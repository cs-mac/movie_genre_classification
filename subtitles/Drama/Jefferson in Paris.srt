1
00:02:58,207 --> 00:02:59,401
Mrs Jefferson.

2
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:02,524
I'm Owen Lettinger
from the Pike County Republican.

3
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:03,642
Come in, sir.

4
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:05,445
Mrs Hemings.

5
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,006
I'll do some water for tea.

6
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,682
My wife, Mary Hemings,
former Mary McCoy.

7
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:16,043
We never took the name Jefferson, sir.
We's all Hemingses.

8
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,917
I trust you had no trouble
finding our place.

9
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,157
We are a bit out of the way.

10
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:27,560
Yes. Well, we journalists
will always find our destination

11
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:30,719
if there's a good story at the end of it.

12
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:32,206
Sit, please.

13
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:33,879
Well, thank you.

14
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,765
It's like this, sir.

15
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,726
When my father died,
he was what they calls bankrupt.

16
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,798
Your father being...

17
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:51,401
President Thomas Jefferson.

18
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:53,364
Yes, sir.
That is true and correct.

19
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,837
He was the third president
of the United States.

20
00:03:56,927 --> 00:04:01,284
- You write mighty fast, sir.
- We call this shorthand.

21
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,436
See?

22
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,524
Mary don't read or write nothing.

23
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:09,839
I learned it my own self. Got the
white children to learn me, in secret.

24
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,246
Mr Lettinger,

25
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:14,205
has anybody ever told you
it was against the law

26
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,926
to learn a Negro how to read
and write during slavery?

27
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,918
They did tell about some owners.

28
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:23,239
They cut off a finger every time
they catch a slave trying to get learned.

29
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:27,206
They was afraid of the Negro reading
and getting to know too much,

30
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,118
getting ideas in his head.

31
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:32,802
Mary, take my key
and bring them things out.

32
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:42,843
There was four of us
living at Monticello.

33
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:46,397
The children of Thomas Jefferson
and Sally Hemings.

34
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:50,162
There were three of us boys:
Beverly, Eston and myself, Madison,

35
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,602
and one sister, Harriet.

36
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:02,162
Did Mr Jefferson have children with any
other slave woman besides your mother?

37
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:06,479
No. Only our mother.
We was the only ones.

38
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,116
Did Mr Jefferson ever
show you any partiality

39
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,243
or fatherly affection?

40
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:17,802
He didn't favour us like he did
his white children and grandchildren,

41
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,161
but we was well-treated.

42
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:22,319
We didn't have to do any
of the field work or hard labour.

43
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,558
My sister Harriet was put
to weaving and spinning and such

44
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:28,002
in the little factory
on the home plantation.

45
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,920
And I was put
to the carpenter trade.

46
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:34,726
My brother Eston and me
was more of the African blood.

47
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:38,117
But my brother Beverly,
you couldn't hardly tell him from white.

48
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:42,405
He so took after my father that
they tell a story of a French gentleman

49
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:46,685
dining with Mr Jefferson, and seeing
Beverly, he did give a mighty jump

50
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:49,839
to see the spitting image
of Thomas Jefferson serving his soup.

51
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,722
They were given
by my father to my mother.

52
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:02,605
And when she dies,
she give 'em to me.

53
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,716
So these are your sole and only...

54
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,286
- May I?
- Sure.

55
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:14,800
Sole and only legacy from...
Thomas Jefferson?

56
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,115
No, sir.

57
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:19,438
Our legacy was our freedom,
long before emancipation.

58
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:23,838
By the age of 21,
we could pick up and leave.

59
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,883
Wasn't slaves no more.

60
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,197
This was written
in the will of our father

61
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,326
in his solemn promise to our mother:
"All our children will be free.

62
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:34,398
"I will set them free."

63
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:36,523
And so it was done.

64
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:41,556
It was mighty sweet to be free, sir.
They used to sing a song.

65
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,079
<i>Free at last</i>
<i>Free at last</i>

66
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:49,477
<i>Thank God Almighty</i>
<i>I's free at last</i>

67
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:53,799
<i>Once was a ruler</i>
<i>just like you</i>

68
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:57,038
<i>Thank God Almighty</i>
<i>I's free at last</i>

69
00:06:57,127 --> 00:07:00,915
Lord, Lord, Lord!
Them days was the days!

70
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:06,279
<i>Thank God Almighty</i>
<i>I's free at last</i>

71
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:09,962
<i>Journey passed</i>
<i>And I get prayed</i>

72
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:44,956
Thomas Jefferson.

73
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,119
Minister Plenipotentiary of America.

74
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:05,639
In the name of
the United States of America,

75
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:09,197
I have the great honour
of paying homage to Your Majesty...

76
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:13,245
as well as to all members
of the royal family.

77
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,317
It is in obedience to
the expressed commands

78
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:26,682
of the Congress
of the United States of America

79
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:30,043
that I have the honour
of assuring Your Majesty...

80
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:40,126
of their unanimous
disposition and desire

81
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:44,758
to cultivate the most friendly and liberal
intercourse between Your Majesty's...

82
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,883
subjects and their citizens.

83
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:02,323
Another great nation, sire,
is rising in America.

84
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:06,923
Have you found a good house?

85
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,357
I thank Your Majesty for your kind concern.

86
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:16,999
I have agreed to the Hôtel de Langeac,
by the Grille de Chaillot.

87
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:20,238
It's very important to have
a decent house in Paris.

88
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,682
Look over these figures again.
We'll go over them in the car.

89
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,678
All right. All right.

90
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,839
I want a bull's-eye opening.

91
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,479
Better get used
to getting hit over the head.

92
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,797
Master can't live
but he's pulling something down,

93
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,640
building something up,
pulling that down again.

94
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:11,716
A step!

95
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,046
Come see!

96
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:05,719
A new girl.

97
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:09,766
She's odd-looking, but pretty.
She must come from abroad.

98
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:13,560
Good day, Mr Jefferson.
Mademoiselle...

99
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:17,560
Please follow me.
I'll take you to Mother Superior.

100
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,521
Your father will see you
before he leaves.

101
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:30,916
A fine tall girl.

102
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,845
She has inherited
your height, monsieur.

103
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:38,397
Yes, and that's no trifle
for a girl to inherit.

104
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:50,204
I'm relieved that your English is so greatly
superior to my French, Madame Abbesse,

105
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,755
because what I wish to say

106
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:56,635
is not altogether
easy to express in any language.

107
00:11:56,727 --> 00:12:00,766
Perhaps I may even venture
to express it for you, monsieur.

108
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:05,966
We have 55 girls

109
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,720
studying in the convent.

110
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:12,163
Of these, 15 are not Catholic

111
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:17,480
but, like your daughter,
of various Protestant persuasions.

112
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:22,516
These girls are completely free
to pursue their own religious faith,

113
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:27,442
and no attempt is ever made
to convert them to ours.

114
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,119
I assure you.

115
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:33,883
They emerge quite as good Protestants
as when they entered.

116
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:38,643
You will forgive my perhaps
somewhat exaggerated anxiety.

117
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,838
For an American,

118
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,364
freedom of religious conscience
is one of our great principles.

119
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,037
I believe, monsieur,

120
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:55,679
you have to fulfil the part of both
father and mother to your daughter?

121
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,997
My wife died three years ago.

122
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,438
Well, Patsy,

123
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:05,525
this is not any kind of parting.

124
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:10,078
James will be coming to fetch you
home on Saturday afternoon...

125
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,442
and every Saturday after that.

126
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:16,205
If only Polly
and Lucy were with me.

127
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:20,121
One day soon, both your sisters
will join us here,

128
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,767
and our little family
will be reunited.

129
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,917
I promise you.

130
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:28,886
You know that I live
only for that day.

131
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,720
And I live only for Saturday.

132
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:33,957
There's something in my eye.

133
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:17,642
Just the right amount of nutmeg.
The sauce is well-seasoned.

134
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:20,878
It could be reduced more
for finicky palates...

135
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,719
Get the glasses!

136
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,038
This dish could be served at
the best French tables!

137
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,877
Come have a drink with us
at the tavern tonight.

138
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,961
People here get paid for working.

139
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,198
- Ask the Master for wages!
- You should be paid like us.

140
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,676
Put more wood on.

141
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,805
- Master?
- You see how this works, James?

142
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,277
As the wheel turns, the distance
is recorded on this metre.

143
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,956
- Master?
- What is it, James?

144
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:09,596
I was wanting to say...

145
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,884
This should be most helpful
in recording accurate boundaries,

146
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,286
within certain limits.

147
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:17,439
- I was wanting to say...
- Wanting to say what?

148
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:20,166
I like finished sentences.

149
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:23,478
Yes, Master, and what it is
I was wanting to finish <i>is...</i>

150
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:27,678
I wants to get paid.

151
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,397
Master, I wants money.

152
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:37,117
In our present circumstances,
your request is not unreasonable.

153
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:40,199
I shall tell Monsieur Petit
that on the first of each month,

154
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,724
you are to receive 24 francs
by the way of salary.

155
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:48,038
You realise that this arrangement
holds good only in Paris,

156
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:51,722
and in Monticello,
we shall revert to our own system.

157
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,116
Yes, Master.
Thank you.

158
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:57,085
- I sure enough realise 24 francs...
- Understand, James?

159
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,759
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

160
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,361
You mock our poor Queen.

161
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:24,846
Indeed!

162
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:29,955
Out of misguided modesty, she avoids
drawn-out, scandalous affairs...

163
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,436
By saying "yes" at once!

164
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:37,647
What would you do if your husband were
sluggish and impotent to boot?

165
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:44,125
Leaving aside the tapir,
we still have among us the moose.

166
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,357
The moose.
The American moose.

167
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,803
Stands so tall that a reindeer
can walk with ease under its belly.

168
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,807
I'd like to see that!

169
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:59,162
And so you shall, Monsieur De Bouffant.

170
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,922
I have the pleasure
of introducing you to our moose.

171
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,116
Adrienne!

172
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:15,359
What an adventure! My dear, we're lucky
to be here. They lit an enormous bonfire

173
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:17,756
and they're throwing on everything
they can lay their hands on.

174
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,681
I was certain they were going to drag us
out of our coach and throw us on top, too.

175
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,725
I told them I was quite prepared
to sacrifice Maria, of course.

176
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:28,004
I said, "Take her. She's much
more inflammable than I am."

177
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:30,965
- Mr Cosway!
- You are. You know you are.

178
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,323
Let me introduce you to Mr Thomas
Jefferson and his daughter, Patsy.

179
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:37,797
Mrs and Mr Richard Cosway,
one of the greatest English painters.

180
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,082
What am I saying?
The greatest English painter.

181
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,362
<i>Vous exagérez,</i> my dear Lafayette.

182
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:47,037
I said to the coachman,
"Who is this they're burning?"

183
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,881
"The biggest rascal on earth," he said.
"And burning's too good for him."

184
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,765
Allons. Is that his name?
Minister of Finance.

185
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:57,396
I should not like to fall
into the hands of your Paris mob.

186
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:01,196
People of Paris need only one little
spark and, boom, they explode.

187
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:07,040
The tables are laid and waiting.
Sit wherever you like.

188
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:11,086
We can't eat now!
We want to perform first.

189
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:14,398
- Come, friends!
- We've rehearsed for hours.

190
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,320
You'll be even more entertaining
after dinner.

191
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:23,920
<i>Au revoir,</i> my dear.

192
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:33,518
I will join you afterwards, my dear.

193
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,404
Mr Trumbull, Patsy.

194
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,079
Mr Jefferson.

195
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:52,243
Your secretary appears
to admire the duchess.

196
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:54,318
We should be happy for her.

197
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:56,967
She is married to her uncle,
who is 40 years older than she.

198
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:07,642
Is your daughter here to learn
French manners and morals?

199
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,240
Manners, to some extent,

200
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,524
but when it comes to morals,
we should keep to our own.

201
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,598
Why? Are yours better than ours?

202
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:16,598
They are better for us.

203
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,484
That is, for us Americans.

204
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,842
And are they difficult to learn?

205
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:24,397
Certainly not difficult to unlearn.

206
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,278
Tell me about America.

207
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,916
Madam, the subject is as large
as the land itself.

208
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:56,523
England is so small.
Even the sky is small.

209
00:20:56,607 --> 00:21:00,077
In Italy it is a vast, cerulean blue.

210
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:03,955
It's not so much sky as... heaven.

211
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,366
You are Italian?

212
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:09,439
Mr Jefferson! Mr Jefferson.

213
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:13,042
Is it true what my young
friends are telling me?

214
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:17,962
That the revolt of our American colonies
was really against trade restrictions.

215
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:22,996
All you wanted, you Americans,
was the liberty to drink French wine!

216
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:31,404
Instead of English beer, one might say
that exchange alone was worth our trouble.

217
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:37,960
"We hold these truths to be self-evident:
That all men are created equal;

218
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:42,245
"that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights."

219
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:47,241
Are all men created equal,
Mr Jefferson?

220
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:56,406
Or should this read,
"All white men are created equal?"

221
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:06,805
We allowed for civil differences
that are not caused by the laws of man

222
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,481
but by those of nature.

223
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:13,560
And though the Negro
may or may not be inferior,

224
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:16,878
his status in no way alters
the wrongness of slavery.

225
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,446
It is evil.

226
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:24,480
Yet your first draft contained a clause
on the abolition of slavery.

227
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,205
I considered it essential,

228
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:29,802
but Congress struck it out of the final
Declaration as being too particular.

229
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,839
So the question remains open
with you and unsolved.

230
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:43,124
Your revolution, Mr Jefferson,
appears to be incomplete.

231
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:47,237
Why did you omit the notion of property
as one of those rights?

232
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:51,479
While I hold the right of the individual
to possess property as basic,

233
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:56,163
I consider it as
a means to human happiness

234
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:58,556
but not as an end in itself.

235
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:03,877
It is Madame Cosway.

236
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:31,277
It is only Monsieur D'Hancarville,
declaring that he loves me.

237
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:34,677
He thinks I don't take him seriously,
but how can I?

238
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:38,396
A man of society has to be in love,
preferably with a married woman.

239
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:42,480
And Monsieur D'Hancarville
has done me the honour of choosing me.

240
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,720
Do go, my dear,
and see if we are wanted.

241
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:49,116
Please. Do go.

242
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,042
Come on, everybody!
Time to play!

243
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,561
Are you always cruel
to those who love you?

244
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:02,923
It's just a game we both play.

245
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:07,478
That's how it is here.
People play at love. It's not serious.

246
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:11,560
It is different in Italy.
There, we kill for it.

247
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:14,764
Well! That was going too far.

248
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,122
Why? How far do you go in America?

249
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:20,199
In America.
In America, we stay at home

250
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,847
and are happy and contented
with the wives we have chosen.

251
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:25,600
If you can choose.

252
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:28,121
And are you happy and contented?

253
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:31,275
Forgive me.

254
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:35,360
I have been told that your wife died
in giving birth to your son.

255
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,165
My daughter, Lucy.

256
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:39,556
And the child?

257
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:41,285
The child survived.

258
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:44,086
- So you have two daughters.
- I have three daughters alive.

259
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,920
We lost our first child
when she was 18 months old.

260
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:51,876
- Do you have no son?
- He did not survive beyond 17 days.

261
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,645
The perfect place for it. Come on!

262
00:25:57,727 --> 00:26:00,116
Quickly. Let's play this game.

263
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,766
"Heads and Hearts."

264
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:05,441
Now, let's divide up.

265
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:09,566
Hearts should be on this side.
That's right. So you stay there, Mr Short.

266
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:10,966
Heads on this side.

267
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,639
Monsieur D'Hancarville...

268
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:17,403
Mr Jefferson, I think you belong
over there with the heads.

269
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:20,559
And that's right, Maria.

270
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,241
Definitely with the hearts.

271
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:28,077
I know, to my cost,
that she has no heart.

272
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,681
And I, to mine, that she has no head.

273
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,759
You would know, too, if you had
to pay her bills, as I do.

274
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:38,601
So, I shall start.
For the head.

275
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:43,681
Friendship is but another word for
an alliance with the misfortunes of others.

276
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:48,318
Our own share of miseries is sufficient.
Why take on those of another?

277
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:59,399
When sorrow makes us weep, how sweet it
is to have a friend to wipe away our tears.

278
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:02,843
With such a comfort,
our very grief may turn to joy.

279
00:27:02,927 --> 00:27:06,237
Come, come, Mr Short. Take a man's part
and speak up for the head.

280
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:09,603
Well, sir, when my heart speaks,
the rest of me must needs be silent!

281
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:11,245
What rubbish!

282
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:17,320
Nothing is in our power except
intellectual pleasure.

283
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:22,401
In contemplating truth and nature,
matter and emotion,

284
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:28,483
we ride, serene and sublime,
above the concerns of the mortal world.

285
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:33,726
Listen to me!
All the frigid speculations of the head

286
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:37,402
are not worth
one generous spasm of the heart.

287
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:42,926
The best way of being secure against pain
is to retire within ourselves

288
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,884
and to suffice for our own happiness.

289
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:47,003
Nobody cares for him
who cares for nobody.

290
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:49,043
A wise man will only depend on himself.

291
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,199
It's not your turn, madam,
nor is it your turn, sir.

292
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,999
I believe it's the heads' turn.

293
00:27:58,087 --> 00:27:59,839
It's the heads' turn.

294
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:02,316
He's lost his head,
and she's lost her heart.

295
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:08,720
Yes, you, Mrs Cosway,
must speak only from your tender heart.

296
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:10,035
Now answer me.

297
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:14,518
Is it not in the company of a friend
that Nature wears her liveliest hue?

298
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:17,963
- Whence did she borrow it?
- From her charming companion.

299
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,925
Speak only from your head,
Mr Jefferson.

300
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:24,600
Our heart is pleased
because she is pleased.

301
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:29,598
No one is pleased at all.

302
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,440
You've ruined the game
and lost everything.

303
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:53,007
This place makes me shudder.

304
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,805
Ill-formed...

305
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,717
overloaded monstrosities.

306
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:05,523
When I was 17, I wanted
to take my vows, as a nun.

307
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:10,036
I see you are amused.

308
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:15,724
It is only because you are the opposite
of everything gloomy and ascetic.

309
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:19,800
To me you appear all clarity and light.

310
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:23,277
Of this world, not the next.

311
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:30,559
It's true. I was born in the sun
and I can't live without it.

312
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:34,526
But when my father died, we had
to leave Florence and go to London.

313
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,679
We were poor, but I had
a little talent for painting

314
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:40,918
and ambition to become an artist.

315
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:43,567
But, instead...

316
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,558
You were married.

317
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:51,317
Mr Cosway encourages me to paint,
but not to exhibit my work.

318
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:11,005
I tell you freely
about myself and my life,

319
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:15,046
but about yourself you keep
everything hidden and closed.

320
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:27,562
When my wife died,

321
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:32,721
I destroyed every letter
that had ever passed between us.

322
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:38,564
I wanted no one to find
the least trace of our happiness.

323
00:30:38,647 --> 00:30:42,162
It was hers and mine.

324
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:45,319
And then, only mine...

325
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:47,716
to be shared with no one.

326
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,763
Mrs Jefferson, please sit still.

327
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:09,040
Enough now. It looks fine as it is.

328
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:12,005
I've been sitting here for hours.

329
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,236
This is unbearable!

330
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:47,605
I see Signor Leonardo's been with you.

331
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,280
Let me look.

332
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:57,677
I would be proud, Mr Jefferson,
to have such a pretty daughter.

333
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:01,642
Mrs Cosway plays well.

334
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:20,957
<i>On Sunday last,</i>
<i>I went as a private citizen,</i>

335
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:24,596
<i>and accompanied by my daughter,</i>
<i>to the Palace of Versailles.</i>

336
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:30,162
<i>We joined the crowd admitted,</i>
<i>according to some ancient custom,</i>

337
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,045
<i>to view the king and queen</i>
<i>on their way to Mass.</i>

338
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:37,564
<i>I meant to impress upon my daughter</i>
<i>the vainglory of these spectacles.</i>

339
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:40,081
<i>May we Americans never emulate them</i>

340
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:45,287
<i>nor burden our taxpayers</i>
<i>with such useless splendours.</i>

341
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,882
<i>The royal procession showed</i>
<i>an unexpected informality</i>

342
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,958
<i>and animation of spirits.</i>

343
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:53,880
<i>It is said that this is due</i>
<i>to Marie Antoinette,</i>

344
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:57,642
<i>who tries to make such occasions</i>
<i>agreeable to her husband,</i>

345
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,002
<i>who is often awkward</i>
<i>and unsociable.</i>

346
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:05,556
No other American ambassador gave us
the pleasure of meeting his family.

347
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,605
You should have come earlier.
What is your name?

348
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,642
Martha Jefferson.

349
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:12,716
Madam.

350
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:22,805
There is nothing to fear. She was only
asking your name, and quite charmingly.

351
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:27,085
<i>Daily life at court is still ruled</i>
<i>by an etiquette so rigid</i>

352
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:30,079
<i>that the most private pursuits</i>
<i>of the king and queen</i>

353
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,522
<i>are converted into public ceremony.</i>

354
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:37,601
<i>It is like watching actors, fantastically</i>
<i>painted, bewigged and bejewelled,</i>

355
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:41,123
<i>disporting themselves on a stage.</i>

356
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:44,597
<i>The leading actress, though never</i>
<i>a popular one, is the queen,</i>

357
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:48,919
<i>whose extravagance is blamed for the</i>
<i>desperate financial situation of France.</i>

358
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:54,286
<i>But the king loves her very much,</i>
<i>and she rules him completely.</i>

359
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:59,487
<i>As a foreigner, an Austrian, she feels</i>
<i>lonely and isolated at the French court</i>

360
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:03,799
<i>and has surrounded herself</i>
<i>with her own little band of friends.</i>

361
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,959
<i>They love to play at being</i>
<i>simple shepherdesses,</i>

362
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:11,359
<i>a game that is said to cost the</i>
<i>exchequer one million livre a year.</i>

363
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:16,441
<i>But the friendship of the shepherdesses</i>
<i>is based on their ferocious greed.</i>

364
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:20,759
<i>The queen's favourites take advantage</i>
<i>of her lonely craving for affection,</i>

365
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:23,202
<i>threatening to leave her</i>
<i>whenever she fails</i>

366
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:26,757
<i>to accede</i>
<i>to their insatiable demands.</i>

367
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,804
<i>The French royal family</i>
<i>are the butt of salacious skits</i>

368
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:43,402
<i>and slanders unimaginable</i>
<i>in any other Christian kingdom.</i>

369
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:48,117
<i>The queen is depicted with the appetites</i>
<i>of a Messalina or a Sappho</i>

370
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:50,801
<i>or engaged in incestuous monstrosities</i>

371
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:54,402
<i>with Count d'Artois,</i>
<i>the king's debauched brother.</i>

372
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:10,443
"The Surrender at Yorktown."

373
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,836
Well done, Trumbull.
It's very life-like.

374
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:17,523
And that is you, sir, here, on the left
of my little sketch, and hard to see.

375
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,201
I assure you, in the finished painting,
no one will ask,

376
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,084
"Where is General Lafayette?"

377
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:25,239
And here is Lord Cornwallis, surrendering.

378
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:27,443
No, a mistake, sir.
It was not Cornwallis.

379
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:31,122
My lord feigned sickness to escape
sharing his men's humiliation.

380
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:32,845
Then I'm very sorry.

381
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:36,556
Must've been misinformed in London,
probably on purpose.

382
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:41,243
You really rubbed their noses in it,
playing Yankee Doodle!

383
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:44,877
<i>Yankee Doodle went to town</i>
<i>Riding on a pony</i>

384
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:49,119
I was shaking like a leaf with the malaria
I caught in your confounded swamps.

385
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,323
And this is Monsieur...

386
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:57,521
Is that you, Viomesnil?
I didn't recognise you with two legs on!

387
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:00,277
Inform Mr. Jefferson.

388
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,642
We're asking no more than our due.

389
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,685
The eye I've given them
deserves a pension.

390
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:10,876
My dear friend...
My dearest friend and comrade,

391
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,958
we are all here comrades,

392
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,164
and so perhaps it is not
too greatly indelicate to mention

393
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:18,158
what weighs on these gentlemen.

394
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:20,283
Although a considerable amount is due

395
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:22,676
for their services
rendered in the American war,

396
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:26,885
the States have not yet paid
their debts to them.

397
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,844
Promises must be kept.

398
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:31,077
I'd never have thought
we'd have to beg.

399
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,486
Not even the interest.

400
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,121
Sir, we put our lives in danger.

401
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:37,846
We sacrificed arms and legs...

402
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:40,760
We offered them willingly
for your cause.

403
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:48,357
Many of these gallant officers
have lost limbs...

404
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:55,199
or have been disabled
in other ways...

405
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:00,556
fighting for our cause.

406
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:08,284
Yet all requests for monies
justly due to them

407
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,358
have been ignored.

408
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:17,403
The fact is, Mr Short, there is no money.
Our congress is insolvent.

409
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,842
I know your own salary
hasn't been paid yet.

410
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:24,842
I haven't been reimbursed for the outlay
I've made on my domestic establishment.

411
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:26,679
That is a personal matter.

412
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:31,158
But all this financial business
presses on my mind like a mountain.

413
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:34,165
<i>This is to inform the Congress</i>

414
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:37,876
<i>that our crushing debts compel me</i>
<i>forthwith to journey to The Hague.</i>

415
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:41,243
<i>I intend to appeal to some</i>
<i>private Dutch bankers</i>

416
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:44,205
<i>who are justly famous</i>
<i>for their financial wizardry.</i>

417
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:46,596
<i>These shrewd money men</i>
<i>have devised a loan</i>

418
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,121
<i>to cover our interest</i>
<i>on another loan;</i>

419
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:51,767
<i>a bit ofjuggling to restore our credit</i>

420
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:55,283
<i>and honour our debt</i>
<i>to those gallant French officers.</i>

421
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:00,442
- Mr Short.
- Mrs Cosway.

422
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:14,518
- It was unexpected and most urgent.
- Evidently.

423
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:17,321
He was promised for the fête on Friday.

424
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:22,797
I trust we will have the honour
of your presence, Mr Short.

425
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:25,276
You keep faith with your friends, I hope.

426
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:30,043
Alas, madam, I leave for Rome tomorrow,
also on urgent business.

427
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:37,278
I've heard that you Americans
are always on urgent business.

428
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:45,758
<i>Your friends miss you,</i>
<i>and none more than myself,</i>

429
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:50,637
<i>and Mr Cosway, who, however, has much</i>
<i>to fill his time with in this place.</i>

430
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:53,116
<i>I pass my more solitary hours</i>

431
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:56,643
<i>in great hopes of a continuance</i>
<i>of our happy days together.</i>

432
00:38:56,727 --> 00:39:00,356
<i>I imagine I see you,</i>
<i>smiling down at me once more.</i>

433
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:04,564
Absence from a friend grown dear...

434
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,603
is harder than I have imagined.

435
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:11,564
My dear Mrs Cosway.

436
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:14,366
Nor had I imagined how dear this friend...

437
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:17,757
My dear Miss...
My very dear missed friend...

438
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:20,839
My dear friend...
How close you are...

439
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:24,078
My dear, dear friend...

440
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:28,240
<i>Absence from a friend grown dear</i>
<i>is harder than I imagined.</i>

441
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:39,406
<i>I observe the hog of this land,</i>
<i>of which the celebrated ham is made,</i>

442
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,843
<i>is tall, gaunt</i>
<i>and with heavy-lopped ears.</i>

443
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:47,162
<i>People here pride themselves</i>
<i>on their unique smokehouses</i>

444
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:48,726
<i>that have no chimney,</i>

445
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:51,879
<i>but I had the pleasure of</i>
<i>informing them that in Virginia,</i>

446
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:55,039
<i>we use the same method</i>
<i>of smoking our bacon.</i>

447
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:46,366
When they rise,
it's called The Resurrection,

448
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:49,041
after having been dead to the world.

449
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:56,517
- But why are you crying?
- It's with joy.

450
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:45,756
Patsy.

451
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:48,846
Wait, dear.

452
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:53,198
I wanted to see you.

453
00:41:54,287 --> 00:41:57,279
And I hoped you
might want to see me.

454
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,520
You must miss your father
so very much in his absence.

455
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,758
- He'll be back soon.
- When? Have you had word?

456
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:15,440
I had hoped to know you better and even,
if you will let me, to be your friend.

457
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:17,165
Thank you, madam.

458
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:24,598
See, I know how it is to be
a foreigner in a foreign country.

459
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:28,282
I was born in that condition,
for in Italy, I'm English,

460
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:31,200
and in England, I'm Italian.

461
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:33,357
But I'm American everywhere.

462
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:36,564
Yes. There you are like your father.

463
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:39,445
Wherever he is, he is what he is.

464
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:46,918
There is another reason why I feel
such a sympathy for you and your family.

465
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:49,805
Because you have suffered tragedy
in the loss of your mother

466
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:52,401
and so many little brothers and sisters.

467
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:56,919
My childhood was also made tragic
for my poor parents

468
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:01,603
and in the most horrible
and unnatural way.

469
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:05,077
May I tell you?
May I tell you my story?

470
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,116
I had three little sisters
and a brother,

471
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,675
all of whom died very suddenly.

472
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:16,839
And only I and one little brother were left.

473
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:26,365
One day, someone overheard
my Italian nurse singing to me,

474
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:29,883
"I have sent four to heaven before you,

475
00:43:29,967 --> 00:43:34,199
"and now I will send you, too,
and save your eternal soul."

476
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:40,166
It was she who had poisoned
the little babies

477
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:43,319
for what, in her madness,
she thought was their salvation.

478
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:51,044
Imagine the state of mind
and heart of my poor parents.

479
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:57,565
You will understand better than anyone

480
00:43:57,647 --> 00:44:00,764
that I have to stay with Papa always.

481
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:04,838
That he needs me.

482
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:11,481
He will never marry again. That is what
he vowed to my mama on her deathbed.

483
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:38,005
Look. Look who it is.

484
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:47,156
We are so glad
to see you, Mr Jefferson.

485
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:51,035
We're enchanted to see you.
We thought you'd completely forgotten us.

486
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:53,846
I arrived from my travels
only one hour ago.

487
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:55,565
Come up. Come on.

488
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:04,484
- What a dwarf!
- Is it draughty up there?

489
00:45:09,087 --> 00:45:13,842
You're so attached to the opera that you
would not waste a moment to come here.

490
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:17,283
Rather, so attached to my friends
whom I hoped to find here.

491
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:18,800
You have found us.

492
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:23,324
It is by no means certain that my wife
is any longer your friend.

493
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,841
See how angry your neglect
has made her.

494
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:26,996
Why would I be angry?

495
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:30,318
Alas, my duties were official,
or I would've returned weeks ago.

496
00:45:30,407 --> 00:45:32,602
Women will never believe any business

497
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:36,202
could take precedence
over our business with them.

498
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:38,278
Mr Jefferson, take your bow.

499
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:01,002
Mademoiselle Contat.

500
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:04,882
Such large hats are forbidden
in the theatre now.

501
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:08,277
Throw me in the Bastille then,
with the thieves,

502
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:11,564
the forgers, and the child molesters.

503
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:15,322
Meanwhile, come join us
as we yawn through the ballets.

504
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:24,598
Well, Mr Jefferson,

505
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:28,316
I shall leave you to make
your peace as best you can.

506
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:32,161
Come, Monsieur D'Hancarville.
Be at least as tactful as her husband.

507
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:30,605
I came back as soon as I could.
I was restless for Paris.

508
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:33,076
I can't imagine you restless

509
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:37,126
or even thinking of anyone or anything
except... what do you call it?

510
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:38,879
"The business at hand."

511
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:42,118
I thought of you constantly.
I wrote you constantly.

512
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:46,120
Yes, about smoked bacon and hogs.

513
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,956
What an extraordinary person you are.

514
00:47:51,047 --> 00:47:54,596
I hoped to interest you
in what interested me.

515
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:58,646
I missed you.
I missed you immensely.

516
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:23,125
I kept having a debate
between my head and my heart.

517
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:26,244
Which, in your case,
the head always wins.

518
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:27,726
Not this time.

519
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:31,243
My poor head was simply whirled
around by my unruly heart.

520
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:33,636
Oh, dear God.

521
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:37,117
It kept telling me, "I love the lady,

522
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:40,005
"and will continue to love her forever.

523
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:48,395
"If she were on one side of the globe
and I on the other,

524
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:51,684
"I would pierce through the whole mass
of the world to reach her."

525
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:56,161
Dardanus!

526
00:48:56,247 --> 00:48:59,045
Dardanus! Bring Dardanus to me!

527
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:02,642
I want to kiss him!
I want to go up to Heaven with him!

528
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:06,276
- Get him a new wig!
- And new legs, too!

529
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,559
They seemed to have
survived the ordeal.

530
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:19,799
Don't you wish it were possible
to fly off to America?

531
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:23,800
Yes, if I could take you with me.
It is not impossible.

532
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:27,596
- We are not on the other side of the globe.
- What are you saying?

533
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:29,723
I'm saying come to America.

534
00:51:31,287 --> 00:51:33,562
Come to Monticello.

535
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:35,205
And leave everything?

536
00:51:35,287 --> 00:51:37,676
Leave everything here?
Leave my husband?

537
00:51:41,607 --> 00:51:44,405
I've thought of it sometimes.

538
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:48,162
Mr Cosway and I have even spoken of it.

539
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:51,683
We are good friends,
although he does not...

540
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:55,555
He cannot love me the way
a man loves a woman.

541
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:58,558
You must've guessed that.

542
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,686
What I guessed, from the beginning,
was that you needed me,

543
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,758
as I need you.

544
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:20,126
Within a year or two, my government
will recall me from my assignment here,

545
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:22,437
and I shall go home for good.

546
00:52:22,527 --> 00:52:25,087
Which is what you want
more than anything in the world.

547
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:28,637
I can't deny that all my wishes end

548
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:32,037
where I hope my days will end,
at Monticello.

549
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,958
But to leave you...

550
00:52:36,447 --> 00:52:39,245
to leave you behind...

551
00:52:39,327 --> 00:52:41,522
with all the ocean between us...

552
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:47,081
and no hope of ever seeing you again...

553
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:03,445
But even if I had no vows to break,

554
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:06,599
what about yours?

555
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,884
Your vow to your wife?

556
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:12,561
You and I are alive...

557
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:15,036
and the earth belongs to us,

558
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:16,924
to the living.

559
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:21,678
Would you dare?

560
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,758
Would you?

561
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:26,361
Yes. Yes.

562
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:30,998
For you.
For you, I would dare anything.

563
00:53:31,087 --> 00:53:32,566
I would fly in the balloon.

564
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:36,959
No. It might carry you
too far away from me.

565
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:41,677
- Then I would ford a flood.
- No. That's too dangerous.

566
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:43,997
Then I would leap over these logs.

567
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:46,996
Thomas!

568
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:49,240
Mr Jefferson!

569
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,716
Mr Jefferson!

570
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:54,560
What have you done?

571
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,640
He's going the wrong way
for Mr Jefferson's house.

572
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,683
I told him to drive straight to the ball.

573
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:34,726
It is fashionable to be late to a certain
degree, but beyond that it's uncouth.

574
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:38,083
Not to visit a sick friend
for fear of being late for a ball.

575
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:41,159
Not a ball, madam.
It is the ball.

576
00:54:41,247 --> 00:54:42,646
Everyone will be there.

577
00:54:42,727 --> 00:54:45,639
<i>Le tout Paris,</i>
except, of course, Mr Jefferson.

578
00:54:45,727 --> 00:54:49,515
Poor Mr Jefferson. We must send him
some calves' foot jelly

579
00:54:49,607 --> 00:54:53,486
or whatever one sends to invalids
who have hurt their wrist.

580
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:56,639
Forgive me, madam.
I forgot to tell you.

581
00:54:56,727 --> 00:55:01,562
I have secured passage
for the packet on Thursday.

582
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:03,956
I have, thank heaven,
finished recording...

583
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:09,566
the entire Orleans family for posterity.

584
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:11,205
We are now free to go home.

585
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:15,121
Dear, dull London.
I've grown weary of Paris, have not you?

586
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:21,680
There are many amusements, it's true,
but some of them are of the wrong kind.

587
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:25,758
<i>I write with pain and must be short.</i>

588
00:55:25,847 --> 00:55:30,443
<i>Failing a private messenger,</i>
<i>I'll send this letter whatever way I can.</i>

589
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:34,998
<i>I fear it may be opened at the post office,</i>
<i>and my words, meant only for you,</i>

590
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:38,045
<i>read by spies and strangers.</i>

591
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:47,559
<i>When you come next, I shall</i>
<i>never let you part from me again.</i>

592
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:51,356
<i>But are you coming to Paris?</i>
<i>I dread the answer may be no</i>

593
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:55,725
<i>and that all this time my fond heart</i>
<i>has been deceiving me.</i>

594
00:56:08,287 --> 00:56:10,403
Look into my eyes.

595
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:17,199
A power now pervades you.

596
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:21,202
My wand... and my fingertips...

597
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:23,755
will do the rest.

598
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:41,039
Nature touches upon the Divine.

599
00:56:42,087 --> 00:56:43,281
The Divine flows...

600
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:50,762
I have made myself a medium
between this force and you. Receive...

601
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,966
Receive from my eyes...

602
00:56:56,687 --> 00:57:00,316
this heavenly current
which lessens pain...

603
00:57:00,407 --> 00:57:03,479
and assuages souls tormented
by every maladie.

604
00:57:06,247 --> 00:57:07,999
I tingle all over.

605
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:13,724
I am reborn. My body is purified.

606
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:17,595
I'm overwhelmed.
My senses are abandoning me.

607
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:23,883
My body throbs.

608
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:31,165
Will you excuse me?

609
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,080
Calm down, dear friend.
You must give it a chance.

610
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:37,443
Sir, this is just trash and tricks
for the weak mind.

611
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:40,118
The method is completely scientific.

612
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,767
I have been cured of ailments
through animal magnetism.

613
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:18,880
<i>The high price of bread in France</i>
<i>is an old grievance.</i>

614
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:21,845
<i>But now the many deprivations,</i>
<i>coming all together,</i>

615
00:58:21,927 --> 00:58:26,205
<i>whether these be bread or fuel</i>
<i>and warm clothes for the dreadful winter,</i>

616
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:28,926
<i>are judged by the populace</i>
<i>to be insupportable.</i>

617
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:32,841
Once the French people get started,
they then go to it with gloves on.

618
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:38,760
<i>Their wrath has found an object</i>
<i>in the person of the queen,</i>

619
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:41,236
<i>who devotes herself to her amusements,</i>

620
00:58:41,327 --> 00:58:45,684
<i>indulging in every current</i>
<i>fancy and delusion.</i>

621
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:50,602
<i>She welcomes fashionable charlatans,</i>
<i>like the dangerous Dr Mesmer,</i>

622
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:54,885
<i>and allows them intimacies, such as</i>
<i>freedom to touch the royal person,</i>

623
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:59,040
<i>that not so long ago would have</i>
<i>condemned them to the rack.</i>

624
00:58:59,647 --> 00:59:02,320
It's very amusing.

625
00:59:02,407 --> 00:59:06,446
Please do sit down. You'll see.

626
00:59:08,287 --> 00:59:11,802
<i>While outside the people</i>
<i>starve and freeze to death,</i>

627
00:59:11,887 --> 00:59:15,118
<i>the queen and her ladies</i>
<i>are cozy in warm chambers</i>

628
00:59:15,207 --> 00:59:17,767
<i>scented by blooms</i>
<i>from the royal hothouse</i>

629
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:20,202
<i>and dressed as if it</i>
<i>were a different season</i>

630
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:24,121
<i>or as if they lived in a different climate</i>
<i>from the rest of France.</i>

631
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:29,156
<i>Is it any wonder that Marie Antoinette</i>
<i>is hated by the people?</i>

632
00:59:29,247 --> 00:59:31,807
What a perfect patient.

633
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:37,997
The doors to healing are now open.

634
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:41,557
Here you are, Monsieur.
Don't be shy. Come to Mother.

635
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:43,877
Go on, Dr Mesmer.

636
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:47,357
Watch this.
It's a fascinating scientific experiment.

637
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:50,883
Look at the Duchess.
Isn't she funny?

638
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:53,483
How was your trip?

639
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:56,923
<i>Yet their sentiments have not changed</i>
<i>toward the little dauphin,</i>

640
00:59:57,007 --> 01:00:00,124
<i>who is still loved,</i>
<i>as is the king himself,</i>

641
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,916
<i>despite the iniquities</i>
<i>he has come to represent.</i>

642
01:00:04,007 --> 01:00:08,205
<i>The Marquis de Lafayette</i>
<i>and other liberal aristocrats</i>

643
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:10,755
<i>are eager to break down</i>
<i>the monstrous privilege</i>

644
01:00:10,847 --> 01:00:14,920
<i>both of their own quarter and of the clergy.</i>

645
01:00:16,527 --> 01:00:21,078
<i>They propose to revive a long dormant</i>
<i>assembly called the States General,</i>

646
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:24,796
<i>which has not convened since 1614.</i>

647
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,880
<i>In this, the common people</i>
<i>will have their own elected deputies</i>

648
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:31,197
<i>to be called the Third Estate.</i>

649
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:33,676
<i>But the king, who has the most to lose,</i>

650
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:38,204
<i>says, "What does it matter if I give up</i>
<i>some of my own authority?</i>

651
01:00:38,287 --> 01:00:41,324
<i>"As long as my people are happy."</i>

652
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,357
<i>London is so melancholy.</i>

653
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:49,644
<i>There is something in this air</i>
<i>which always makes me sad.</i>

654
01:00:49,727 --> 01:00:53,402
<i>How I long for blue skies</i>
<i>and for church bells</i>

655
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:55,796
<i>and for your presence.</i>

656
01:00:55,887 --> 01:00:59,357
<i>What am I without seeing</i>
<i>or hearing from you?</i>

657
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,041
<i>Write to me. Write to me!</i>

658
01:01:02,127 --> 01:01:04,118
<i>I live only in your letters</i>

659
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:08,803
<i>and in memories of</i> ourjours heureux,
<i>our happy days together.</i>

660
01:01:30,927 --> 01:01:34,317
<i>It is impossible to paint</i>
<i>the anguish of my heart.</i>

661
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:37,479
<i>Confined a week to her bed</i>
<i>with the whooping cough,</i>

662
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:41,446
<i>your dear angel Lucy was thrown</i>
<i>into convulsions and then expired.</i>

663
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:46,237
<i>She retained her senses perfectly,</i>
<i>called me a few moments before she died</i>

664
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,841
<i>and asked distinctly for water.</i>

665
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:09,686
You shall always, always,
above everyone, be first in my life.

666
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:13,043
I vow to you now as you vowed to Mama.

667
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:20,643
No one shall ever come between us.

668
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:25,242
I shall write to your Aunt Elizabeth
that Polly must come to France

669
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:28,842
on the next available ship
before winter sets in.

670
01:02:28,927 --> 01:02:31,316
Her nurse may accompany her.

671
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:38,280
I will be her nurse
and her mother and her sister

672
01:02:38,367 --> 01:02:42,121
and her everything
and your everything, dearest Papa.

673
01:02:46,207 --> 01:02:48,198
Your poor wrist.

674
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:57,958
The surgeon has made
a bad thing of setting it.

675
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:03,280
I may have to carry it as a reminder
of foolishness the rest of my life.

676
01:03:09,487 --> 01:03:11,443
Polly dearest!

677
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:13,802
<i>You may imagine, my dear Mrs Epps,</i>

678
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:16,765
<i>how greatly we desire</i>
<i>to have Polly with us</i>

679
01:03:16,847 --> 01:03:19,725
<i>and never to be parted from her again.</i>

680
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:23,402
<i>The voyage and the change of domicile</i>
<i>would be greatly eased for her</i>

681
01:03:23,487 --> 01:03:28,038
<i>by the company of any one servant</i>
<i>to whom she is particularly attached.</i>

682
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:29,879
I's goin' with ya'.

683
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:34,916
We two, we'll be laughing
and joking each other all the way.

684
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:37,919
We's gonna ride on a big old ship.

685
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:41,124
We'll be rockin' on the water.

686
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:44,516
Ain't that gay, Polly? Huh?

687
01:03:44,607 --> 01:03:46,643
Ain't that gay?

688
01:03:56,287 --> 01:03:59,006
My grandmother, Betty Hemings,

689
01:03:59,087 --> 01:04:02,716
was the daughter of a full-blooded
African slave woman

690
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:06,163
and an English sea captain
named Hemings.

691
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:09,364
She was the property of Mr John Wayles.

692
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:12,883
Mr Jefferson, having married
Mr Wayles's daughter,

693
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:16,437
my grandmother and all of her kin
came to live at Monticello.

694
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:22,685
That is... Thomas Jefferson
inherited your family

695
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,327
from his wife's father, John Wayles.

696
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:26,522
Yes, sir.

697
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:30,361
Mr Wayles was the father
of Mrs Thomas Jefferson.

698
01:04:30,447 --> 01:04:34,201
He was also the father of my mother,
Sally Hemings,

699
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,323
and her brother, James Hemings,

700
01:04:36,407 --> 01:04:39,365
and four other offspring
that he had with my grandmother,

701
01:04:39,447 --> 01:04:41,165
who he took as concubine.

702
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,319
So Mrs Thomas Jefferson...

703
01:04:44,407 --> 01:04:47,956
and Sally Hemings...

704
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:50,038
were half-sisters.

705
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:55,724
Ain't no use in askin' who is sister with who
and who the father and who the brother.

706
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:59,117
They don't speak of it now
and they didn't speak of it then.

707
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:03,325
No matter whose blood flows in your veins,

708
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:06,240
you're either master or you're slave.

709
01:05:06,327 --> 01:05:10,479
You're white or you're black
and no in between.

710
01:05:19,567 --> 01:05:21,478
Here she is!

711
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:23,239
Polly!

712
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:26,562
Hello, Sally. What is it?

713
01:05:26,647 --> 01:05:30,037
- Have you forgotten your own sister?
- Sally, Polly, we've missed you.

714
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:32,595
- You've let her be away from us too long.
- Help me up with her.

715
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:35,281
- Your wrist.
- It'll be all right. Yes!

716
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:37,562
We missed you.

717
01:05:38,407 --> 01:05:39,317
Sally.

718
01:05:39,407 --> 01:05:42,717
Welcome to France,
Mademoiselle Jefferson,

719
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:45,241
to the land of liberty and equality,
or soon it will be.

720
01:05:45,327 --> 01:05:48,922
- Polly, come on inside. Come with Papa.
- It's all right.

721
01:05:49,007 --> 01:05:50,725
Sally!

722
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:55,563
So Granny's gone?

723
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,596
She was sick a while.

724
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:03,724
You see her there layin' in bed.

725
01:06:03,807 --> 01:06:07,243
And she couldn't take nothin' to eat.

726
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:12,196
Little Isaac, he tried givin' her
a piece of his crust.

727
01:06:12,287 --> 01:06:15,006
But she said,

728
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:18,602
"Granny don't want bread no more."

729
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:22,157
They done buried her
over by Weaver's cottage.

730
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:24,124
Sit down, Mademoiselle.

731
01:06:24,207 --> 01:06:26,482
He said sit.

732
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:31,277
This is my sister.

733
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:36,477
- Get to work!
- Let's celebrate Sally's arrival.

734
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:39,400
Welcome.
You have a beautiful sister.

735
01:06:45,927 --> 01:06:48,760
It is still very swollen.

736
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:52,522
This will take longer to heal
than you thought.

737
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:57,484
You wants a poultice on that, Master,
with hot ashes and mustard.

738
01:06:57,567 --> 01:07:01,082
My old nurse at Tucker Hall
had all kinds of roots and herbs

739
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:04,921
for the mumps and the whooping cough
and every sort of ache and pain.

740
01:07:05,007 --> 01:07:08,761
And no medicine ever suited me
as well or tasted better.

741
01:07:14,647 --> 01:07:16,956
I have some letters for you, sir.

742
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:22,438
Letters from a lady.

743
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:24,916
- And how is the lady?
- She sends her regards.

744
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:26,599
Thank you.

745
01:07:46,447 --> 01:07:48,756
My French harpsichord is easier.

746
01:07:49,727 --> 01:07:54,357
<i>Did you receive my last two letters?</i>
<i>What does this silence mean?</i>

747
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:56,915
<i>Inconstant friend.</i>

748
01:07:57,007 --> 01:08:00,158
<i>I live in misery waiting</i>
<i>for a letter from you.</i>

749
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:02,841
<i>Unable to bear this anxiety,</i>

750
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:07,284
<i>I have taken a passage for Calais</i>
<i>on Thursday next.</i>

751
01:08:11,447 --> 01:08:14,041
<i>I am in a million fears about you.</i>

752
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:16,641
<i>I long to be with you.</i>

753
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:13,082
- Polly. Polly.
- Lucy, Lucy.

754
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,043
What if little Lucy wasn't dead

755
01:09:19,127 --> 01:09:24,326
but was sitting up in her coffin,
in the cold, wet ground?

756
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:27,046
- Patsy.
- Hush.

757
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:31,923
You hush.

758
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:37,362
Our little Lucy is an angel now
in heaven with Mama.

759
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:46,837
Where have you been?

760
01:09:46,927 --> 01:09:49,282
This is for Master's poor hand.

761
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:53,717
When Miss Polly is home
from the convent,

762
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:56,321
you are to sleep with her, I told you.

763
01:10:04,007 --> 01:10:05,565
Go on.

764
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,879
Papa.

765
01:10:19,727 --> 01:10:24,960
Try some of this.
It might do you some good.

766
01:10:25,047 --> 01:10:27,277
Did Sally make it?

767
01:10:30,407 --> 01:10:32,159
Well, I'll try anything.

768
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:44,678
<i>Walk like ladies</i>

769
01:10:45,687 --> 01:10:50,681
<i>The cake's all done</i>

770
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:54,601
<i>You needn't mind the weather</i>

771
01:10:56,047 --> 01:11:01,121
<i>If the wind don't blow</i>

772
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:20,678
While it is true that under French law
slavery is considered illegal,

773
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:24,237
I don't think that American citizens
need to be too concerned.

774
01:11:24,327 --> 01:11:28,843
My advice to you would be to keep
your boy here and say nothing about him.

775
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:31,316
- Where you from?
- Byrd's Nest, Gooseland County.

776
01:11:31,407 --> 01:11:32,726
Mr James Byrd is my master.

777
01:11:32,807 --> 01:11:35,446
Would you be knowin' Susie Melton
what was cook there one time?

778
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:39,520
- Married Israel Jefferson?
- She be my mother's own sister.

779
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:41,120
Lordy!

780
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:44,005
Ain't it a small world to turn around in?

781
01:11:44,087 --> 01:11:46,317
What sort of place would that be,
Byrd's Nest?

782
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:48,318
We's getting on most fine.

783
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:51,160
Plenty to eat, new clothes
for the summer and winter.

784
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:55,035
Saturday night, Master don't care
how much we dance and carry on,

785
01:11:55,127 --> 01:11:56,719
so long we don't do it on Sunday.

786
01:11:56,807 --> 01:11:59,560
Some fares good.
Some fares common.

787
01:11:59,647 --> 01:12:01,638
- He fare pretty good.
- Yes, sir.

788
01:12:01,727 --> 01:12:05,197
Master so fond of me
I's like his own child almost.

789
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,243
Company comin'.

790
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:09,522
- What's your name?
- Horatius. Horatius Byrd.

791
01:12:09,607 --> 01:12:11,598
My own master's name.

792
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:18,839
- Afternoon, Miss Cosway.
- James.

793
01:12:34,007 --> 01:12:35,998
What a pretty girl that was.

794
01:12:36,087 --> 01:12:39,079
That's Sally. She my baby sister.

795
01:12:45,727 --> 01:12:49,515
James. She come to see old Master?

796
01:12:49,607 --> 01:12:52,485
That Miss Cosway. She go away.

797
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:54,364
Now she back.

798
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:03,838
If slavery is illegal in France,
the boy could claim he was free

799
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:06,600
and refuse to go back home with us.

800
01:13:11,007 --> 01:13:15,000
Master, Miss Cosway is waiting for you
in the music room.

801
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:17,885
Inform the lady I'll be with her presently.

802
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:23,915
Strictly speaking, the answer
to your question is yes.

803
01:13:24,007 --> 01:13:26,805
But I don't think your boy would
know enough to claim that right.

804
01:13:26,887 --> 01:13:31,438
Didn't you yourself, Mr Jefferson, bring
over two of your servants from Virginia?

805
01:13:31,527 --> 01:13:34,837
A male and a female, I believe.

806
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:59,166
You see, I've come back.

807
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:03,479
Although with very little encouragement.
Why did you not write?

808
01:14:03,567 --> 01:14:05,797
I had always to wait
for a suitable messenger.

809
01:14:05,887 --> 01:14:08,720
How could I run the risk
of exposing my tender sentiments

810
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:13,278
- to officials of the post office?
- Excuses, vain excuses.

811
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:16,325
Mr Trumbull could have brought letters,
but you entrusted none even to him.

812
01:14:16,407 --> 01:14:22,198
- Did you have nothing then to say to me?
- I had too much to say.

813
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:26,246
And have you come back only
to load me with reproaches?

814
01:14:34,447 --> 01:14:36,961
- And how is your poor wrist?
- It is better.

815
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:40,676
No thanks to the French surgeons, but I've
been trying out some American witchcraft.

816
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:45,397
I hope it works so that soon you can
play your violin for me again.

817
01:14:45,487 --> 01:14:49,560
Our beautiful duets, our happy day.
<i>Ourjours heureux.</i>

818
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,518
I'm alone here.

819
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:26,405
Mr Cosway's in London.

820
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:28,955
He wished me to...

821
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:31,515
to find my own way.

822
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,757
Did you lose it?

823
01:15:33,847 --> 01:15:35,599
Yes.

824
01:15:35,687 --> 01:15:38,599
From the moment I saw you,
I found it again.

825
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:57,965
Trust me. I know what girls like
better than you.

826
01:15:58,047 --> 01:16:00,607
- But American girls?
- American girls?

827
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:04,236
How pray are your American girls
so different to the rest of the world?

828
01:16:04,327 --> 01:16:05,919
Their expectations are different.

829
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:07,918
You mean they expect
to make corn puddings

830
01:16:08,007 --> 01:16:11,044
and knit woollen stockings
for their lord and master?

831
01:16:11,127 --> 01:16:13,595
I could think of worse occupations
for a woman.

832
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:15,120
What a tyrant you'd be.

833
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:19,120
- The turquoise.
- Farther down.

834
01:16:27,927 --> 01:16:30,964
Are you sure?
I'm afraid it won't suit Patsy.

835
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:33,481
- It's not for Patsy.
- Polly would like it even less.

836
01:16:33,567 --> 01:16:36,035
It's for a servant girl
who needs to be outfitted.

837
01:16:36,127 --> 01:16:39,676
The little Negro nurse.
She's very pretty.

838
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:41,883
How old is she?

839
01:16:41,967 --> 01:16:44,720
I'm not sure. I inherited her.

840
01:16:44,807 --> 01:16:47,082
- You inherited her?
- Yes.

841
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:51,205
Yes. As a responsibility.

842
01:16:51,287 --> 01:16:55,963
We are responsible for these people
as members of our most intimate family.

843
01:16:56,047 --> 01:16:57,719
They're...

844
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:02,518
It's impossible to explain to a foreigner.

845
01:17:02,607 --> 01:17:04,962
Even an American not born
in our southern states

846
01:17:05,047 --> 01:17:08,642
is unable to understand the special
relationship we have with our Negroes.

847
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:12,595
Ten metres.

848
01:17:12,687 --> 01:17:16,236
No, eight will be enough.
It's a simple dress.

849
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:30,319
It's only an effigy. They are burning
an effigy of Brienne, the Finance Minister.

850
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:32,716
The last time we were in Paris,
they were burning another one.

851
01:17:32,807 --> 01:17:36,038
Monsieur de Calonne.
He is now an exile in England.

852
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:50,682
The people are making their voice heard.

853
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:53,918
There's nothing to fear
in the triumph of the people.

854
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:57,920
Not even you are safe any more.
Come away!

855
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,682
All they want is their liberty,
their right to freedom.

856
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:05,680
I've seen such horrible sights
in the streets.

857
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:09,282
It makes me fear that men are not good,
not kind by nature but cruel.

858
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:12,006
No. No.

859
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:15,363
They've been warped
by generations of tyranny,

860
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:17,438
but they are naturally good.

861
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,518
If I were not sure of that,

862
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:23,202
sure of the goodness
inherent in the natural man,

863
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:26,085
I would no longer want to be alive.

864
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:30,439
Loosen up here a bit.
You'll look more graceful.

865
01:18:30,527 --> 01:18:34,440
Let me show you
what I've planned for the ribbons.

866
01:18:34,527 --> 01:18:37,121
I told you I don't want any trimmings.

867
01:18:37,207 --> 01:18:38,322
Sally!

868
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,284
Sally!

869
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:47,365
Have you gone deaf?

870
01:18:49,927 --> 01:18:55,001
- Where did you get that?
- Master done give me the cloth to sew.

871
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:58,796
I been calling and calling you.
Come along.

872
01:19:09,247 --> 01:19:11,761
He's gotta pay you for that.

873
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,759
You's out of your head, James.

874
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:19,398
Folks get wages for their work.
That's the law of this land.

875
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:21,637
But we's slaves.

876
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:27,439
You's a slave all right, right down
to the bottom of your soul.

877
01:19:27,527 --> 01:19:31,679
I'd sooner be a slave
to ol' Master than that ol' liquor.

878
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,600
You mind yourself or you'll end up
just like Bob Tuffle.

879
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,804
Think on that and what happened to he
on account of the way he was drinking,

880
01:19:37,887 --> 01:19:39,479
just like you is drinking.

881
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:44,880
"If that nigger don't walk the chalk,
y'all put him on the block and sell him!"

882
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:49,358
But ain't nobody gonna buy a drinkin'
nigger. He ain't no use for work.

883
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:53,766
What's I want with all that money?

884
01:19:53,847 --> 01:19:57,317
I gets me my something to eat.
I gets me my new clothes.

885
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,916
You tell him.

886
01:20:02,007 --> 01:20:06,046
You tell him, right this minute,
20 francs a month for your wages.

887
01:20:06,767 --> 01:20:08,962
You is hurtin' my arm.

888
01:20:12,087 --> 01:20:14,999
I'll hurt you if you
don't tell him right now.

889
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:18,638
I just talkin' to Sally, Master.

890
01:20:18,727 --> 01:20:21,958
You are?
What are you talking about?

891
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,836
Just talkin', Master.

892
01:20:25,927 --> 01:20:31,604
That's a mighty pretty dress, Sally.
Good night, James.

893
01:20:33,767 --> 01:20:35,598
Come in, Sally.

894
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:18,602
You tell him? What you doin'?

895
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:21,326
You better get back in there
and tell him something.

896
01:21:21,407 --> 01:21:23,762
What are you doing there, Sally?

897
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:27,641
What's the matter?

898
01:21:27,727 --> 01:21:30,241
Master, I scared.

899
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:32,238
Of what?

900
01:21:36,607 --> 01:21:38,962
- Ghosts.
- Ghosts?

901
01:21:41,327 --> 01:21:44,046
Have you ever seen one?

902
01:21:44,127 --> 01:21:48,006
Scare me so bad, my hair "ris" up

903
01:21:48,087 --> 01:21:51,159
till I couldn't get my hat back on my head.

904
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:52,839
Well,

905
01:21:52,927 --> 01:21:57,637
you won't see any here because
they're all left behind in Virginia.

906
01:21:57,727 --> 01:22:01,800
- They come with us, Master.
- What, they sailed with you on the ship?

907
01:22:01,887 --> 01:22:04,196
I thought ghosts couldn't cross water.

908
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:09,839
See, they don't need no ship, no water.
They just...

909
01:22:09,927 --> 01:22:11,758
goes on through the air.

910
01:22:11,847 --> 01:22:14,486
Same as smoke.

911
01:22:40,527 --> 01:22:44,805
I done seen Molly.
She drowned herself in the mill pond.

912
01:22:44,887 --> 01:22:47,606
She's here with us?

913
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:50,360
Doesn't that make you feel
nice and at home

914
01:22:50,447 --> 01:22:55,441
to have Molly come all the way to Paris
from the bottom of our old mill pond?

915
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:10,081
You know, when they bring Molly up,

916
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:14,479
there wasn't nothing left to bury,
she was ate up so bad.

917
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:19,038
All her eyes was gone
and half her face.

918
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:21,163
Her legs and all.

919
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:25,399
And there wasn't a morsel of brain
left in her skull.

920
01:23:25,487 --> 01:23:30,800
What was all swarming
with them water bugs.

921
01:23:31,887 --> 01:23:33,445
Good night, Sally.

922
01:23:33,527 --> 01:23:38,920
And thank you for giving me
a pleasant vision to lull me to sleep.

923
01:23:39,007 --> 01:23:40,440
Good night.

924
01:24:16,527 --> 01:24:17,926
Master?

925
01:24:18,007 --> 01:24:20,919
There was this old fly
sittin' on your face.

926
01:24:21,007 --> 01:24:24,363
- Where? I don't see it.
- It's troublin' you.

927
01:24:24,447 --> 01:24:27,007
I just stays here
and fan him right off you.

928
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:54,527
I do beg your pardon, Mr Ambassador.

929
01:24:55,047 --> 01:24:59,996
The King began dozing off five minutes
after the Assembly opened.

930
01:25:00,087 --> 01:25:02,203
How could he have done otherwise?

931
01:25:02,287 --> 01:25:06,485
The Finance Minister's speech
was a perfect sleeping potion!

932
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:10,685
And our poor Queen,
so sad and exasperated.

933
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:13,201
Your immediate task now is practical.

934
01:25:13,287 --> 01:25:16,279
Your three separate orders
of nobles, clergy and commons

935
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:18,597
must be combined into one single vote.

936
01:25:18,687 --> 01:25:23,203
But that is our resolve. We shall vote
not by rank, but with the commons.

937
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:25,562
Sir, I once knew a young man who,

938
01:25:25,647 --> 01:25:29,162
having visited countries
where liberty and equality were the rule,

939
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:33,035
decided to import those commodities
into his own country.

940
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:35,357
Do you know what happened to him?

941
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:40,999
Well, sir, he was hanged.

942
01:25:58,247 --> 01:26:00,124
Don't laugh.

943
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:05,281
My invention is the most humane
form of execution ever conceived.

944
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:24,007
Mr Guillotin, for whom
did you invent your charming machine?

945
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:25,759
Is it only for us?

946
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:30,204
Can commoners also take advantage of
so noble a form of execution?

947
01:26:30,287 --> 01:26:31,481
Certainly!

948
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:35,924
No more wretches swaying from gallows
or pulled apart by horses.

949
01:26:36,007 --> 01:26:39,841
No more rascally hangings, no more
low-life drawings and quarterings.

950
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:42,487
What a terrible shame.

951
01:26:54,407 --> 01:26:57,080
Whatever these learned
French surgeons may say,

952
01:26:57,167 --> 01:27:00,477
our old American remedies
are still the best.

953
01:27:01,887 --> 01:27:05,846
Now, Sally, since the cure
was due to your ministrations,

954
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:09,283
it's only right that the results
should be to your benefit.

955
01:27:09,367 --> 01:27:11,164
Yes, Master?

956
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:17,165
To Sally... Hemings.

957
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:21,286
Wages, 24 francs.

958
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:39,119
You shall receive
the same amount every month.

959
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,441
Of course it's yours
to do with as you please,

960
01:27:44,527 --> 01:27:47,041
but I would advise you
not to give it to James,

961
01:27:47,127 --> 01:27:50,517
or he will be spending it in ways
that won't do him any good.

962
01:27:50,607 --> 01:27:52,757
He young and wild.

963
01:27:52,847 --> 01:27:55,486
And you're so old and sage?

964
01:27:59,447 --> 01:28:01,756
Would you want me to keep it for you?

965
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:08,520
Sally.

966
01:28:09,927 --> 01:28:13,886
This is your money.
It'll be right here in the corner.

967
01:28:17,487 --> 01:28:20,877
You'll be rich soon, and then what
will you do with all your wealth?

968
01:28:20,967 --> 01:28:23,276
I takes it home to Virginia.

969
01:28:23,367 --> 01:28:27,679
Don't you want to spend it
on pretty things here in Paris?

970
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:32,079
They has no pretty things
like we has in Virginia.

971
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:34,840
Well, what about this?

972
01:28:36,327 --> 01:28:37,999
Yeah.

973
01:28:38,087 --> 01:28:40,760
But I like the bright colours best.

974
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:44,237
Pink I likes, and yellow.

975
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:49,405
Now, I wonder...

976
01:28:49,487 --> 01:28:52,320
what do you think of this?

977
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:54,841
Of course you may not care for it at all,

978
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:57,999
in which case, I might as well
give it away to some other girl.

979
01:28:58,087 --> 01:28:59,918
What is it?

980
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:04,038
You show me. Show me what it is.

981
01:29:07,407 --> 01:29:09,637
It's that one.

982
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:11,638
It's not that one.

983
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:13,763
It's this one.

984
01:29:15,247 --> 01:29:17,522
Is that for me?

985
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:22,476
That's plum pretty.

986
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,319
Sally.

987
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:44,366
Haven't you finished with Patsy yet?
You're so slow, Sally.

988
01:31:44,447 --> 01:31:47,325
What will I say to Soeur Theresa
if we're late again?

989
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:50,444
You tell her that you only got one girl.

990
01:31:50,527 --> 01:31:53,724
And she's so unlucky to be born
with only two hands.

991
01:31:53,807 --> 01:31:57,846
- You make me so cross.
- You make me so cross.

992
01:32:00,127 --> 01:32:03,119
That's to teach you
respect for your mistress.

993
01:32:06,807 --> 01:32:09,560
You go and lay out Polly's things.

994
01:32:25,087 --> 01:32:27,965
"He spread her legs
as widely as possible,

995
01:32:28,047 --> 01:32:31,437
and knelt down to enjoy her charms."

996
01:32:31,807 --> 01:32:33,525
Is that how we excite men?

997
01:32:33,607 --> 01:32:38,283
"Toinette abandoned herself
to her pleasure."

998
01:32:38,367 --> 01:32:42,963
I do think in lovemaking
some perversity is no bad thing.

999
01:32:43,047 --> 01:32:46,403
Listen: "As she undressed..."

1000
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:49,604
Jeffy, are you asleep?

1001
01:32:49,687 --> 01:32:53,475
Mother Superior says
I can write to my parents.

1002
01:32:53,567 --> 01:32:59,119
- Yes, I may enter my novitiate.
- You can take your vows.

1003
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:00,845
Jeffy.

1004
01:33:03,727 --> 01:33:06,116
Now I have only one wish left.

1005
01:33:07,567 --> 01:33:10,400
Jeffy, I pray for it.

1006
01:33:12,327 --> 01:33:14,477
For you.

1007
01:33:14,567 --> 01:33:17,161
That God will allow you
to join the true church.

1008
01:33:25,047 --> 01:33:29,723
<i>The jealousies of rank have brought</i>
<i>the States General to an impasse.</i>

1009
01:33:29,807 --> 01:33:33,561
<i>The older nobles and the clergy</i>
<i>are determined to negate any measures</i>

1010
01:33:33,647 --> 01:33:36,320
<i>that would lose them</i>
<i>the least of their privileges.</i>

1011
01:33:36,407 --> 01:33:39,319
<i>And of course, as usual,</i>
<i>the queen is on their side.</i>

1012
01:33:39,407 --> 01:33:40,965
Your credibility is at stake.

1013
01:33:41,047 --> 01:33:44,244
Your people respect you.
Their representatives will listen.

1014
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:48,036
The members of the Third Estate
are waiting for your answer.

1015
01:33:48,127 --> 01:33:50,721
Tell them they're on the wrong track.

1016
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:54,162
The King!

1017
01:33:54,247 --> 01:33:58,286
<i>The order of the commons,</i>
<i>the Third Estate, are equally determined,</i>

1018
01:33:58,367 --> 01:34:02,121
<i>so that there is a deadlock</i>
<i>which only the king can resolve.</i>

1019
01:34:02,207 --> 01:34:04,004
Gentlemen:

1020
01:34:05,367 --> 01:34:08,723
We have listened to your requests

1021
01:34:08,807 --> 01:34:11,958
with all the interest they deserve.

1022
01:34:12,047 --> 01:34:14,959
But we feel obliged to inform you

1023
01:34:15,047 --> 01:34:20,724
that the State
is ruled by secular laws.

1024
01:34:20,807 --> 01:34:25,881
The King cannot allow them
to be changed...

1025
01:34:25,967 --> 01:34:29,039
or even discussed.

1026
01:34:41,287 --> 01:34:42,686
Citizens!

1027
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:45,884
There's not a minute to lose!
I've come from Versailles.

1028
01:34:45,967 --> 01:34:49,676
Our Finance Minister
has been dismissed.

1029
01:34:49,927 --> 01:34:54,364
This will be a St Bartholomew's Day
massacre for patriots.

1030
01:34:54,447 --> 01:34:59,316
We must choose coloured cockades
so we know our allies!

1031
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:05,279
- What colour do you want?
- You choose!

1032
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:08,165
Green, the colour of hope? Or blue...

1033
01:35:08,847 --> 01:35:14,001
Blue, the colour of American
freedom and democracy?

1034
01:35:14,087 --> 01:35:16,362
Green! Green!

1035
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:21,599
Comrades, the word is out!

1036
01:35:21,687 --> 01:35:25,077
Police spies and informers
watch my every move!

1037
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:28,159
But they won't get me,
at least not alive!

1038
01:35:29,087 --> 01:35:32,523
Citizens, follow me! To arms!

1039
01:35:40,927 --> 01:35:45,125
<i>The spirit of liberty is cantering</i>
<i>from one end of France to the other</i>

1041
01:35:47,647 --> 01:35:49,683
<i>There are some incidents of violence,</i>

1042
01:35:49,767 --> 01:35:52,645
<i>mainly due to the continued</i>
<i>shortage of bread,</i>

<i>Yet, I will agree to be stoned</i>

1046
01:37:24,967 --> 01:37:29,119
- Is it a revolt?
- No, sire. A revolution.

<i>Reason dispels falsehood</i>

<i>Error flees, fanaticism is overcome</i>

1053
01:38:29,927 --> 01:38:33,397
<i>Our gospel is Nature</i>

1054
01:38:33,487 --> 01:38:39,642
<i>And we are of the cult of Virtue</i>

1055
01:38:39,727 --> 01:38:43,276
<i>And we are of the cult of Virtue</i>

1056
01:38:54,927 --> 01:38:59,637
I fear it is what in England
you would call rather silly,

1057
01:38:59,727 --> 01:39:01,922
but for us it's a beautiful new thought,

1058
01:39:02,007 --> 01:39:08,003
that the flower of the poor potato is
more valuable than our finest jewellery.

1059
01:39:08,087 --> 01:39:10,043
Thank you, Adrienne.

1060
01:39:33,847 --> 01:39:37,237
Perhaps you don't understand
the deep affinity

1061
01:39:37,327 --> 01:39:39,841
between us and the people.

1062
01:39:39,927 --> 01:39:43,203
We are all of us commoners now,

1063
01:39:43,287 --> 01:39:45,323
and they are all noble.

1064
01:39:45,407 --> 01:39:50,117
Some of the faces I have seen
in the streets of Paris do not look noble.

1065
01:39:50,207 --> 01:39:54,439
What I don't understand is
what you're all waiting for.

1066
01:39:54,527 --> 01:39:59,282
Why don't you go, get out?
Run for your lives.

1067
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:04,315
It is not easy to leave everything behind,

1068
01:40:04,407 --> 01:40:06,716
go to a strange country.

1069
01:40:06,807 --> 01:40:10,277
An <i>émigré,</i> a refugee.

1070
01:40:11,127 --> 01:40:14,358
Without money or connection or friends.

1071
01:40:15,887 --> 01:40:19,243
So one persuades oneself

1072
01:40:19,327 --> 01:40:22,125
that everything will turn out well.

1073
01:40:23,647 --> 01:40:28,402
<i>On Tuesday last, a crowd of women,</i>
<i>in a direct approach to the king and queen</i>

1074
01:40:28,487 --> 01:40:31,843
<i>to help them feed their children,</i>
<i>marched to Versailles</i>

1075
01:40:31,927 --> 01:40:35,840
<i>and forced the royal family</i>
<i>to return with them to Paris.</i>

1076
01:40:35,927 --> 01:40:39,681
<i>The Marquis de Lafayette,</i>
<i>as commander of the new National Guard,</i>

1077
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:42,486
<i>had the duty of escort.</i>

1078
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:45,081
<i>The people hope that the presence</i>
<i>of the king in their midst</i>

1079
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:48,284
<i>will help relieve</i>
<i>their desperate situation.</i>

1080
01:40:48,367 --> 01:40:50,597
<i>Waving loaves in the air on spikes,</i>

1081
01:40:50,687 --> 01:40:53,679
<i>they jest that surely now</i>
<i>they will have bread</i>

1082
01:40:53,767 --> 01:40:56,998
<i>when they have brought</i>
<i>the baker himself, that is the king,</i>

1083
01:40:57,087 --> 01:41:00,079
<i>and the baker's wife,</i>
<i>and his little apprentice.</i>

1084
01:41:11,927 --> 01:41:14,885
I came to give you this.

1085
01:41:14,967 --> 01:41:19,438
A memento of my small art
and its great subject.

1086
01:41:21,487 --> 01:41:24,081
Papa has always taught us

1087
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:28,445
that in matters of religion everyone must
be free to follow their own conscience.

1088
01:41:28,527 --> 01:41:30,597
So you've not told him yet.

1089
01:41:32,447 --> 01:41:35,166
I shall have to soon.

1090
01:41:35,247 --> 01:41:37,556
I am so happy for you.

1091
01:41:39,407 --> 01:41:45,926
When I was your age,
I too desired so ardently to take my vows.

1092
01:41:46,007 --> 01:41:48,726
But it was not to be.

1093
01:41:48,807 --> 01:41:52,004
You will be more fortunate than I.

1094
01:41:52,087 --> 01:41:55,875
But what will you do
when he returns to America?

1095
01:41:55,967 --> 01:41:59,562
I shall stay here in the convent
and take my vows.

1096
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:03,117
And not see your beautiful Monticello?

1097
01:42:03,207 --> 01:42:05,402
- No.
- Patsy.

1098
01:42:05,487 --> 01:42:07,523
I don't ever want to go back to Monticello.

1099
01:42:07,607 --> 01:42:11,520
Dear Patsy, it's your sweet home
and your father's most cherished place.

1100
01:42:11,607 --> 01:42:12,926
You don't know.

1101
01:42:13,007 --> 01:42:14,884
What?

1102
01:42:14,967 --> 01:42:18,642
- What is it, my dear child?
- You don't know how we live in Monticello.

1103
01:42:18,727 --> 01:42:21,366
It is a paradise on Earth.

1104
01:42:21,447 --> 01:42:24,757
Your father has told me so much, so much.

1105
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:28,601
And he has made me love the place, and...

1106
01:42:28,687 --> 01:42:31,645
made me long to go there, too.

1107
01:42:32,807 --> 01:42:35,844
And has he told you about
our Negroes and how they live?

1108
01:42:35,927 --> 01:42:38,395
I'm sure he's very good to them.

1109
01:42:40,047 --> 01:42:43,881
He's the best master in all of Virginia.

1110
01:42:43,967 --> 01:42:48,404
But he is the master,
and they're the servants.

1111
01:42:48,487 --> 01:42:50,682
Slaves.

1112
01:42:50,767 --> 01:42:53,725
And I'm certain that they hate us.
I know they do. I can see it,

1113
01:42:53,807 --> 01:42:57,038
in their faces, even when they smile
and say, "Yes, Master."

1114
01:42:57,127 --> 01:42:59,880
And they're always there,
watching everything we do

1115
01:42:59,967 --> 01:43:03,516
and listening to everything we say
and hating us.

1116
01:43:03,607 --> 01:43:05,598
And I hate them.

1117
01:43:06,767 --> 01:43:08,997
Yet I pity them
for the misery of their lives,

1118
01:43:09,087 --> 01:43:13,126
and I wish from the bottom of my heart
that all the Negroes could be free forever.

1119
01:43:13,207 --> 01:43:16,563
They of us and we of them.

1120
01:43:18,327 --> 01:43:23,447
Your father has explained to me how it is
in the nature of a family relationship.

1121
01:43:24,647 --> 01:43:30,836
And I've seen how kind he is. For instance,
to the little Negro nurse, Sally.

1122
01:43:30,927 --> 01:43:33,885
He has bought her pretty clothes,
just as he has for you.

1123
01:43:39,527 --> 01:43:41,916
Can't you speak to me?

1124
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:43,884
Please. Tell me.

1125
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:47,357
No, Mrs Cosway, don't ask me.
Don't force me.

1126
01:43:47,447 --> 01:43:49,438
Who would force you?

1127
01:43:49,527 --> 01:43:54,123
Only to relieve your heart
by speaking to a friend.

1128
01:43:56,367 --> 01:43:59,040
I can't speak, Mrs Cosway.

1129
01:43:59,127 --> 01:44:02,881
I can't... speak, because...

1130
01:44:03,767 --> 01:44:05,564
Because?

1131
01:44:05,647 --> 01:44:07,877
Because...

1132
01:44:07,967 --> 01:44:09,844
it's unspeakable.

1133
01:44:28,647 --> 01:44:31,525
I can't possibly guess.

1134
01:44:31,607 --> 01:44:33,723
It's late, Master.

1135
01:45:05,367 --> 01:45:08,120
Master's expecting you in the garden.

1136
01:45:29,887 --> 01:45:32,845
What are you doing here?

1137
01:45:32,927 --> 01:45:34,963
You scared me out of my skin.

1138
01:45:35,047 --> 01:45:37,436
I was pickin' corn for dinner.

1139
01:45:37,527 --> 01:45:39,995
Old Master, he's so proud of his corn.

1140
01:45:40,087 --> 01:45:42,885
But I see his Frenchie guests,
they can't abide it.

1141
01:45:42,967 --> 01:45:45,162
They don't even know how to eat it
like it should be ate.

1142
01:45:45,247 --> 01:45:47,807
Why, how do you eat it?

1143
01:45:47,887 --> 01:45:50,082
You roasts it, then you eats it on the cob.

1144
01:45:50,167 --> 01:45:53,318
And it's the sweetest stuff
you ever eat in your life.

1145
01:45:53,407 --> 01:45:57,320
'Cept for couscous. And ash cake.

1146
01:46:08,167 --> 01:46:11,239
Since you are never to be found,
I have boldly come to you.

1147
01:46:11,327 --> 01:46:13,602
But it is you who are never to be found,

1148
01:46:13,687 --> 01:46:18,920
except among a crowd of friends
and admirers who hide you from view.

1149
01:46:19,007 --> 01:46:20,486
At least my view.

1150
01:46:23,687 --> 01:46:26,155
I've planted an American garden.

1151
01:46:26,247 --> 01:46:30,843
I had seeds sent from Virginia, but
only our hominy corn has prospered.

1152
01:46:30,927 --> 01:46:33,043
Everything else has been a dismal failure.

1153
01:46:33,127 --> 01:46:38,042
Our watermelons, cantaloupes,
sweet potatoes.

1154
01:46:38,127 --> 01:46:40,561
You see, it hasn't rooted.

1155
01:46:40,647 --> 01:46:43,798
If only I could give you a taste
of our marvellous sweet potatoes.

1156
01:46:43,887 --> 01:46:46,196
You sound homesick, Mr Jefferson.

1157
01:46:46,287 --> 01:46:49,245
It is hard to leave.
I shall miss my friends

1158
01:46:49,327 --> 01:46:51,682
and so much else.

1159
01:46:51,767 --> 01:46:54,565
Who would not want to be in France
at such a glorious time?

1160
01:46:54,647 --> 01:46:57,605
Yes. The glorious revolution.

1161
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:08,718
Sally Hemings!

1162
01:47:08,807 --> 01:47:11,879
I, too, shall have to return soon.

1163
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:16,404
I've overstayed both my leave from London
and my welcome in Paris.

1164
01:47:16,487 --> 01:47:20,002
- Your welcome from whom?
- From you, sir.

1165
01:47:20,087 --> 01:47:23,966
My affections have not altered.
There has been no change

1166
01:47:24,047 --> 01:47:28,882
in the friendship that has been
between us from the first moment.

1167
01:47:28,967 --> 01:47:30,958
You are becoming the perfect diplomat.

1168
01:47:31,047 --> 01:47:35,643
Courteous and amiable always
and always on your guard.

1169
01:47:35,727 --> 01:47:40,198
Well, I confess I fear unguarded moments.

1170
01:47:41,047 --> 01:47:43,607
As when you fell and hurt your wrist?

1171
01:47:45,527 --> 01:47:49,440
I do feel most horribly responsible for that,

1172
01:47:49,527 --> 01:47:51,995
as though it were I
who led you into recklessness.

1173
01:47:52,087 --> 01:47:53,520
No, no.

1174
01:47:53,607 --> 01:47:56,804
It was my own middle-aged vanity
that made me attempt

1175
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:59,082
what only a youth can do.

1176
01:47:59,167 --> 01:48:00,441
Master?

1177
01:48:00,527 --> 01:48:05,647
Hot corn. You must try our corn.

1178
01:48:05,727 --> 01:48:08,525
Pick it up and eat it with your hands.

1179
01:48:11,887 --> 01:48:14,924
It's like with all your Frenchie guests
when we cook it for 'em.

1180
01:48:15,007 --> 01:48:16,440
They love our corn!

1181
01:48:16,527 --> 01:48:20,600
They loves it when you're looking at 'em,
but when you ain't they just spits it out.

1182
01:48:20,687 --> 01:48:24,362
- Nonsense, Sally. That's nonsense.
- I seen it with my own eyes.

1183
01:48:25,327 --> 01:48:26,840
They just spit.

1184
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:30,958
Excuse me.

1185
01:48:44,887 --> 01:48:45,876
What's wrong?

1186
01:48:45,967 --> 01:48:48,845
You told me yourself
I could never hope to understand.

1187
01:48:48,927 --> 01:48:53,205
If I have erred in some way,
if I have offended you,

1188
01:48:53,287 --> 01:48:56,802
I beg you to be as frank with me
as I've always tried to be with you.

1189
01:48:56,887 --> 01:48:58,559
On all subjects?

1190
01:48:58,647 --> 01:49:02,686
Or are there some that are
best left unexplained?

1191
01:49:02,767 --> 01:49:05,804
Let me call on you tomorrow.

1192
01:49:05,887 --> 01:49:07,400
I've so missed you.

1193
01:49:07,487 --> 01:49:11,526
Let us resume <i>ourjours heureux,</i>
our happy days together.

1194
01:49:14,847 --> 01:49:16,997
I wish we could.

1195
01:49:34,127 --> 01:49:38,643
- Is someone leaving?
- Yes, sir. Madame Cosway.

1196
01:49:39,687 --> 01:49:42,884
I wish you both success and joy.

1197
01:49:42,967 --> 01:49:46,198
May God protect you
and keep you from harm.

1198
01:49:46,287 --> 01:49:48,721
And without a word
for those who love you?

1199
01:49:48,807 --> 01:49:51,844
Not even our American friend?

1200
01:49:55,007 --> 01:49:57,123
My dear Mrs Cosway,
this is all very hard on me.

1201
01:49:57,207 --> 01:50:00,165
How will I justify myself when
he reproaches me for your absence?

1202
01:50:00,247 --> 01:50:01,600
He will be heartbroken.

1203
01:50:01,687 --> 01:50:04,679
I don't think we need fear
for Mr Jefferson's heart.

1204
01:50:04,767 --> 01:50:09,397
But he has one, believe me.
A great and tender heart.

1205
01:50:09,487 --> 01:50:11,637
He wears it under a suit of armour.

1206
01:50:11,727 --> 01:50:16,039
Then he is safe, for it will never
break or hurt him very much.

1207
01:50:17,127 --> 01:50:19,357
- We have failed you.
- No, not you.

1208
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:23,042
You have been kindness
and hospitality itself.

1209
01:50:23,127 --> 01:50:28,406
In France, we boast how fertile
is our soil for love and lovers.

1210
01:50:28,487 --> 01:50:33,481
But if the soil is American, then nothing
will grow but corn and what is it?

1211
01:50:33,567 --> 01:50:35,797
Sweet potatoes.

1212
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:39,679
Come in.

1213
01:50:55,767 --> 01:50:57,883
You sad, Master?

1214
01:50:59,727 --> 01:51:01,365
You cryin'?

1215
01:51:04,407 --> 01:51:07,524
You want me to sing for you?

1216
01:51:07,607 --> 01:51:09,962
I could sing you something sad,

1217
01:51:10,047 --> 01:51:12,197
something merry.

1218
01:51:14,207 --> 01:51:17,165
Let it be sad then, Sally,

1219
01:51:17,247 --> 01:51:19,715
since that's my mood.

1220
01:51:47,687 --> 01:51:49,245
I can't bear it.

1221
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:52,478
It'll make me sink
into my grave for sadness.

1222
01:52:05,087 --> 01:52:08,159
You want me to show you
how to cut the pigeon wing?

1223
01:52:08,247 --> 01:52:09,885
How to what?

1224
01:52:12,487 --> 01:52:14,637
We calls it cuttin' the pigeon wings

1225
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:18,686
'cause you hold your neck up
real stiff just like a pigeon do,

1226
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:23,716
and you're there flappin'
your arms and your legs.

1227
01:52:23,807 --> 01:52:25,877
I'll show you.

1228
01:52:32,927 --> 01:52:35,236
But first a couple has to set the floor.

1229
01:52:35,327 --> 01:52:38,876
They comes up, bends over
to each other at the waist,

1230
01:52:38,967 --> 01:52:41,800
and the woman she puts
her hands on her hips

1231
01:52:41,887 --> 01:52:46,199
and the man rolls his eyes all around,
and he's grinnin'.

1232
01:52:46,607 --> 01:52:48,837
<i>Gonna wear a red gown</i>

1233
01:52:50,007 --> 01:52:53,044
<i>Gonna wear a velvet coat</i>

1234
01:52:53,807 --> 01:52:55,399
<i>Going to the party</i>

1235
01:52:55,487 --> 01:52:59,639
But it's better if you're on a dirt floor
'cause your feet can slap down real hard.

1236
01:52:59,727 --> 01:53:02,764
Or you get a glass of water,

1237
01:53:02,847 --> 01:53:07,204
put it on your head and you see how many
steps you can do without spillin' the water.

1238
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:09,039
<i>Going to the party</i>

1239
01:53:09,127 --> 01:53:10,799
<i>Going to the party</i>

1240
01:53:10,887 --> 01:53:12,161
<i>Going to the party</i>

1241
01:53:12,247 --> 01:53:14,556
<i>Going to the part...</i>

1242
01:53:16,687 --> 01:53:18,837
Let me show you how to do buck dancing.

1243
01:53:18,927 --> 01:53:22,158
You hold hands, you jumps up and down.

1244
01:53:27,287 --> 01:53:29,881
You still scared of me, Sally?

1245
01:53:29,967 --> 01:53:32,003
I ain't scared of you, Master.

1246
01:53:44,407 --> 01:53:49,481
I respect your decision, monsieur,
but I regret it.

1247
01:53:49,567 --> 01:53:53,276
We have become fond
of both your daughters.

1248
01:53:53,367 --> 01:53:56,837
And I have reason to believe
that your elder daughter

1249
01:53:56,927 --> 01:53:58,963
is not altogether willing to depart.

1250
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:03,996
But I am confident that she will
be glad of it in her future years.

1251
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:06,999
We have our own ways, Madame Abbesse,

1252
01:54:07,087 --> 01:54:10,636
which we must follow
if we are to be true to ourselves.

1253
01:54:10,727 --> 01:54:15,721
I believe freedom of worship
is written into your constitution.

1254
01:54:15,807 --> 01:54:18,480
Yes, Madame. I am proud to say it is.

1255
01:54:18,567 --> 01:54:21,286
We allow each man
to choose his religion

1256
01:54:21,367 --> 01:54:24,040
according to his own conscience.

1257
01:54:24,127 --> 01:54:26,766
In spite of promises made to me,

1258
01:54:26,847 --> 01:54:29,645
my daughter was unduly influenced.

1259
01:54:29,727 --> 01:54:32,924
On the contrary, monsieur.

1260
01:54:33,007 --> 01:54:34,725
Your daughter,

1261
01:54:34,807 --> 01:54:40,325
exercising the freedom on which
your country prides itself,

1262
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:43,717
made the choice
which she judged to be right.

1263
01:54:43,807 --> 01:54:49,803
My daughter is too young
to make such a judgement.

1264
01:54:49,887 --> 01:54:54,915
Independence is not a toy
for children to play with

1265
01:54:55,007 --> 01:54:58,317
but the privilege of a fully matured mind.

1266
01:55:29,887 --> 01:55:31,002
Patsy?

1267
01:55:32,727 --> 01:55:34,843
Not yet asleep?

1268
01:55:36,767 --> 01:55:39,759
- It's very late.
- What's the time?

1269
01:55:39,847 --> 01:55:42,998
It's past midnight.
Didn't you hear it strike?

1270
01:55:44,287 --> 01:55:46,847
I thought I counted 11.

1271
01:55:49,287 --> 01:55:52,836
General Washington has written
to ask me to return home

1272
01:55:52,927 --> 01:55:56,317
and become his Secretary of State.

1273
01:55:56,407 --> 01:55:59,763
You know my feelings about public office.

1274
01:56:00,727 --> 01:56:04,640
That I'd rather eat my soup
at home with you and Polly

1275
01:56:04,727 --> 01:56:08,640
than have all the honours and position
my country can heap on me.

1276
01:56:08,727 --> 01:56:10,922
But, Patsy, you have to be at home

1277
01:56:11,007 --> 01:56:14,636
and learn what, after all,
you can only learn in America.

1278
01:56:14,727 --> 01:56:19,323
To be a woman of your own country.
A lady of Virginia.

1279
01:56:26,727 --> 01:56:29,958
Have you so fallen in love with France?

1280
01:56:30,047 --> 01:56:33,084
Or is it the dislike of your own country?

1281
01:56:37,807 --> 01:56:39,320
Surely not.

1282
01:56:43,567 --> 01:56:47,480
Remember what you promised me
when you were only 10 years old?

1283
01:56:49,607 --> 01:56:53,236
You said then, in your sweet way,

1284
01:56:53,327 --> 01:56:57,445
that you were there for me
and would do everything for me

1285
01:56:57,527 --> 01:57:02,237
and would forever be
the lady of my household.

1286
01:57:02,327 --> 01:57:05,922
Who can be the mistress
of Monticello but you?

1287
01:57:06,007 --> 01:57:08,680
Don't you want to be that?

1288
01:57:10,847 --> 01:57:13,486
More than anything else in the world.

1289
01:57:16,527 --> 01:57:18,802
If only it could be.

1290
01:57:18,887 --> 01:57:22,243
Monticello is yours.

1291
01:57:22,327 --> 01:57:24,636
As I am.

1292
01:57:25,087 --> 01:57:29,126
Listen, dearest Patsy, and believe me.

1293
01:57:30,847 --> 01:57:33,759
You are my true life

1294
01:57:33,847 --> 01:57:35,997
and my true love.

1295
01:57:36,087 --> 01:57:39,636
And everything that is best in me

1296
01:57:39,727 --> 01:57:41,718
belongs to you.

1297
01:58:06,647 --> 01:58:08,603
I need some of your money, Sal.

1298
01:58:08,687 --> 01:58:13,078
I ain't got it.
Master done keep it for me.

1299
01:58:13,167 --> 01:58:15,965
You let him keep your money?

1300
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:18,322
You do be all for natural stupidness.

1301
01:58:18,407 --> 01:58:20,159
I don't needs it.

1302
01:58:20,247 --> 01:58:21,919
I needs it.

1303
01:58:25,127 --> 01:58:27,004
Is you in trouble?

1304
01:58:31,207 --> 01:58:33,926
I just go tell old Master
that I wants my money.

1305
01:58:36,807 --> 01:58:38,798
And if he says what for?

1306
01:58:40,327 --> 01:58:43,000
I say that it's for me

1307
01:58:43,087 --> 01:58:45,078
and the little one that's comin'.

1308
01:58:49,127 --> 01:58:53,325
Who's been at you? One of them down
there? I'll kill him with my bare hands!

1309
01:58:53,407 --> 01:58:55,159
Them Frenchies?

1310
01:58:55,247 --> 01:58:57,966
They as much as look at me
and I bop him in his face.

1311
01:58:59,207 --> 01:59:02,119
Who is it, then?

1312
01:59:02,207 --> 01:59:05,916
You think you know somethin'
and you don't know nothin'.

1313
01:59:13,047 --> 01:59:15,117
So it's him, is it?

1314
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:20,035
Whole lot better if it was
one of them Frenchies.

1315
01:59:21,207 --> 01:59:25,519
- You scarcely 14.
- I's 15 and you knows it.

1316
01:59:25,607 --> 01:59:27,279
I's almost 16.

1317
01:59:27,367 --> 01:59:30,325
You's glad?

1318
01:59:30,407 --> 01:59:34,320
You's glad to breed more little niggers
to work in your master's fields.

1319
01:59:34,407 --> 01:59:38,798
Won't be no field nigger
if it's his own child I's carrying.

1320
01:59:38,887 --> 01:59:42,766
Oh, yeah.
He let it sit in his parlour,

1321
01:59:42,847 --> 01:59:44,644
drinking his port.

1322
01:59:44,727 --> 01:59:47,116
Like my white father and yours
done for us.

1323
01:59:47,207 --> 01:59:48,640
Don't you shush me.

1324
01:59:48,727 --> 01:59:51,605
You know blame well what
our white father done for us.

1325
01:59:51,687 --> 01:59:54,804
Give us away for her wedding present
when his white daughter,

1326
01:59:54,887 --> 01:59:57,799
our white sister, married Mr Jefferson.

1327
01:59:57,887 --> 02:00:00,845
Mr Jefferson serve you the same
when Miss Patsy get married.

1328
02:00:00,927 --> 02:00:04,397
You'll see. You and all
your little half-niggers,

1329
02:00:04,487 --> 02:00:09,083
y'all gets thrown in with the pots and pans
she'll be taking from Monticello.

1330
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:10,839
Or he gets married hisself.

1331
02:00:10,927 --> 02:00:13,316
And this new Mrs Jefferson,
she come and say,

1332
02:00:13,407 --> 02:00:16,479
"Who all these brat niggers
running around my house?

1333
02:00:16,567 --> 02:00:20,480
"That don't look good.
You go sell 'em someplace else."

1334
02:00:20,567 --> 02:00:22,319
You don't know nothin'!

1335
02:00:22,407 --> 02:00:24,841
Old Master, he never gonna marry again.

1336
02:00:24,927 --> 02:00:27,760
I was there when he do promise
Mrs Jefferson on her deathbed.

1337
02:00:29,527 --> 02:00:31,438
White folks' promises.

1338
02:00:31,527 --> 02:00:34,280
They keep 'em when they make 'em
to other white folk.

1339
02:00:34,367 --> 02:00:36,597
If the angels
was to come down from heaven,

1340
02:00:36,687 --> 02:00:40,123
they'd treat them the same
as they do us.

1341
02:00:40,207 --> 02:00:43,119
It's pitiful.

1342
02:00:43,207 --> 02:00:45,357
Pitiful times we's in.

1343
02:00:50,327 --> 02:00:52,795
But you listen here.

1344
02:00:52,887 --> 02:00:56,516
Sal, if we stays in Paris,

1345
02:00:56,607 --> 02:00:58,598
we's free.

1346
02:00:58,687 --> 02:01:01,565
Yeah. Plum free to starve to death.

1347
02:01:01,647 --> 02:01:03,399
I can get wages any day I wants

1348
02:01:03,487 --> 02:01:06,365
with making the pastries
and all them things I learnts.

1349
02:01:06,447 --> 02:01:10,156
But he learned you so you can
cook good things at Monticello.

1350
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:16,238
It's lucky for us I got more sense in my
little toe than you has in your entire body.

1351
02:01:18,767 --> 02:01:22,555
I misses my mammy and they all
something awful.

1352
02:01:22,647 --> 02:01:24,558
I wants to go home.

1353
02:01:24,647 --> 02:01:27,559
Home? Home? What home?

1354
02:01:27,647 --> 02:01:31,037
Your little old slave cabin where they
keeps you like the animals they breeds?

1355
02:01:31,127 --> 02:01:34,403
God Almighty never meant
for human beings to be like animals.

1356
02:01:34,487 --> 02:01:37,479
We has a soul
and a head and a mind.

1357
02:01:37,567 --> 02:01:41,003
We ain't like a dog or a horse.
Now, you listen to me.

1358
02:01:41,087 --> 02:01:43,840
You do what I says and you and me is free.

1359
02:01:43,927 --> 02:01:46,964
And that little one in there... free.

1360
02:01:47,047 --> 02:01:50,119
Don't you want to see what it's like
to own your own body?

1361
02:01:53,487 --> 02:01:57,878
You's crazy, James Hemings.
You's crazy.

1362
02:02:16,127 --> 02:02:19,039
Master, we staying in Paris.

1363
02:02:19,127 --> 02:02:21,482
Sally and I are staying.

1364
02:02:21,567 --> 02:02:26,322
You consider yourself free then,
to go or stay as you please.

1365
02:02:26,407 --> 02:02:29,001
We is free here, Master.

1366
02:02:29,087 --> 02:02:32,124
Ain't nobody is a slave in France.

1367
02:02:32,207 --> 02:02:35,324
Does your sister also wish
to follow the law prevailing here

1368
02:02:35,407 --> 02:02:37,841
rather than the American law
under which she was born?

1369
02:02:37,927 --> 02:02:40,395
She don't understand nothin'.

1370
02:02:40,487 --> 02:02:42,682
She do what I say.

1371
02:02:52,927 --> 02:02:55,885
With no regard for what I say?

1372
02:02:55,967 --> 02:02:59,846
She be wanting her freedom, Master.

1373
02:02:59,927 --> 02:03:01,645
For her own self

1374
02:03:01,727 --> 02:03:03,797
and the little one what's coming.

1375
02:03:09,607 --> 02:03:13,043
So you, James, will provide
for Sally and her child?

1376
02:03:13,127 --> 02:03:14,845
I'll be getting work and wages.

1377
02:03:14,927 --> 02:03:17,919
Remember, once I have left
and you are here on your own,

1378
02:03:18,007 --> 02:03:20,601
there's nothing more I shall
be able to do for you.

1379
02:03:20,687 --> 02:03:23,406
You will be living among strangers
in a strange land,

1380
02:03:23,487 --> 02:03:25,762
of which you do not even
know the language.

1381
02:03:25,847 --> 02:03:30,921
I know some,
more than you, Master.

1382
02:03:31,767 --> 02:03:34,964
Yes. That is true.

1383
02:03:36,927 --> 02:03:39,157
But if, James...

1384
02:03:39,247 --> 02:03:41,761
James, listen to me.

1385
02:03:41,847 --> 02:03:46,079
If I say come home to Virginia,
and I shall give you your freedom.

1386
02:03:48,847 --> 02:03:50,883
You'd give me my freedom?

1387
02:03:50,967 --> 02:03:53,117
That is what I'm proposing.

1388
02:03:55,567 --> 02:03:56,966
My papers and all?

1389
02:03:57,047 --> 02:04:00,562
Everything that is legally required
to release you from my ownership.

1390
02:04:06,127 --> 02:04:08,243
And her and the little one?

1391
02:04:18,607 --> 02:04:20,723
What do you say, Sally?

1392
02:04:22,207 --> 02:04:24,596
Think very carefully.

1393
02:04:27,047 --> 02:04:30,801
You and your child will be free
to leave Monticello

1394
02:04:30,887 --> 02:04:34,402
and earn your living elsewhere
as a free woman.

1395
02:04:37,967 --> 02:04:41,926
- Where's I goin'?
- Wherever you wish.

1396
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:46,036
But where do I go?

1397
02:04:58,927 --> 02:05:01,202
Let me make another proposal.

1398
02:05:01,287 --> 02:05:07,123
While you, James, may claim your freedom
whenever you wish after I return home,

1399
02:05:07,207 --> 02:05:09,596
Sally and her child...

1400
02:05:11,007 --> 02:05:13,999
will remain at Monticello,

1401
02:05:14,087 --> 02:05:16,396
under my care.

1402
02:05:16,487 --> 02:05:19,001
But upon my death
to be given her freedom.

1403
02:05:19,087 --> 02:05:22,523
How we know it'll happen like that
when we get back to Monticello?

1404
02:05:22,607 --> 02:05:25,201
You have my word.

1405
02:05:45,527 --> 02:05:49,202
You wish me to swear an oath
on the Bible?

1406
02:06:02,327 --> 02:06:05,080
Patsy? Patsy.

1407
02:06:05,167 --> 02:06:07,556
Will you step inside, please?

1408
02:06:13,207 --> 02:06:15,118
Close the door.

1409
02:06:20,927 --> 02:06:24,158
Now, here's a strange to-do, Patsy.

1410
02:06:24,247 --> 02:06:28,240
I'm about to swear an oath
that on our return to Virginia,

1411
02:06:28,327 --> 02:06:31,000
James shall have his freedom.

1412
02:06:32,527 --> 02:06:35,678
But should anything
happen to me, Patsy,

1413
02:06:35,887 --> 02:06:39,084
it will be you who'll have
to fulfil that promise.

1414
02:06:40,727 --> 02:06:42,638
Do you understand me?

1415
02:06:48,407 --> 02:06:52,082
And further there's an oath to Sally
that she, too, upon my death shall be free.

1416
02:06:52,167 --> 02:06:55,000
Her and the little one what's coming.

1417
02:06:56,407 --> 02:07:00,923
Yes, Sally and the child she's expecting.

1418
02:07:01,007 --> 02:07:06,320
And all other children that may be
born to her in the future.

1419
02:07:06,407 --> 02:07:09,285
Do you bind yourself to that?

1420
02:07:21,807 --> 02:07:25,766
I swear by Almighty God that upon
my return to the state of Virginia,

1421
02:07:25,847 --> 02:07:31,046
I shall within a period of not more than two
years give his freedom to James Hemings.

1422
02:07:35,847 --> 02:07:39,760
Since, however, James was brought
to Paris at great expense to me

1423
02:07:39,847 --> 02:07:42,680
for the purpose of learning
the art of French cookery,

1424
02:07:42,767 --> 02:07:46,077
he shall continue to reside
at Monticello in my service

1425
02:07:46,167 --> 02:07:51,161
until he shall have taught the same art
to such persons as I shall place under him.

1426
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:53,397
Do you swear?

1427
02:07:59,607 --> 02:08:01,325
I swear.

1428
02:08:06,687 --> 02:08:12,319
I also hereby promise and declare
that Sally Hemings,

1429
02:08:12,407 --> 02:08:14,557
sister of James,

1430
02:08:14,647 --> 02:08:16,877
shall be freed upon my death.

1431
02:08:18,047 --> 02:08:20,880
Likewise, all children born to her

1432
02:08:20,967 --> 02:08:25,438
shall be freed from my ownership
or that of my heirs

1433
02:08:25,527 --> 02:08:28,325
upon reaching the age of 21.

1434
02:08:30,687 --> 02:08:32,917
Do you swear, Patsy?

1435
02:08:36,087 --> 02:08:37,918
I swear.
