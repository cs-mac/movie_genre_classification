1
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,916
Can I give you a ride?

2
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,411
All the way into town?

3
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,083
I turn north at Heatherton.

4
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,252
What are those for?
A funeral?

5
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,251
Why do flowers have
to be for anything?

6
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,253
Isn't it enough that
they have color and form

7
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,245
and that they make
you feel good?

8
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,787
You talk a lot, don't you?

9
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,252
Don't you, ever?

10
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,420
I could talk your eyes
out of your head.

11
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,430
But not small talk.

12
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,632
I'd be grateful to hear
any talk at all these days.

13
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,755
Talk big.

14
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,270
Red and green.

15
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,573
Duran died last fall
in a hospital.

16
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,765
You wouldn't know who he was.

17
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,107
It happens I do.

18
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,172
Who?

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,210
A French painter.

20
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,075
One of Les fauves.

21
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:59,282
He died in a hospital in a
white bed in a white room,

22
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,017
doctors in white
standing around.

23
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:06,622
The last thing he said was,
"some red, show me some red.

24
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,518
"Before dying, I want to see
some red with some green. "

25
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,428
You're right. You don't have small talk.

26
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:15,625
Artists are better off dead.

27
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:16,697
Why?

28
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,704
People pay more
attention to them

29
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,136
when they're dead
and not so troublesome.

30
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,102
Is that what you are? A painter?

31
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,470
They said Van Gogh was crazy
because he killed himself.

32
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,481
He couldn't sell a painting
while he was alive,

33
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,653
and now they're
worth $30 million.

34
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,853
They weren't that bad then
and they're not that good now

35
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,646
so, who's crazy?

36
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,318
I get out here.

37
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,986
You're from the clinic.

38
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:43,834
That's right. I'm "out
of touch with reality. "

39
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,831
I'll take you up.

40
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:49,832
Are you being helped here?

41
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,397
How should I know?

42
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,536
If you don't, who does?

43
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,901
My analyst thinks he does.

44
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,340
The fact which
I should like to convey

45
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,177
in this report to the trustees

46
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,183
is that our patients
now, more and more,

47
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,176
are shouldering
the responsibility

48
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,918
for their own affairs
in the hospital.

49
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,124
In dealing with the, ah,
borderline patients,

50
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,517
that is to say the people
who find it difficult

51
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,230
to cope with the normal
strains of living,

52
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:22,762
and in whom the, ah, the danger of
a psychotic break is always present...

53
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,729
Mrs. Demuth.

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,540
All right.
We'll go on after that.

55
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,372
You've changed Steven Holte to 5:00.

56
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:32,137
Oh, yeah. Well, I'll
work on it by myself tonight.

57
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,206
Patients' committee meeting... 8:30.

58
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,735
I know. Bedtime... 2:30.

59
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,076
Mrs. Demuth. Dr.
Mclver will see you now.

60
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,822
Mr. Holcomb is disturbed.

61
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,956
So is Mrs. O’Brien.

62
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,468
Mr. Holcomb!

63
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,540
Mr. Holcomb, are you all right?

64
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:15,554
Mr. Holcomb.
This is Dr. Devanal.

65
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:18,287
I'd like
to talk to you.

66
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,992
Would you open the door, please?

67
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:22,686
Mr. Holcomb.

68
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,687
Shall I use my key, doctor?

69
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,500
What brought this on,
do you know?

70
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:28,732
He was pretty incoherent.

71
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,256
Something about the gardener.

72
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,471
Curly?

73
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,713
Yes. He felt he'd insulted him.

74
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:33,734
When did this happen?

75
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,198
Just a few moments ago.

76
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,539
Shall I send curly to you?

77
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:40,535
No, no. Is miss inch
in her office?

78
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,678
She was in the library
the last time I saw her.

79
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:44,854
Well, keep talking to him
and try to get him

80
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,082
to open the door.
I'll be back.

81
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,748
What's the price of this?

82
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,586
That's cotton wrap. You
wouldn't be happy with that.

83
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:52,853
What's wrong with it?

84
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,860
Well, there's
nothing wrong with it

85
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,332
but as long as you're investing
in drapes for a room like this,

86
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,158
why, you should have
a cheerful pattern.

87
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,827
Otherwise, you'd be better off

88
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,926
to let these old ones
make do until you...

89
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,568
well, it was not my idea
to replace the drapes,

90
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,574
the board makes these decisions.

91
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,536
I'm responsible for
getting things done

92
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:11,935
as economically as possible.

93
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,806
So I want to know what
this would add up to.

94
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:18,545
Well, that wrap is $2.99
a yard plus sales tax.

95
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,723
191.36, less our discount.

96
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:23,082
Vicky. May I see you a moment?

97
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,050
12.5% on 191.365 times...

98
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:33,101
167.44 plus 3% sales
tax... 5.02... 176.46 total!

99
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,263
How's my best girl?

100
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,071
Up to my...

101
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,403
Vicky, we've got a situation
here. I need your help.

102
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,779
It's about curly.
It seems he has...

103
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:44,274
what do you want me to do? Fire him?

104
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,668
He's been here 20 years.

105
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,300
Cost you twice as
much to get anyone else

106
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,611
to do half the work.

107
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:49,956
Vicky, please.
You know very well

108
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:51,581
he won't listen to
anybody but you.

109
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:52,906
He's upset another patient.

110
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,580
And the last thing
in the world we want,

111
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,119
with the trustees coming
down next week, is a...

112
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,554
well, anytime the board

113
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,900
doesn't like the way
I run my department...

114
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:00,961
Vicky, Vicky.

115
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,762
Everyone knows you do
wonders around here.

116
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:05,634
Well, do a tiny
wonder for me, now.

117
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,433
Tell curly to behave
with the patients.

118
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:12,595
Anything. Just so I can tell
Holcomb he's apologized. Hmm?

119
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:15,497
Go on! Work your magic!

120
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:17,767
Oh, Vicky.

121
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,469
Why don't you let me leave these

122
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,111
chintz samples here
for you to think over?

123
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,546
I don't think you're going
to be happy with that.

124
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,662
What's all this concern
about my being happy?

125
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,310
I have no intention of

126
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,651
dancing through the halls,

127
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,316
shrieking with laughter because

128
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,724
we're changing a set of drapes.

129
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,196
Now, then, leave a
duplicate order blank.

130
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,290
Let you know in a few days.

131
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,955
Ok, Vicky!

132
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:51,909
Well, there it is. The house of Usher.

133
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:56,343
They talk of environmental
therapy. Some environment!

134
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,850
You should see the inside.

135
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,652
Like the inside of a dead fish!

136
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,084
Right now, miss inch...

137
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,148
you live in town,
you've heard of miss inch...

138
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,397
her old man shot buffalo bill
or somebody right near here.

139
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,649
Ha ha! I've heard of her.

140
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,361
Well, she's getting ready

141
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,192
to hang new drapes
in the library.

142
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,357
One look, and all the patients
will hang themselves alongside them.

143
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,697
Everybody's tilted here.

144
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,202
That's why you didn't
know who I was.

145
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,840
You can't tell the patients
from the doctors.

146
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,195
Oh, but I can.

147
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,266
How?

148
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,874
The patients get better!

149
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,196
Ha ha!

150
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,369
Thanks for the ride.

151
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,240
You're welcome.

152
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,824
And that evening, we put her
on the boat train for America.

153
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,517
Well!
As you can imagine,

154
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,359
our joy and relief
was indescribable,

155
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:47,134
and we boarded the plane for Italy
happy and carefree as children.

156
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,334
I can see you've already
guessed what happened!

157
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,576
Well, sure enough, when we
landed at the airport in Rome,

158
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,739
we were greeted by
the appalling sight

159
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,401
of miss Dalrymple
waving hysterically.

160
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,740
Well, the rest of the trip
was agony. She literally...

161
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,942
...Mrs. Dalrymple
or I.

162
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,444
Well, finally, we found
a handsome young Italian...

163
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,876
Ah, Mrs. Mclver!

164
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,741
Oh! Dr. Wolff, how nice.

165
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,440
A most unusual pleasure

166
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,751
seeing you in the clinic.

167
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,083
And how's, ah, um...

168
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,277
Mrs. Wolff is very well, thank you.

169
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,789
I tried to phone...

170
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,501
Stewart's been so busy
we haven't seen anyone.

171
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,919
Oh, I understand.

172
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:49,658
Well, sometime very, very soon!

173
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,474
Stewart, I...

174
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:02,765
oh! I'm so sorry!

175
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:03,937
I didn't hear anyone.

176
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,805
Karen, can't you see I'm busy?

177
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,813
I do beg your pardon. I
didn't mean to interrupt.

178
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,845
But I've just had an idea,
the most wonderful idea...

179
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,517
look, you know better than
to bust in here like this.

180
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:12,775
But, darling, it's after 5:00.

181
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:13,977
I thought you were through.

182
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,378
Ok, ok.

183
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,331
...your wife, who looks as if

184
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:30,773
anybody breathed on her she'd
break out in a thick frost!

185
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,629
What is she? A
nymphomaniac or something?

186
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,371
What did you marry her for,
anyway? To wear on your lapel?

187
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,836
Why are you so worried about me?

188
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,908
Who's worried about you?
I'm worried about me.

189
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,854
All right,
I'm a charity patient.

190
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,417
You've got to have me
for taxes or something,

191
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,756
but you're still supposed to be
making me fit for normal life!

192
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,261
What's normal? Yours?

193
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,326
If it's a question of
values, your values stink.

194
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:06,126
Lousy, middle-class,
well-fed, smug existence.

195
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,170
All you care about is
a paycheck you didn't earn

196
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,136
and a beautiful thing
to go home to every night.

197
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:14,884
Stewart, darling!
Welcome home!

198
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,142
There's a fatted calf
on the stove!

199
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:23,353
This started before
she came in, though.

200
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,887
What's that? An
interpretation or something?

201
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:29,223
It doesn't go
very deep, does it?

202
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,530
Why don't you analyze my Oedipus
complex with my lousy father?

203
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,903
Suppose we let me determine
the course of treatment, eh?

204
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,903
After all, this is
your first case.

205
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,665
Don't you know how to do
any ID analysis here?

206
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,674
Isn't that the
classic procedure?

207
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,166
You're not a classic case.

208
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,968
Oh, insults now.

209
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:50,408
Stevie, since you
mention my values,

210
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,877
they include sitting here listening
to the bull you throw at me.

211
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,878
And I don't get more
than a little mad,

212
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,820
and I don't say "forget it. "

213
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,315
Because one of my values

214
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,216
is not to toss in the
sponge on human commitments.

215
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:09,059
You have a genius for
belittling the world, Stevie.

216
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,800
Great. I'm glad you think
it's worth something.

217
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,896
You reduce me to a fictitious character,

218
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,838
a predatory dolt.

219
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,843
This is what you do
to people and then

220
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,835
you wonder why you
can't relate to Th...

221
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,607
what a collection
of junky platitudes!

222
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,276
I don't know, maybe
you're sore at me

223
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:28,246
because you haven't got a woman
of your own, a home of your own...

224
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,475
Oh, stop it.
You're so brilliant.

225
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,892
I seem to be missing
a piece here.

226
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,385
I can't quite understand...

227
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,056
she gave me a lift
in that station wagon.

228
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,156
Did you know who she was?

229
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,070
Who do you think
you are, Stevie?

230
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,472
You're no different
from anybody else.

231
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,274
She's a good-looking woman.

232
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:53,406
Why shouldn't you have
certain thoughts about it?

233
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:57,484
You don't have to feel guilty
toward me or even afraid.

234
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,048
I'm not your father, Stevie.

235
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,293
And I'm not going to run
out on you like your father.

236
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:14,298
There's something in the
world besides betrayal.

237
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,109
What did you... Say?

238
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,453
Oh, Regina,
it's so funny! Ha ha!

239
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,659
Oh, yes, but this is a new
low in taste even for Vicky.

240
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,893
A dismal, dreary old
piece of wreck

241
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,429
you wouldn't even use
for washing the car.

242
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,304
Well, it's such a pity.
It's a beautiful old room,

243
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,904
and, well, that's where
I thought you could help me.

244
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:56,298
You have such beautiful
shops in Chicago,

245
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,610
and we have nothing here
but poor old Petlee's.

246
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,143
Well, I found myself visualizing

247
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,279
what I would choose
if it were left to me.

248
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,075
Well, you know that's fatal.

249
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:08,277
They shouldn't allow me
within 100 miles of materials

250
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,019
when there's a budget involved.

251
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:13,415
Oh, well, Regina,
that's so sweet of you,

252
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,587
but it's not strictly true.

253
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:20,326
If I have any taste at all, it's because
I've absorbed everything you've taught me.

254
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,698
Well! Do you remember...

255
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,337
Daddy!

256
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,505
R- r-Rosie!

257
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:35,514
Mommy said I could stay
up until you got home.

258
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:38,346
That's swell. I'll tuck
you in myself. Hi, mark!

259
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,352
Hi, dad!

260
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,353
How are you?
Oh, uh, excuse me!

261
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,185
Listen, do you think you could
square things with Sadie for me?

262
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,547
Sure!

263
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,728
Ask her to get me something to
eat. I got to get right back.

264
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,753
Ok.

265
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:48,891
Good. Oowhaah!

266
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,216
Daddy, will you come up and

267
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,291
kiss me good night
before you go?

268
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,069
Well, I sure will. I wouldn't
miss that for the world.

269
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:55,695
Will you read me a story?

270
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,202
I'll read you a short one.

271
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,634
Daddy, what can we play?

272
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,199
How's about a little cribbage?

273
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,737
Ha ha!
Stay home tonight.

274
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,243
Now, are you sure
you have the measurements?

275
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,306
Right.

276
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,710
How long will...
yes, air express.

277
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:14,376
Oh, but Regina, how could you possibly
get them here for the meeting Tuesday?

278
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,148
Well, how on earth can
he make them that quickly?

279
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:20,218
Oh, how wonderful!
He must be a mad genius!

280
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,487
Good evening, darling. I'll
be with you in a minute.

281
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,257
That was Stewart.

282
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,756
No, I haven't had a chance
to tell him yet. I...

283
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,898
I don't know.
He may think I...

284
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,233
oh! Thank you. Thanks.

285
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,569
As a matter of fact, I think
myself he'll be pleased.

286
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,235
It's the first time I've
done anything for the...

287
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,044
oh, Regina, you're the most
extravagant, fabulous...

288
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:43,082
all right, darling.
You'll let me know?

289
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:45,254
And I'll leave word
if I'm not at home.

290
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,452
Good-bye, darling,
and thank you!

291
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,516
Have you got a moment?

292
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,785
Sure. I'm all ears.

293
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,723
Oh, darling, this is
important. Please sit down.

294
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,959
I'm sorry.
Go ahead, shoot.

295
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,134
I had an inspiration
this afternoon.

296
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,203
At least, I think it is.

297
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:03,262
How do you like this?

298
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,730
Chippendale rose
on antique satin.

299
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,269
It's very pretty.
What's it for?

300
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,074
Well, I first thought
of it this afternoon

301
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,836
when I picked up that
wild Fawn of yours.

302
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,824
In fact, that's what I came
bursting in your office to tell you.

303
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,279
I'm sorry I was so curt.

304
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,811
Oh, that's all right.
I didn't...

305
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,336
listening to what
you hear in there,

306
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,321
you get to feel it's a
little like a confessional.

307
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,776
That's a very high-strung boy.

308
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,277
Yes, I understand.

309
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,919
He's very attractive.
As I say, he's the one...

310
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,115
the feeling was mutual.

311
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,458
You made quite an impression.

312
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,463
Really?

313
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,524
Mmm.

314
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,628
What did he say?

315
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,303
Well, it got a little complicated.

316
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,301
What went on with him?

317
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,303
Nothing.
We just talked.

318
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,825
Did he tell you about it?

319
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,840
Just about all of it.

320
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:44,472
Well, why do you
ask what went on?

321
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,808
Because I'm not sure
what he thought went on

322
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,643
is what you thought went on.

323
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,839
He thought you were
flirting with him.

324
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:52,851
Is that what you think?

325
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,453
Karen.

326
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,315
This boy leads a very active
fantasy life with ladies.

327
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,824
He got going on you
and I couldn't stop him!

328
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,256
Is that my fault?
I didn't...

329
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:03,322
I wasn't really thinking
about you, Karen.

330
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,660
It's my job to think about him.

331
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,325
And what he felt,
not what I feel!

332
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,363
I'm not worrying about
you! I am about him.

333
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,060
When he saw you were my wife,

334
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:13,502
he got very scared,
went on the attack.

335
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,467
Said a lot of wild things
about you, about me.

336
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,867
What things?

337
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,668
It doesn't matter what things.

338
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,240
I've told you too
much about him already.

339
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,039
But you listen to them!

340
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,681
Of course I listen to them!
What do you think I'm there for?

341
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,877
And because they're
too sacred to tell me,

342
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:30,579
I get no chance
to reply to them?

343
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,551
Who expects you to?

344
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,659
Look, Karen. Don't be
so full of your feelings.

345
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,862
The point I'm making
is that this boy

346
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,734
has put his life in my hands.

347
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,093
I'm concerned about him,

348
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:42,902
as I am about everything at the clinic.

349
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:45,603
You might try to understand
that and share it.

350
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,366
I am trying to! I came in
this afternoon without...

351
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,805
by being so self-absorbed
you interrupt an hour?

352
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,612
I apologized for that.

353
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,614
And while you're
in your confessional

354
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:57,406
being a divinity
to your sick boy,

355
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:59,208
what am I supposed to be doing?

356
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
You're not supposed to be

357
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,247
showing yourself off
to my patients!

358
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,746
Give me one ounce of the
attention you give them

359
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,248
day and night!

360
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,950
Now, what does that mean?

361
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,161
Just what you think it means!

362
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,409
How did the tournament go?

363
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,407
Fine. I'm in the
semi-finals playing Conover.

364
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,909
Ooh, he's a tough one.

365
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,620
Hello, Sadie.

366
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,952
Good evening.

367
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,617
Oh, just skip the soup, Sadie.

368
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:39,745
It's your favorite.

369
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,420
Yeah, I know. I don't have much time.

370
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,918
Just put something on a plate.

371
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,929
All right.

372
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,931
How long did you play?

373
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,803
Two hours.
Then we adjourned.

374
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,572
Hmm. You playing white?

375
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,972
Mm-hmm.

376
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,573
Looks like you've got a mate
there if you play it right.

377
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,436
What's your next move?

378
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,244
Well, I was going
to sacrifice my rook.

379
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,177
That's pretty fancy.
What for?

380
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:05,983
I take the Bishop with my rook
and his rook has to take mine.

381
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,976
Then I bring my queen
to knight 4

382
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:10,448
and threaten mate in one move.

383
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,717
Well! You know, I think
I'd better take up checkers!

384
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,028
Sadie!

385
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,296
Yes, sir?

386
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:25,465
Where's the Brandy?

387
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,972
Oh, it's on this side.

388
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,033
Oh, thank you.

389
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,671
With Martinis?

390
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,336
Sure! Why not?

391
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,661
What's tonight?

392
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,063
The concert.

393
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,664
Oh, Karen.
I'm sorry, I forgot.

394
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,328
I've got a patients' meeting.

395
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:58,127
Wouldn't tomorrow
night do as well?

396
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:01,028
It's their meeting. I can't
switch it around to suit myself.

397
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,371
It involves a dozen patients.

398
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:03,866
Well, can't Dev take it?

399
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,137
Oh, you know Dev. Besides,
this is my department.

400
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,236
I've been looking forward
to this for one week.

401
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,514
Look, I'll call
Meg Rinehart and ask her

402
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,919
to take the meeting if
it's that important to you.

403
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,621
It isn't, really.

404
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,252
I'm sorry, Kare.

405
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,961
I'm sorry, too.

406
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:35,603
Mr. Appleton, if you please.

407
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,239
Very well,
Mr. Holcomb.

408
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,684
We're not going to get
anywhere unless

409
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,735
we follow rules of
parliamentary procedure.

410
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,437
If everyone speaks at once,
it becomes very disorderly.

411
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,610
Please wait until
I recognize somebody.

412
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,279
Well, hurry up.
Recognize somebody.

413
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,879
I recognize myself,

414
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,620
which I believe I have every
right to do. And I am...

415
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,656
Oh, let someone else
talk for a change, Holcomb.

416
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,818
You blew your top
this afternoon.

417
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,670
Miss Demuth,
that is rude and uncalled for.

418
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,732
What's more, if you
don't like the way I...

419
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,795
I'm sorry. I... I am
sometimes a little dictatorial.

420
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:07,665
That's a fault I have...
I... I'm working on it.

421
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,474
Work harder.

422
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,171
Oh, Dr. Mclver!

423
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,438
Sorry I'm late.

424
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:15,778
Oh, please, go right ahead.

425
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,482
Dr. Mclver, they're all confusing

426
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,654
occupational therapy with common labor.

427
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:22,523
Let's ask Dr.
Mclver what he thinks.

428
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,993
Sounds like a very
vital topic. What is it?

429
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,331
Quiet! Quiet!

430
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:35,663
Mr. Appleton, you are
being very difficult.

431
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,369
Actually, it was Mrs.
Rinehart's department.

432
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:38,668
Perhaps she would summarize.

433
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,672
No. Innocent bystander.

434
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,674
Well, Mrs. Jenkins,
then. It was her idea.

435
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,196
I had the impression
it was mine.

436
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,740
We both had the idea.

437
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,936
I was talking to Mrs.
Rinehart this afternoon about

438
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:50,138
how there were going to be
new drapes in the library

439
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,980
when this scheme occurred to me.

440
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,415
Then we discovered that
Lois had had the same thought

441
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,857
when she was talking
to Mrs. Rinehart...

442
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,321
I still think mine came first.

443
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,324
Who had the idea first
is completely, uh...

444
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,846
Irrelevant?

445
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:01,921
Irrelevant.

446
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,528
The point is, we could
make them ourselves.

447
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,691
The patients, I mean.
A group project.

448
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,160
They'd be all our
own from beginning to end

449
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:11,869
and Stevie Holte could
make some original designs

450
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:13,872
and we'd put them together and sew them.

451
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:15,694
Everybody's in favor of
it except Mr. Holcomb.

452
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,166
Now, now, just a moment.

453
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,667
I did not say that I
was not in favor of them.

454
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,540
I merely raised the question...

455
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,278
does Mrs. Rinehart
think it's workable?

456
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,553
Might be.

457
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,781
You don't sound
too enthusiastic.

458
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:27,747
I don't mean to.

459
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,224
It's an interesting idea.

460
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,752
It's a wonderful idea!

461
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,217
And you say Stevie Holte
wants to do the designs?

462
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,557
Yes.

463
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:36,892
Oh, thank you.

464
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:37,957
Stevie?

465
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,034
Yes?

466
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,232
Can you?

467
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:41,733
We figure on using
unbleached muslin.

468
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,555
Which I could wipe my feet on

469
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,230
and it would look
better than those.

470
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:46,898
Oh, is that the plan?

471
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:48,197
No!

472
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:51,538
No, the plan is to do
designs of our own lives here.

473
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:53,405
I don't know
what they'll be yet.

474
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:54,924
But when we get them
up, it'll look like

475
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,411
our living room and
not miss inch's.

476
00:22:57,478 --> 00:22:59,878
What makes you so confident?

477
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,146
Isn't that obvious?
I'm scared stiff!

478
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,415
Does that mean all right
on the drapes, doctor?

479
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:05,715
It means all right so far.

480
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:16,234
Quiet! Mr. Appleton,
in the name of heaven!

481
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:17,896
Excuse me, doctor.

482
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,904
We're still
without any decision

483
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,436
as to whether this is
an administrative problem,

484
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,613
in which case we should
consult Dr. Devanal...

485
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,741
well, for the moment let's
say it's a clinical matter

486
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,937
since I'm here tonight
and Dr. Devanal isn't.

487
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,439
Now, uh...

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,940
Right over there.

489
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:01,405
Calling 4-1098.
Calling Mrs. Mclver.

490
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,844
Yes, this is Mrs. Mclver.

491
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,980
What?

492
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:06,775
Oh! Regina!

493
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,777
I thought it was something
wrong with the children!

494
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,990
What? On the plane tomorrow?

495
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:13,492
I don't believe it.

496
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:15,724
Oh, Regina, you're
a miracle worker.

497
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,989
Vicky inch? Oh,
don't worry about her.

498
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:20,058
I'll call her at once
and tell her.

499
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,626
She's no problem.

500
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,625
Oh, Regina, darling!
Thank you so terribly much.

501
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:25,067
And we'll see you
next week then.

502
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,531
Good-bye.

503
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,754
Yes, who is it?

504
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,146
Vicky,
this is Karen Mclver.

505
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:47,816
Yes?

506
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,768
I'd like to discuss something
with you for the clinic.

507
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,590
How have you been?

508
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,858
Satisfactory.

509
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,996
Darling, could you
speak a trifle louder?

510
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,031
I'm calling in the
intermission of the concert.

511
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:59,077
Everyone in town is galloping
up and down the corridor.

512
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,529
Close the booth!

513
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,771
Whew! I can't.
I'll perish.

514
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,565
It's quite sultry here.

515
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,547
I never understand why this
place cannot be air-conditioned.

516
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,042
Money.

517
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:08,367
What, darling?

518
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,381
I said money.

519
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:10,542
How are you?

520
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,691
I told you satisfactory!

521
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,112
Do you want one of these?

522
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,419
No, but thanks so much.
I'll see you all later.

523
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:15,947
Karen!

524
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,896
Yes, Vicky. I'm calling
about the library drapes.

525
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,521
I've been talking with Regina.

526
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:20,986
Who?

527
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,834
Regina Mitchell-Smythe.
She has this material.

528
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,786
I have a swatch here
she let me have.

529
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,889
Well, if she'd let us have
a few swatches of money

530
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,461
it would be more to the point.

531
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,569
Vicky, I don't think the
money should be an obstacle.

532
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,232
Shouldn't it?

533
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,539
Last year the clinic spent
over $100 just on thumbtacks.

534
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,072
Thumbtacks?

535
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,337
And paper clips.

536
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,674
We can't afford them.

537
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,880
Vicky, you're being
simply obstructive!

538
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:43,182
Am I?

539
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:45,683
Karen, there are channels
for doing things here.

540
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:46,976
I am beginning to doubt.

541
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,347
And traditions which newcomers

542
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,685
may not be familiar with.

543
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,689
Vicky, are you referring
to Dr. Mclver and myself?

544
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,827
I'm certainly referring
to Regina Mitchell-Smythe,

545
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,632
who seems not to know that I
do the decorating at the clinic.

546
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:04,665
She has been chairman
of the board for 5 years.

547
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,231
Sprung up like a toadstool.

548
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,299
What?

549
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,773
Toadstool!
Overnight.

550
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:10,745
Regina Mitchell-Smythe
is a most influential woman

551
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,611
and works very hard
for the clinic.

552
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:13,843
No harder than I do.

553
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,047
I've been with the clinic longer

554
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,605
than anyone except Dr. Devanal.

555
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:18,007
I remember when the late

556
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,848
Dr. Sanford Collins founded it.

557
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,223
Why, I remember
when that building

558
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,877
was put up in the
first place in 1907.

559
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:23,949
Really?

560
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:25,334
And those drapes
that are up there?

561
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,761
I didn't have to send
to Chicago for them.

562
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:28,217
I picked them myself
from Petlee's.

563
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,318
In 1907?

564
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,290
Let me warn you, Vicky...

565
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:35,228
hello?
Vicky! Vicky!

566
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,881
Jim Petlee?
Vicky inch.

567
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,016
Well, you can go
back afterwards.

568
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:58,221
That cotton wrap? $2.99
a yard, 12.5% discount?

569
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,694
I'll take it. You can
send it out tomorrow.

570
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,626
Dev!

571
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,725
You go back to your seat, dear.

572
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,797
I'll join you.

573
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,600
Karen, we ought to
put you in the bank

574
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,610
and live off the interest.

575
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,412
You look like a million dollars.

576
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:25,754
Dev, I... I hate to bother
you, but I'm a little upset.

577
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,452
Could I talk with
you for a moment?

578
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,783
Why, of course!
Get you anything?

579
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,750
No. I'd like some
fresh air, please.

580
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,748
Absolutely.

581
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,464
Where is Stewart tonight?

582
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,785
Isn't he a music lover?

583
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,461
As a matter of fact, he's not.

584
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,998
He went back to the clinic.

585
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:45,804
Oh?

586
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,766
Now, what's fretting
your handsome head?

587
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,895
What can I do?

588
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,941
Dev, how do you get
on with Vicky inch?

589
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,807
Most of the time.
Why?

590
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,806
She was very rude
to me just now.

591
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,508
Is she here?

592
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:00,779
No. On the phone.

593
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,777
Oh! Ha! That's just Vicky.

594
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,119
Don't take it personally.

595
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,454
She made it unmistakably personal.

596
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,789
Referred to me as a newcomer.

597
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,464
She even hung up on me.

598
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,792
Only once?

599
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,787
What was it about?

600
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,659
What do you think
of Regina, Dev?

601
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,827
Regina? Oh, very capable woman.

602
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:19,828
She's been very valuable to us.

603
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,530
Then I don't understand why

604
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,801
Vicky called her a toadstool.

605
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,110
A toadstool?

606
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,842
Regina?

607
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:30,738
Ha ha ha!
Vicky's a character!

608
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,751
In what connection, Karen?

609
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,853
Well, I looked in
the library today

610
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,575
when I stopped by the clinic...

611
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,319
Today? How did I miss that?

612
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,515
Well, I got my first real
look at those curtains.

613
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,857
They're a disgrace!

614
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,133
Vicky's doing
something about them.

615
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:45,857
Vicky spoke as though I had no right

616
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,486
to think about
the clinic at all.

617
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:53,101
She made me feel suddenly
left out, unwanted here.

618
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:57,296
Unwanted? How could
you feel that?

619
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,939
I've never given you that
feeling, have I, Karen?

620
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,879
Well, you leave Vicky to me.

621
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:07,906
I'll talk to her in the morning,

622
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:09,551
give you a ring.

623
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,045
Oh, Dev, you're very sweet.

624
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:16,318
Better yet, why don't we meet
for a late-afternoon drink,

625
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:18,559
put our heads together?

626
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,034
Settle this in no time at all.

627
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:29,701
Dr. Mclver?

628
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,099
Yes, Mrs. O’Brien?

629
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,851
It's Mr. Wictz, doctor.
He's done it again.

630
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,543
Done what? Had a party, last night.

631
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,577
Miss Kubiecki reports
it went on till 2:00.

632
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:37,822
Several of the
patients complained.

633
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,014
To miss Kubiecki?
No.

634
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,649
To you? No, among themselves.

635
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:42,223
Good. Then it's the business
of the patients' committee

636
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,878
to take it up with Mr. Wictz.

637
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,160
That's what the committee's
for. Anything else?

638
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:46,745
I found out where he keeps it...

639
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,099
in his bureau drawer, under the socks.

640
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,661
Keeps what?
The whiskey.

641
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:50,862
How would you know that?

642
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,064
I looked.

643
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,785
You mean you searched his room?

644
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,430
Of course.

645
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,425
Mrs. O'Brien,

646
00:29:57,497 --> 00:30:00,067
you're a...
Human being

647
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,243
and, as such, you feel
that you're entitled

648
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,272
to a certain privacy, right? Yes.

649
00:30:04,337 --> 00:30:06,737
And you'd resent it if someone
violated that privacy. Yes.

650
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,676
Well, there's some evidence
that Mr. Wictz is human, too.

651
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:10,792
Shall I take it away from him?

652
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,310
Of course not.

653
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:14,548
But he has somebody in
for a nightcap every night.

654
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:15,784
I've got to do something...

655
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,448
see that he gets clean glasses.

656
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:18,577
But, Dr. Mclv...

657
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:19,821
Mrs. O'Brien, 5 months ago,

658
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:21,956
Mr. Wictz wanted
to cut his throat!

659
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:24,792
It's much better for him
to want somebody in

660
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:27,087
for a nightcap, don't you think?

661
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,430
Dr. Wolff's been coaxing
him out of his hole.

662
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,995
Once he sticks his nose out,
we can't bang down on it.

663
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:34,295
It isn't consistent.
You understand?

664
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,097
Yes, doctor.

665
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,735
Good morning, Stevie.

666
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:29,515
It... it wasn't Lois' idea
or Mrs. Jenkins'.

667
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:31,222
It was yours.

668
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,024
Well, what am I supposed to do...

669
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:36,716
get real flattered and be grateful
to you for the rest of my life?

670
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,389
You figure this will get me over
my neurotic inertia or something?

671
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,160
Get out of here!

672
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,928
You know what I think this is?

673
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:46,396
I think this is
a neurotic acting-out on me

674
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,496
as a surrogate figure
for your son.

675
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:51,839
Could be...

676
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,914
How did you know I had a son?

677
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,613
Well, I didn't.
I meant...

678
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:56,975
"Son" in general.

679
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:58,613
Oh.

680
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:00,248
You live alone.

681
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,883
How do you know that?

682
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,317
Well, I've walked by that, uh,

683
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:07,094
garage place where you live.

684
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,423
You divorced, or what happened?

685
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,093
My husband was killed
in a wreck 4 years ago.

686
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,459
So was our son.
I wasn't.

687
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,941
My mother...
Died last year.

688
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:27,113
That's when I fell apart.

689
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,913
Is your father still alive?

690
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,935
I don't know.

691
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,981
I don't know where he is.

692
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,446
He ran out on us
when I was a kid.

693
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:39,246
Did you love him very much?

694
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,489
He was a real louse.

695
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,756
Only I... I shouldn't say that.

696
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:46,955
Why not?

697
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,786
You're not supposed to.

698
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:52,061
My mother did her
loving best to ruin me.

699
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,832
I fooled her,
though. Got over it.

700
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,500
Withstood it, anyway.

701
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:57,669
How?

702
00:33:57,737 --> 00:33:59,667
Got analyzed.

703
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:01,939
Now, I'm perfect.

704
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,147
You mean people...
Get better?

705
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,651
It helps, if you work at it.

706
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,983
Now, beat it. I have to write a memo.

707
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:10,979
About what?

708
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,150
The price of muslin,

709
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,818
if it's any of your business.

710
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:19,288
I don't... Usually
ask questions much.

711
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,396
I'm not... Very interested
in anybody but myself.

712
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:30,198
I don't usually...
Tell people much, either.

713
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,540
You're going to hate
yourself in the morning.

714
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,878
Here.

715
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:43,216
I'm not sure you deserve them.

716
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:04,372
Vicky.

717
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,880
Oh. Uh, Dr. Devanal
is on the phone.

718
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,375
I know. Been trying to get
through for the last 20 minutes.

719
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,048
Who is he gabbing with, anyhow?

720
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,316
Mrs. Mclver.

721
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,513
Can you put these on cloth, Abe?

722
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:45,375
Easy, and silkscreen
them. They look good.

723
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,575
Good.
Let's go ahead.

724
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,077
You feel kind of proud, huh?

725
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,818
A little.
You should.

726
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,693
This boy's at the point where
he needs people he can trust.

727
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:55,293
He likes you, you know.

728
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:56,485
I like him.

729
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:58,416
That's good judgment
on both sides.

730
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:00,161
If we can make
this work, we may be able

731
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:02,026
to show him we're different...

732
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:04,264
good parents.

733
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,630
Oh, could I use
your phone a minute?

734
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,429
Surely.

735
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,945
This is Mclver. Will you
get my home, please?

736
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:37,932
Hello?

737
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:40,597
Sorry. I was in the shower.

738
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,266
Oh, I... I'm sorry,
dear. No, I can't.

739
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,196
I have a date
for cocktails. Why?

740
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,571
Well, um...
Never mind.

741
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,180
The lake will
be there next week.

742
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,582
Uh...

743
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:52,954
Look, Karen,
it's been a long time

744
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,378
since we've had
a chance to talk.

745
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:56,117
How about tonight?

746
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,921
No, I won't.
I'll be home early.

747
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,954
Ok, I'll see you then.

748
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,490
Good-bye.

749
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,421
Excuse me.

750
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,700
Can you tell me
where to take this?

751
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,294
It's material from Petlee's.

752
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,400
Oh, that must be the
canvas for Mr. Irwin.

753
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:44,402
No, it's cotton rep
for miss inch.

754
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,074
Miss inch?
Yeah.

755
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,671
Good night, Mrs. Rinehart.

756
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,673
Oh, good night, doctor.

757
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:52,935
Oh, uh, miss inch's office is
just inside the service entrance.

758
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:54,665
Thank you.

759
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,378
Stevie!
Mrs. Rinehart tells me

760
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,984
your sketches are
splendid, splendid!

761
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,045
Oh, they are, Stevie. I
saw them. They're beautiful.

762
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:05,594
I've never seen her so
enthusiastic about any...

763
00:38:11,824 --> 00:38:13,964
Ah! The Cezanne
of the psychos!

764
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,826
This is your moment!
Make the most of it.

765
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:19,096
You're on the assembly
line of success.

766
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,434
From now on, you'll hover

767
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,400
between exhilaration
and despair.

768
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,268
I pity you.

769
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,266
For a few moments of elation,

770
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,068
a mass of inflamed nerve ends!

771
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,610
I don't think you're
very funny Mr. Capp.

772
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,306
I think you ridicule
other people

773
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:34,708
to hide your own insecurity.

774
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:37,775
I detest myself.

775
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,650
Gibbon
captured it magnificently

776
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,849
in his decline and fall
of the Roman empire,

777
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:44,421
but he missed the
delicious irony to be found

778
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,930
in the pattern of the Caesars.

779
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,791
Now, granted,
Caligula was a beast...

780
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,530
cruel, cunning, and licentious.

781
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:50,795
Nevertheless, it...

782
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,634
Yes? Come in.

783
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm not disturbing you?

784
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:58,468
Oh, Mrs. Rinehart.
No. Come in.

785
00:38:58,538 --> 00:38:59,808
It's nice to have a visitor.

786
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:01,472
It gets lonely here
this time of day.

787
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,951
I'm not keeping you
from your dinner, am I?

788
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:05,445
No, I was just having
a Sherry before I go in.

789
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,481
Always do.
Have one with me?

790
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:09,647
Why, thank you.
I'd love one.

791
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,215
You don't eat here
at night, do you?

792
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:13,224
No.

793
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:15,145
Where do you eat?

794
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,320
Oh... In town, usually.

795
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,319
Mmm, expensive.

796
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,231
Oh, isn't everything these days?

797
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:23,634
I... I understand your new drapes

798
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,296
for the library are
costing a fortune.

799
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:27,504
270 plus.

800
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:29,997
The entire expense
is unnecessary.

801
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,339
It's a crime!

802
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,543
Have you begun on them?

803
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:33,865
Yes. Why?

804
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,839
Because, if you hadn't,
I think I know

805
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:38,038
how we can reduce
the crime to a misdemeanor.

806
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,110
But you've already begun.

807
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:41,809
Sue.

808
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,018
Sue.

809
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,023
You wouldn't...

810
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:46,854
I mean, um...

811
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:48,849
Would you like to go downtown with me

812
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:51,061
to the movies tonight, to celebrate?

813
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:52,123
No!

814
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:53,231
Oh!

815
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:54,632
I'll get that for you, my dear.

816
00:39:54,694 --> 00:39:57,264
A little water. That's
very easily mopped up.

817
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:07,705
Stevie?

818
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,983
Stevie, wait a minute.

819
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:18,048
I want to tell you something.

820
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,722
I'm ashamed of it.

821
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,886
Oh, I wanted to go.

822
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:29,629
Nobody ever asked me before...

823
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:34,531
But I just can't.

824
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,243
Why not?

825
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,249
I'm phobic.

826
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:49,721
I haven't been off grounds
since I came, not once.

827
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,990
It's what's wrong with me.

828
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:59,091
What would happen if you did?

829
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:02,158
I mean, I-like going
downtown to the movies?

830
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,668
Start screaming or something?

831
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,443
Well, they'd think you
were a critic, that's all.

832
00:41:14,173 --> 00:41:16,113
Well...

833
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:19,035
I'd like to try,
though. I mean, well...

834
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:21,111
Maybe if you went with me
and knew about it,

835
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,580
it would be all right...
If you took care of me.

836
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,450
All right.
Let's go, then.

837
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,618
Oh, no.
I... I didn't mean now.

838
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:31,288
I just meant sometime.
Well...

839
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,626
I couldn't go suddenly.

840
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,970
Ok.

841
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:41,832
Sometime.

842
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,135
The muslin... cartoons?

843
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:54,481
Well... muslin cartoons?

844
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,976
Mrs. Rinehart, just
what are you up to?

845
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:58,979
I'm not up to anything,
miss inch.

846
00:41:59,051 --> 00:42:01,051
I... I talked this over
with Dr. Mclver today,

847
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,430
and he feels that
from a therapeutic...

848
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:04,064
so that's why you're here...

849
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:06,633
so that woman can have her way!

850
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:07,992
What woman?

851
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,290
You cat's-paw!

852
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,961
Miss inch, I came here
to ask your cooperation.

853
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,171
And I thought you
came here to talk to me.

854
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:16,143
Muslin cartoons, indeed!

855
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,341
I never heard of such
taradiddle in all my life!

856
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:19,613
I haven't the faintest notion...

857
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:21,512
you tell your
Dr. Mclver you saw me

858
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:23,013
and I said you've gone too far!

859
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:24,475
And tell him to keep his loose,

860
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,683
busybody wife's nose
out of my affairs!

861
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,484
Oh, I'm sorry.

862
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,020
I seem to be coming to you
with all my problems today.

863
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,160
Marriage is a funny
business, Karen.

864
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:42,033
You can starve for something
you don't get in it.

865
00:42:42,094 --> 00:42:46,034
Oh, it's a great institution
but, like all institutions,

866
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:50,668
something of the
individual gets lost in it,

867
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,006
so... Either we starve

868
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:55,812
or we look for it outside.

869
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,605
Dev, I... I'm not
complaining. It...

870
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:00,878
It's just that... well,
in the beginning,

871
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,246
when... When we lived in Chicago,

872
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:05,375
there was Stewart's
career, of course,

873
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,050
but it was exciting then.
We... we had a life together.

874
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,620
We seemed to bring
something to each other.

875
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,020
And now?

876
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,061
I'm not really selfish, Dev.

877
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:16,026
He wanted to come out
here and I didn't,

878
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,725
but I came, and now
gradually it's changed.

879
00:43:18,798 --> 00:43:21,028
He's become so absorbed,
so... so unapproachable.

880
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,170
He has work to express
himself in. I don't.

881
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:26,636
I have nothing, and when
I do try to find something

882
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:29,406
to bring me closer to him, he...

883
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,414
I need...

884
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:33,806
I don't know what I need.

885
00:43:45,024 --> 00:43:46,034
Hello.

886
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,991
Hello.

887
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,200
Found your message at home.

888
00:43:50,262 --> 00:43:51,732
Sounded urgent.

889
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,197
I didn't mean to drag you out.

890
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,935
Oh, it's all right. It's
on the way. What's up?

891
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,497
I'm afraid I made
a mistake... a bad one.

892
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,669
Some material came from
Petlee's for Vicky inch.

893
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:03,079
I... I tried to get hold of you
and then I went in to see her.

894
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:05,042
She took the top of my head off.

895
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,110
She did?

896
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:06,975
Mmm...

897
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:08,706
Heh heh! Well, I'll talk to her

898
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:10,021
in the morning.
Forget it.

899
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:11,432
I think I'd better
brief you a little:

900
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,890
I'm a cat's-paw.

901
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:14,622
You're using me to further some

902
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:17,016
sinister scheme
of Mrs. Mclver's.

903
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:18,019
Karen?

904
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,790
Tell Dr. Mclver

905
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,900
to keep his wife out
of my affairs. Unquote.

906
00:44:22,962 --> 00:44:24,732
More or less, minus adjectives.

907
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:26,527
Now, what does that mean?

908
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:29,108
I don't know. She wouldn't discuss
it further, stomped out on me.

909
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,874
Hmm. Maybe I better
call her from here.

910
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,537
May I?
Oh, of course.

911
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:36,335
Here... can I help you
with that? No, I can manage.

912
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:39,239
Oh, I'm sorry.
The bulb's out.

913
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:40,951
That's all right.

914
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:44,721
Wonder who put that
bat in her belfry?

915
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:45,894
Vicky?
Yeah.

916
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,691
Thought I should ask you.

917
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:49,723
What... you mean you think I am?

918
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:51,319
Using me?
Yeah.

919
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,790
No.

920
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,456
Here... I'll help you.

921
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,940
I'm afraid the place
is in a shambles.

922
00:45:04,003 --> 00:45:06,273
No, that's all right.
Don't worry about it.

923
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,849
I'm really a better
housekeeper than this.

924
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:13,912
Looks fine.

925
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:15,179
Give me a week.

926
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:16,117
Where's the phone?

927
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:17,521
Oh, it's on the floor there.

928
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:19,222
Thank you.

929
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:46,976
Oh, hello, Vicky. This is
Dr. Mclver. How are you?

930
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,476
Good. Uh, look...
I, uh,

931
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:53,289
I want to unmix this
mix-up about the drapes.

932
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:56,986
No, no, no.
W- wai-wait a minute.

933
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:59,516
Karen called you?

934
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,491
Well, what's Karen got...

935
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,830
well, yes, of course, I'll ask
her, but I still don't know...

936
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:06,497
hello, Vicky?

937
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:08,665
Vi...

938
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:11,143
well, there's one thing you
can't take away from Vicky inch...

939
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:13,013
she does have her foibles,

940
00:46:13,072 --> 00:46:15,272
and several other people's, too.

941
00:46:16,508 --> 00:46:17,878
Oh.

942
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:20,683
You said something
last night about privacy.

943
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:24,215
Snooping is one of the
prerogatives of all medical men.

944
00:46:24,283 --> 00:46:25,483
But not nurses?

945
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,690
Mrs. O'Brien?

946
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:27,891
She's not a nurse.

947
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,093
She's a policewoman in disguise.

948
00:46:32,992 --> 00:46:35,132
She'll learn.

949
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:39,061
That's a nice-looking
chair. You make it?

950
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:40,001
Yes.

951
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:42,395
Uh... Think I could trust it?

952
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,897
Stronger than you are.

953
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:46,239
Well, I should hope so. Heh heh.

954
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:49,566
What about Mr Wictz?

955
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,681
What if his drinking does
annoy the other patients?

956
00:46:52,744 --> 00:46:55,884
Simple. Let the patient
committee call him on it.

957
00:46:55,948 --> 00:46:57,418
Well, can he take it?

958
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,722
The patients?
Sure.

959
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:02,824
Well, he better. He can't
keep people up all night.

960
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:04,758
He's not Scheherazade.

961
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:07,093
Oh.

962
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,359
One thing I've learned
since I've been here...

963
00:47:09,428 --> 00:47:11,598
a sense of humor's
indispensable.

964
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:12,973
Ah, it sure is.

965
00:47:13,032 --> 00:47:14,432
You're in on so much suffering,

966
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,369
so much goes wrong all
day, you begin to fray.

967
00:47:17,436 --> 00:47:19,596
Then you don't have
anything left to give them.

968
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:20,911
And they need so much more.

969
00:47:20,973 --> 00:47:23,113
Sure, they're starving.

970
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:25,235
Here.

971
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:28,982
Now, that's a good-looking case.

972
00:47:29,048 --> 00:47:30,278
You make that, too?

973
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,279
No. My husband.

974
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,991
Oh, I'm sorry.

975
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,560
But, in a...
Kind of magic way,

976
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:40,762
somebody always comes up with something.

977
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,785
Like these, uh...

978
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:44,801
Like these drapes of yours.

979
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,333
I haven't seen Stevie so eager

980
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:48,728
about anything
since he got here.

981
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,640
I owe you something.

982
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,042
That was Sue's idea.

983
00:47:52,104 --> 00:47:53,974
Mm-hmm.
I just made it contagious.

984
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,439
I thought it was very
skillfully handled.

985
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:58,908
I thought so myself,
until I was under your eye.

986
00:47:58,978 --> 00:48:00,978
Then I got uncomfortable.

987
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,976
Tell me... how would you
have done it?

988
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,318
Well, I don't know.
There aren't any rules.

989
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:08,954
If your heart's in the
right place and your brain,

990
00:48:09,021 --> 00:48:10,961
you just trust
what comes to you.

991
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:13,833
You think mine is?
Are?

992
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,092
Heh heh heh!
You work here

993
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,800
a few months more,
I'll let you know.

994
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,331
Oh.

995
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,007
Hey, you're right. This
thing is comfortable.

996
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:21,472
Certainly, it's comfortable.

997
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:24,343
So why don't I just
sit here instead?

998
00:48:24,403 --> 00:48:25,403
Instead of what?

999
00:48:25,437 --> 00:48:27,037
Instead of going out
into the night

1000
00:48:27,106 --> 00:48:29,406
to do battle with Vicky inch.

1001
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:33,976
Yes, sir. This is going
to be a friendly place.

1002
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:36,146
Mmm, in another week or two.

1003
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:38,515
It's friendly now.

1004
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,993
Throw me out.

1005
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:41,592
All right. Get out.

1006
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:42,993
Thank you.

1007
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:44,185
Let me know who wins.

1008
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:46,526
Yeah, sure. I will.
Good night.

1009
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,991
Good night.

1010
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:34,014
Who's there?

1011
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:35,813
It's Dr. Mclver.

1012
00:49:35,874 --> 00:49:37,014
What do you want?

1013
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:39,676
I want to talk to you. Open up.

1014
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:43,476
I've retired! I'll talk
to you in the morning!

1015
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:46,688
Vicky, this is forcible
entry. Open the door.

1016
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,221
Wait a minute.

1017
00:49:59,398 --> 00:50:01,098
Dr. Mclver, I must
ask you to go.

1018
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,896
I hope you realize
you're breaking the law.

1019
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,607
This house and the ground
it stands on is my property.

1020
00:50:04,636 --> 00:50:06,006
I've asked you to leave
and you're trespassing...

1021
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:08,667
Vicky, stop drooling
and sit down.

1022
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,680
Sit down!

1023
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:14,654
And shut up!

1024
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,877
Now, first of all,
don't ever hang up on me

1025
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,379
like that again, Vicky.

1026
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:21,201
And if you do, I'll pull
your dress over your head

1027
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,020
and beat some manners into you.

1028
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:24,618
You wouldn't dare!

1029
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,489
Dare me.

1030
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:31,357
What's that for?

1031
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,170
Dr. Mclver, I have neighbors.

1032
00:50:33,232 --> 00:50:35,082
What will they think, with
me not properly dressed?

1033
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,100
You're dressed, all right.

1034
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:37,738
I am not.

1035
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:40,312
Then you want your neighbors
to see that you're not?

1036
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,910
Dr. Mclver!

1037
00:50:42,974 --> 00:50:44,044
I'd like an ashtray, Vicky.

1038
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:45,039
I don't smoke!

1039
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,050
Then get me a saucer,

1040
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:49,252
or don't you eat?

1041
00:50:51,183 --> 00:50:52,553
Thank you.

1042
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:55,087
Now, just what...
sit down, sit down.

1043
00:50:55,154 --> 00:50:57,364
Just what is all this
nonsense about Karen?

1044
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,962
I find it very peculiar...

1045
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,093
I don't care what you find it!

1046
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,230
And incidentally,
this act of yours...

1047
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,995
going around,
frightening people...

1048
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,733
I've seen it tried too often.

1049
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:10,138
I know it frightens you more
than anybody else, so cut it out.

1050
00:51:10,202 --> 00:51:12,142
Our job running the clinic
is tough enough

1051
00:51:12,204 --> 00:51:14,914
without fancy dramatics.

1052
00:51:14,973 --> 00:51:16,413
Now, when did Karen call you?

1053
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:18,405
Last night.
What about?

1054
00:51:19,711 --> 00:51:20,911
Swatches!

1055
00:51:20,979 --> 00:51:22,549
What I'm to do,
what she's to do,

1056
00:51:22,614 --> 00:51:24,424
what Regina Mitchell-Smythe
is going to do

1057
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:27,093
about drapes for the library!

1058
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:29,252
I see.

1059
00:51:29,321 --> 00:51:30,591
Well, I'm, uh,

1060
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:33,285
I'm sorry this got
so tangled up, Vicky,

1061
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:35,558
but the decision on
Mrs. Rinehart's project

1062
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:38,097
is one of therapeutic
policy. It stands.

1063
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:40,433
The patients make the drapes.

1064
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,440
They'll be very peculiar.

1065
00:51:43,502 --> 00:51:45,102
It's a matter of taste,
on which you are

1066
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,970
in no way the final arbiter.

1067
00:51:47,038 --> 00:51:48,768
Who's to explain
to the trustees?

1068
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,280
I'm running the clinic,
Vicky, not the trustees.

1069
00:51:51,343 --> 00:51:52,613
I was under the impression

1070
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:55,277
that Dr. Devanal is
running the clinic!

1071
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:00,119
Didn't you ever
read my contract?

1072
00:52:00,185 --> 00:52:01,185
No.

1073
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:03,623
How'd you miss that?

1074
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:06,488
Dev keeps it locked in his desk.

1075
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:07,858
Oh.

1076
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:10,156
Well, Mrs. Rinehart will
be ordering a few things,

1077
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:13,499
so whatever she needs,
you take care of it.

1078
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:15,095
Uh...

1079
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,966
This your father?

1080
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:18,295
Yes.

1081
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,340
Formidable gent.

1082
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:23,275
He fought the Indians to
settle this territory.

1083
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,139
Oh.

1084
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:27,311
Well, good night, Vicky.

1085
00:52:27,379 --> 00:52:29,649
Uh, would you...

1086
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:32,854
Could I get you
a cup of tea or something?

1087
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:33,987
No, thanks, Vicky.

1088
00:52:34,052 --> 00:52:35,852
Dr. Mclver!

1089
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,490
I... Do you think we could...

1090
00:52:38,557 --> 00:52:41,157
Get along better together?

1091
00:52:41,226 --> 00:52:42,326
Why, sure, Vicky.

1092
00:52:42,394 --> 00:52:44,334
My terms are simple...

1093
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:46,826
unconditional surrender.

1094
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:48,828
Good night.

1095
00:53:07,786 --> 00:53:09,416
Well!

1096
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,120
Karen?

1097
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:14,361
Mom? Come on and watch me

1098
00:53:14,426 --> 00:53:16,226
beat the tar out
of your husband.

1099
00:53:16,295 --> 00:53:18,455
I think I'll go up, mark.
Good night.

1100
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,200
Karen,

1101
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:21,525
I thought we had a date.

1102
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,340
I got stuck at the office.

1103
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:42,215
I've been waiting
3 hours, Karen.

1104
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:43,587
I'd like to talk to you.

1105
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:46,255
I'd rather not now.
I have a bad headache.

1106
00:53:46,325 --> 00:53:48,255
Well, then, what were you
drinking for?

1107
00:53:48,327 --> 00:53:50,527
You know alcohol
dilates the capillaries.

1108
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,925
Oh, go write a book
if you know so much.

1109
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:57,238
Well, there's one thing
I didn't know so much about!

1110
00:54:04,142 --> 00:54:05,582
Karen.

1111
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:08,054
What are you quarreling
with me about?

1112
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,912
What?

1113
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:12,781
I said what
are you quarreling with...

1114
00:54:13,952 --> 00:54:15,752
what are you quarreling
with me about?

1115
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,020
I'm not quarreling!

1116
00:54:34,172 --> 00:54:36,442
Why didn't you tell me
about these drapes of yours?

1117
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:38,308
Seems odd I have to hear
about it from other...

1118
00:54:38,377 --> 00:54:39,537
when?

1119
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:40,611
What?

1120
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:42,149
When should I have told you?

1121
00:54:42,213 --> 00:54:44,123
Well, anytime.
What do you mean "when"?

1122
00:54:44,182 --> 00:54:47,122
Last night at the concert,
perhaps, during the intermission?

1123
00:54:47,185 --> 00:54:48,515
Oh, Karen.

1124
00:54:48,587 --> 00:54:50,587
I tried to. When are you
ever in long enough?

1125
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:52,255
I even telephoned this evening.

1126
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:53,463
Sadie said you weren't home.

1127
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:55,085
I thought we had a date!

1128
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:57,959
I was at Vicky's, trying to
straighten out this tangle!

1129
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:59,959
Before you know it,
we'll have so many drapes

1130
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:02,201
around here, we can wrap
the clinic up in them.

1131
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:04,666
I straightened it out with Dev.

1132
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:08,638
Dev?

1133
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:10,507
Is that who you had dinner with?

1134
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:11,905
Yes. Isn't that allowed?

1135
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,246
Karen, you didn't go
to Dev to sweet-talk him

1136
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,522
into these drapes, too, did you?

1137
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:18,381
Did you talk about them?

1138
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,180
Among other things.

1139
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:21,991
Listen, I want
to tell you something.

1140
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:24,793
Don't you ever again
go over my head to Dev

1141
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:26,486
about anything to do
with this clinic!

1142
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:28,228
Do you understand?

1143
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,832
Meg Rinehart has a project on

1144
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,164
for the patients to make
drapes of their own.

1145
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,470
It's going to be tough enough

1146
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:34,912
without any additional
monkey business,

1147
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:36,333
least of all with Dev.

1148
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:38,641
Has it never occurred to you
that I might be interested

1149
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:40,343
in talking to Dev
with no purpose

1150
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:42,235
except to talk with
another human being?

1151
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:43,636
Ha ha!

1152
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,678
We discussed a great
deal besides the clinic.

1153
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:47,214
Yes, you must have.
What else did you

1154
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:49,008
talk to him about for 4 hours?

1155
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,180
As a matter of fact,
I talked about you.

1156
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,690
Oh, I see.

1157
00:55:54,753 --> 00:55:58,163
You've been encouraging Dev
by weeping on his shoulder.

1158
00:55:58,222 --> 00:55:59,362
I don't weep.

1159
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:00,584
You don't know what's going on

1160
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:01,955
inside that man.
Leave him alone.

1161
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,796
Huh! Don't I?
When did you last have

1162
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:05,562
a heart-to-heart talk with Dev?

1163
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,500
Is that what you think you had?

1164
00:56:07,566 --> 00:56:10,026
I hate to break into
your little dream, Karen,

1165
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:13,671
but you're not exactly a unique
event in Dr. Devanal's life.

1166
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:15,838
It happens with
every woman he meets,

1167
00:56:15,907 --> 00:56:17,837
including his secretary and...

1168
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:20,509
will you stop knowing
everything about everything?!

1169
00:56:22,981 --> 00:56:24,751
Rosie's asleep.

1170
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:27,046
Don't turn into an
attentive father suddenly.

1171
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,438
Now, what does that mean... that
I'm neglecting the kids, too?

1172
00:56:29,488 --> 00:56:31,268
Yes, the only ones who
get anything real from you

1173
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:33,729
are those professional
children out at the clinic.

1174
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,462
Yesterday in school,
they asked Rosie

1175
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:37,057
what she wanted to be
when she grew up.

1176
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:39,428
Would you like to know
what she answered?

1177
00:56:39,498 --> 00:56:41,568
A patient!

1178
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:16,596
People...

1179
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:18,938
Fight sometimes, mark.

1180
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,122
Good night.

1181
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:41,831
Good night.

1182
00:58:05,617 --> 00:58:08,747
As it happens, when this "monkey
business"... as you call it...

1183
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,090
about the drapes first
occurred to me yesterday,

1184
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:13,285
I stopped by your
office to tell you.

1185
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:14,927
I tried to tell you last night.

1186
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:16,463
I thought you'd be pleased.

1187
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:17,997
Now I'm sick of the whole thing.

1188
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:20,232
I don't care
if they never go up!

1189
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:24,299
I'd be home more, Karen...

1190
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:27,338
If there were more
to come home to.

1191
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:29,265
What, for instance?

1192
00:58:30,308 --> 00:58:32,038
A real woman.

1193
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,850
You don't make me
feel like a woman.

1194
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:37,353
What do you think I've been
trying to tell you for months?

1195
00:58:37,415 --> 00:58:40,115
I am a woman. I want
to be one, but I...

1196
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:43,024
I have to feel I...
I'm desired!

1197
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:46,017
Everyone thinks
you're desirable.

1198
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,960
Do you?

1199
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:49,656
Do you?!

1200
00:59:06,645 --> 00:59:08,605
No, you think you're
going to win this game,

1201
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,510
but you're not!
Hooray!

1202
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:11,581
Ha ha ha!

1203
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,480
Hooray!

1204
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,871
Has he or has he not
the authority

1205
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:15,849
to let the patients make
their own drapes?

1206
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,190
The patients do what?

1207
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:18,685
Library drapes, from start to finish.

1208
00:59:18,757 --> 00:59:20,317
Well, that's...

1209
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,041
didn't you know? Don't you
have to ok things like this?

1210
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,060
Well, uh...

1211
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:24,374
Aren't you administrative head anymore?

1212
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:25,595
What?

1213
00:59:25,664 --> 00:59:27,204
Why haven't I seen
Mclver's contract?

1214
00:59:27,265 --> 00:59:28,195
You never asked me.

1215
00:59:28,266 --> 00:59:29,896
I'm asking you now!

1216
00:59:29,968 --> 00:59:31,178
Vicky, I'd only be too glad
to have you look at this thing.

1217
00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:32,702
It's in the bottom
right-hand drawer.

1218
00:59:32,771 --> 00:59:34,041
No, it's not!

1219
00:59:34,105 --> 00:59:35,905
Unlock it, and let's
have a look!

1220
00:59:35,974 --> 00:59:39,184
We'll have to continue this
another time. I have a patient.

1221
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,053
Oh, uh, Cobby, send Mr. Capp
in... The minute he arrives.

1222
00:59:42,113 --> 00:59:44,223
Now, just a minute.
I want to dictate a letter.

1223
00:59:44,282 --> 00:59:45,822
I'll get my book.

1224
00:59:45,884 --> 00:59:49,054
No, no, never mind.
Here. Use this.

1225
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,260
Now, Vicky, you'll have to excuse me.

1226
00:59:56,494 --> 00:59:58,004
Get out.

1227
00:59:58,496 --> 00:59:59,496
Pardon?

1228
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:01,033
I said, "get out!"

1229
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:03,866
All right.

1230
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:11,914
Now, look here, Vicky!

1231
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,106
I'm good and sick
of your high-hand!

1232
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:16,448
What do you think you are
around here, the queen bee?

1233
01:00:16,514 --> 01:00:18,124
You're just another employee.

1234
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:19,982
Then fire me!

1235
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:26,658
Well, am I fired?

1236
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:29,429
Of course you're not fired.

1237
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:31,133
Don't be ridiculous.

1238
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:32,455
Because you can't.

1239
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,500
You gave that up,
too, didn't you?

1240
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:36,936
Didn't you?

1241
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:38,571
That's why you didn't want me to read

1242
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,236
Mclver's contract, isn't it?

1243
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:41,944
Isn't it?

1244
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:53,379
Why didn't you tell me?

1245
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:57,659
I haven't even told Edna.

1246
01:00:57,722 --> 01:01:00,262
I have some pride left, Vicky.

1247
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:04,263
You let me fight your battles,

1248
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,958
when you knew I could be fired for it.

1249
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:09,330
Now, look here, Vicky.

1250
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,540
We've been working
together for 20 years.

1251
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:15,943
Friends are supposed to be
able to lean on each other.

1252
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:19,277
A man should stand
on his own two feet.

1253
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:22,213
I've been standing on mine for 48 years.

1254
01:01:25,283 --> 01:01:28,393
It's time someone around
here began holding me up

1255
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,322
once in a while.

1256
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:32,418
You think Mclver will?

1257
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:36,690
Just last night, his
own wife was standing...

1258
01:01:36,761 --> 01:01:38,901
I remember Sanford Collins in here.

1259
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:41,103
It was always a beautiful, big room.

1260
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:44,336
It's a sad sight.

1261
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:47,006
What is?

1262
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:50,341
Seeing such a small man in it.

1263
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:09,028
Oh, Mr. Capp...

1264
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,563
Do you mind waiting
for me a few minutes?

1265
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:13,099
Thank you.
Cobby...

1266
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:15,998
Uh, what's my schedule
this afternoon?

1267
01:02:16,067 --> 01:02:18,897
Never mind. Clear me up
for the rest of the day.

1268
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:21,440
I can't work anymore.
I'm due out.

1269
01:02:54,973 --> 01:02:57,283
Petlee? Inch.

1270
01:02:57,341 --> 01:03:00,481
Fine. Jim, this cotton rep...

1271
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:02,314
I find it's not satis...

1272
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,050
you better have Albert
come and take it back.

1273
01:03:35,914 --> 01:03:39,184
Uh, Cobby, take a memo
for me, please.

1274
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:46,985
From the office of
the medical director...

1275
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:50,562
To general distribution.

1276
01:03:50,628 --> 01:03:53,558
Library drapes.

1277
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,466
It is my decision,

1278
01:03:57,535 --> 01:04:02,035
based on careful examination
of the elements involved,

1279
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:04,506
and taking into consideration
the expressed wishes

1280
01:04:04,575 --> 01:04:06,835
of the chairman of
the board of trustees...

1281
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,449
Sadie!

1282
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:14,221
Mclver?

1283
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:15,315
Yes.

1284
01:04:15,386 --> 01:04:17,586
Air express for
Mrs. Stewart Mclver.

1285
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:25,501
You're welcome.

1286
01:04:37,942 --> 01:04:39,412
Sadie!

1287
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:45,577
I'm not too early?

1288
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,289
It's all right, Sadie.

1289
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:48,991
Come in here.

1290
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:52,588
We did have a date
for lunch, didn't we?

1291
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:54,586
Did we? I don't remember.

1292
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,628
Oh! Karen, I'm sorry.

1293
01:04:56,694 --> 01:04:58,234
Well, as long as I'm here,

1294
01:04:58,296 --> 01:05:00,096
why don't we drive out
to the lake for lunch?

1295
01:05:00,164 --> 01:05:01,644
I can't, Dev. I'm not dressed. I have...

1296
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:03,195
take your time, Princess,

1297
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:05,397
there is nothing I can't
cancel this afternoon.

1298
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:08,109
Oh, Dev, would you
care for a drink?

1299
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:10,042
Sure, I'd love one.

1300
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,989
I loved last night, Karen.

1301
01:05:24,055 --> 01:05:30,055
You know... After you left, I got
to thinking about something you said.

1302
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:33,462
How we all go around...

1303
01:05:33,531 --> 01:05:37,001
Each of us shut up
inside himself.

1304
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:38,868
Oh, it's nobody's fault.

1305
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:41,506
It's just the way it goes.

1306
01:05:41,572 --> 01:05:46,112
Here we are... Both...
Searching for something,

1307
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:48,677
hoping for something.

1308
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:52,124
Well...

1309
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:54,847
I thought...

1310
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:56,518
What did you think, Dev?

1311
01:05:56,587 --> 01:05:58,517
That just because of a
few drinks and a steak

1312
01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:00,369
and your help with those
ridiculous drapes that...

1313
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,291
Karen!

1314
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,030
You make it sound so... so sordid.

1315
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:07,704
Isn't it?

1316
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,370
Well... Last night, it
seemed to me that we...

1317
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:17,035
I really thought we...

1318
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,639
What happened, Karen?

1319
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:23,552
What happened with everybody?

1320
01:06:23,614 --> 01:06:25,954
Mark and Rosie will be
home from school any minute.

1321
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:28,146
I wish you'd leave.

1322
01:06:35,493 --> 01:06:37,103
Dev, I...

1323
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:42,171
I'm sorry. I... I know
I led you into this.

1324
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:47,536
Wipe your face, Dev.

1325
01:07:06,524 --> 01:07:08,334
Got a cigarette?

1326
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,300
May I visit, or am I rupturing

1327
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:13,532
the delicate bud of creation?

1328
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:17,596
Is that Genesis or synthesis?

1329
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:19,398
It isn't finished.

1330
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:21,910
You can see the others
in the barn.

1331
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:23,412
Ah, incompleteness.

1332
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:25,414
That's the only
triumph worthwhile.

1333
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:28,676
With a finished work, you subject
yourself to public scrutiny,

1334
01:07:28,746 --> 01:07:33,376
praise, ridicule, and all the other
vulgarities that go with accomplishment.

1335
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,251
That's why I congratulate you.

1336
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:38,459
You've just been relieved
of a major responsibility.

1337
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,692
Once again, talent is rejected.

1338
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:42,828
The itsy-bitsiest triumph,

1339
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:45,963
with that memo from Dr.
Devanal canceling your drapes.

1340
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:48,429
What?

1341
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:50,029
What?

1342
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,640
Didn't you know?

1343
01:07:51,702 --> 01:07:52,942
Where is it?

1344
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:54,383
Holcomb's got it
in the barber shop.

1345
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:56,605
I'm sorry, I thought everybody...

1346
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:05,554
where's that memo?

1347
01:08:05,616 --> 01:08:07,056
Stevie, please, don't be
worried about that memo.

1348
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,654
Everything's going
to be all right.

1349
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:09,719
Gentlemen, please!

1350
01:08:09,787 --> 01:08:11,017
You can't have that!

1351
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:12,618
Please, Stevie!
You must read...

1352
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:15,990
"I waited for her, and
when I went to her... "

1353
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:17,529
Stevie!

1354
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:44,761
Stevie!

1355
01:08:44,822 --> 01:08:46,262
I'm taking my drawings.

1356
01:08:46,324 --> 01:08:48,234
They're not your drawings.

1357
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,559
They belong to us.

1358
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:53,228
Are you the only one who
has put any love into this?

1359
01:08:55,233 --> 01:08:57,173
Get out of the way!

1360
01:08:57,235 --> 01:08:59,495
Get out of the way!

1361
01:09:00,938 --> 01:09:03,868
I'd like to use your office
a minute, Mrs. Rinehart.

1362
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:07,706
Come on, Stevie.

1363
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,412
It's the first
I've heard of this.

1364
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:47,446
But you don't want
an explanation.

1365
01:09:47,518 --> 01:09:49,718
You want to believe the worst.

1366
01:09:55,293 --> 01:09:57,563
Dr. Devanal there, miss Cobb?

1367
01:09:57,628 --> 01:09:59,798
Well, where is he?
I want to talk to him.

1368
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:02,804
Any place you think he might be?

1369
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:06,471
Yes, yes, there is a message,
and take it down,

1370
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:08,967
I want him to get this verbatim.

1371
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,639
Dear Dev, I think
there's a misunderstanding

1372
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,650
on the subject of these drapes.

1373
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:17,452
There's more at stake
here than the wishes

1374
01:10:17,515 --> 01:10:19,915
of the chairman of
the board of trustees.

1375
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,923
Meanwhile, the patient's
committee will go ahead

1376
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:24,145
with the drapes which it
already has in work. Mclver.

1377
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,791
And have him call me
soon as he gets back.

1378
01:10:28,726 --> 01:10:29,756
Big man.

1379
01:10:29,827 --> 01:10:31,757
Not so big.

1380
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:39,343
Are you going to send me
away to a closed hospital?

1381
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:41,613
Depends entirely on you.

1382
01:10:41,672 --> 01:10:44,412
Start knocking people down,
we can't keep you here.

1383
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:46,575
Is that what you're working for?

1384
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:50,151
Oh, what's the difference?

1385
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:52,823
I'm just so tired of being sick.

1386
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:56,891
An hour ago I...
Don't laugh...

1387
01:10:56,954 --> 01:10:59,864
I thought I was well
enough to get out of here.

1388
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:03,191
It's like trying to get
out of a greased well.

1389
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:06,430
Not quite. Remember how you
were when you first got here?

1390
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:14,135
That was closer to bottom.

1391
01:11:14,204 --> 01:11:16,344
What do you think?

1392
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:19,084
I don't know.

1393
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:22,511
You can't help me.

1394
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,650
You may be right, you may not.

1395
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:26,245
But when something
like this happens,

1396
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:28,116
if you can't hang on
for 5 minutes,

1397
01:11:28,185 --> 01:11:29,815
you're never going to find out.

1398
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:31,817
I'm free at 2:00, ok?

1399
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:35,131
Let's get going on these drapes

1400
01:11:35,192 --> 01:11:36,532
before someone else horns in.

1401
01:11:36,594 --> 01:11:38,104
I'll talk to Devanal.

1402
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:39,461
Abe's coming over tonight.

1403
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,010
He's going to test it
on the silkscreen.

1404
01:11:41,031 --> 01:11:42,501
Good. Let me know.

1405
01:12:10,628 --> 01:12:13,828
Mr. Holcomb...
I'm sorry.

1406
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:39,415
Stevie?

1407
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,960
I made it myself.

1408
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,364
Uh, Stevie, I was thinking
about what you said,

1409
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:45,027
I mean, about going
to the movies in town,

1410
01:12:45,095 --> 01:12:47,495
and I think I could now if
you still wanted to take me.

1411
01:12:47,565 --> 01:12:49,565
Well, you don't have to
say anything right now.

1412
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,643
You can think about it.

1413
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,255
Oh, I'm glad you came, Cobby.

1414
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:24,330
Cobby, my dear... But first, I'm
going to get you a little drink.

1415
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:26,341
I don't want a drink.

1416
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,513
Listen, I shouldn't
have come here.

1417
01:13:27,538 --> 01:13:28,648
Why, if anybody saw me here...

1418
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:30,312
of course, you want a drink.

1419
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,413
Wake you up.

1420
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:35,076
Get the memo out all right?

1421
01:13:35,145 --> 01:13:36,645
Good!

1422
01:13:37,515 --> 01:13:39,775
We're going to fight, Cobby.

1423
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:43,250
Know that? We've got
our backs to the wall.

1424
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,720
You have, maybe, but I don't.

1425
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:46,518
Do you really want me
to work, or not?

1426
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,870
You said you had
some work to do.

1427
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:49,691
What if somebody
saw me come out here?

1428
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,430
Cobby, you're all I've
got left. You know that.

1429
01:13:53,497 --> 01:13:55,897
All I've got left.
You're important to me.

1430
01:13:55,966 --> 01:13:59,396
Sure... to answer the phone
when Mrs. Mclver calls.

1431
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:00,899
Listen, everybody's
been calling me

1432
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:02,511
wanting to know where you are.

1433
01:14:02,573 --> 01:14:03,753
How much longer can you hide out here?

1434
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:05,784
Who is hiding? Heh heh!

1435
01:14:05,843 --> 01:14:08,213
Still got a drink or two
up my sleeve. Heh.

1436
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:12,479
What I said 4 years ago to Regina...

1437
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:15,950
I... I... I said,
"all right, Regina.

1438
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:19,459
Bring in this Mclver
whoever-he-is if you want to. "

1439
01:14:21,358 --> 01:14:25,158
"I am perfectly willing to
take a back seat for a while. "

1440
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:26,498
The phone's ringing.

1441
01:14:26,564 --> 01:14:28,374
Do you want me to answer it, or what?

1442
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:31,571
Huh? Oh!
But of course.

1443
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:36,940
Hello.
Hello, Regina. Dev.

1444
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:39,807
Regina, there's
an emergency here.

1445
01:14:39,877 --> 01:14:43,277
I want you to fly down
tomorrow before the others.

1446
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,476
It's important.

1447
01:14:44,548 --> 01:14:49,018
Yes... what?
Oh, just a moment.

1448
01:15:02,099 --> 01:15:03,899
Now then, operator.

1449
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:07,707
What... she's not?
Why not?

1450
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:11,241
Well...
Keep trying, operator.

1451
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,610
Cobby, get me
Vicky on the phone.

1452
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,349
I want to talk to Vicky.

1453
01:15:17,414 --> 01:15:19,054
Get her yourself.

1454
01:15:20,918 --> 01:15:22,648
Oh...

1455
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,757
That's all you got me
out here for.

1456
01:15:26,824 --> 01:15:29,164
It's the craziest thing
I ever got into.

1457
01:15:29,226 --> 01:15:30,256
Shhh!

1458
01:15:30,327 --> 01:15:32,997
Hello? Hello, Vicky.

1459
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:36,834
Of course it is.
Who did you think it was?

1460
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,770
I... oh, fine.
I'm fine.

1461
01:15:40,838 --> 01:15:43,708
Standing on my own two feet.

1462
01:15:43,774 --> 01:15:46,114
Vicky, we're going to fight.

1463
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:48,506
This is the showdown.

1464
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:50,748
Dev, where are you, anyhow?

1465
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:53,324
And what are you talking about?

1466
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,653
I'll tell you what to do.

1467
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:58,559
Prepare a report.
Yes, that will do it.

1468
01:15:58,622 --> 01:16:01,492
Show the board...
you know what I mean...

1469
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:03,558
how everything went wrong.

1470
01:16:03,627 --> 01:16:05,527
The mess Mclver's
gotten us into.

1471
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:10,695
You know, late hours, drinking...
Patients taking over the place.

1472
01:16:10,768 --> 01:16:12,198
Pour it on!

1473
01:16:12,269 --> 01:16:14,909
And then we walk into
that meeting on Tuesday

1474
01:16:14,972 --> 01:16:17,512
and just throw it on the table.

1475
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,584
What good will all that do?

1476
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:21,483
Now listen, Vicky.

1477
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:24,354
I'm going to clean house!

1478
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:27,284
And you better be on the
right side, or out you go.

1479
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,090
Mclver wants you out.

1480
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:31,122
He's gone to Regina about it.

1481
01:16:31,188 --> 01:16:33,588
Sh-she told me, Vicky!

1482
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:39,057
Mclver stays, and it's a-snickety
bang, off with your head. So...

1483
01:16:44,735 --> 01:16:47,635
Maybe if the staff
could settle its problems,

1484
01:16:47,705 --> 01:16:49,365
the patients could
settle theirs.

1485
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:50,909
Good point.

1486
01:16:50,974 --> 01:16:53,084
I promise you, we'll have
a policy meeting on this

1487
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:55,513
soon as I can communicate
with Dr. Devanal.

1488
01:16:55,578 --> 01:16:57,508
The main point is
whether we have

1489
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,520
self-government here at all.

1490
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:02,722
And if we haven't, don't
tell us we have, Dr. Mclver.

1491
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:05,386
Just hang up
any drapes you want,

1492
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:09,455
and let's take all this rigmarole
of a committee and so and so,

1493
01:17:09,526 --> 01:17:11,456
and give it back to the Indians.

1494
01:17:11,528 --> 01:17:13,098
Or miss inch.

1495
01:17:14,531 --> 01:17:17,671
Look, all I'm asking of you
at the moment is to be patient.

1496
01:17:17,735 --> 01:17:19,665
What we're trying to
do here isn't easy.

1497
01:17:19,737 --> 01:17:22,167
Self-government never is.

1498
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,439
But I think we can
all put it through.

1499
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,777
Anyway, let's try, hmm?

1500
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:32,248
Well, um...

1501
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:33,845
Excuse me.

1502
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:41,322
Oh, well, uh,
I... I... I think, uh...

1503
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:44,561
if you think they'll make any
changes around here, Holcomb,

1504
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:46,857
you're just kidding yourself.

1505
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,070
Karen, I'm in a meeting. I haven't

1506
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:53,373
Edna Devanal?
What does she want?

1507
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,566
I don't know where he
is. Nobody seems to.

1508
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:57,978
Just threw his
stink bomb and ran.

1509
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,581
I thought maybe you did.

1510
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:02,712
I haven't seen Dev since...

1511
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,950
I have to talk
with you about us.

1512
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:08,286
I'm frightened
at what's happened.

1513
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:09,991
Stewart, I...

1514
01:18:10,053 --> 01:18:11,993
Karen, I can't talk now.

1515
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:15,025
Mr. Holcomb? Meeting over?

1516
01:18:15,092 --> 01:18:16,832
Adjourned.

1517
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:21,659
Dr. Mclver.

1518
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:23,801
Yes, Mr. Capp.

1519
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:28,537
Uh... Holcomb's pretty upset.

1520
01:18:28,605 --> 01:18:30,635
Dr. Devanal missed
his hour today.

1521
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:32,107
I see.

1522
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:34,635
By the way, have you
heard from Dr. Devanal?

1523
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:36,451
Thank you.
No. No, I haven't.

1524
01:18:36,513 --> 01:18:40,183
Did, uh... Did he cancel your hour, too?

1525
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:45,124
Yes, but I don't get
hysterical like Holcomb.

1526
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:47,489
I feel fine.

1527
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,667
Good. Good.
I'm glad to hear it.

1528
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:50,491
Oh, miss Gavney.

1529
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,900
Yes, doctor?

1530
01:18:51,962 --> 01:18:53,372
Dr. Wolff will be here
all evening, won't he,

1531
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:55,026
in case anyone wants
to talk to him?

1532
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:56,768
Why, of course, sir.
He's...

1533
01:18:56,834 --> 01:18:58,974
fine. Good night, miss Gavney.

1534
01:19:00,003 --> 01:19:01,843
Good night, doctor.

1535
01:19:06,376 --> 01:19:07,636
Thank you.

1536
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,180
Good night, Mr. Capp.

1537
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:26,034
Oh, Abe.
You're so right.

1538
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:27,966
The world's becoming dehydrated.

1539
01:19:28,031 --> 01:19:29,971
What they can't
dry up, they freeze.

1540
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:31,973
Slicing has become a lost art.

1541
01:19:32,035 --> 01:19:33,965
Now tell me, when did
you last see a woman

1542
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:35,637
cutting an orange?

1543
01:19:35,705 --> 01:19:36,965
Listen, as far as I'm concerned,

1544
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,510
the more art that's
lost, the better.

1545
01:19:40,077 --> 01:19:42,007
Well, if it isn't
the good gray doctor!

1546
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:44,606
Hello.

1547
01:19:44,681 --> 01:19:46,021
Come in. Come in.

1548
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:48,493
Thank you. I, uh,
saw the lights.

1549
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:51,421
Have a seat. Give him
a glass of wine. Do you good.

1550
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:53,818
No, thanks. I'll have
to be getting along.

1551
01:19:56,193 --> 01:19:58,003
I, uh, just finished a meeting.

1552
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,531
I don't think I did too well.

1553
01:19:59,596 --> 01:20:00,656
Oh.

1554
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,100
Good evening.

1555
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:05,135
Careful with that,
honey. It's valuable.

1556
01:20:05,202 --> 01:20:07,472
Doctor,
you haven't met Abe's wife.

1557
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:08,937
Well, no.
I haven't.

1558
01:20:09,006 --> 01:20:10,446
Shirley, this is the
world-famous mind reader

1559
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,443
and deep-sea diver,
the great Mclver.

1560
01:20:12,509 --> 01:20:13,509
How do you do?

1561
01:20:13,543 --> 01:20:14,343
Very glad to know you.

1562
01:20:14,411 --> 01:20:15,581
Abe said it would be all right

1563
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:16,645
if I came along.

1564
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:17,679
I give him inspiration.

1565
01:20:17,747 --> 01:20:19,347
Good for you.

1566
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:21,316
Well, Abe, how is
it going to work?

1567
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:23,194
Ah, it's in the lap
of the gods, now.

1568
01:20:23,253 --> 01:20:25,893
You can only rely on my cool
skill and animal cunning.

1569
01:20:25,956 --> 01:20:28,256
Stevie really
got Wolff, didn't he?

1570
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,885
He's got your immaculate
scientific preoccupation.

1571
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:33,801
Won't you have
something to eat with us, Dr. Mclver?

1572
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:35,333
He just said no.
Don't ply the man.

1573
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:36,828
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1574
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,570
I changed my mind.

1575
01:20:38,635 --> 01:20:39,695
Ply me.

1576
01:20:39,769 --> 01:20:41,639
Good. Here.
Start with this.

1577
01:20:41,704 --> 01:20:43,344
Ah, spaghetti.
Wonderful.

1578
01:20:43,406 --> 01:20:45,276
Will you be able to
stay for a great experiment?

1579
01:20:45,308 --> 01:20:46,618
I don't know. How long
is it going to take, Abe?

1580
01:20:46,643 --> 01:20:48,753
Ah, be patient, doctor.

1581
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:50,191
This isn't something
you can toss off

1582
01:20:50,213 --> 01:20:51,963
like mending a split
personality, or something.

1583
01:20:51,982 --> 01:20:53,822
This is art.

1584
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:55,693
Well, Mrs. Irwin, I can see

1585
01:20:55,752 --> 01:20:57,062
that your child is
going to be reared

1586
01:20:57,087 --> 01:20:58,987
with a healthy respect for the arts.

1587
01:20:59,056 --> 01:21:00,856
Abe will have him
painting like the Venetians

1588
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:01,964
by the time he's 3.

1589
01:21:03,493 --> 01:21:05,043
Don't tell me you
doctors are going to start

1590
01:21:05,062 --> 01:21:06,862
analyzing kids before
they're even born, huh?

1591
01:21:08,565 --> 01:21:09,925
You wouldn't suspect it,

1592
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,640
but Abe's pretty excited
about being a father.

1593
01:21:11,668 --> 01:21:13,968
Everything is

1594
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:16,107
Husbands, careers, art.

1595
01:21:16,173 --> 01:21:18,313
When a baby is around,
nothing else counts.

1596
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,182
How right you are.

1597
01:21:21,744 --> 01:21:23,354
Ta-da!

1598
01:21:25,482 --> 01:21:26,552
How about that?

1599
01:21:26,616 --> 01:21:28,346
Hey, that's good! Isn't it?

1600
01:21:28,418 --> 01:21:30,118
Stevie has a sardonic touch,

1601
01:21:30,187 --> 01:21:31,887
a sort of jovial Goya.

1602
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:33,385
I think more like Steinberg.

1603
01:21:33,456 --> 01:21:34,886
More like you're all a little drunk.

1604
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:36,028
Oh...

1605
01:21:36,093 --> 01:21:37,563
Abe's really very pleased.

1606
01:21:37,627 --> 01:21:39,137
It's difficult to tell,
but I've had experience.

1607
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:40,902
How do you tell?

1608
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:42,274
He eats.

1609
01:21:42,332 --> 01:21:43,972
Whenever he eats,
things are all right.

1610
01:21:44,034 --> 01:21:46,174
Oh, it used to worry me
before we were married...

1611
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:48,266
for days at a time...
nothing.

1612
01:21:48,338 --> 01:21:50,468
Then suddenly,
at 3:00 in the morning,

1613
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:51,770
he'd get hungry,

1614
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:53,411
make me get up and fix him a sandwich.

1615
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:55,406
And from now on,
it's going to be me

1616
01:21:55,478 --> 01:21:57,958
who will have to get up at 3:00
in the morning, warm the bottle.

1617
01:21:58,015 --> 01:21:59,745
Serves you right!

1618
01:21:59,816 --> 01:22:01,996
Hey, Shirley, you know, it's
about time you ought to be in bed.

1619
01:22:02,019 --> 01:22:03,429
We can go on with this
in the morning.

1620
01:22:03,453 --> 01:22:04,893
We can't leave this mess.

1621
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:06,264
Leave it.

1622
01:22:06,323 --> 01:22:07,483
How are you going to get home?

1623
01:22:07,524 --> 01:22:08,564
I'll manage.

1624
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:09,955
If you need a lift, I'll drop you.

1625
01:22:10,027 --> 01:22:11,287
Fine. Take her home, Abe.

1626
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:13,301
You're a good man
in a chin fest.

1627
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:15,013
We ought to do this again
at my house sometime, doc.

1628
01:22:15,032 --> 01:22:16,532
Just say when.

1629
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:17,669
Good night.

1630
01:22:17,734 --> 01:22:18,744
Good night, Shirley.

1631
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:21,342
Doc?
Yeah.

1632
01:22:22,372 --> 01:22:24,112
You be sure to cure this kid, huh?

1633
01:22:24,174 --> 01:22:25,614
We'll do our best, Abe.

1634
01:22:25,675 --> 01:22:26,935
See you.

1635
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,020
Good night...
And thanks a lot.

1636
01:22:28,045 --> 01:22:29,745
Oh, any time, doctor.

1637
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:47,195
Nicest part of every party...

1638
01:22:47,264 --> 01:22:48,074
Hmm?

1639
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:49,201
When everybody leaves.

1640
01:22:49,266 --> 01:22:50,996
Oh. You want to wash or dry?

1641
01:22:51,068 --> 01:22:52,338
I don't care.

1642
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:53,942
More sense of accomplishment washing.

1643
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:55,143
You wash.

1644
01:22:55,205 --> 01:22:56,405
All right. Will you get a towel?

1645
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,013
The first cupboard on the right...

1646
01:22:58,075 --> 01:22:59,535
the one that says "clean rags".

1647
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:01,009
Yes, ma'am.

1648
01:23:08,285 --> 01:23:10,515
<i>doo doo there you are.</i>

1649
01:23:10,587 --> 01:23:12,217
Thank you.

1650
01:23:19,396 --> 01:23:21,826
How long were you married?

1651
01:23:21,898 --> 01:23:24,528
6 years, 8 months, and 2 days.

1652
01:23:24,601 --> 01:23:25,741
Oh...

1653
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:49,057
Come on, you guys!

1654
01:23:49,092 --> 01:23:50,492
Let's go get some chow!

1655
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,100
Hey! Hey!

1656
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,421
Any regrets...

1657
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:19,617
Coming here and taking this job?

1658
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:21,519
No.

1659
01:24:21,591 --> 01:24:24,291
It's only partly true, you know,

1660
01:24:24,361 --> 01:24:27,001
that hard work cures all sorrow.

1661
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,003
Is that what you think I'm doing?

1662
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:30,995
Trying.

1663
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:32,797
This, uh...

1664
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:35,269
This work is a bridge for you, isn't it?

1665
01:24:36,139 --> 01:24:38,479
To back among the living?

1666
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:39,611
Mm-hmm.

1667
01:24:39,676 --> 01:24:40,606
Mm-hmm.

1668
01:24:40,677 --> 01:24:42,447
Welcome back.

1669
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:45,112
You're young. You've got
a whole world ahead of you.

1670
01:24:45,182 --> 01:24:47,622
It's up against
real competition...

1671
01:24:47,684 --> 01:24:49,424
the one behind me.

1672
01:24:49,486 --> 01:24:52,216
Yeah, I've been thinking
myself back into that one.

1673
01:24:52,289 --> 01:24:55,359
Well, uh, "think" is
probably the wrong word.

1674
01:24:55,425 --> 01:24:57,425
It's an impression...
A feeling,

1675
01:24:57,494 --> 01:24:59,634
an atmosphere around you.

1676
01:25:00,697 --> 01:25:02,667
Something inside.

1677
01:25:02,732 --> 01:25:04,472
Relax. Close your eyes.

1678
01:25:04,534 --> 01:25:06,674
That's what the couch is for.

1679
01:25:06,736 --> 01:25:09,506
All right.

1680
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:12,182
You're in a small college town.

1681
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:15,382
5- room yellow house.
Rented.

1682
01:25:16,646 --> 01:25:19,546
It's on a shady street
with a handful of others.

1683
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,586
And outside, peaceful sounds:

1684
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,720
A lawn mower clanking,

1685
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:29,159
a piano playing.

1686
01:25:29,226 --> 01:25:30,326
In the first apartment

1687
01:25:30,393 --> 01:25:31,663
Karen and I had in Chicago,

1688
01:25:31,728 --> 01:25:33,998
the bathtub was in the kitchen.

1689
01:25:34,063 --> 01:25:36,703
Small, cozy, no big problems.

1690
01:25:37,834 --> 01:25:39,474
Except when the Murphy bed was down,

1691
01:25:39,536 --> 01:25:42,406
you couldn't open
the front door.

1692
01:25:42,472 --> 01:25:44,592
I'd come home from the
hospital at 5:00 in the morning,

1693
01:25:44,641 --> 01:25:46,641
and there'd be
coffee on the stove.

1694
01:25:51,414 --> 01:25:53,054
I wonder where Dev is.

1695
01:25:53,115 --> 01:25:55,515
He's probably drunk someplace.

1696
01:25:55,585 --> 01:25:57,615
There's a real
deterioration in that man.

1697
01:25:57,687 --> 01:26:00,417
Now I'm going
to have to fight him

1698
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:02,990
for the clinic,
and I don't want to.

1699
01:26:03,059 --> 01:26:04,429
Why not?

1700
01:26:04,494 --> 01:26:06,434
Because I remember him
when I was in training.

1701
01:26:06,496 --> 01:26:08,496
He and Collins were doing
really important work.

1702
01:26:08,565 --> 01:26:10,825
Is that why you've been
covering for him here?

1703
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:13,500
What do you think it
would do to the patients

1704
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,470
to see us at each
other's throats?

1705
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:18,679
You know what I'd really like?

1706
01:26:18,741 --> 01:26:19,611
What?

1707
01:26:19,676 --> 01:26:21,406
To get back to that feeling

1708
01:26:21,478 --> 01:26:23,608
I had in the bar.

1709
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,080
Talk, wine...

1710
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:28,078
Beer wouldn't do?

1711
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,420
Uh-uh. Wrong mood.

1712
01:26:30,487 --> 01:26:33,187
I'll put it in a red glass.

1713
01:26:34,924 --> 01:26:36,394
All right.

1714
01:27:10,126 --> 01:27:11,926
Could I use your phone?

1715
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:13,804
Oh, yes.
Right over there.

1716
01:27:13,863 --> 01:27:15,403
Thank you.

1717
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:27,537
Miss Kubiecki?
This is Dr. Mclver.

1718
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:30,380
Have you heard from
Dr. Devanal yet?

1719
01:27:30,447 --> 01:27:32,377
Nothing, huh?

1720
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:34,919
She does? Well, switch
me through to her, please.

1721
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:39,759
Oh, hello, miss Gavney.

1722
01:27:39,822 --> 01:27:41,892
Who?

1723
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:44,028
Oh, Mr. Capp.

1724
01:27:44,093 --> 01:27:46,003
Yes. Yes, he'll need sedation.

1725
01:27:46,062 --> 01:27:48,702
That's all right. You
can give it to him.

1726
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:50,895
And if Dr. Wolff needs me,

1727
01:27:50,967 --> 01:27:53,697
I'm at 6258.

1728
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:55,240
Mm-hmm.

1729
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:56,844
Good night.

1730
01:28:51,828 --> 01:28:54,298
Hello. This is Mrs. Mclver.

1731
01:28:54,363 --> 01:28:57,503
Is my...
Is Dr. Mclver there?

1732
01:28:57,567 --> 01:29:00,097
Well, I...
It's rather urgent.

1733
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:02,769
Oh, yes, thank you.
Give me the number if you will.

1734
01:29:04,273 --> 01:29:05,913
Thank you.

1735
01:29:13,483 --> 01:29:16,153
Hello?

1736
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:17,818
Who is this?

1737
01:29:17,887 --> 01:29:19,487
Hello?

1738
01:29:26,563 --> 01:29:29,733
Information, 6258.

1739
01:29:29,799 --> 01:29:31,769
Under whose name is
that number listed?

1740
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:35,304
I'm sorry. We are
unable to give this information.

1741
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:37,871
We do not list
by telephone number.

1742
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:15,574
It's hard for everybody,
but particularly for us...

1743
01:31:16,706 --> 01:31:19,576
Because all the sick
feelings out of the past

1744
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,582
hook onto things in the present.

1745
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:31,651
Now, this...

1746
01:31:31,721 --> 01:31:34,561
Being with you right now...

1747
01:31:34,624 --> 01:31:37,234
Is real, only...

1748
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:39,863
My feelings about now...

1749
01:31:39,929 --> 01:31:42,429
How do I know where
they come from,

1750
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:45,968
or have I got them all
mixed up with something else?

1751
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,520
Good night, Stevie.

1752
01:31:59,582 --> 01:32:01,382
Thank you for taking me.

1753
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:03,320
I couldn't have
done it by myself.

1754
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:06,215
I couldn't have gone
with anyone else but you.

1755
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:11,258
Good night.

1756
01:32:37,153 --> 01:32:41,093
Well, Mr. Capp, you must
be as drowsy as a kitten.

1757
01:32:41,157 --> 01:32:44,227
How about bed now...
And some sleep?

1758
01:32:44,293 --> 01:32:48,103
That's the wittiest remark
since the passing of Oscar Wilde.

1759
01:32:48,164 --> 01:32:51,304
Oh, Mr. Capp, I gave you some sedation.

1760
01:32:51,367 --> 01:32:53,367
Yeah. Two capsules.

1761
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:57,243
Are you sure the clinic
can spare it?

1762
01:32:57,306 --> 01:32:59,076
Mr. Capp, would it help

1763
01:32:59,141 --> 01:33:02,581
if I called in Dr. Wolff to talk to you?

1764
01:33:02,645 --> 01:33:04,305
Miss Gavney, please!

1765
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:06,350
One doctor at a time.

1766
01:33:08,284 --> 01:33:11,824
Let's not interfere with
good old Devanal's work.

1767
01:33:11,888 --> 01:33:16,158
Ha! He's making me fit
to face the world.

1768
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:21,430
The futility
and the emptiness...

1769
01:33:21,497 --> 01:33:23,767
The hydrogen bomb...

1770
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:27,941
Say, I may even be fit
to cope with my mother!

1771
01:33:30,072 --> 01:33:33,342
There's a formidable
woman, miss Gavney...

1772
01:33:33,409 --> 01:33:36,209
quick of eye, steady of hand.

1773
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:39,078
Never been known to miss
with a knife in the back.

1774
01:33:40,349 --> 01:33:46,319
<i>"m" is for the million
things she gave me</i>

1775
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:51,828
<i>"o" means only that
she's growing old</i>

1776
01:33:51,894 --> 01:33:56,874
<i>"t" is for the tears
were shed to save me</i>

1777
01:33:56,933 --> 01:34:01,403
<i>"h" is for her heart
of purest gold</i>

1778
01:34:15,551 --> 01:34:17,191
Good morning, mark.

1779
01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:18,893
Morning.

1780
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:21,385
Mother not down yet?

1781
01:34:21,457 --> 01:34:22,927
She's gone.

1782
01:34:23,793 --> 01:34:26,263
Gone? Where?

1783
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:29,168
To the Springs.
She took Rosie with her.

1784
01:34:30,699 --> 01:34:32,669
You're supposed to take me

1785
01:34:32,735 --> 01:34:35,335
over to Billy Hormeyer's
for the weekend.

1786
01:34:35,404 --> 01:34:37,274
Sadie's not here yet.

1787
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:41,940
Yeah, I'll... All right,
whenever you're ready.

1788
01:34:43,212 --> 01:34:45,882
I'll get breakfast
at the clinic.

1789
01:34:57,626 --> 01:34:59,096
So long.

1790
01:34:59,161 --> 01:35:00,901
Good-bye, dad.

1791
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:35,760
Is Dr. Mclver here yet?

1792
01:35:35,832 --> 01:35:37,302
Should be any minute.

1793
01:35:37,366 --> 01:35:39,836
Well, please let me know
the minute he comes in.

1794
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:41,902
I'll be at breakfast.

1795
01:35:46,976 --> 01:35:49,306
No. No, no, Mrs. Devanal.

1796
01:35:49,378 --> 01:35:51,808
We haven't heard
from the doctor yet.

1797
01:35:51,881 --> 01:35:54,221
Yes. Yes, I'll be sure
to call you.

1798
01:35:54,283 --> 01:35:57,093
Mr. Capp, why don't you
go in to breakfast?

1799
01:35:57,153 --> 01:35:59,293
I'll call you as soon
as the doctor arrives.

1800
01:35:59,355 --> 01:36:01,085
I'd rather stay here.

1801
01:36:01,157 --> 01:36:03,257
Cobby, did you know that
Thomas Edison never slept

1802
01:36:03,325 --> 01:36:05,255
more than 42 minutes
a night in his whole life?

1803
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:07,027
No wonder he tinkered around.

1804
01:36:07,096 --> 01:36:08,926
Dr. Mclver!

1805
01:36:12,869 --> 01:36:15,039
It's Stevie!

1806
01:36:23,145 --> 01:36:25,875
I've taken all I'm gonna
take of these loonies!

1807
01:36:25,948 --> 01:36:28,248
Look at that.
I tried to stop him.

1808
01:36:28,317 --> 01:36:30,317
He was smashing the window.

1809
01:36:30,386 --> 01:36:33,056
He was trying to break down
the door when curly stopped him.

1810
01:36:39,929 --> 01:36:42,059
Curly got cut
with the broken glass.

1811
01:36:42,131 --> 01:36:43,671
Curly, what started this?

1812
01:36:43,732 --> 01:36:44,872
How should I know?

1813
01:36:44,934 --> 01:36:46,544
Dr. Mclver!

1814
01:36:46,602 --> 01:36:48,472
Dr. Mclver, I demand to know

1815
01:36:48,537 --> 01:36:50,817
why those new drapes are put up in
the library, considering your promise!

1816
01:36:50,839 --> 01:36:52,439
What drapes?
Flowered brocade.

1817
01:36:52,508 --> 01:36:54,378
A very striking effect,
as a matter of fact.

1818
01:36:54,443 --> 01:36:56,453
Curly, did you see
which way he went?

1819
01:36:56,512 --> 01:36:59,522
Last I saw him, he was hightailing
it river way. Good riddance!

1820
01:37:16,732 --> 01:37:19,142
Stevie!

1821
01:37:28,544 --> 01:37:30,484
Stevie!

1822
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:40,620
Stevie!

1823
01:38:08,917 --> 01:38:11,017
Doctor, something has to be done

1824
01:38:11,087 --> 01:38:12,957
about the noise in the annex.

1825
01:38:13,022 --> 01:38:14,992
It's impossible to rest.
If something isn't done,

1826
01:38:15,057 --> 01:38:16,987
I'm going to call
the police myself!

1827
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:18,859
Miss Robbins, you will do no such thing.

1828
01:38:18,927 --> 01:38:20,407
If you'll please go
back to your room.

1829
01:38:20,429 --> 01:38:22,329
I assure you, everything
possible is being done.

1830
01:38:22,398 --> 01:38:24,398
The state highway patrol
has been trying to get you.

1831
01:38:24,466 --> 01:38:26,936
I told them you'd call
just as soon as you got in.

1832
01:38:27,003 --> 01:38:28,273
All right, get them for me,

1833
01:38:28,337 --> 01:38:29,967
and put the call
through in my office.

1834
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:32,339
Dr. Mclver, I came to
this place to be helped,

1835
01:38:32,408 --> 01:38:34,338
not to be driven out of my mind!

1836
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:36,180
Miss Robbins,
perhaps you can tell me.

1837
01:38:36,245 --> 01:38:38,015
The noise upstairs, and the
laughing and the dancing...

1838
01:38:38,047 --> 01:38:39,377
How bad is it, Tim?

1839
01:38:39,448 --> 01:38:41,278
Pretty bad. We have
a very disturbed house.

1840
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,430
There's been a lot of talk
all day about those new drapes,

1841
01:38:43,452 --> 01:38:45,422
and now this rumor about
Steven Holte's suicide.

1842
01:38:45,487 --> 01:38:47,817
They each read themselves into
it, and I never know what's...

1843
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:50,249
Dr. Mclver, I found Mrs. Demuth
drunk in Mr. Appleton's room.

1844
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:52,932
You see? I tried to persuade
her to go back to her own.

1845
01:38:52,995 --> 01:38:55,025
Dr. Mclver, state
highway patrol calling.

1846
01:38:55,097 --> 01:38:57,297
Does Demuth know I'm here?

1847
01:38:57,366 --> 01:38:58,566
I'll go up.

1848
01:38:58,634 --> 01:38:59,904
Doctor...

1849
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,898
I'll see to it.

1850
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:04,070
Mclver.

1851
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:05,470
That's right.

1852
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:07,911
I called the sheriff's
office around 2:00.

1853
01:39:07,976 --> 01:39:09,576
Definitely not.

1854
01:39:09,645 --> 01:39:11,605
He's not dangerous
to anybody but himself.

1855
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:14,150
Don't send an officer out
here. I'll come down there.

1856
01:39:18,454 --> 01:39:20,194
Dr. Mclver, what'll I do about...

1857
01:39:20,256 --> 01:39:21,416
later, Mrs. O'Brien.

1858
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:23,260
Mrs. O'Brien...

1859
01:39:29,698 --> 01:39:31,768
Mrs. O'Brien!

1860
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,103
Yes, doctor?

1861
01:39:33,169 --> 01:39:34,769
I want you to take these
down right away.

1862
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:36,173
But, doctor...

1863
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:37,378
take them down before
more patients see them.

1864
01:39:37,406 --> 01:39:38,806
But what will I do with them?

1865
01:39:38,874 --> 01:39:40,554
I don't care what you
do with them... anything!

1866
01:39:40,576 --> 01:39:42,506
Put them in my car. I'll
take them to the dump!

1867
01:39:42,578 --> 01:39:45,048
But don't you think we ought
to wait until Dr. Devanal...

1868
01:39:59,695 --> 01:40:01,325
Stewart!

1869
01:40:06,702 --> 01:40:08,142
Where have you been?

1870
01:40:08,204 --> 01:40:10,514
Been? I've been to the
airport to meet Regina.

1871
01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:12,712
We had a few things
to talk about.

1872
01:40:12,774 --> 01:40:14,244
Just got in.

1873
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:15,680
Now, look here...

1874
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,614
Then you haven't heard
about Steven Holte.

1875
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,149
No. Why?

1876
01:40:19,215 --> 01:40:21,615
Is he... Was he very disturbed?

1877
01:40:21,683 --> 01:40:24,053
I'd say so, Dev,
assuming he's still alive.

1878
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,250
One of the patients?

1879
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:26,391
My patient.

1880
01:40:26,455 --> 01:40:27,515
Stewart, aren't you being

1881
01:40:27,589 --> 01:40:29,359
a little melodramatic, perhaps?

1882
01:40:29,425 --> 01:40:31,225
You know this boy's history!

1883
01:40:31,293 --> 01:40:32,833
If you don't, why don't you come

1884
01:40:32,894 --> 01:40:35,634
to staff meeting once
in a while and find out?!

1885
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:37,627
What are you in
this business for...

1886
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:39,339
to cure patients
or to kill them?!

1887
01:40:39,401 --> 01:40:42,141
I didn't put up those
drapes. You know that.

1888
01:40:42,204 --> 01:40:44,744
Dev, if this boy kills himself,

1889
01:40:44,806 --> 01:40:47,406
I'll drive you so far
out of the profession,

1890
01:40:47,476 --> 01:40:49,146
you'll never find your way back!

1891
01:40:49,211 --> 01:40:50,881
Now, look here, Stewart!

1892
01:40:50,946 --> 01:40:53,276
If I were you, I would not
make accusations you may regret.

1893
01:40:53,349 --> 01:40:54,349
I'll regret nothing!

1894
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:56,053
Now, just a minute!

1895
01:40:56,118 --> 01:40:57,948
This boy has
a history of suicide.

1896
01:40:58,019 --> 01:41:00,389
Do you mean to tell me
that knowing that,

1897
01:41:00,456 --> 01:41:02,556
you gave him
the run of the clinic,

1898
01:41:02,624 --> 01:41:05,094
let him become some kind
of celebrity around here?

1899
01:41:05,161 --> 01:41:07,361
Why wasn't he sent
to a closed hospital?

1900
01:41:07,429 --> 01:41:09,729
Because I'm a doctor,
not a jailer!

1901
01:41:09,798 --> 01:41:11,998
Mac, before the rest
of the board arrives,

1902
01:41:12,067 --> 01:41:13,267
I insist on a clarification

1903
01:41:13,335 --> 01:41:14,795
of what's going on down here.

1904
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:16,210
I hear these rumors...

1905
01:41:16,272 --> 01:41:17,642
What rumors, Regina?

1906
01:41:17,706 --> 01:41:19,246
About laxity in the
treatment of patients...

1907
01:41:19,275 --> 01:41:20,635
incompetence.

1908
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:22,979
I want to know if
there's any basis to them.

1909
01:41:23,044 --> 01:41:24,654
Does Dev suggest there is?

1910
01:41:24,713 --> 01:41:26,953
Certainly not. He
completely denies them.

1911
01:41:27,015 --> 01:41:28,245
Same thing.

1912
01:41:28,317 --> 01:41:31,547
Mac, I take a serious
view of this.

1913
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:32,820
Yes, so do I.

1914
01:41:32,888 --> 01:41:35,058
Don't try to run this
place single-handed.

1915
01:41:35,123 --> 01:41:37,133
We have a responsibility
to the trustees.

1916
01:41:37,193 --> 01:41:38,793
But not to the patients, huh?

1917
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,130
The patients are yours.

1918
01:41:40,196 --> 01:41:41,826
Regina, the trustees
can't run the clinic

1919
01:41:41,897 --> 01:41:43,397
without knowing the clinic,

1920
01:41:43,465 --> 01:41:45,305
and you can't know the
clinic sitting in Chicago!

1921
01:41:45,334 --> 01:41:47,354
Well, from what I've seen
here in the past few minutes...

1922
01:41:47,369 --> 01:41:49,539
well, take a few more
minutes. I can't talk now.

1923
01:41:49,605 --> 01:41:50,535
Mac!

1924
01:41:50,606 --> 01:41:52,206
Not now!

1925
01:41:56,745 --> 01:41:59,675
I just don't understand.
What are they doing?

1926
01:42:00,649 --> 01:42:03,389
They are mourning, Mrs. O'Brien.

1927
01:42:03,452 --> 01:42:07,062
I think that's what
your people would call...

1928
01:42:07,122 --> 01:42:08,792
A wake.

1929
01:42:18,567 --> 01:42:20,497
Mr. Capp.

1930
01:42:21,837 --> 01:42:23,767
Mr. Capp!

1931
01:42:27,676 --> 01:42:32,476
Man shall not
minister to my disease,

1932
01:42:32,548 --> 01:42:36,488
plucked from the memory
of rooted sorrow.

1933
01:42:37,586 --> 01:42:40,886
Raise up the hidden
troubles of the brain,

1934
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:47,660
and, with some sweet,
oblivious antidote,

1935
01:42:47,729 --> 01:42:49,329
cleanse the...

1936
01:42:49,398 --> 01:42:52,398
Mr. Capp, won't you
come to bed now?

1937
01:42:54,503 --> 01:42:56,973
Mrs. O'Brien,
did I ever tell you

1938
01:42:57,038 --> 01:42:59,338
you reminded me of my mother?

1939
01:43:00,609 --> 01:43:05,849
And, with some sweet,
oblivious antidote,

1940
01:43:05,914 --> 01:43:09,854
cleanse the...
Bosom from that...

1941
01:43:29,805 --> 01:43:32,335
Hello, Otto.
I'm glad you're here.

1942
01:43:32,408 --> 01:43:34,338
I want to talk to you.

1943
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:36,350
Mrs. Devanal is in your office.

1944
01:43:36,412 --> 01:43:38,352
Mrs. Devanal?
What does she want?

1945
01:43:38,414 --> 01:43:41,554
I don't know. She's been
waiting for some time.

1946
01:43:48,223 --> 01:43:49,963
Hello, Edna.

1947
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:54,761
What can I do for you?

1948
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:59,173
I'm sorry about
the boy, Stewart.

1949
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:02,404
I've been trying to make
up my mind all night.

1950
01:44:02,471 --> 01:44:05,641
I know how you feel about Dev.

1951
01:44:05,707 --> 01:44:08,707
I can't justify
anything he's done.

1952
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:16,050
Stewart... Don't you care
at all what happens to him?

1953
01:44:16,117 --> 01:44:17,847
I'm sorry, Edna.
It's not personal,

1954
01:44:17,919 --> 01:44:20,859
but I can't let Dev
go on like this.

1955
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:24,892
But can't you do it some
way... some other way?

1956
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,230
That's all I ask.

1957
01:44:27,295 --> 01:44:30,595
Just... Not this way.

1958
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:35,571
Can it really matter
how many times

1959
01:44:35,637 --> 01:44:38,567
he's been at the realton
hotel with miss Cobb?

1960
01:44:40,241 --> 01:44:41,981
If it doesn't matter to me...

1961
01:44:42,043 --> 01:44:45,913
I've been through all that so
long and gotten used to it...

1962
01:44:45,981 --> 01:44:48,481
what can it matter
to anyone else?

1963
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:50,620
If it's true
he really mishandled

1964
01:44:50,686 --> 01:44:53,556
the two cases
mentioned in there,

1965
01:44:53,622 --> 01:44:56,392
I suppose that is
serious, but mistakes...

1966
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:58,788
have you any idea what it is

1967
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:01,860
to live in the same
house with a man

1968
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:05,330
who hasn't brought his
problems to you for 10 years?

1969
01:45:06,802 --> 01:45:11,412
But, Stewart, if he
loses his pride now...

1970
01:45:12,441 --> 01:45:14,641
He'll be through.

1971
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:18,351
That's all he has left.

1972
01:45:21,249 --> 01:45:23,179
Edna...

1973
01:45:24,486 --> 01:45:26,816
Where did you get this?

1974
01:45:26,888 --> 01:45:31,688
It... Came to the house
last night by messenger.

1975
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,300
I know I shouldn't
have opened it,

1976
01:45:34,362 --> 01:45:36,362
but Dev wasn't there, and...

1977
01:45:36,432 --> 01:45:37,832
I was so worried.

1978
01:45:37,899 --> 01:45:39,269
Has Dev seen it?

1979
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:40,644
No.

1980
01:45:44,406 --> 01:45:46,136
Sally, get miss inch in here.

1981
01:45:46,207 --> 01:45:47,287
Mrs. Mitchell-Smythe called.

1982
01:45:47,342 --> 01:45:48,542
The board meeting is for...

1983
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:50,580
I want miss inch!

1984
01:45:52,714 --> 01:45:55,684
Dr. Mclver's office.
Who's calling, please?

1985
01:45:55,751 --> 01:45:58,851
Yes, just one moment,
lieutenant. He's right here.

1986
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,860
Yes?

1987
01:46:00,922 --> 01:46:02,362
What?

1988
01:46:02,424 --> 01:46:04,434
Where?

1989
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:08,204
Lieutenant!

1990
01:46:08,263 --> 01:46:10,473
Can you identify this, doctor?

1991
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,670
That shoe could've been
in the river for 3 years.

1992
01:46:14,736 --> 01:46:16,266
It doesn't mean he's drowned!

1993
01:46:16,337 --> 01:46:19,337
No one says it does, but
it's the nearest we've come.

1994
01:46:19,407 --> 01:46:20,507
Where'd you find it?

1995
01:46:20,576 --> 01:46:21,876
Out over there in that mudbank.

1996
01:46:21,943 --> 01:46:24,053
We figure that's where
he entered the river.

1997
01:46:24,112 --> 01:46:26,782
We're going to start dragging all
through here and work downstream.

1998
01:46:26,848 --> 01:46:30,448
Cal, let's get over to those
other two boats by the bridge.

1999
01:46:32,454 --> 01:46:34,894
Keep that searchlight
on us over here!

2000
01:46:34,956 --> 01:46:38,656
Lieutenant Ferguson... tangled
in the lines of your hook!

2001
01:46:38,727 --> 01:46:40,457
We've gone too far!

2002
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:44,469
Dr. Mclver!
Boat 5 hooked something!

2003
01:46:58,647 --> 01:47:00,417
Something's on the hook!

2004
01:47:00,482 --> 01:47:03,152
I think
we've snagged a body!

2005
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:10,760
Do you want me
to take you to him?

2006
01:47:10,826 --> 01:47:13,956
No, he wouldn't
want me. Not now.

2007
01:47:16,064 --> 01:47:17,734
I'll be at home.

2008
01:47:17,799 --> 01:47:22,269
Will you call me, let me
know if there's anything?

2009
01:47:22,337 --> 01:47:25,437
Karen, forgive me.
I shall presume.

2010
01:47:25,507 --> 01:47:26,777
Tomorrow... Or
whenever this ends,

2011
01:47:26,808 --> 01:47:30,148
if he will let you,
go to him, help him.

2012
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:32,711
He has much to work through.

2013
01:47:32,781 --> 01:47:35,451
Don't nurse your wounds.

2014
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:37,647
Nurse his.

2015
01:47:38,453 --> 01:47:40,163
Thank you.

2016
01:47:50,498 --> 01:47:52,328
Pull it in slow!

2017
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,770
What is it?

2018
01:47:53,835 --> 01:47:55,265
It's only a Fender.

2019
01:47:55,336 --> 01:47:57,436
You've just hooked a Fender!

2020
01:48:09,851 --> 01:48:11,751
Meg, I'm not going
to stand around

2021
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:14,290
waiting for them
to bring up the body.

2022
01:48:14,355 --> 01:48:15,585
I can't take any more.

2023
01:48:15,657 --> 01:48:17,387
Any more of waiting?

2024
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:19,288
Any more of myself.

2025
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:23,500
Everything I've put my hand to
flies apart like a straw man...

2026
01:48:23,565 --> 01:48:25,395
wife, kids, Dev...
Now Stevie.

2027
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:30,036
What kind of a fool was I to think
I could take care of all that?

2028
01:48:30,105 --> 01:48:32,205
I can't even
take care of myself.

2029
01:48:32,273 --> 01:48:35,583
I'm no more fit to be
in this job than Dev is.

2030
01:48:35,644 --> 01:48:38,214
Well, let somebody else try
to put it together again.

2031
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:39,619
It won't be me.

2032
01:48:39,681 --> 01:48:41,721
Why don't they just
leave it where it is?

2033
01:48:41,783 --> 01:48:43,893
You know the way a stiff acts?

2034
01:48:43,952 --> 01:48:47,262
It goes down to the
bottom. It don't drift away.

2035
01:48:47,322 --> 01:48:51,132
Just lays there until it bloats
enough to come to the top.

2036
01:49:12,614 --> 01:49:14,824
Oh, Meg...

2037
01:49:14,883 --> 01:49:18,523
Oh, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

2038
01:49:18,586 --> 01:49:21,456
It seems a long time.

2039
01:49:21,522 --> 01:49:23,362
A long time.

2040
01:49:23,424 --> 01:49:26,864
I've been living in a
dream these last few days.

2041
01:49:26,928 --> 01:49:30,228
It has to stop.
I have to wake up.

2042
01:49:30,298 --> 01:49:34,598
I've been playing family
again with you and Stevie.

2043
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:36,840
It was a wonderful dream.

2044
01:49:36,905 --> 01:49:40,635
I was dead for a long time,
and now I'm alive...

2045
01:49:40,709 --> 01:49:42,139
For which I thank you.

2046
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:45,010
Meg, listen to me.
Nothing has to stop.

2047
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,950
I think it does.

2048
01:49:47,015 --> 01:49:49,715
We can't stay out any
longer just to find a body.

2049
01:49:49,785 --> 01:49:52,245
Bring in the boats!

2050
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:54,921
That's it!

2051
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:56,320
I think I'm something...

2052
01:49:56,391 --> 01:50:00,061
something you had once
or wanted once, and...

2053
01:50:00,128 --> 01:50:03,298
It's easier for you
to start again with me

2054
01:50:03,364 --> 01:50:05,334
than go back and get Karen.

2055
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,040
No, no, no, Meg...

2056
01:50:07,102 --> 01:50:09,602
I wonder if she doesn't
need some of the strength

2057
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:12,011
you've tried to give
Stevie and me.

2058
01:50:12,073 --> 01:50:14,343
Maybe it's too late for that.

2059
01:50:14,409 --> 01:50:17,109
Well, leave her, then, but
don't make her suffer...

2060
01:50:17,178 --> 01:50:20,578
While you and I clutch at
our dreams in odd moments...

2061
01:50:20,648 --> 01:50:22,548
please don't!

2062
01:50:22,617 --> 01:50:24,417
Don't.

2063
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:27,055
I could do that, too.

2064
01:50:27,122 --> 01:50:30,862
I almost want you that much.

2065
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,060
Just not quite.

2066
01:50:34,129 --> 01:50:35,929
Not quite.

2067
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,940
Well...

2068
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:44,670
What should I do, Meg?

2069
01:50:48,509 --> 01:50:52,709
Who do you...
Think I am?

2070
01:51:59,114 --> 01:52:00,724
I'm late for the meeting.

2071
01:52:00,782 --> 01:52:04,892
I know. I want to talk to
you a minute before you go in.

2072
01:52:18,133 --> 01:52:20,443
When did you send
this out, Vicky?

2073
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:22,141
I worked on it
Saturday and Sunday

2074
01:52:22,203 --> 01:52:24,743
and called a messenger
and sent it to your house.

2075
01:52:24,806 --> 01:52:27,606
I didn't get it.
I haven't been home.

2076
01:52:27,675 --> 01:52:29,875
This is Dev's copy.

2077
01:52:30,812 --> 01:52:32,752
But I...
Don't understand.

2078
01:52:32,814 --> 01:52:34,424
I thought...

2079
01:52:34,482 --> 01:52:37,452
All right, I believe in
calling a spade a spade.

2080
01:52:37,518 --> 01:52:40,458
You may be interested in
knowing that Dr. Devanal

2081
01:52:40,521 --> 01:52:44,091
suggested that I prepare just
such a report as that against you.

2082
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,259
Vicky, I hope,
for your own peace,

2083
01:52:46,327 --> 01:52:48,727
you won't present
that thing at the meeting.

2084
01:52:48,796 --> 01:52:51,096
And if I led you
to believe I wanted

2085
01:52:51,166 --> 01:52:54,936
that kind of help
from you, forgive me.

2086
01:53:00,308 --> 01:53:01,838
I understand that the drapes

2087
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:04,080
hung in the library by your wife

2088
01:53:04,145 --> 01:53:05,705
were removed by you yesterday.

2089
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,180
You will appreciate, Dr. Mclver,

2090
01:53:07,248 --> 01:53:08,928
that regardless of their
origin or suitability,

2091
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:10,820
they are the property of the clinic.

2092
01:53:10,886 --> 01:53:13,086
I must ask that they
be returned at once.

2093
01:53:47,855 --> 01:53:49,585
Vicky.

2094
01:54:02,003 --> 01:54:04,613
Under the circumstances,

2095
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:07,142
I suggest we dispense
with the customary agenda

2096
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:09,438
and get to the essentials.

2097
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:11,850
I understand
miss inch has a report

2098
01:54:11,913 --> 01:54:14,123
which she believes may
clarify certain aspects

2099
01:54:14,182 --> 01:54:16,482
of our present situation.

2100
01:54:26,995 --> 01:54:30,095
Miss inch, may we
have your report?

2101
01:54:33,901 --> 01:54:35,771
I have no report...

2102
01:54:35,836 --> 01:54:38,306
Except the usual financial ones.

2103
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:42,341
Much the same as last year.

2104
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:45,210
Read them yourselves
to save time.

2105
01:55:00,495 --> 01:55:01,895
Regina, if I may,

2106
01:55:01,963 --> 01:55:04,573
I think I can save you
some time, too.

2107
01:55:06,667 --> 01:55:08,837
You all know what's happened.

2108
01:55:08,903 --> 01:55:11,873
None of it can be undone.

2109
01:55:11,939 --> 01:55:14,339
But what we can do
is learn from it.

2110
01:55:16,344 --> 01:55:19,284
Out of our needs
and our passions here,

2111
01:55:19,347 --> 01:55:22,947
we've... We've spun
a human cobweb,

2112
01:55:23,018 --> 01:55:25,148
and this boy's
been caught in it.

2113
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:27,860
I know that a lot
of what's happened

2114
01:55:27,922 --> 01:55:30,062
is my responsibility.

2115
01:55:30,125 --> 01:55:33,185
I think I forgot
that if an analyst

2116
01:55:33,261 --> 01:55:37,431
is to be of any real help
to the people he cares for,

2117
01:55:37,498 --> 01:55:41,368
it must come out of
the way he lives.

2118
01:55:41,436 --> 01:55:45,036
Not just from how much he knows
or how hard he works.

2119
01:55:45,106 --> 01:55:47,776
We live very close
together here,

2120
01:55:47,842 --> 01:55:50,152
patients and staff.

2121
01:55:50,211 --> 01:55:53,081
And we bring everything we are...

2122
01:55:53,981 --> 01:55:57,251
strong and weak, good and bad...

2123
01:55:57,985 --> 01:56:00,615
to the smallest act.

2124
01:56:00,688 --> 01:56:05,228
If we realize this
and accept and use it,

2125
01:56:05,293 --> 01:56:08,863
that's the only way I know
of reconciling ourselves

2126
01:56:08,929 --> 01:56:10,669
to the present trouble

2127
01:56:10,731 --> 01:56:14,941
and trying to prevent
its happening in the future.

2128
01:56:15,002 --> 01:56:18,912
Now as to the conduct
of the clinic,

2129
01:56:18,973 --> 01:56:22,083
my basic views haven't changed.

2130
01:56:22,143 --> 01:56:23,543
More than ever,

2131
01:56:23,611 --> 01:56:26,611
I believe the self-
government program

2132
01:56:26,681 --> 01:56:28,851
is inevitable and right.

2133
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:31,316
And the risks we take under it

2134
01:56:31,386 --> 01:56:33,846
with a patient like Steven Holte

2135
01:56:33,921 --> 01:56:35,921
are calculated and worthwhile.

2136
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:38,390
If I stay here...

2137
01:56:39,894 --> 01:56:41,834
I propose to continue and extend

2138
01:56:41,896 --> 01:56:44,096
the present program.

2139
01:56:45,666 --> 01:56:48,736
Whether I do or not
is for you to decide.

2140
01:57:18,999 --> 01:57:21,599
"Having been associated
with this clinic

2141
01:57:21,669 --> 01:57:26,039
"and many of its employees
for over 1/4 of a century,

2142
01:57:26,107 --> 01:57:27,777
"it is with a deep
feeling of regret

2143
01:57:27,842 --> 01:57:30,212
"and a sense of
great personal loss

2144
01:57:30,278 --> 01:57:33,578
"that for reasons of ill health,

2145
01:57:33,648 --> 01:57:36,578
"I submit to this board
my resignation

2146
01:57:36,651 --> 01:57:39,351
"as medical director of
the castle house clinic

2147
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:41,590
"for nervous disorders.

2148
01:57:41,656 --> 01:57:44,056
"Sincerely...

2149
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:47,455
Douglas N. Devanal, M.D."

2150
01:58:18,226 --> 01:58:21,156
We've covered a lot of ground,

2151
01:58:21,229 --> 01:58:22,999
for two people
who have forgotten

2152
01:58:23,063 --> 01:58:25,533
how to talk to each other.

2153
01:58:28,102 --> 01:58:30,242
What do we do now?

2154
01:58:32,273 --> 01:58:35,083
Try to...
Help each other

2155
01:58:35,142 --> 01:58:37,712
as much as we can.

2156
01:58:37,778 --> 01:58:40,248
Be as honest as we can.

2157
01:59:05,273 --> 01:59:07,313
Stevie!

2158
01:59:14,715 --> 01:59:17,585
I... Came back.

2159
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:21,420
You all right?

2160
01:59:21,489 --> 01:59:24,659
Came back...
For an explanation.

2161
01:59:24,725 --> 01:59:25,625
Explanation?

2162
01:59:25,693 --> 01:59:27,833
Where the devil have you been?

2163
01:59:27,895 --> 01:59:29,625
Waiting here for hours.

2164
01:59:29,697 --> 01:59:31,867
Where have you been?

2165
01:59:31,932 --> 01:59:34,642
Do you realize everybody's
been looking for you,

2166
01:59:34,702 --> 01:59:36,502
been dragging
the river all night?

2167
01:59:36,571 --> 01:59:37,341
Too bad.

2168
01:59:37,405 --> 01:59:38,805
What do you mean?

2169
01:59:38,873 --> 01:59:40,143
They won't find me.

2170
01:59:40,207 --> 01:59:42,277
They'll find you, all right.

2171
01:59:42,343 --> 01:59:44,953
I'll throw you back in myself.

2172
01:59:48,416 --> 01:59:50,346
It's all right, it's all right.

2173
01:59:50,418 --> 01:59:53,288
Come on, Stevie,
you can make it.

2174
01:59:56,090 --> 01:59:58,830
I made it...
Didn't I?

2175
01:59:58,893 --> 02:00:00,333
That's right, Stevie.

2176
02:00:00,395 --> 02:00:02,795
You made it.

2177
02:00:10,938 --> 02:00:12,508
Oh, say...

2178
02:00:12,573 --> 02:00:14,313
could... could you
get hold of sue?

2179
02:00:14,375 --> 02:00:16,105
Tell her I'm all right?

2180
02:00:16,176 --> 02:00:17,106
Yeah, sure.

2181
02:00:17,177 --> 02:00:18,407
Explain to her?

2182
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:20,319
She's got a lot of
anxieties, you know.

2183
02:00:20,381 --> 02:00:21,481
Yeah, I know, I know.

2184
02:00:21,549 --> 02:00:24,049
Tell her I still got her bell.

2185
02:00:24,118 --> 02:00:26,288
What's Dr. Carmody's
phone number?

2186
02:00:26,354 --> 02:00:28,394
It's in the book.

2187
02:00:28,456 --> 02:00:30,786
Just... Thought I'd
lie down a minute.

2188
02:00:34,629 --> 02:00:37,159
You ever almost
drowned yourself?

2189
02:00:37,231 --> 02:00:38,871
No.

2190
02:00:38,933 --> 02:00:40,543
It's just silly.

2191
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:42,901
I'll never do it again.

2192
02:00:53,681 --> 02:00:55,451
Oh, hi.

2193
02:00:55,516 --> 02:00:57,946
Is he going to be all right?

2194
02:00:58,018 --> 02:00:59,118
Yeah, mark.

2195
02:00:59,186 --> 02:01:01,516
I think he's going to be fine.

2196
02:01:14,469 --> 02:01:17,269
You know, mark, uh...

2197
02:01:17,338 --> 02:01:20,008
Sometimes it's
easier for a doctor

2198
02:01:20,074 --> 02:01:22,444
to take care of his patients

2199
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:25,450
than... Than someone of his own.

2200
02:01:25,513 --> 02:01:28,923
I know, dad.
That's your job.

2201
02:01:43,398 --> 02:01:45,528
Can I help you?

2202
02:01:47,067 --> 02:01:48,997
You have.

2203
02:02:28,843 --> 02:02:33,853
I seem to... Keep running
into these things.
