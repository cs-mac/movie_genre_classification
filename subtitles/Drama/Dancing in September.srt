1
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,900
J'aime beaucoup
de choses à la campagne.

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,700
J'aime les fleurs, j'aime les arbres.

3
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,800
Um...

4
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,100
Et quoi d'autre ?

5
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,500
Quoi d'autre ?

6
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,500
Oui, les collines peut-être ?
Les animaux, les oiseaux.

7
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,000
Oui, oui.

8
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,500
Et pensez-vous que la campagne est
plus tranquille que la ville ? Par exemple.

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,600
Oui, mais pas assez excitante.

10
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,000
- Uh, quand j'ai venu ici...
- Quand je suis venue.

11
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Oh, gosh. How many times
have I made that mistake ?

12
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,000
It's common among my pupils.
It's what they most often get wrong.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, what's the difference ?

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,200
If and when I ever get to visit Paris again,
I'll have long forgotten all my French.

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,300
- I must be going.
- No !

16
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,800
Stay. It's still early.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,900
- I mean, what are you gonna do at home ?
- Nothing special.

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,300
Right. I mean, how many times
can you putter around the garden ?

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
God !

20
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,800
I can't believe my mother.

21
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
She's out there...

22
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,000
She's made friends with Peter and
is trying to get him to write her biography.

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,000
Her stupid life. "As told to."

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,500
Oh, come on, now.
She'll be gone in a couple of days.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,100
Yeah, that's what you said last week.
Time passes and she's still here.

26
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Oh, look at this. She will not stop picking
the flowers, which I asked her not to do.

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,500
She doesn't even put them in water,
so of course they die.

28
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,100
Walking around in a snit
is not gonna make the time go any faster.

29
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,100
When I ask Peter if he wants to go for a
drive or walk, he's busy writing his novel.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,600
But he's got plenty of time
to stroll around the lake with her.

31
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,400
- You must admit she tells funny stories.
- See ? Men.

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,000
She certainly hasn't lost her knack.

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,400
- Somehow I thought Peter'd be different.
- Lane, it's your mother.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,100
- Is that when you dated Errol Flynn ?
- Oh, I was too old for Errol Flynn.

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,500
I mean, I met him when I was 16.

36
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,900
For Errol, 15 was over the hill.

37
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,300
Lane, I invited the Richmonds for drinks
tonight. I thought we might have a party.

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,100
What did you do that for ? Peter and I were
supposed to see the new Kurosawa film.

39
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
- Sorry. Why didn't you say something ?
- I did.

40
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,200
That's OK. We can catch it another night.

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,800
OK, but it's only there tonight.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
- Where was I ?
- How we met.

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,600
Oh ! Lt was like a bad movie.
We both hailed the same taxicab.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,200
- We shared a cab and fell in love.
- And I know nothing about physics.

45
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,100
- So what did you talk about ?
- Talk ? By the time the meter hit $3...

46
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,800
- .. she had her tongue in my ear.
- Oh ! Lloyd !

47
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,900
How nice. I drop in to visit my daughter
and she has a writer renting her cottage.

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,700
I'm trying to write.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,700
I think my life story
would make a sure-fire bestseller.

50
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,200
I know. I remember reading
about your exploits in the paper.

51
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,400
You're too young, but anything,
whatever your dad read, it's all true.

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
No, I remember your picture in the long
defunct New York Journal-American...

53
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,300
.. with an actor named
Jeff Chandler, who you dated.

54
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,400
What a memory.

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
What a memory ! That was Palm Beach !

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,500
I love Palm Beach !

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,200
That's where Lloyd and I were heading
when I decided to stop off to see Lane.

58
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Um... I hadn't seen her, you know,
since she... took the pills.

59
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,600
God, that had to be six, eight months ago.

60
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,300
Boy, what some people will do for love.

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,700
Or the lack of it.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Of course, I understand.
I mean, if you've never had something...

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,200
.. and then you experience it
and then it's taken away...

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Wow. Poor kid.

65
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Try and stroke the ball to the rhythm of
the music. It'll give you a smooth motion.

66
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,500
- Yeah, but the music's so fast.
- Keep it rhythmic, and keep your eye...

67
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,000
Steffie, Mrs Mason thinks
she's got me an offer on the house.

68
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,500
That's great. Congratulations.

69
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,800
Two. Not great. But,
after everything's paid off,...

70
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,300
.. there'd be something to put a down
payment on an apartment in New York.

71
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,200
I can get two for mine,
and it's half your acreage.

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,100
Well, I can't really afford to be choosy.

73
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,400
At least I have a customer.
I think. I hope, at least.

74
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,400
Don't give it away.
I can lend you what you need.

75
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,400
No, Howard. Oh, God, no.
Thank you, though.

76
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,400
No. You've been... You've been
incredible to me through all this,...

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,100
- .. but I've gotta try and get my own life...
- What can you do in New York ?

78
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't know. I...

79
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,500
Maybe my photography again. I was...

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,100
Or sometimes I think
about writing, but I don't know.

81
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,800
It's awful, isn't it, at my age
to be floundering around so ?

82
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I just... I don't know what I want.

83
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,500
A child. I'd love to have a child.

84
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,300
Lane, did you, by any chance,
finish those chapters I gave you ?

85
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,400
- Yeah, almost. They're wonderful.
- I thought about them. I'm discouraged.

86
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,800
- You shouldn't be. You're wrong.
- I just wanna start over, again.

87
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,900
You can't tear up
everything you write, you know.

88
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,600
Otherwise of course you have
to take tranquillisers to calm down.

89
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,300
It seems so futile.
I was supposed to be finished by now.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,500
Next week is Labor Day.
I have to be back at my job the day after.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,900
If you wouldn't let
my mother seduce you...

92
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,400
Now, her life would make
a fascinating book.

93
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,400
Why ? What's so fascinating
about her frivolous existence ?

94
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,200
That she left my father,
who was a wonderful man,...

95
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,600
.. for a gangster who beat her up ?
You think that's compelling ?

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Was it the shooting ? That wasn't
fascinating. That was pathetic.

97
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,200
Maybe it's that she's a survivor, and
the book I'm writing is about surviving.

98
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,300
You're right. She went on with her life,
but I get stuck with the nightmares.

99
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,700
Excuse me. Uh...

100
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,300
Diane wanted some ice cubes
and you seem to be out.

101
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,700
Um, there's a... there's an ice machine
just outside the back door.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And you're wrong to think your mother
didn't suffer terribly over that whole affair.

103
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Right. Poor thing

104
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,900
She experienced a little hearing loss
in her left ear from the gunshot.

105
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Noise trauma.

106
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,900
The only point I wanted to make -
and I didn't mean to upset you -

107
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,000
.. is that some people are survivors and
some let life's tragedies annihilate them.

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,000
- This is just one of the cruelties of living.
- And in your book that idea is moving.

109
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,400
But the story of a 14-year-old girl
who kills her mother's lover is... sleazy.

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,800
And the trial was sleazy
and he was sleazy.

111
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,200
And my mother was
completely unconcerned.

112
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,500
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,900
I'm sorry. I'll get you those pages.

114
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,300
And they're good, you know, despite what
you think. I won't let you tear them up.

115
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,200
- Very good. I'm very impressed.
- You liked that ?

116
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,500
Oh !

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,100
I didn't know
you were a pool player.

118
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,800
Now you know.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Did you ever get a chance
to play that record I got you ?

120
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

121
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,100
I play it all the time.

122
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,900
It's so beautiful.
I was just listening to it last night.

123
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Somehow I knew you'd like it.

124
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,500
Did I hear you say
your book was about survival ?

125
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,200
Yeah, well, it's not really about survival.
It's about, you know. It's about everything.

126
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Oh, really ?
Like the Encyclopaedia Britannica.

127
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,000
Excuse me.
I'd better get those papers and work.

128
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,700
Howard, it's so unlike you to be rude.

129
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,700
We don't need another book on survival.
We already have the Boy Scout manual.

130
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,000
Lane says he's talented.

131
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,100
Well, if he's such a hotshot, why's he
wasting his life on Madison Avenue ?

132
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,900
It's because writing beer and
deodorant ads is more within his grasp.

133
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm surprised at you.
You're the kindest man,...

134
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,400
.. and you can't bring yourself to say
one good word about Peter.

135
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
He's OK. I don't mean he's a bad person.

136
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,000
But I can't stand that Lane
gets so moonstruck over his line.

137
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,100
- I mean, she blushes when he's around.
- Now you sound jealous.

138
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,700
What's the difference ?
She's going away anyhow.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,900
I knew that was bothering you.

140
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,900
If you could have seen her at the
beginning of the year when she came up.

141
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,600
She was in such bad shape. She needed
someone to take care of her so badly.

142
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,800
She's very fragile.

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,100
We used to spend
long afternoons together,...

144
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,000
.. winter evenings listening to music.

145
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,900
It was such a pleasure watching her gain
strength and begin to enjoy things more.

146
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,600
I remember one night I was home alone
after we'd seen a movie together...

147
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,000
.. and I noticed that I missed her and
I couldn't wait to see her the next day.

148
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,600
And that's when I realised
I never wanted her to leave here.

149
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,100
- Oh, Howard.
- Thank you.

150
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,200
I never said anything. I knew she was
through a terrible time and not over it.

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,900
I didn't think she was ready to hear
that someone had become...

152
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,100
.. dependent on her.

153
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,000
I didn't want to...

154
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,700
I didn't want to say anything that would
frighten her or cause her any confusion.

155
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,800
Well, after all,
I am much older than she is.

156
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,400
So in the end I hedged and
procrastinated and... obsessed over her.

157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,600
And over the right moment to speak.

158
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,600
Next thing I knew
she was in love with that tenant,...

159
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,900
.. that sensitive young man who
suddenly started occupying all her time.

160
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Well,...

161
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,300
.. one can see how
having Peter on the premises, just...

162
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,000
- - .. just the two of them for seven weeks,...

163
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,600
.. how she could fall very much in love.

164
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,600
Never thought I could
feel this way after Karen died.

165
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Hello ?

166
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,300
Steffie ! Lt's your husband.
He says it's important.

167
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,200
Lane's changed towards me.

168
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,900
She used to get such a kick out of me.

169
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,700
She used to laugh at my jokes
and tell me how pretty I looked.

170
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,700
She's become so angry.

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,900
What do you think, honey ?
This or the pink one, with the jacket ?

172
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
- This one.
- You're the boss.

173
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,900
Hey. Hey !

174
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,500
Come here. Where you goin', huh ?

175
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,600
Boy, oh boy ! Am I lucky I hailed that taxi !

176
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,200
You're the only man I've known
worth marrying since Lane's father.

177
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,400
The others were just nothin' !

178
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,100
Just nothin'. And the proof is, when
they asked me to marry 'em, I said no.

179
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,800
- I'm the lucky one.
- You, lucky ?

180
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
You inherited a machine
that's grinding to a halt.

181
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,200
Between my ulcers and
my gall bladder and my angina...

182
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,400
The whole is greater than
the sum of the parts. Remember ? Hm ?

183
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
Said the bishop to the showgirl.

184
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,500
- Sorry.
- No, come in.

185
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
- You wanted to borrow this pin ?
- Oh, yeah.

186
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,500
But I've decided on a whole other outfit
so I don't think I'll need it.

187
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,600
- It's lovely. Where'd you get it ?
- You gave it to me.

188
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,600
I did ? What taste !

189
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,500
- Doesn't Diane look stunning ?
- She looks great.

190
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,000
Try to have a good time tonight.
You don't wanna turn into a recluse.

191
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
I just really didn't feel up to
having people over tonight.

192
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,800
You have to learn
to put the past behind you.

193
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,000
What's done is done.

194
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
It's easy to say.

195
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,600
I know you wanted to go
to the movies with Peter.

196
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,900
Is he a good writer ? I mean, seriously,
could he write my biography ?

197
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,200
- Oh, Mom, don't be foolish.
- Foolish ? I've been offered good money.

198
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,300
Peter's trying to write a serious book.
You shouldn't be distracting him.

199
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,300
God, he's always asking me
millions of questions.

200
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,700
I don't think your memoirs
are something you wanna make public.

201
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
Really ? I'm not ashamed of my life.

202
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,400
Your mother was offered
quite an advance.

203
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,800
Then she should find somebody else
to write it. And leave me and Dad out of it.

204
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,600
I can't leave you out of it.
That's the part everybody's interested in.

205
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,300
You're exploiting an ugly situation.

206
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,100
You've become so touchy lately.

207
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,200
I mean, if your life hasn't worked out,
stop blaming me for it.

208
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,200
Take the bull by the horns.
Make something happen.

209
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,400
I'm sorry. Not everybody's
a human dynamo like you.

210
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Your mother does have
remarkable energy.

211
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,200
You were such a promising young girl,
so bright, and you had my looks.

212
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,800
Well, you had better bone structure
than I did, but you lacked my height.

213
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,600
And you had your father's intelligence.

214
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,100
You gotta do something about all that.
I mean, you're young, you're lovely.

215
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,700
Of course, you dress like a Polish refugee.

216
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,900
I don't feel too attractive these days.

217
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,000
Peter thinks you're beautiful.
And he's right.

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,800
- Does he ?
- He sings your praises.

219
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
He's probably just being polite.

220
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,000
You really like him, don't you ?

221
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,600
- I don't know.
- You've gotta be a little cool about it.

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,400
- You shouldn't let your desperation show.
- I don't think I have.

223
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,300
I always felt there was a fatal element
of hunger in your last affair.

224
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
That's not true.

225
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,100
I don't think Jeff would have run
quite so quickly back to his wife...

226
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,100
.. if he didn't feel a certain pressure.

227
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,700
I sensed it.

228
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,100
His name was Jack. And you were never
here, so you don't know what happened.

229
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Darling, don't be so defensive.

230
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,500
I base this observation
on the time I saw you together.

231
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,900
And I'm not saying anything different than
those high-priced psychiatrists have said.

232
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,400
When it comes to men, you're probably
doing something to stand in your way.

233
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,900
- I probably am.
- Yeah.

234
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,500
Well, this is out.
Looks like I'm going to a luau !

235
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,600
Oh, my God. Look at me.

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I gotta redo my whole make-up.

237
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,200
It's hell, gettin' older.

238
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,300
Especially when you feel 21 inside.

239
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,700
All the strengths that sustain you
all through your life...

240
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,300
.. just vanish one by one.

241
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,300
And you study your face
in the mirror and you...

242
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,200
You notice something is missing.

243
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,600
And then you realise it's your future.

244
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,800
So that's...

245
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,800
That's why I want you to find yourself...

246
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,000
.. while there's still time left to enjoy it.

247
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

248
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
- I guess I'm early.
- The guests haven't arrived yet.

249
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,100
Well, you look wonderful, all dressed up.

250
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
It's starting to rain.

251
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Maybe it'll cool things off.

252
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
Let's hope.

253
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Well, you look lovely.
I said that !

254
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,900
Thank you.

255
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,900
- Did you know the, um...
- Steffie...

256
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,000
- Sorry. What were you gonna say ?
- No. What ?

257
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,300
- You looked like you were...
- No, nothing.

258
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,300
Thunder's getting close.

259
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,700
Yeah.

260
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,100
So, who's the history professor ?

261
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,600
The history professor ? How did you know
about that ? Did we talk about that ?

262
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,500
Well, you mentioned to me one time that
that might be the title of your book.

263
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,300
The history professor was my father.

264
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,200
He taught at a college
in Connecticut and he...

265
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
.. he was fired during the McCarthy era.

266
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,500
He was blacklisted. He had to do
all kinds of things to keep us going.

267
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
Like what ?

268
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,800
He supported us by playing poker
and betting the horses.

269
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,100
He sounds wonderful.

270
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
Yeah, he was.

271
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,500
I see what you mean by a survivor.

272
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,100
This summer went by too fast.

273
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
I had such high hopes for this book.

274
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
To tell you the truth, I'm floundering.

275
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,500
Is this the first time
you've tried to write a book ?

276
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,100
Oh, I've published a couple of short
stories. Nothing... Nothing any good.

277
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,400
I've never been able to do it full time. I've
always been busy with other obligations.

278
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,500
You don't want to hear about all this.

279
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,100
You know, Lane showed me
some of your short stories and...

280
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,400
.. I thought they were wonderful.

281
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,000
It's funny.

282
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,200
I've wanted to talk to you so often,...

283
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
.. but we never seem to be alone.

284
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,900
We were alone.
We were alone for a whole afternoon.

285
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Running into you at the local
flea market is not exactly private.

286
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,100
Well, we walked around together.
You didn't say anything.

287
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,300
No, I didn't, did I ?

288
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,700
Well, I felt awkward.

289
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,900
At least you liked the record I found you
so it wasn't a complete waste of time.

290
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,500
It's so funny because I used to be in love
with a boy who just idolised Art Tatum.

291
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,300
Well, this was years ago
on my first visit to Paris.

292
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,300
He was a student and he played piano
in a jazz club in the student quarter.

293
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
He didn't speak any English.

294
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,600
And we spent a summer trying to make
each other understand our feelings.

295
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,700
The funny thing was it didn't matter
that we only knew a few words.

296
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,100
Oh, anyway, that was years ago.

297
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,100
I hate thunder. I don't care how harmless
it is, I wanna get under the bed !

298
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
- The air is full of electricity.
- I'm serious !

299
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,800
- Where is everyone ? I heard voices.
- Hi.

300
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,600
- How do I look ? Don't say "old and fat".
- Great.

301
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,300
Great. What time
do the guests arrive ?

302
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,800
Any minute. Let's get some more lights
on. Did Lane make any hors d'oeuvres ?

303
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,600
What were you two doing
before we came down ?

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Excuse me ? What ?

305
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,300
I hope you weren't out on the porch.
That lightning's getting close.

306
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,100
- Oh, no.
- No.

307
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,100
- Let's have some music.
- All right. Who wants what ?

308
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,300
- Well, you know about me. Peter ?
- Vodka.

309
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,500
- Stephanie, what do you want ?
- Vodka, please.

310
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,700
Have you given any more thought
about my memoirs ?

311
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,400
They deserve better than me. They're
too good to waste on a fledgling writer.

312
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,200
You're patronising me.

313
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,100
- Lane says you think my life is trivial.
- I never said that.

314
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,100
- Lloyd, come on, dance with me.
- Oh, honey, I'm such a stiff.

315
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,900
If you can figure out the universe,
you can figure out the box step.

316
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,300
All right.

317
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,200
See, there ? You're terrific.

318
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,400
- I try.

319
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,100
I had so many things
I wanted to say to you.

320
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,200
Oh, well, it's, you know... There are
people coming over and people here, so...

321
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,100
- I don't wanna be pushy.
- No, you're not pushy.

322
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,800
I wish you'd been here
for the whole summer.

323
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Yeah, well, I couldn't.
I have obligations, too, so...

324
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,900
What is that record ? Lt's terrific !

325
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
It's Art Tatum and Ben Webster.

326
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,600
- It's funny.
- What ?

327
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,200
I made a complete fool
out of myself when I met you.

328
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,700
- No ! You didn't.
- I remember carrying on at great length...

329
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,800
.. about writing and metaphor and choice.

330
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,900
- I left no cliché unturned.
- No. Actually I just... No, I...

331
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I just thought you were so sweet.

332
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,900
You reminded me of Paul,
the boy that I knew in Paris.

333
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,900
- Really ?
- Yeah.

334
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm very flattered.

335
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,000
Which one is Art Tatum
and which is Ben Webster ?

336
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,200
Art Tatum's the piano.

337
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,100
See, and I always felt foolish
all the time because...

338
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,600
- Why ?
- .. I was very taken with you right off.

339
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,200
I love all the music from that era. You
don't have any Benny Goodman, do you ?

340
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Uh, not here.

341
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000
Or Coon-Sanders Nighthawks ?

342
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,500
- Now, please don't panic when I say this.
- No.

343
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,500
I just think that you're incredibly lovely.

344
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,700
Peter, don't. Don't, please.
Let's just stop this before it's too late.

345
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,300
You know, I can't.

346
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,000
I just... I just feel flushed
and... and my heart is pounding.

347
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,100
- - Oh, there are the Richmonds.

348
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Get it, will you, Lloyd ?

349
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,000
- Oh, Howard !
- Oh, it's pouring out there.

350
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,200
We were expecting the Richmonds.
Let me get you a drink.

351
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,300
Hi, Howard. Hi. Oh, the Richmonds
must be stuck. You're wet.

352
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,300
Yes, I know.

353
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,300
Look, my old Ouija board ! Look !

354
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,800
They take too long. What you want
is a computerised Ouija board.

355
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,300
That way you can punch up
any dead person you wanna talk to.

356
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,800
- Howard, you did say Scotch ?
- Ask Lane to dance with you.

357
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,200
- Me ?
- Mm-hm. She'll be thrilled.

358
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,700
- She's got a big crush on you.
- I don't dance.

359
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,700
That's what everybody says.
Come on. She's been so blue.

360
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
- Lane ?
- Yes ?

361
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,200
Go ahead. Go ahead !

362
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,800
Uh, Lane, uh, Peter was just asking me...

363
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
.. if I'd ask you to dance with him.

364
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Oh ! No, thank you.

365
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,900
Oh, yes, thank you.
That music is fabulous !

366
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,100
I used to go to Harlem
to hear music like that.

367
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,700
I was dating a disc jockey.
He used to call records "sides".

368
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,900
- - I have two left feet.

369
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
I'll get that. I'll get it.
You just enjoy yourselves.

370
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,400
- Is she bothering you ?
- No, not at all.

371
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,400
- I like her energy.
- It's the record you got at the flea market.

372
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,600
- I didn't know you liked jazz.
- You like Prokofiev.

373
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,700
Yeah, but not to dance to.

374
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,900
The Richmonds aren't coming.
Their house is flooded.

375
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,700
Really ? Then maybe
we can go to the Kurosawa film.

376
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,000
- In this storm ?
- Well, you know, maybe.

377
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,300
Let's not let it kill our evening.

378
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,800
The Richmonds aren't coming.
We're lucky. They're so boring !

379
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,000
- Then why did you invite them ?
- Uh-oh. Oh, God !

380
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,000
- This could last for hours.
- Lloyd.

381
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,900
- Just light some candles.
- OK. I'll get some matches.

382
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,000
I love walking around
in the pitch-black.

383
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,300
I think I put my hand in the guacamole.

384
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Lloyd ! The Richmonds are
flooded, the electricity's gone off.

385
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,200
God is testing us and l, for one,
am gonna be ready. Where's the vodka ?

386
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,200
T.

387
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
O.

388
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,300
M.

389
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
I don't know any Toms.

390
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,100
Oh, wait a minute.

391
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,200
Are you that dentist in Hackensack
that tried to rape me when I was 15 ?

392
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,600
No ? OK.

393
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,000
OK.

394
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,100
One more try.

395
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,000
N.

396
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Ooh, I.

397
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,000
C.

398
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,600
Oh, God. Nick.

399
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,500
Wait a minute. Are you in this room ?

400
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,600
Is your ghost in this room,
bullet hole an' all ?

401
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,000
You were so bad.

402
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,800
But so gorgeous.

403
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,400
Do you still comb your hair
like you were in Sicily ?

404
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,500
Well, we had some good times.

405
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,800
It was hectic.

406
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,900
It was dangerous.

407
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,300
And then it ended.

408
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,500
I think it's clearing up.

409
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,600
Yeah ?

410
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Please don't move away from here.

411
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,800
I have to.

412
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,900
You know, I should never drink.
My head really spins.

413
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,700
How are you gonna drive home ?

414
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,800
Same way I always do:

415
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,900
.. thinking about you.

416
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,100
You know, in all the time I've known you
I don't think I've ever seen you drink.

417
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,100
No.

418
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,600
Although the year after my wife died
I was never sober.

419
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,900
Of course, on the faculty of the school
where I work, it's... hard to tell.

420
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm gonna miss you so much.

421
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,900
I'm gonna miss you, too,...

422
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,500
.. but we'll always stay in touch.

423
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,900
You know what I'm saying.

424
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,100
Howard, please.

425
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,900
I have to...

426
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,100
When you got that offer today
to sell the house, I...

427
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,500
.. I realised suddenly...

428
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,600
.. we wouldn't be sharing
those winter evenings again.

429
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,900
Yeah, but you knew I was only up here
to get well, and not permanently.

430
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Is the difference in our ages
awkward for you ?

431
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,600
I'm in love with Peter.

432
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,400
Isn't that the most ridiculous thing ?

433
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,300
Considering I don't think
I even have a chance with him.

434
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,000
I did for a while.

435
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,000
I keep telling myself that maybe
it'll still work out all right somehow.

436
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,400
And why Peter and not you ?

437
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,400
No reason worthy of you.

438
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,400
How often I've wanted to touch you.

439
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,700
Please. Please, don't.

440
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,800
Now that I've embarrassed us both...

441
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,000
Let me make you some coffee. You're
gonna have a terrible hangover tomorrow.

442
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,100
I don't play this game that well
in the light, let alone the dark.

443
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Look how much it's cleared up.

444
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
You can see a billion stars.

445
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,800
It should be nice tomorrow.

446
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,800
So tell me,...

447
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,800
.. is it true you worked on
the atomic bomb ?

448
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,800
No.

449
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,300
Did Diane tell you that ?

450
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,200
Yes.

451
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,300
Not at all.

452
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,700
I did one small, unrelated project
at Los Alamos many years ago.

453
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,400
But when she's describing me to people
I'm the father of the A-bomb.

454
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,400
What branch of physics
are you involved with ?

455
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Something much more terrifying
than blowing up the planet.

456
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
Really ?

457
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Is there anything more terrifying
than the destruction of the world ?

458
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Yeah.

459
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,500
The knowledge that it doesn't
matter one way or the other.

460
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,900
That it's all random.

461
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,000
Originating aimlessly out of nothing and...

462
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
.. eventually vanishing for ever.

463
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,600
I'm not talking about the world.

464
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm talking about the universe.

465
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,400
All space, all time, just...

466
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,100
.. a temporary convulsion.

467
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,300
And I get paid to prove it.

468
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,400
You feel sure of that, when
you look out on a night like tonight...

469
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,700
.. and see all those millions of stars ?
That none of it matters ?

470
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,000
I think it's just as beautiful as you do.

471
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,800
And vaguely evocative of some deep truth
that always just keeps slipping away.

472
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,800
But then my professional
perspective overcomes me,...

473
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,000
.. a less wishful,
more penetrating view of it,...

474
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,000
.. and I understand it for what it truly is.

475
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,100
Haphazard,...

476
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,100
.. morally neutral...

477
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,600
.. and unimaginably violent.

478
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,900
Look, we shouldn't have
this conversation.

479
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,800
I have to sleep alone tonight.

480
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,500
That's why I cling to Diane...

481
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,900
.. and consider myself very lucky.

482
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,000
She's warm and vital
and holds me while I sleep.

483
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,600
That way I don't have to dream of
photons and quarks.

484
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
I have a question for you, Richard.

485
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,500
Your daughter hates me.

486
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,700
Our daughter...

487
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
.. hates me, and I love her.

488
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,500
She's my one child,...

489
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,100
.. and I want her to be happy.

490
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,400
She never got over
the shooting, you know.

491
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,800
See, now, I'm a tough cookie.

492
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,400
I can file and forget.

493
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,900
Rap once if you hear me, Richard.

494
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,800
I want her to forgive me.

495
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,200
So you speak to her. OK, Richard ?

496
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,000
You two were so close.

497
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,700
She loved you so much.

498
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
You rap if you hear me, Richard.

499
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,300
Rap, Richard.

500
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,400
Rap once.

501
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
Rap.

502
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,400
I love those old songs.

503
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,800
Between the music,
the candlelight and the drinks,...

504
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,000
.. it feels like we're in some exotic place.

505
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Mm.

506
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,000
I should never drink. My head swims.

507
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,400
What are you doing ?

508
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,200
I've wanted to touch your face
since the first time we met.

509
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
What do you want me to say to you ?

510
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,900
Soon we'll be going
in separate directions.

511
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,000
Peter, you must know
that this is impossible.

512
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,800
Lane is my best friend. She's crazy about
you. I don't think I could ever do that.

513
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,300
- And she's become so attached to you.
- Please.

514
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,700
I already feel guilty enough
because I led her on.

515
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,300
Not on purpose. I just wasn't
thinking about anyone but myself.

516
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,400
She's told me about
all the time you spent together.

517
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,000
I know about all your walks and talks
by the lake, under the stars.

518
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,400
She's told me all that.

519
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,900
I felt very lonely.

520
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,200
I needed some company,
and my marriage broke up.

521
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I was losing confidence
that I could write this book.

522
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,300
I needed a voice
to keep me from panicking.

523
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,200
But you made love together.

524
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,800
I didn't understand how vulnerable
she was until it was too late.

525
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,000
I know it's my fault.

526
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,400
Would you... Would you have become
serious about her if I hadn't come along ?

527
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,600
I don't know. Maybe.

528
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,900
You do funny things
when you feel empty inside.

529
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,900
Look,...

530
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,700
.. I'm married.

531
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,200
You know, my kids come home
from camp in a week. I have a life.

532
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
I know.

533
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,500
But is it the life you want ?

534
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,300
Is it ?

535
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,300
- You've been flirting with me for weeks.
- Please, just go away.

536
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,300
My husband's a wonderful man.

537
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,600
Oh, he's bewildered
because I wanted this summer apart.

538
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,900
He's a radiologist.

539
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,100
He takes X-rays, but...

540
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,300
.. I never let him take them of me
because, if he looked inside, he'd...

541
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,100
.. he'd see things that he wouldn't
understand and he'd be terribly hurt.

542
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,100
Somewhere along the line I just...

543
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,400
.. I just started going through
the motions of my life.

544
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,900
Steffie...

545
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,000
I've just... I've just longed so
to hear certain things said to me again.

546
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,500
I want so much to respond,
but I can only run.

547
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,200
- Don't run.
- I can only run.

548
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,300
That's all I can do.

549
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,000
I knew you cared about me.

550
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,100
That's why I couldn't look at you when
you were around because I felt so guilty.

551
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,100
I wanna kiss you right now.

552
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,200
You can't. You can't because
there's too many problems.

553
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,500
This is just out of the question.

554
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,000
Out of the question.
We're gonna be discovered.

555
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,200
Just please go away.
It's out of the question.

556
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,800
Time for me to go home.

557
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,000
Sorry about the Kurosawa film.

558
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,500
I made some coffee before.
D'you want me to heat it up for you ?

559
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
No, thanks. I'd rather stay drunk.

560
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,900
Maybe you'd better.
I'm supposed to work tomorrow.

561
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,900
You've been in such
a strange mood all night.

562
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,300
Did you know that the universe
was haphazard, morally neutral...

563
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,700
.. and unimaginably violent ?

564
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,600
Peter...

565
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,600
What happened to us ?

566
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,100
What do you mean ?

567
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,900
You know, we were getting so close...

568
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,800
.. and we... we shared all that time...

569
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,600
.. and, um...

570
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,400
.. and that night at the lake...

571
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,800
I mean, did I... Am I misreading the signs ?

572
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,800
Maybe you did.

573
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,500
I can't let myself get involved right now.

574
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,700
I'm gun-shy from my marriage and...

575
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,300
.. I'm unsettled about my life, my work.

576
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,600
Can I help ?

577
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,000
They're my problems.
I don't wanna cause you any suffering.

578
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,600
You're doing so well.

579
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,000
You need to think about yourfuture.

580
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,200
Yeah, I know.

581
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,400
I know you're right. I...

582
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,200
It's silly, but I just...

583
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,900
You know, I have these dreams
that, when we're both in New York,...

584
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,800
.. you know, we'd...

585
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,100
I don't know.

586
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,800
You know, we just... We feel things
so similarly so much of the time,...

587
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,200
.. and that's so rare.

588
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,200
I don't... I'm sorry, I'm really tired.
I don't know what I'm saying.

589
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,200
The funny thing is that I'll probably
wind up calling you at 3am in New York...

590
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,100
.. to keep me from going off the deep end.

591
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,100
- Hi. Can I give you a hand there ?
- No, that's OK.

592
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,000
Listen, I had a talk with Peter.

593
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,700
And he doesn't wanna
get involved right now.

594
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,400
And that's OK. I understand that.

595
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,400
He's... You know,
he's got a lot of problems.

596
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,800
But I... But maybe things
will be different later on. You know ?

597
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,500
I'm glad that things are
out in the open anyway.

598
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,800
You know, I do feel better.

599
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,000
We'll both be living in New York.

600
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,700
Who knows ? You know,
anything could happen.

601
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,700
Who could that be ?

602
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Hello ?

603
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,500
Oh, Ken. No, she's right here.
One second.

604
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,800
Ken, listen. I told you the lights were out
and the phone was out. I couldn't call you !

605
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,300
Right. Yes.

606
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,900
I still don't know. I'm thinking about
spending some time in New York.

607
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,300
Please don't bring that up now.
It's late and I'm tired.

608
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,700
Let me call you tomorrow. Good night.

609
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,600
Oh, God.

610
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,100
I didn't know you were still here.

611
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,800
I heard your voice.

612
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,600
Peter, we're not alone.

613
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,400
Steffie, I love you.

614
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,300
From the first day.

615
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,600
We could be alone.

616
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,500
I can't spend the night in the guesthouse.

617
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,100
Maybe not the whole night,...

618
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,500
.. but we could have
some of it alone together.

619
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,800
Oh, God.

620
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,400
Would you ?

621
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,000
Look, if...

622
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,700
If this means anything to you,...

623
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,700
.. I really want to, but I...

624
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,900
I just love this room. It's just perfect.

625
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,300
We could knock this wall out
and make one big room.

626
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,700
- That's a thought.
- It's big enough as it is. I love the size.

627
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,800
OK, whatever.

628
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,700
- What about fishing ?
- The lake has bass, Lane told me.

629
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,100
Of course, you can always stock the lake.

630
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,900
It seems so inane to dump fish into a lake
just to pull 'em back out again.

631
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,300
- No dumber than golf !
- Your wife's not a golfer !

632
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,500
Gimme a break.

633
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,800
That's Diane Frazier. I used to have such
a crush on her when I'd see her picture.

634
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,100
- Diane Frazier ? Wasn't she...
- She was a model, playgirl.

635
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,600
She was always at the Stork Club
or El Morocco with some tennis player.

636
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,900
- Those people lead such exciting lives.
- Yes, don't they ?

637
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,700
- It's gonna be great to get out of the city.
- I'm so excited about buying a dog.

638
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,900
Our co-op doesn't permit dogs
and I've always wanted a pit bull.

639
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,300
I'd love to go upstairs
and take some measurements.

640
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,500
Lane, is it OK to go upstairs ?

641
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,000
Oh, well, my mother's
still sleeping up there.

642
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,600
- Really ?
- Yeah. She's a late sleeper.

643
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,100
I don't think I ever slept past noon.

644
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,800
- She'll be up soon.
- Maybe we could see the barn ?

645
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Could you show us the barn ?
I know Mr Raines has some questions.

646
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,600
OK. You know where it is, don't you ?
Just follow that path out of the house.

647
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,600
I'll join you in one second.
I just wanna finish up.

648
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,700
- They gonna buy ?
- Looks like it.

649
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,300
That's great.

650
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,500
Lane, Howard called, and the stand
that sells the corn you like is open again.

651
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,200
- He's gonna bring some over.
- Uh-huh.

652
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,700
What's the matter ?
Why are you so depressed ?

653
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,300
I just think about Peter all the time.

654
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,100
Lane, just don't. Don't.

655
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,300
I think he's gonna
write that book on my mother.

656
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,900
God.

657
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,700
They're all supposed to go out today
together. If she ever gets up.

658
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,900
Oh, she's up.
She said she'd be a little late.

659
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,600
- Lane, could I speak to you ?
- Yes.

660
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,100
- We need you to answer some questions.
- OK.

661
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,500
Their final offer is 175.

662
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,800
175 ? You said two !

663
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,200
That's as high as they'd go.
This area isn't what it was.

664
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,900
But I've really been counting
on that money.

665
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,600
- Are you sure ?
- I'm sorry.

666
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,800
- - Yeah ?

667
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

668
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,000
Um, Diane said they'd be a little late.
I'll let them know that you're here.

669
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,100
You've really been avoiding me.

670
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,700
I think you should leave
and go back to New York.

671
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,100
I'd like to know what's going on.

672
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,800
I'm having a hard time and, even
though she tries to hide it, Lane is, too.

673
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,100
- Don't say that.
- She thinks about you all the time.

674
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,800
- And you ?
- Naturally, I think about you.

675
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,200
And yet you avoid me.

676
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:31,500
- Will you write Diane's biography ?
- Believe it or not, I'm thinking about it.

677
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,400
Why ? What happened
to the book about your father ?

678
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,600
I know. I...

679
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,400
It just isn't coming. I told you that.

680
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,300
I've been beating my brains out
about it all summer long and I...

681
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,700
I don't know. It's lifeless.

682
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,100
And then I hear all these sensational
anecdotes and stories. You know ?

683
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,500
This woman's had an incredible life.
I mean, the shooting alone is a book.

684
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,500
- Lane doesn't want it written.
- I'm not so sure.

685
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,800
If I do it, I can protect her.
Somebody's gonna write it.

686
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,800
Look, Peter, just put yourself
in her place for one minute.

687
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,600
Here's this 14-year-old girl. Her mother
leaves her father, who Lane adored,...

688
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,500
.. and moves in with this thug, who beats
up Diane, and Lane ends up shooting him.

689
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:20,800
It's completely wrecked her life.
You don't wanna put her through it again.

690
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,200
You know, people staring at her
as she walks down the street.

691
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,200
I don't know.

692
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,300
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I don't...

693
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,500
I just feel so... guilt-ridden.

694
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,800
I'm just very tense.

695
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,600
Oh, Peter, please don't do this.

696
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,600
Oh...

697
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,400
Steffie.

698
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,700
Let's...

699
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,300
Let's go to Paris together.

700
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,100
"Let's go to Paris together."

701
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:11,200
My God. You really are
a writer, aren't you ?

702
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:19,400
This is why I have to stay away from you.
Because you just make my head... spin.

703
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,700
I just can't... I can't do this.

704
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,900
I can't...

705
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,500
Oh, my God.

706
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,300
- I guess we should have knocked.
- I always worry about rabies.

707
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,700
I read about a woman bitten by a squirrel
in Central Park and she got rabies.

708
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,800
Nothing like that
ever happens up here.

709
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,200
What bothers me are not the
raccoons but gnats. They drive you crazy.

710
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,900
You don't have a big
insect problem here, do you, Lane ?

711
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,900
Lane ?

712
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,000
- But you do have mosquitoes ?
- Naturally, with the pond.

713
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,900
Well, mosquitoes are rare.
Aren't they, Lane ?

714
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,100
- Lane ?
- It's... It's usually very pleasant.

715
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,800
- I imagine the frogs'd eat the mosquitoes.
- If the snakes don't eat the frogs !

716
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,600
Is it OK if we go upstairs ?

717
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,600
Yes, um...

718
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,900
Sorry. I'm getting a headache.
I'll rejoin you in a few minutes.

719
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,300
OK, but hurry. There are many questions
Mr and Mrs Raines have.

720
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,100
Yes. Now, what about hornets and bees ?

721
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,200
This is the country,
Mrs Raines, not midtown Manhattan.

722
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,300
Oh, my God. I just can't
believe that happened !

723
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,200
- It was my fault.
- Oh, Peter, please ! I just can't handle this !

724
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,200
Lane. Lane, I'm sorry.

725
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,600
Lane. Lane, I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

726
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,600
- Lane !
- Has this been going on long ?

727
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,400
No. No ! Please. Jesus.

728
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,600
- Are you in love with him ?
- It's not what you think.

729
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,200
- What do you mean ?
- Lane, I just don't know what I've done.

730
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,900
- I just don't know what I've...
- A lot of things make sense now.

731
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,600
There's nothing to make sense.
Absolutely nothing to make sense.

732
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,900
So many times I saw
you and Peter looking at each other.

733
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
No, don't do that. Just don't do that.

734
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,800
This is my fault. Stephanie's not to blame.

735
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,600
- Leave us alone.
- I'm sorry you found out like this.

736
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,500
There's nothing to find out.
You're making it worse.

737
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,200
There's not nothing.
Let's get this out on the table.

738
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,700
I want Steffie to go with me
to New York or Paris.

739
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,500
Peter, the summer's over. I'm going back
to Philadelphia. I miss my children.

740
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,400
I can't play these games.
I've been married too long. I just...

741
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,100
I don't know what I am.
I don't know what I've done.

742
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,400
I just... I'm not who I thought I was.

743
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm beginning to think
that antique fair will be too crowded.

744
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,900
You're getting cold feet
about driving to East Hope.

745
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,700
I am not. I just thought
today's the wrong day.

746
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,600
We could postpone it. You and Peter
could work on the book around here.

747
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,500
You know, Peter, I think we could do
a whole section on Las Vegas.

748
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,400
I know so many great
Sammy Davis stories. He's the best.

749
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,400
- Did ya tell Lane about our conversation ?
- Oh, yeah. Listen, darling.

750
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,500
Lloyd and I have decided
that we wanna live here.

751
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,700
This house is our idea of heaven.

752
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:43,300
I fell in love with it the moment
I stepped inside. It was like coming home.

753
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,900
I know you're off back to the city,
but whenever you wanna use it, it's yours.

754
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,400
You know, weekends
or the summertime. Whenever.

755
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,900
You're gonna need a sweater.
I better go up and get one.

756
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,700
I don't understand.

757
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,400
You know one of my first
projects ? I'm gonna put in a pool.

758
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,100
I never, ever liked the pond
because there's live things in there !

759
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,300
Your mother's a wonderful swimmer.

760
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,300
I took her swimming in Santa Fe.
She outdid everybody.

761
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,400
- She's got perfect legs for a bathing suit.
- What are you talking about ?

762
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,100
We're gonna move back here.

763
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,900
We've discussed it
and decided to move back here.

764
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,300
Lloyd loves Vermont
and I have always loved this house.

765
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,300
- And if...
- You can't move back here.

766
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,300
- Why not ?
- Because I'm about to sell this place.

767
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,500
- You're selling it ?
- I told you...

768
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:41,000
- Wait a minute. Since when ?
- I've mentioned this three times at least.

769
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,900
- You have ?
- Don't you ever listen to me when I talk ?

770
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,900
Do you only care about
what you have to say ?

771
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,000
Why are you getting so nasty ?

772
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,600
I got people here right now - buyers.
They're looking at it.

773
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,600
Well, Jesus, wherever they are, just go
and find them and tell them the sale is off.

774
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,800
- What ?
- You can't sell it. It's gonna be our home.

775
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,100
You can't tell me that now.

776
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,100
What are you talking about ?
This is the family house.

777
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,100
How can you sell this place ?
You don't own it.

778
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,400
- Well, who owns it ?
- Uh... I do.

779
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,600
Well, I mean, we do. You and me.
Your father and I bought it.

780
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:23,700
But you gave it to me years ago. I told you
then I might sell it and divide the money.

781
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,000
- You said great, you could use the cash.
- Was I sober when I gave it to you ?

782
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,000
- You said it was mine.
- To live in, darling, but not to sell.

783
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,700
To live in ? What does that mean ?
To maintain ? To repair ? To keep up ?

784
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,700
Am I the caretaker ?

785
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,600
I've said a lot of things in haste. When
it comes to practical matters, I'm a dodo.

786
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,500
I can't afford to move
without selling this house.

787
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,900
I've run up too many debts.
It's expensive being sick.

788
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,300
- Nobody's throwing you out in the cold.
- I've been counting on this money.

789
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,000
I haven't been working in two years.
I've used up everything. I've borrowed.

790
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,300
Darling, it's as simple as this:
my plans have changed.

791
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,800
- What ?!
- We want to settle here.

792
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,500
Your father and I bought this house.
He'd have wanted it to stay in the family.

793
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,500
- Can't we discuss this later ?
- You're such a phoney !

794
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,900
He bought the house, not you,
and I've kept it going !

795
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,100
- Lane !
- Couldn't you have just stayed away ?

796
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,400
Lloyd and I are not young.
We wanna settle.

797
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,500
Who knows ? Maybe we'll hate it
and in a year we'll move.

798
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,100
My life is just not worth all the trouble !

799
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,800
Everyone, just stop it !
Diane, Lane has been through so much.

800
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,600
- Don't get angry, sweetheart.
- She doesn't care what she says to me.

801
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,600
- Like I'm to blame for everything.
- You are !

802
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,600
- OK, calm down.
- I'm calm, Lloyd. I am calm.

803
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,800
We all make mistakes,
but what's done is done.

804
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,600
And if your life didn't turn out,
don't keep accusing me !

805
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:55,300
You're the one who pulled the trigger !
I only said what the lawyers told me to.

806
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,000
- What an absurd thing to say.
- It's not absurd. It's the truth !

807
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,700
I don't think this is the place
to have that discussion.

808
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,800
I'm just wrecked !
And you come and go with no guilt !

809
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,000
I don't wanna hear any more of this.
Stop it right now.

810
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,300
It's her excuse for a life wasted,
thrown away to spite me.

811
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:23,700
- That's not true !
- Yes ! Out of spite ! Pure spite !

812
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,100
Maybe things could have been different
for me if I didn't have to go through that !

813
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,100
- Excuse me. Could we see the attic ?
- Get out of here !

814
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,800
- Pardon me ?
- Get out of here ! Please, just leave !

815
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,900
- Diane ! Relax !
- Get out of here now !

816
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,500
- Diane, just relax.
- OK, take the house.

817
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,600
- I didn't realise it meant that much to you.
- That's enough.

818
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,300
I said she could have the house !
Now can we go ?

819
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,400
That's enough !

820
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,400
There are things I might do differently
if I had them to do over, but I don't.

821
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,500
My head is splitting open !

822
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,500
OK, I'm sorry for all the fuss.

823
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,900
We all make mistakes.

824
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,300
Lane, can I have the sleeping pills back ?

825
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,200
- I don't know where they are.
- They're not in the medicine cabinet.

826
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,800
- What's the difference ?
- That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

827
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,400
What are you talking about,
"what's the difference" ? Where are they ?

828
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,200
I have no reason to get up tomorrow.

829
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,900
Then you're just gonna
have to make up a reason.

830
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,900
What about your plans to move to New
York and set up a photography studio ?

831
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,900
You're so damn angry.

832
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,200
If I haven't made it as
a photographer by now, why would I ?

833
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,900
I don't know. You'll just
have to try harder, won't you ?

834
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So...

835
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,300
.. you and Peter are
in love with each other ?

836
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,100
We just became very attracted
to each other. These things happen.

837
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:07,200
- You knew how much I cared about him.
- It happened by itself. I didn't instigate it.

838
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:12,800
You know, we're all up here isolated from
the world. Unpredictable things happen.

839
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,900
The truth is...

840
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,300
.. I flirted with Peter,...

841
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,500
.. I wanted him to want me,...

842
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,400
.. but I didn't think it would go very far.

843
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:52,600
I just wanted to know
that I could be wanted.

844
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
And he seemed very challenging.

845
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,900
You know, he's very clever
and busy with his novel.

846
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,700
And he's charming and smart and...

847
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,900
Then slowly I began to see how...

848
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,100
.. very vulnerable he is and...

849
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,400
.. he's so uncertain.

850
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,600
And my heart went out to him.

851
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,800
And I began dreaming about him.

852
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,200
What's gonna happen ?
Are you gonna go away with him ?

853
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,100
I can't. No, I can't do that.

854
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,800
It's... It's not so easy
when you're married with... kids.

855
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,100
That's something I wouldn't know.

856
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,300
Now give me those pills.

857
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,900
Tomorrow will come
and you'll find some distractions.

858
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,900
You'll get rid of this place.
You'll move back to the city.

859
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,800
You'll work. You'll fall in love.

860
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,900
And maybe it'll work out
and maybe it won't.

861
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,900
But you'll find a million petty things
to keep you going,...

862
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,700
.. and distractions
to keep you from focusing on the...

863
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,300
On the truth.

864
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,600
I don't know what the truth is
and you don't either.

865
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,500
I just wanna swallow all of this Valium.

866
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Well, it's hard to die from Valium.
It takes about a million.

867
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:34,300
- I'll take 'em all.
- Stop it. Stop it.

868
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,200
You're behaving like a petulant child.

869
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,000
If you really wanted to die,
you would have done that the last time.

870
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,200
I'm so lonely.

871
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,200
OK, stop it, and just give me the pills.

872
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,700
You really wanna die ?

873
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,700
No.

874
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,800
No.

875
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:04,600
That's my problem.
I... I always wanted to live.

876
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,500
Where the hell is everybody ?

877
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,500
Where is everybody ? Boy, the going
gets rough and everybody vanishes.

878
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:22,400
Lane, we're leaving !

879
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,800
Lane ! God, I hate this outfit. I look
like one of the Hundred Neediest Cases.

880
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,700
You look beautiful.

881
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,700
You know, I'm gonna miss this place.

882
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,800
Hadn't realised how pretty it was up here.

883
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,500
It's so tranquil.

884
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,300
And it's been in the family for so long.

885
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,900
It's the closest thing
I can think of to roots.

886
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,300
It might have been nice.

887
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,500
Dear, it's my age talking.

888
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,900
Never mind.

889
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,900
Never mind. It's not in the cards.

890
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,400
Palm Beach will be fine.

891
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,400
The place is unimportant
as long as we're together.

892
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,600
Oh, Lloyd.

893
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,500
Lane, we're leaving for Palm Beach.

894
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,400
If you need me,
we're staying with the Chasens.

895
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,800
And let's not have a wake over what
happened before. It's over and done with.

896
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,400
Life's too short
to dwell on our tragedies. Right ?

897
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,900
Besides, I'm sure we all
said things we're sorry for.

898
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
We're all temperamental.

899
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,100
Otherwise, we wouldn't
all be so fascinating.

900
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,000
I'm sorry if I caused you any grief.

901
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,700
OK ? I wasn't thinking.

902
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,500
Oh, well. It's over now.

903
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,300
Lane,...

904
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,600
.. you always liked this,...

905
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,200
.. and I want you to keep it.

906
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,400
Stephanie,...

907
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,300
.. this is for you.

908
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,800
I saw you admiring it
and I'd love you to have it.

909
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,400
Thank you.

910
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,800
Jesus ! Look at my hands.

911
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Now, really, I am too young for liver spots.
Maybe I could merge them into a tan.

912
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,400
What do you think ?

913
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,600
- Can I help with the bags ?
- Oh, my God ! I forgot.

914
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,500
Howard, just in time to say goodbye and
help with the luggage. I'll get the door.

915
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,400
Lloyd, put that hanging piece on top,
I beg you. Everything'll be mussed.

916
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,300
Thanks, Howard.
Terrific. The door's open.

917
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,900
Lane, let them get it, honey.
Come here. Come here.

918
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:40,300
Now... No, never mind. You know where
we're gonna be, with the Chasens,...

919
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,100
.. so if you need me for anything - your
hair looks just darling down like that -

920
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,600
.. you call me. D'you hear me ? OK.

921
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,700
And tell Peter that
I've got to rethink my memoirs.

922
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,800
If I come up with a fresh approach,
then I'll call him.

923
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,900
Goodbye. Be a good girl.

924
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,400
Oh, God. Have you got my make-up kit ?
It's got my diaphragm in it.

925
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:03,100
Isn't it silly ? I still travel with it.
It's like a lucky charm.

926
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:07,000
Maybe I should donate it
to the antique fair !

927
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,800
Will I see you again ?

928
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,300
I think you should leave.

929
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,100
I'm going to stay with Lane
and then go back home.

930
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,100
It's funny. You meet somebody
under strange circumstances.

931
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,800
You fall in love and then
you go off in separate directions.

932
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,700
Peter, please don't make this hard for me.

933
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,100
- Please.
- I feel so empty.

934
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:03,400
You haven't even gone yet and I feel like
I've lost something I'll never find again.

935
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,400
I'm so disappointed in myself.

936
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,600
Steffie.

937
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,300
Time will pass
and you'll forget this summer.

938
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,900
And you ? Will you forget it ?

939
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,600
I'll try.

940
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,100
It won't be easy, but I'll try.

941
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,000
Now she's off to Palm Beach
as though nothing had happened.

942
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,600
Well, I really should be going, too.

943
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,700
My debts.

944
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,900
I have to manage the final sale.

945
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,000
All the details.

946
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,500
Lane, I want so badly
to tell you not to worry.

947
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,600
Howard.

948
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,900
And that I'll take care of you,
that nothing would make me happier.

949
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,900
I've gotten so used to
having you in my life.

950
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,000
- You're all that gives it meaning now.
- Howard, don't. Don't.

951
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,700
- I'm sure that...
- I can't.

952
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,900
.. when you leave here...

953
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,600
.. I'll never see you again.

954
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,100
But I really did grow to love you.

955
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,800
Lane.

956
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,000
I came to say goodbye.

957
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,400
I think it's better
if I head back to the city tonight.

958
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,800
You haven't finished your book.

959
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,600
It's finished.

960
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,200
What a sad tone in your voice.

961
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,300
I loved all the time we spent together.

962
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,300
And I appreciate your faith in me and...

963
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,300
.. the encouragement.

964
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,400
I'm sorry I couldn't live up to it.

965
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,500
Well...

966
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,200
Take care of her, Howard.

967
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

968
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,500
Would you like some tea ?

969
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,400
No.

970
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,200
- It's chilly.
- Yeah.

971
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,500
It was chilly when I got up this morning.

972
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,600
In a few days it'll be September.

973
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,800
I know.

974
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,900
There are so many things to do,
selling a house.

975
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,200
It'll keep you busy. That's good.

976
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,100
When do you have to go home ?

977
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,200
In a couple of days I'll go back.

978
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,600
The kids need school supplies
and new shoes.

979
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,500
- Sweet kids.
- Yeah.

980
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,700
Oh, Steffie.

981
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,400
Soon you'll leave here and
you'll start all over again in New York.

982
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,900
There'll be a million things
to keep you busy.

983
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,300
It's gonna be OK.

984
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:52,500
