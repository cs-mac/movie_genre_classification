1
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,270
If someone had asked me
not long ago...

2
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:52,216
why I thought it was that men
left women and never came back,

3
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,845
I would have said this:

4
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,855
"New cow. "

5
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:01,121
The new cow theory
was born of a broken heart.

6
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,163
It came to me while reading
an article on male behavior...

7
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,289
in the New York Times
science section,

8
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,426
which chronicled a particularly
fascinating study...

9
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:13,336
on the mating preferences
of the male cow.

10
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,510
First, a bull was presented with...

11
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,172
A cow.

12
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,147
They mated.

13
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,047
The next day, the bull was
presented with the same cow.

14
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,060
The bull wasn't interested.

15
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,528
He wanted new cow,

16
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,191
and this was old cow.

17
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,971
Curious to see if
they could trick the bull,

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,975
the scientists came up
with an ingenious ploy.

19
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:55,447
- Do not disappoint Daddy.
- The old cow was smeared with new cow scent...

20
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,212
- Doesn't that feel good?
- But he was no fool.

21
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,549
This wasn't new cow.

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,522
This was just old cow
incognito.

23
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,685
Old cow in sheep's clothing.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,164
Mutton dressed as lamb.

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,925
{ Car Horns Honking]

26
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,203
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

27
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:23,208
To really understand the theory and
how it took over my entire existence,

28
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,642
you need to hear
the whole story.

29
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,047
When Ray came into my life,

30
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,175
I was booking talent
for the Diane Roberts Show,

31
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:36,210
a local New York talk show that
had just been syndicated nationally.

32
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,019
The network had given us
a small window of opportunity...

33
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,082
in which to make something
of ourselves.

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,219
We're back with
Mary Lou Corkle,

35
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,560
outspoken
conservative activist,

36
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,533
who's here to talk about
her new book The Nest Crisis.

37
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,469
One of your central arguments,
Mary Lou,

38
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:56,907
is to blame society's problems
on working mothers.

39
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,467
Diane was determined to strike
pay dirt with her audience...

40
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:03,037
by appealing to both their
understimulated intelligence...

41
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:06,846
and their overstimulated appetite
for tabloid television.

42
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,978
Ambition has blinded
these women...

43
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,922
- to their responsibilities to their families.
- And so, by your standards,

44
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:16,257
doing what I do makes me
unfit for motherhood.

45
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,889
Well, we make
our own beds, don't we?

46
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,560
That is true.
Just out of curiosity, Mary Lou,

47
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,569
who's been
making your kids' beds...

48
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,629
while you've been out selling
your book these past three months?

49
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,143
My job was to supply
a steady diet of raw meat...

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,940
to satisfy Diane's
Emmy-clad ambitions.

51
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,106
Hi, Donald. Did you hear?
We've gone national.

52
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,116
Thanks.
Well, it's a new format.

53
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,118
We're just starting up
major exposure,

54
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,245
and I think it's
right up Hillary's alley.

55
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:46,121
Oh, she'd be among the first. I'm lining up
great company. Trust me, everyone wants on.

56
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,592
My only colleague in this quest...

57
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:52,358
was our writer, producer and
pathological womanizer Eddie Alden.

58
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,365
How are we doin'?

59
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,367
Publisher's having a coronary.

60
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,403
- That good, huh?
- You book 'em, I cook 'em.

61
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,235
Right on. Yeah.

62
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,708
Thank you very much. We are
here talking to Mary Lou Corkle.

63
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,041
Any progress with Cuba?

64
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,809
Well, just keep trying.
I swear to God.

65
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,749
This Castro thing is gonna kill me.
I mean, it is insane.

66
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,013
- She will not let it go.
- Forget Castro. Come on.

67
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,318
- I mean, what you want is a more creative angle.
- Such as?

68
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,519
- Elena Villagolla.
- Who?

69
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,462
One of the women the C.I.A. Hired to
try and kill him back in the sixties.

70
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,591
Excuse me. I believe this is
a smoke-free building.

71
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:34,072
Blow me. Apparently, the C.I.A. Cooked up
this death oil that could pass as perfume.

72
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,303
The idea was she'd rub it on, Castro
would be kissin' her and lickin' her...

73
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:41,073
- Don't editorialize.
- Sorry. He was supposed to croak right after.

74
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:45,516
Eddie could find the sex factor
in just about any subject.

75
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,075
He, of course,
considered this a gift.

76
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:52,181
- Nina, you left these earrings in my bathroom.
- You don't waste any time.

77
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,919
- Cynic.
- Slut.

78
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,219
But if Eddie was enough to
make me lose hope in all men,

79
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,788
it only took one
to bring it back again.

80
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,493
- Hey, Rick.
- How you doin', Eddie?

81
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,636
You are the only one I
haven't met yet. I'm Ray Brown.

82
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,872
- This is our new executive producer.
- Oh, from Washington.

83
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:14,935
I saw that piece you produced
for Newsline. That was brilliant.

84
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,379
Wow.
Thank you very much.

85
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,643
We just did a follow-up piece. That's
why I'm a little late getting up here.

86
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:22,049
- Oh.
- Well, I better scoot.

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,112
Jane, you want me to get 'em to turn the
A.C. Up? You're looking a little flushed.

88
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:28,724
Okay.

89
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:33,493
- Jane Goodale.
- I know. That's an interesting name.

90
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:36,533
- People must confuse you with the scientist.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,570
- They're always asking me if I'm into chimps.
- Are you?

92
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:42,800
Not really. I mean, maybe
Curious George when I was five.

93
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,274
Ah. Curious George
was a monkey, not a chimp.

94
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,176
- A man who knows his primates.
- Yes, I do.

95
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:52,580
See you around. Oh, I heard Len Chaney's
people are giving you a hard time.

96
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,244
Yeah, they're afraid it's gonna turn
into an abortion debate and get ugly.

97
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,549
Which is, uh, right.

98
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:00,489
- Of course.
- So guarantee Diane won't bring it up,

99
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:03,584
and we'll plant somebody in the
audience to initiate it during Q&A.

100
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:06,789
I think you came to the
right show, Ray Brown.

101
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,768
So he's cute.
- Very.

102
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,997
Mm-hmm.
Care to elaborate?

103
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:18,805
Pale blue eyes, athletic, sort
of, um,J. Crew, but not as preppy.

104
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:22,778
- Oh, that guy again.
- Are you going to buy anything or not?

105
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,645
- Sh-Shush! I'm
concentrating! - Okay.

106
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:28,208
- Marital status?
- Girlfriend.

107
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,345
Why are we having
this conversation?

108
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:32,651
You know what? You're
right. He's too much work.

109
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,851
And even if I were up to it,
with my luck,

110
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,053
he'd probably end up
marrying her anyway.

111
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:40,962
Wow. There's the cynical bitch
I know and love.

112
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:44,195
So that's it. Case closed.
Leaving this one alone.

113
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:46,862
You feeling carnivorous?

114
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,532
Absolutely.

115
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,705
So what else do I need
to know about you,

116
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,714
apart from your addiction
to processed foods,

117
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,875
much to the chagrin
of your girlfriend?

118
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,719
"D."

119
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:07,315
- Whom you've been dating now for...
- Three years.

120
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:09,484
Three...

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,496
Excuse me. Three years.
Wow. That's, um...

122
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:16,795
Huh.
More serious than I...

123
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,995
would've guessed,
you know, off the cuff.

124
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,205
I guess it is.

125
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:26,175
You think you ever get to the moment
where you just know it's the right one?

126
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:30,177
That's it.

127
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:32,876
That's the person you're
meant to be with forever.

128
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,479
Probably.

129
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,882
God, he was cute.

130
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:46,392
- It's me!
- We're in here.

131
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:48,489
What's the problem?
Just jab it in.

132
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,000
- Don't rush me.
- What is going on?

133
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:53,468
Dr. Lipshick started your sister
on injections.

134
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:57,304
- Of orange juice?
- Fertility drugs, Jane.

135
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,639
The orange is for practice.

136
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,545
For God's sake, Stephen, if you
can't stick it into a Valencia,

137
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:05,548
- How are you gonna stick it in my ass?
- I'm just a little nervous.

138
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:09,211
If this isn't done right, we
could lose another whole month.

139
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,382
Oh!

140
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,290
That was supposed
to be my job.

141
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:20,296
I just wanted to show you
how easy it is.

142
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:22,457
You know, this is
a very emotional time for us,

143
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,991
and you're sucking the romance
out of the entire situation.

144
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,631
Oh, come on, sweetheart. I think we've
pretty much kissed romance good-bye...

145
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:32,403
when you started jacking off
into a cup once a week.

146
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:34,410
Leave my sperm count
out of it!

147
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:39,546
Chubby Hubby?

148
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:43,314
Come on, sweetie. I'll look at the
dirty magazines with you this time.

149
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:45,787
I don't think you should...
Enough about it!

150
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,554
That's great. Just great.

151
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,224
Very nice, Nina.
Very grown up.

152
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,426
At least one of us is.

153
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,435
Good morning.

154
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:03,371
Don't bother, Eddie.
I already know you're an asshole.

155
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:06,171
Hey, you're always complaining
your apartment's too small.

156
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,337
Why don't you
move in with me?

157
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:10,880
- You cannot be serious.
- Why not?

158
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,007
Come on. All I'm meeting
are hip, successful types.

159
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,143
- I'd much rather have someone like you.
- Gee, thanks.

160
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:18,211
No, hey. This would be
a strictly financial arrangement.

161
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:20,757
I've got no interest in you
that way whatsoever.

162
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,225
- What a relief.
- Come on. Is that a no?

163
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,923
Actually, it's a "Thanks, but not
if my life depended on it. "

164
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:30,657
In the dark

165
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:33,465
I can hear

166
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:35,767
You whisper

167
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:41,470
Shadows still

168
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:44,343
Move across

169
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,349
The distance

170
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:51,410
- Hello.
- You up for a walk?

171
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,684
What did you say

172
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,192
It's okay

173
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,357
Mm-hmm

174
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:03,229
Did you miss me

175
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,036
Did you miss me

176
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,274
Make it mine

177
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,835
Takin'time

178
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:17,972
- What?
- What?

179
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,275
I was just gonna...

180
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:25,688
I can't speak.
You say something.

181
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:29,920
No, no, no, don't.
Do you think I'm insane?

182
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,090
Not at all.

183
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:41,405
I was just thinking how good
my apartment looks with you in it.

184
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,401
Did you miss me

185
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,476
Did you miss me

186
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:57,577
You know
at times I wonder

187
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:00,715
If you ever thought of me

188
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:06,286
And I wonder if you
wanted to be free like me

189
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,397
Let's start again.
You were eating Cocoa Puffs.

190
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:17,464
- Right.
- Then a couple cartoons.

191
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,669
- A Tweety Bird and a Road Runner, I think.
- Then some more kissing.

192
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,838
- Right.
- Okay, go on.

193
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:26,007
We had to get ready for work, so I
walk into the door, and he gave me a...

194
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,051
- Morning, Jane.
- Morning, Les. How are ya?

195
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:32,112
- Big finale-type kiss
before leaving? - Exactly.

196
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:34,885
That's good, good, good.
Very good, considering.

197
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,793
- Considering what?
- Considering he's already picked out his wife.

198
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:42,629
I told you, Liz,
they're having problems.

199
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,567
- They're not engaged.
- Yet.

200
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:49,663
Nevertheless, he does sound like an
interesting prospect, so here's what you do.

201
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,836
Pretend she doesn't exist.
Never mention her name.

202
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,845
If he mentions her, you just
nod politely, change the subject.

203
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,881
- Why?
- Because if you bring her up,

204
00:11:57,948 --> 00:11:59,882
he's gonna feel
pushed and resentful.

205
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,884
This way, it's like,
"I'm healthy, I'm happy.

206
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,886
No pressure.
Getting sex other places. "

207
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:07,117
- It's gonna drive him nuts.
- Lizzy, where do you get this stuff?

208
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:10,183
Snagmen. Com.
It's very informative.

209
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,695
- Odd.
- Read the papers, Jane.

210
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:15,323
23-year-old women
are lying about their age,

211
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,994
so excuse me, Miss "I have a
crush, so I'm currently in denial. "

212
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,004
You gotta get on your game.

213
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:24,064
You know what I really need to
know? What do I do right now...

214
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:26,905
when I see him in my staff
meeting in five minutes?

215
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:30,071
That's easy.
Pretend he doesn't exist.

216
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,619
Well, good morning, Eddie.

217
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,751
- What is on your neck?
- I bit myself shaving.

218
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:46,661
Isn't that why God
invented turtlenecks?

219
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:50,929
- No. That's why God invented Darlene.
- You are so gross.

220
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:53,493
- Hey, Eddie. Hi, Jane.
- Hey, Ray.

221
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:56,404
Hey, Ray. Mornin'.

222
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,170
You okay?
You look a little tired.

223
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,180
Morning, Diane.

224
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:06,944
Straw. Mmm.

225
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:09,953
- Okay. I'm late, I know. I'm sorry.
- Morning.

226
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:13,752
I locked myself out of the apartment.
Keys, wallet, total nightmare.

227
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,849
The only reason
I'm standing here right now...

228
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:19,157
is because of Habib, the nicest
cab driver in the city of New York.

229
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,199
Okay, now, who saw
ABC's 4 a. m. Newscast?

230
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:25,030
I think a lot of us
missed that, Diane.

231
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:28,868
There's a big story on how single
media outlets aren't cutting it anymore.

232
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,873
Ray, where are we
on interactive?

233
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:34,308
- The web site should be up and running on Monday.
- No, not should be.

234
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:37,643
Will be!
We cannot sell this show...

235
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,649
on the pissant advertising budget
they've given us.

236
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:42,618
We need to be
streaming 24-7,

237
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,884
and we need to make
every show count.

238
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:50,154
- Remember, it is all about the get.
- The get.

239
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:53,060
We cannot make a splash
if we only get...

240
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,064
the gets that everybody's
already gotten.

241
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:58,431
- I need the ungettable get, got it?
- Got it.

242
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,367
Good.

243
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,668
Okay, where are we
on Fidel?

244
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,198
Uh, well,
I spoke with Juanita,

245
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,302
his, um,
foreign press secretary,

246
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,677
who assured me
that the moment...

247
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:16,152
el presidente was back
from his fantasy baseball camp...

248
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,518
she would
approach him about it.

249
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,250
And what did she say?
He might be interested?

250
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:21,791
Did she discuss
his availability?

251
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,692
Tell me, do you think
we have a shot here?

252
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:28,254
- Jane?
- Sorry.

253
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:31,790
I said what do you think your
chances are of getting this guy?

254
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,937
I think they're good, Diane.

255
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:37,496
I think they're very good.

256
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,177
Uh, j-just a minute.

257
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,398
Sorry.

258
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:39,095
I thought I'd just, um,
do a few sit-ups.

259
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:05,585
Joy: The emotion evoked by the
prospect of possessing what one desires.

260
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,867
Rapture: The experience
of being carried away...

261
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,563
by an overwhelming
emotion or passion.

262
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,906
Ecstasy: A state of being
beyond reason and self-control.

263
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,451
I cannot feel my legs.

264
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,317
- Tell me again what we're doing here, please.
- We're coming up for air.

265
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:34,516
- Oh, right.
- Besides, I owe you a shirt.

266
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,617
Hey, that's a good idea.

267
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:38,628
- Blue?
- Yeah.

268
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,960
This one's pretty.

269
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:43,329
- You think?
- With your eyes.

270
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,301
Could be risky, given your
impatience with buttons.

271
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,361
Well...

272
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,901
- I love it. We'll take this one.
- My treat.

273
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:56,412
- No, no, no. No, Jane.
- Shut up.

274
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,074
- Let me buy you a shirt.
- Thank you.

275
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:04,051
- Hey, guys.
- Eddie, hey!

276
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,487
Wow. We were...
I mean, I just, uh...

277
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:08,991
- She's helping me pick out a shirt.
- Yeah.

278
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,152
- Well, I didn't mean to intrude.
- Not at all. You're not.

279
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,196
- Not at all. Please!
- No.

280
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:17,291
Listen,
I gotta go to a thing.

281
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:20,030
- I gotta hit this... Great running into you.
- Okay.

282
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,629
- Both of you. My God! I can't even...
- See you around.

283
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:25,436
- All right.
- Okay. - Yeah.

284
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,105
What a coincidence. First I run
into Ray, and then we run into you.

285
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,671
I didn't even know he lived
around here, and then, boom!

286
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,311
All of a sudden, there he is.
Um, so, uh...

287
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:40,881
Wha... Okay, so I am
sleeping with him.

288
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,291
Eddie, if you tell anyone at
the office, so help me, God...

289
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,852
What are you thinking?

290
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:50,230
I'm... I'm thinking
the same thing you are, Jane,

291
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:53,168
that you and Ray are gonna
live happily ever after...

292
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,171
with matching Volvos
and chocolate labs.

293
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,173
See you Monday.

294
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,176
Did you have
any friends growing up?

295
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:03,213
Better hurry. I think he's
waiting down the street.

296
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,981
And I never thought
I'd feel this way

297
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:14,184
The way I feel about you

298
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,596
Soon as I wake up
every night

299
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,534
Every day

300
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:29,163
I know that it's you I need

301
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,207
To take the blues away

302
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:36,711
It must be love
love, love

303
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:42,609
It must be love
love, love

304
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,120
Nothing more
nothing less

305
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,384
Love is the best

306
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:52,525
How can it be
that we can

307
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:55,861
Say so much
without words

308
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,118
I love you, Jane.

309
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:32,969
I love you too.

310
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:44,438
He just came right out and
said it, after only six weeks.

311
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:48,417
Oh, my God. Takes most guys
like a year to use the "L" word.

312
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,510
When they finally do,
they're usually, you know,

313
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:53,488
on top of you,
so it doesn't really count.

314
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:57,288
- What about the "D" woman?
- He's telling her tomorrow night.

315
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:00,922
- Why didn't he tell her already?
- He's in a complicated situation.

316
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,932
Anyhow, if he were
having second thoughts,

317
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,059
I hardly think he would've
asked me to live with him.

318
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:08,369
He asked you to live with him?
Oh, my God.

319
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:12,239
- What did you say?
- I must've said yes or something to that effect...

320
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,437
because he started calling realtors,
and I gave my landlord notice.

321
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:19,313
Ohh! Mazel tov!

322
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:22,352
Oh, I can't believe this!

323
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,354
You're getting asked
to play house by some guy,

324
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:28,449
and I'm still on
the blind date circuit from hell.

325
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,824
I take it last night
did not go very well.

326
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,955
Awful. Do me a favor. Next time
Julian offers to set me up...

327
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:37,398
with one of his straight friends,
shoot me before I say yes.

328
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:39,834
I'm in a sad state.

329
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:43,305
And I'm telling you,
it's just screaming potential.

330
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,433
H- Hello?

331
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:47,602
- I didn't mean to intrude.
- No, we're fine.

332
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,703
Didn't you want to see
the patio? Come on out.

333
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,214
Isn't it just wonderful?
Wait'll you see the view.

334
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:55,343
It's just spectacular.
Right this way.

335
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,853
Right down
to the World Trade Center.

336
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,830
It's such a jewel box.

337
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:13,726
I guess I'll leave you two alone
to talk things over.

338
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,230
- Oh, my God. It's unbelievable.
- I love it! I love it!

339
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,403
It's amazing. The light
is so good! I love you.

340
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,811
I don't know.

341
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:33,413
Liz, I gotta go.

342
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,789
Oh, my God. He looks like
he's been hit by a bus.

343
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,919
I'll call you back.

344
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:42,691
I feel like I've been
hit by a bus.

345
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,791
You told her?

346
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:50,433
Was it bad?

347
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,806
Not like I thought.

348
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:58,144
I mean, she, uh... She didn't go
hysterical or anything like that.

349
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:01,150
She just, uh,
was kinda,

350
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:04,551
you know, eerily calm
about the whole thing.

351
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,954
- Well, that's good, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

352
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:09,822
I just meant,
you know,

353
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:12,988
it wasn't what I expected
is all, you know?

354
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:17,124
- What'd she say about us?
- She just, she just...

355
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:21,604
I
- I didn't tell her. Jane, I just didn't think it was necessary.

356
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,606
I mean, to hit her
over the head with this thing...

357
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:27,508
after three years,
it just seemed so, so awful.

358
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:29,944
I just told her
that it was over.

359
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,278
You know? And I think
that's all she needs to know.

360
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:36,183
- Right?
- S-Sure.

361
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,847
- And she was okay with that?
- Yeah. I mean, I guess.

362
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:40,857
I don't know. It was so...
It was just weird.

363
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:44,691
I mean, she just kinda...
Whoooh.

364
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:47,026
You know, she just
kinda went cold on me.

365
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:49,964
I mean,
sh-sh-she's upset.

366
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,002
She's upset,
the poor thing.

367
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:55,232
She's gotta be upset.
She's... You know.

368
00:22:55,306 --> 00:23:00,209
She just didn't seem
terribly upset, so...

369
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:05,579
- Well, you're okay with it, right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

370
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:09,312
- I mean, you're happy.
- Happy?

371
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:13,015
I am so happy.
I mean, this is what I wanted.

372
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,251
I mean, there's nothing
between us anymore, you know,

373
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:20,525
and that's... that's what I
was looking for, so I'm happy.

374
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:27,203
How exactly did Ray disappear?

375
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:30,832
Slowly and kind of subtly.

376
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:34,501
Single pane,
double pane?

377
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,512
Single pane, I believe.
- Singles.

378
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,674
A lot more sun, I guess,
than I had recalled.

379
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,210
This doesn't open? Oh!
Well, gotta force it. Oops.

380
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:46,256
Well, maybe it wasn't so subtle.

381
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:48,291
Hi, babe.

382
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,385
It's me again.
Listen, the realtor called,

383
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:53,987
and she said that we have
to sign the lease by Monday.

384
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:57,397
I know you wanted your lawyer to have
a look at the contract and everything,

385
00:23:57,468 --> 00:24:00,130
but my apartment's been re-rented,
and I have got to be out of here...

386
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:12,073
He is not sleeping with somebody
else. What are you talking about?

387
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:14,083
First of all,
Ray really isn't like that.

388
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:16,085
And second of all, the poor guy
wouldn't have time.

389
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:18,781
He's been working until 3:00 in
the morning every night for 2 weeks.

390
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,222
Okay, A: There's no such thing as a guy
who doesn't have time to mess around.

391
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:24,659
They always have time for that. And
B: If he ain't sleeping with you,

392
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:27,697
he ain't sleepin' alone.

393
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,858
Right?

394
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:32,959
Listen, you gotta talk to him.
It's better than not knowing.

395
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:37,466
Sorry.
This patch is worth shit.

396
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:43,539
Throughout the animal kingdom,
prey species have developed...

397
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:47,015
a wide variety
of escape behaviors.

398
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:50,485
Freezing is a common response
to predator alarm.

399
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:56,117
Sensing danger, many animals will
assume a rigid, statue-like position.

400
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:59,458
Fleeing is another
popular method.

401
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,931
Some species will simply
try to outrun their captors,

402
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,833
while others take
an erratic zigzag course...

403
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:10,135
in the hopes that sudden direction
shifts will eventually tire the predator,

404
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:14,473
causing her
to give up the chase.

405
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:16,775
Smell the bacon, Jane?

406
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:24,510
I'm wondering
what's happening here. I mean,

407
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,681
we haven't been alone
together in a week.

408
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:29,624
We lost that great apartment...

409
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:32,025
because your lawyer supposedly
didn't get his act together,

410
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:34,189
which is okay,
I understand.

411
00:25:34,264 --> 00:25:36,425
But as of Saturday,
I don't have a place to live.

412
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,367
Ray, what the hell's going on?

413
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:43,365
I don't think I can do this.

414
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,136
Do what?

415
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,476
This. Us.

416
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:52,708
What?

417
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,853
Why?

418
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,016
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

419
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:04,117
There has to be a reason.
Just tell me what it is.

420
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:07,254
Jane, I'm sorry. L-I...
You deserve an answer,

421
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,891
and I don't think
I can explain it to you.

422
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:15,234
I thought we...
felt the same way:

423
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:18,706
Incredibly lucky to have...

424
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:21,540
- found th-the thing.
- I do.

425
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,307
And here you go.
- I did.

426
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,854
I...

427
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:36,723
I just think that we both
need to take a step back.

428
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:42,965
I mean we're talking about
a very serious move here.

429
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:47,333
L- I just wanted...
I still...

430
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,873
I don't even know
what I'm trying to say.

431
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:56,538
I feel like... such a jerk,

432
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:59,343
you know, believing
that this was, uh...

433
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,350
Listen to me.
I love you.

434
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,987
I... want us to be
important to each other.

435
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:08,650
Please don't do that.

436
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:20,130
Please go.

437
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:49,329
There are few things
sadder in this life...

438
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:53,426
than watching someone walk
away after they've left you,

439
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:57,234
watching the distance
between your bodies expand...

440
00:27:57,307 --> 00:28:01,004
until there's nothing
but empty space...

441
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:03,012
and silence.

442
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:12,178
Remember,

443
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:15,349
time wounds all heels.

444
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:28,501
Eddie Alden.
Yeah, sure. Hold on.

445
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:30,540
Hi.

446
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:34,410
Are you all right?

447
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:36,969
Why?
Don't I look all right?

448
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:42,009
- You look like you hate my guts.
- I do hate your guts.

449
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,145
That's nice.

450
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:47,315
I don't blame you,
you know.

451
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,483
For what it's worth, this
hasn't been easy for me either.

452
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,153
Oh, yeah, you look
really... destroyed.

453
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,595
- Hey.
- Hey, Eddie.

454
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:58,122
Eddie, did you by any chance
ever find a roommate?

455
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,463
Well, no, actually.

456
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:05,167
Because the place I was supposed to
move into just suddenly fell apart...

457
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:08,006
and my apartment's
been re-rented...

458
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,638
and I was wondering
if the offer's still good.

459
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,807
- Y-You're moving in with Eddie?
- Maybe.

460
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:15,374
- What's the apartment like?
- Uh...

461
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:19,183
Just a two-bedroom loft, big
kitchen, lots of windows, living room.

462
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:21,986
Sounds amazing.
When can I see it?

463
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:25,050
- You're moving in with Eddie.
- How about tonight?

464
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:28,222
Perfect.
Everything is just perfect.

465
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,670
Hey.

466
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,398
- You okay?
- Yeah.

467
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,207
- Here it is.
- It's huge.

468
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:52,949
Yup. Kitchen, living room,
whatever.

469
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:56,083
Uh, my bedroom, bathroom.

470
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,218
This would be your room.

471
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:04,366
What happened here?

472
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:07,369
Yeah, I got the urge to renovate
one night, but don't worry.

473
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:09,803
I'd have it fixed
by the time you moved in.

474
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:12,933
- You want a drink?
- Sure. Some water.

475
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:15,068
We don't have to share
a bathroom, do we?

476
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:17,909
Oh, no, I never,
ever use the bathroom.

477
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,250
So how'd you find
this place?

478
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:25,721
My ex-girlfriend worked
in an emergency room.

479
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:28,622
Whenever someone croaked, she'd check out
their address, see if it was rent control.

480
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:30,626
Eventually, we got lucky.

481
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:33,128
You lived with somebody?

482
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:36,427
- Yeah.
- For how long?

483
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,763
For... a while.

484
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:43,829
- So what do you think?
- I think I must be out of my mind.

485
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:46,432
They say you stand

486
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,670
By your man

487
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,770
Tell me something

488
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:52,940
I don't understand

489
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:57,043
You said you loved me
and that's a fact

490
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,214
- Hey!
- Thank you!

491
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,224
Shit.

492
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:06,729
Well, some days
you can explain away

493
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:11,130
But the heartache's with me
till this day

494
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:15,863
Did you stand by me

495
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:17,930
No, not at all

496
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:20,408
Did you stand by me

497
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:22,741
No way

498
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,210
All the times

499
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:31,618
That we were close

500
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:33,781
I remember

501
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:36,018
These things the most

502
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:40,654
I've seen all my dreams
come tumblin'down

503
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,698
I can't be happy

504
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,326
Without you around

505
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:49,805
So alone I keep
the wolves at bay

506
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:53,707
And there's only
one thing I can say

507
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,680
You didn't stand by me

508
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:00,943
No, not at all

509
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:03,417
You didn't stand by me

510
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:05,511
No way

511
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:09,046
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all

512
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:12,492
You didn't stand by me

513
00:32:12,562 --> 00:32:15,053
No way

514
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,725
Morphine for the pain.

515
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,418
Hey.

516
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:40,250
It was right after
she moved out.

517
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:50,160
I just took an ax
and started hacking away at it.

518
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:53,726
So I thought
opening up that wall...

519
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:57,603
might make it easier
to breathe or something.

520
00:32:57,674 --> 00:32:59,733
I don't smoke.

521
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:16,455
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

522
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:20,763
You okay?

523
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,667
Oh, yeah.

524
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:28,937
What was her name?

525
00:33:34,844 --> 00:33:36,778
Rebecca.

526
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,314
Put your shoes on.
We're going downstairs.

527
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:44,319
- What's downstairs?
- You'll see.

528
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,650
It's like there are two realities.

529
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:56,961
First, we're in love,
and it's incredible, it's perfect.

530
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,661
And then poof!
"Sorry, Jane.

531
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,670
Doesn't work for me
anymore. "

532
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:05,834
- How is that possible?
- Easy. You were living in a fantasy.

533
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:09,868
Romance, true love,
soul mates,

534
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:11,880
it's all bullshit.

535
00:34:11,948 --> 00:34:13,882
None of it exists.

536
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,475
Trust me.
I speak from experience.

537
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:23,419
Man, she really did a
number on you, didn't she?

538
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:25,757
Well, don't shit
on my broken heart...

539
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:30,732
just because you converted to some
warped brand of romantic atheism.

540
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,428
Oh, man! Whoo!

541
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,437
It's called
self-preservation.

542
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:39,441
Oh, in other words, you narcotize
yourself with casual sex.

543
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:42,103
No, no, no. See, that implies
I'm avoiding reality...

544
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:44,112
when, in fact, I embrace it.

545
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,941
Don't underestimate
casual sex, Jane.

546
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:52,249
- It's very liberating.
- I'll bet.

547
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:01,229
I almost feel sorry for her.

548
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,231
What for?

549
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,324
I make no pretenses, okay?

550
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:07,562
Now, if she wants to put me up
on a white horse,

551
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:09,628
that's her choice.

552
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:13,571
We're all
grownups here, Jane.

553
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:16,009
You know I love you, baby

554
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:21,112
And I don't want
nobody else

555
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:26,783
I can't help wonderin'if I

556
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:32,623
I lay awake that night
wondering which was worse:

557
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:37,257
Guys like Ray who blinded you
with charms and promises,

558
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:42,093
or the Eddies of the world
who went right for your pants.

559
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:45,039
Oh. Excuse me.

560
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:47,406
And in the end,
it didn't matter.

561
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:52,073
The truth was, they were
all cast from the same mold.

562
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:55,319
But the question remained.

563
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,511
Why?

564
00:35:57,587 --> 00:36:00,055
And then
one day by the river,

565
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,057
I found my answer.

566
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,687
Holy shit!

567
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,098
I told them dumb asses
it'd never work.

568
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:15,297
You can't fool a bull, mister.
No, sir.

569
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:18,466
He knows where he's been,
and he ain't goin' back.

570
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:21,102
Hell, I got...
I got 93 cows.

571
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,146
Only one of'em got nads.

572
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:28,480
Why? 'Cause that one son of a bitch
alone can knock up an entire herd.

573
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:31,953
But once he's done,
well, the party's over.

574
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:34,889
I gotta go over to Ed
Hickey's place down the road...

575
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,892
and trade him for a new one...

576
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,894
'cause there ain't
a chance in hell...

577
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:41,829
he's ever gonna touch
any of them cows again, no, sir.

578
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:46,733
- I figured it out. I'm the old cow.
- I don't get it.

579
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:50,534
Remember a couple weeks ago when we were
laughing at that graffiti on the subway?

580
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,575
- " Baby, I love the toilet you sit on"?
- No.

581
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:54,667
"I'm tired of banging
the same woman every night. "

582
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,838
We thought there might
actually be something to that,

583
00:36:56,913 --> 00:37:00,212
- like it could be a window into their dark...
- Schizophrenic behavior.

584
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:02,251
Well, it is.
The new cow theory...

585
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,446
and "I'm tired of banging
the same woman every night,"

586
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:06,455
same thing.

587
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,616
This is why
men can't commit.

588
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:11,388
Sooner or later,
we all become old cows.

589
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:14,055
We're identified
as already serviced,

590
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,362
so they wanna move on
and find less familiar females.

591
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:21,564
- The whole novelty thing, you mean.
- Neophilia, to be precise.

592
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:24,869
- What do you think?
- What do I think? I think...

593
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:27,205
it's always about you,
that's what I think.

594
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:31,509
You fall for some guy, and it's like
men are worthy of heroic worship.

595
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:34,846
You get dumped and suddenly they're
shit-sucking, commitment-phobic assholes.

596
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:37,443
I'm sorry, Jane. The entire
universe does not revolve around...

597
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,648
your romantic status.

598
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:48,187
You're in love.

599
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:50,460
I'm almost in love.

600
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,800
Oh, honey,
why didn't you tell me?

601
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,274
You're having a spectacular
mope. I didn't wanna ruin it.

602
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:04,006
- Oh, my God!
- We met at a work party a couple of weeks ago and...

603
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:08,683
Just incredible.
I mean, he's so...

604
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:11,414
And I'm so...

605
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,013
Although I appreciated
Liz's intoxication...

606
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,149
over her seeming good fortune,

607
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:18,854
I refused to be derailed.

608
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,989
Now armed with
my new cow theory,

609
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:25,523
I became voracious
for information.

610
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,664
What are you doing?

611
00:38:55,732 --> 00:38:58,030
Nothin'.

612
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:00,433
- Hey! Eddie!
- Whoa! What's this?

613
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,473
"Amygdala,
AKA erotic nose brain.

614
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,135
- Give it back!
- "An organ located in the nasal cavity,

615
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,508
"which connects smells
to memories.

616
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:13,948
"Banana slugs,
actually hermaphrodites...

617
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:19,913
While mating, the males
chew each other's penises off. "

618
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:28,130
I worry about you, Jane.
I really do.

619
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,122
Despite my conviction,

620
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,820
there was
the occasional setback.

621
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:00,863
I want my erotic
nose brain removed.

622
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,195
I beg your pardon?

623
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:06,463
My amygdala, the organ
deep inside the nasal cavity,

624
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:09,937
which processes scent,
which then connects to memory.

625
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:12,065
I'd like it extracted.

626
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:15,839
But why would you want to
voluntarily make yourself anosmatic?

627
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,107
Well, let me see
if I can explain this.

628
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,843
Um, I had this
boyfriend, okay?

629
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:25,411
And he smelled really,
really good, like soap...

630
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:30,482
and fresh laundry
and vanilla.

631
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,892
And every time I smell
any of those smells,

632
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:36,091
I'm reminded of my boyfriend
and how happy we were...

633
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,100
before he dumped me
for no good reason.

634
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:42,002
And I get very sad,
and then I get angry.

635
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:47,374
And then before I know it, I am in the
throes of an all-out emotional breakdown.

636
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:50,106
And so I was
just thinking, Dr. Glen,

637
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,115
if I can just short-circuit
my nose somehow,

638
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:57,847
I might actually have a chance of
living a semi-normal life someday.

639
00:40:57,921 --> 00:41:00,990
Hey, wait!

640
00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:46,500
Couldn't sleep?

641
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:49,366
- No.
- Me neither.

642
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:52,839
Does that happen
to you a lot?

643
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:54,933
Yeah.

644
00:41:56,011 --> 00:41:58,070
Me too.

645
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:01,749
Mmm.

646
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,455
- Just like eating worms.
- Yeah.

647
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,597
Talent. Mmm.
These are good.

648
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:29,835
Here.

649
00:42:31,513 --> 00:42:33,538
Head back.

650
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:42,490
- Yeah?
- Good.

651
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:44,549
Good.

652
00:42:49,932 --> 00:42:51,866
Cold dumplings.
My favorite.

653
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:57,031
Way to go, Tomcat.
Two points.

654
00:42:57,106 --> 00:42:59,006
Tomcat?

655
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:01,133
Cheerleader.

656
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,269
A what?

657
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:05,279
I was a cheerleader.

658
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:08,009
- You were a cheerleader?
- Yes, I was.

659
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:12,782
Paul G. Blazer Memorial High. Pride and
joy of Cincinnati, Ohio, state champs, 1989.

660
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,982
- Go, Cats.
- Go, Cats.

661
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:17,048
Well, show me.

662
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:19,151
- No. No!
- Come on! Why not?

663
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:21,788
I just haven't done it
in ten years, Eddie. Come on.

664
00:43:21,864 --> 00:43:25,265
- You come on. Show me.
- You have to do something that merits a cheer.

665
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:28,167
Like, uh, like, like...

666
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:31,172
Like three dumplings,
left-handed, in a row.

667
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,868
- You can't do that.
- Deal?

668
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:35,876
Deal.

669
00:43:35,944 --> 00:43:39,380
One, two, three.

670
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:41,916
Like that?

671
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:44,851
Come on. Come on.

672
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,854
Come on.

673
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:51,086
- You promise not to laugh?
- No. Come on.

674
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:02,203
- What are those?
- Pom-poms.

675
00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:06,799
Okay.

676
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,002
I hate you.

677
00:44:09,077 --> 00:44:11,102
It's okay.

678
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:18,418
Ready? Okay!

679
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:21,115
The Tomcats are here...

680
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,488
to show...

681
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:25,891
Whoa.

682
00:44:31,366 --> 00:44:33,698
Ready? Okay!

683
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:35,703
The Tomcats are here...

684
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:38,604
to show who's top.

685
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:40,904
You think can beat us...

686
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:43,410
but we can't be stopped!

687
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:45,446
Go, Tomcats!

688
00:44:45,514 --> 00:44:50,076
- Whoo! First and ten and...
- Eddie?

689
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:53,521
Oh. Oh, sh... Um...

690
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:55,648
Oh, hey, hey.

691
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:59,956
- Um...
- Hi. I'm, uh, Jane.

692
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:02,053
Roommate.

693
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,759
- Isabel.
- Isabel, Jane.

694
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:09,235
- You can clean up. It's your turn.
- Okay. Okay.

695
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:12,569
Good night.
We're a little noisy.

696
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:24,010
Hi, George. It's Jane.

697
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:29,791
God, I'm such an idiot.

698
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:32,588
I mean, I sensed things were a
little off when he got back from L.A.,

699
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:36,028
but I just thought that he was
just jet-lagged or something.

700
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:38,225
Then he tells me the France thing
isn't such a good idea...

701
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,234
because he's gonna have
to work the whole time anyway,

702
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,270
so still, I figure,
"Okay, that's no big deal. "

703
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:44,703
So Friday he gets on a plane,
he goes over there alone.

704
00:45:44,773 --> 00:45:47,105
Right? Wrong.

705
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:50,440
An hour ago, I call his
hotel room to say good night.

706
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:52,946
Guess who answered the phone
1:00 a. m. Paris time?

707
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,951
Penelope Pope.

708
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:59,419
- Who's Penelope Pope?
- I have no idea,

709
00:45:59,488 --> 00:46:01,786
but that's what she said when I said,
"Who the fuck is this?"

710
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:06,021
- Oh, God. I don't get it!
- Liz, I'm sorry.

711
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:11,760
I mean, why feed me all that romantic
crap if he's just gonna cheat on me?

712
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,961
- Two words: Copulatory imperative.
- Excuse me?

713
00:46:15,037 --> 00:46:18,097
It's the biological urge
to spread their seed.

714
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:22,132
The truth is, less than five percent
of all male animals are monogamous.

715
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,008
The other 95% are...

716
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,014
Plucking Penelope Pope?

717
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,457
Hi, Jane.

718
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:41,758
I, uh, stopped by H&H
on the way in,

719
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,027
picked up
a sesame seed bagel...

720
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,933
lightly toasted,
just like you liked.

721
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:55,977
Okay.

722
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:06,584
Ray has a cold. I'm hoping
it will turn into pneumonia...

723
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:10,352
and that weeks of bed rest will
cause abdominal muscles to atrophy.

724
00:47:15,397 --> 00:47:18,332
Ben wants to add a column
to the magazine for women.

725
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,460
It finally hit him that
20% of our readership is female.

726
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:23,697
The idea is for it
to be about men.

727
00:47:23,772 --> 00:47:25,740
You know, how they're
so paranoid...

728
00:47:25,807 --> 00:47:29,174
- about going bald and that kind of thing.
- So...

729
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:31,712
Forget baldness.
The real issue is their behavior.

730
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,613
You know, that stuff like
that copulatory impulse...

731
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:37,151
Imperative. Hey, Bobby, can
I get some more hot water?

732
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:39,210
The point is, I think
you should write it.

733
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:41,755
Are you crazy?

734
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,314
- Well, why not? I'm not a
writer. I'm not a psychologist.

735
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:46,327
We don't need
a psychologist.

736
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:48,659
We need someone who's been
in the trenches, baby.

737
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,131
Liz, I don't know
what I'm talking about.

738
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,863
All I have are a bunch of notebooks
filled with ridiculous little factoids.

739
00:47:55,937 --> 00:47:59,270
I mean, this is not a
full-time job. This is a hobby.

740
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:03,209
A sick, twisted,
pathetic little hobby.

741
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:05,872
You get paid to write about something
you're already obsessed with.

742
00:48:05,947 --> 00:48:09,041
If you want anonymity,
we'll give you a pen name.

743
00:48:09,117 --> 00:48:11,176
I personally think
it'd be cathartic for you,

744
00:48:11,253 --> 00:48:15,121
and you'd be doing your dear,
sweet, wonderful friend a huge favor.

745
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:20,652
Pen name, huh?

746
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:29,392
I'm doing this once.
Do you hear me? One time.

747
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:32,235
- Fine. I'm telling you, it's gonna be fun.
- Fun?

748
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:35,299
I'm helping concoct the background
of a nonexistent scientist...

749
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:40,076
who's about to publish her delusional
theories in the nation's top men's magazine.

750
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:43,174
You're right. Ha!
This is fun.

751
00:48:43,251 --> 00:48:45,651
Okay, try this. Um...

752
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,315
Born in Sussex, 1937.

753
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:56,827
Cofounder of the Institute of
Pathological Narcissism in Vienna.

754
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:14,374
- Who is she?
- The recently deceased Harriet Gould of Astoria.

755
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:16,781
No surviving relatives.
She's perfect.

756
00:49:16,852 --> 00:49:20,219
- She even has a bun.
- That's her.

757
00:49:20,288 --> 00:49:23,086
Dr. Marie Charles.

758
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:25,592
Oh, my God.

759
00:49:58,727 --> 00:50:01,093
Every bull
begins a relationship...

760
00:50:01,162 --> 00:50:04,097
with certain cards
up his sleeve... aces.

761
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:08,534
Tools of seduction
by which he lures a new cow.

762
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:10,867
One of the most
notorious examples...

763
00:50:10,939 --> 00:50:12,998
is the current cow
sob story.

764
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:17,272
Allow me to deconstruct
the essential elements.

765
00:50:17,345 --> 00:50:20,212
You're so easy to talk to,

766
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:22,944
not like my current cow.

767
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:25,418
This is key to understanding
the myth of male shyness,

768
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:27,421
for though you think
he is flattering you,

769
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:29,423
he is actually
flattering himself,

770
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:33,052
showing how open
and sensitive and honest he is.

771
00:50:35,196 --> 00:50:39,724
I just try so hard and...

772
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:43,259
Well, I'm sure she doesn't
mean to be such a cold cow.

773
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:46,705
Just in case you're starting to think he's
a coldhearted, home-wrecking womanizer,

774
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:49,573
he'll throw this in just to prove
he's putting his current cow...

775
00:50:49,644 --> 00:50:51,578
out to pasture for good reason,

776
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:55,013
and that he's actually tormented with
guilt at the thought of abandoning her.

777
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:58,348
What's that thing they always say
about the love of a good woman?

778
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,253
That, once offered,
it's guaranteed to come back...

779
00:51:01,323 --> 00:51:03,257
and bite her in the ass.

780
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:05,623
- Enter case in point.
- Hey.

781
00:51:05,694 --> 00:51:08,094
- Hey.
- Thought you were with what's her name.

782
00:51:08,163 --> 00:51:12,224
- Didn't work out.
- You have a little saddle sore on that white horse of yours?

783
00:51:14,202 --> 00:51:17,330
- Okay, so what happened?
- Just lost interest.

784
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:20,033
What do you mean,
you lost interest?

785
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:22,133
How exactly?

786
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:26,237
Christ, Jane, do we really have
to have another postmortem?

787
00:51:26,314 --> 00:51:29,477
I'm just curious is all.
So you went to a movie,

788
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,486
then back to her place?

789
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:35,580
Then what?

790
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:37,648
So we're in the kitchen
getting a drink,

791
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,660
and suddenly, she starts
looking for food.

792
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:43,027
We had dinner right after the
movie, but... I don't know.

793
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:46,363
She was still hungry.
She's always hungry, it seems.

794
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:49,801
And that's bad,
Women who eat?

795
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:57,437
Okay, so you're in the kitchen,
she's hungry again, inexplicably,

796
00:51:57,512 --> 00:51:59,377
then what?

797
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:03,042
So she takes out a pint
of Haagen-Dazs... a pint...

798
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,451
and just starts eating it
right out of the container,

799
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:09,888
and there was just something
about it that turned me off.

800
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:12,984
Was the refrigerator door open?

801
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:15,859
- Why?
- Answer the question. Open or closed?

802
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,955
It was open, I think.

803
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:20,058
Would it have made a
difference if it were shut?

804
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:23,036
Would that have made the act of
a nonfat woman eating ice cream...

805
00:52:23,104 --> 00:52:25,038
a little less revolting to you?

806
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:28,974
What if she'd not had dinner?
What if she were legitimately hungry...

807
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:32,036
before she shoved her face
into a trough of Haagen-Dazs?

808
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:34,047
Would it have repulsed you less
if she used a dish?

809
00:52:34,115 --> 00:52:37,380
- Good night, you psycho!
- Good night, neophiliac!

810
00:52:37,452 --> 00:52:42,389
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

811
00:52:42,457 --> 00:52:45,255
- Hallelujah Hallelujah
- Are you sitting down?

812
00:52:45,326 --> 00:52:48,193
Oprah read the article
on her show today.

813
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:50,424
The audience went so crazy for it,
she called us personally,

814
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:52,432
begging for Dr. Charles
to appear as her guest.

815
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,901
- What?
- I told everyone in P.R. A different story.

816
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:59,235
She's vacationing in Hong Kong.
She's at a conference in Tangiers.

817
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:02,765
- Oh, this is bad.
- No, no, no. This is all good.

818
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:05,472
Okay? Trust me.
I've got it all under control.

819
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:08,107
This won't come
anywhere near you.

820
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:10,743
"And so, while the male
may often seem shy...

821
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:15,882
"with all his Uriah Heep hand-wringin'
and 'aw, shucks' toe-kickin',

822
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:18,653
"he's actually a narcissist...

823
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:24,131
"because this apparent shyness belies
the more deeply rooted feelings...

824
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:28,033
"of unworthiness
and fear of rejection.

825
00:53:28,103 --> 00:53:32,301
"And this is what compels him
to constantly seek attention...

826
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:38,209
from new cow after new cow
ad nauseam, ad infinitum. "

827
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:40,611
This is such great stuff.

828
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:43,674
It obliterates any sentimentality
we might have...

829
00:53:43,752 --> 00:53:46,084
about what
noble creatures men are.

830
00:53:46,154 --> 00:53:49,419
This right here is what we've been
looking for. It's-It's provocative.

831
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:52,927
It's clever. It's got mass
appeal written all over it.

832
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:55,792
There's just one problem. Nobody
can seem to find this woman.

833
00:53:55,864 --> 00:53:58,162
The Today Show's tried.
Oprah's tried.

834
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,394
- Yeah, and have you tried?
- Eddie?

835
00:54:00,468 --> 00:54:03,835
- Uh, well, no.
- Well, get on it!

836
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:06,999
Do you realize what
we're talking about here?

837
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:10,875
The ungettable get?
- Yes!

838
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:14,972
I don't care what it takes.
You find that Dr. Marie Charles...

839
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:18,087
and bring her here
to my studio.

840
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,620
Let me get this straight. Your
best friend works at M magazine...

841
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:22,782
and she has no idea
where this cow doctor is?

842
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:24,917
That's what she said.

843
00:54:24,993 --> 00:54:26,961
I don't buy that.
Why are you holding out on me?

844
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:29,156
I'm not!
I told you she's working on it!

845
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,199
- Just give me her number.
- I'm not gonna give you her number.

846
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:32,824
- Why not?
- She's working on it!

847
00:54:32,901 --> 00:54:35,369
- Besides, you'd never reach her. She's atJivamukti.
- Huh?

848
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:37,405
- Yoga.
- Yoga what?

849
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:39,771
- Jivamukti.
- Jiv...

850
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:45,808
- Manhattan. Jivamukti.
- Eddie!

851
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:48,372
It's a yoga place.

852
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,975
Eddie, don't be a jerk!

853
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,156
Eddie, come on!

854
00:54:57,226 --> 00:54:59,956
- This is so ridiculous.
- Ohhh!

855
00:55:00,028 --> 00:55:02,929
Hey, hey, you have
to leave your shoes in here.

856
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:09,529
Liz?
Excuse me.

857
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:14,304
Jerk, she is my best friend.
I would certainly know if...

858
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:16,503
Jane?

859
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:19,680
Stay!

860
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:23,184
- Bring your leg up higher.
- Excuse me, sir, you're gonna have to leave.

861
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:25,311
Gee. Sorry. I know.
I'm just looking for a friend.

862
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:27,719
Oh.

863
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,383
- Sorry. You okay?
- Eddie.

864
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,958
How you doin', Becca?

865
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:40,126
I'm good.

866
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:44,038
What are you
doing here?

867
00:55:46,475 --> 00:55:50,070
I, uh... I-I don't know.

868
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,371
Come, class. Let's forget
about this disturbance.

869
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:55,439
It's okay. Everyone,
let's come on up.

870
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:58,714
Get back to your spaces
and let's prepare for lion pose.

871
00:55:58,787 --> 00:56:02,416
Hey, inhale. Exhale.
Open your mouth.

872
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:04,516
Stick out your tongue.

873
00:56:04,593 --> 00:56:08,120
That was Rebecca?
Eddie, talk to me.

874
00:56:08,197 --> 00:56:10,131
There's nothing
to talk about.

875
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:13,930
- Hi, Liz.
- I cannot believe it.

876
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:16,698
- Hey, Janey!
- Hi! Hi, guys!

877
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:20,037
Eddie, this is my sister Alice
and my brother-in-law Stephen.

878
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:23,737
- You're... Eddie.
- Yeah. Hey.

879
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:26,144
- Are you two taking yoga class together?
- No.

880
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:30,151
- We were just... I... It-It's
stupid. - No, no, it's not stupid.

881
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:32,710
- We don't think it's stupid.
- No. We just started the pregnancy class.

882
00:56:32,788 --> 00:56:34,779
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.

883
00:56:34,856 --> 00:56:37,882
- Thanks. She's a great breather.
- Listen, I gotta go.

884
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,622
- Hey, it was really nice to
meet you, Eddie. - Bye-bye.

885
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:22,760
Eddie preferred
to leave things unsaid...

886
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:26,841
and went back to grazing
in greener pastures.

887
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:31,642
Merry Christmas.

888
00:57:31,712 --> 00:57:33,703
Merry Christmas, everyone.

889
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:35,715
Merry Christmas.

890
00:57:35,783 --> 00:57:38,684
- I'm getting out of here.
- Okay.

891
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:43,486
- Uh, two champagnes, please.
- Yes, sir.

892
00:57:43,557 --> 00:57:47,084
Shouldn't that be a champagne
and a Shirley Temple?

893
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:50,324
- Sorry.
- No, you're not.

894
00:57:50,397 --> 00:57:54,197
- So where'd you meet her?
- She's Emily's roommate.

895
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:57,499
Emily that I made
coffee for last Sunday?

896
00:57:57,571 --> 00:57:59,903
Uh-huh.

897
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:02,135
Isn't that complicated?

898
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:06,009
It's never complicated, Jane.

899
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,071
Thank you.

900
00:58:24,665 --> 00:58:28,192
Evening, sir.
What can I get you?

901
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:30,396
- Scotch, please.
- Yes, sir.

902
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:33,998
Did you hear Diane's joke
about the reindeer?

903
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:37,543
Funny!

904
00:58:41,348 --> 00:58:43,407
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

905
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,260
I miss you, Jane.

906
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:05,836
Am I... Am I supposed
to walk away now?

907
00:59:09,643 --> 00:59:12,476
No.

908
00:59:12,546 --> 00:59:16,710
Can we get away from this?
Can we do something?

909
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:19,412
Get together for lunch,
dinner, Friday night.

910
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:24,614
Friday is New Year's Eve.

911
00:59:24,692 --> 00:59:29,061
Oh, that's right.
That's right.

912
00:59:29,129 --> 00:59:31,063
You probably have
some, uh, plans.

913
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:33,065
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

914
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:36,227
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.

915
00:59:36,303 --> 00:59:39,670
I have...

916
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,301
No.

917
00:59:43,377 --> 00:59:47,313
I have none.

918
00:59:47,381 --> 00:59:52,751
Could I call you?
Would that be okay?

919
00:59:55,422 --> 00:59:58,391
Yeah.

920
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,791
Merry Christmas, Jane.

921
01:00:03,864 --> 01:00:08,130
- Yee-haaaw! - Jingle
bells Ji-Jingle bells

922
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:11,262
Well, you can't stop now.
We'll do it together.

923
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:13,533
You're syndicated
in over 300 newspapers.

924
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:15,598
Talk radio is having
a field day with it.

925
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:18,736
Clearly the world is
one giant used-cow lot.

926
01:00:18,812 --> 01:00:22,646
- Look, I just want to think about it, okay?
- What's there to think about?

927
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:25,150
You don't want to be
a post-feminist icon?

928
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:29,417
Come on. Let's get something great to
wear for Julians New Year's Eve party.

929
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:35,489
I meant to tell you that...
I kind of made other plans.

930
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:37,928
I mean, it's nothing major.
It's not a big...

931
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:40,364
- Well...
- What are you talking about?

932
01:00:40,434 --> 01:00:44,803
- Ray asked me out.
- Ray?

933
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:47,898
As in Ray Brown?

934
01:00:47,975 --> 01:00:49,909
As in devil incarnate?

935
01:00:49,977 --> 01:00:52,070
No! No, I forbid it!

936
01:00:52,146 --> 01:00:54,239
L- I-I thought you
were over this.

937
01:00:54,314 --> 01:00:57,181
I think I'm having
second thoughts.

938
01:00:57,251 --> 01:01:02,712
Oh, so now... Dr. Charles
is having them too.

939
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:15,893
- Done yet?
- You got a hot date?

940
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:18,563
- No, I just have to pee.
- Be my guest.

941
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:21,233
- What's this, party Viagra?
- Huh?

942
01:01:21,308 --> 01:01:23,435
No, it's nicotine gum.

943
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:27,879
- When did you quit?
- Oh, since Daphne told me she wanted to marry a smoker.

944
01:01:27,948 --> 01:01:30,246
Here.

945
01:01:30,317 --> 01:01:32,376
Thank you.

946
01:01:32,453 --> 01:01:34,614
Why don't you put on a dress
and come out with me tonight?

947
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:36,952
Why, so I can
trail after your harem?

948
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:39,584
- I'm flying solo. I thought
I'd keep my options open.

949
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,594
Yeah?

950
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:43,630
Although
that may be for me.

951
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:47,291
- Hello.
- You're home.

952
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:48,891
Does this mean you've
come to your senses?

953
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:51,164
No, and I only have
an hour to get ready.

954
01:01:51,238 --> 01:01:53,297
So quit worrying about me.
Go out. Have a good time.

955
01:01:53,373 --> 01:01:55,307
I'm going to wear that red lipstick
you gave, and I'll call you tomorrow.

956
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,309
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

957
01:02:04,218 --> 01:02:06,812
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

958
01:02:08,689 --> 01:02:11,385
- Doing what?
- Ray.

959
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:14,154
I don't know what
you're talking about.

960
01:02:14,228 --> 01:02:17,163
Okay.

961
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:22,430
- Well, if you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
- Oh, thanks.

962
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:25,301
I think I'll...
jump into my pj's,

963
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:27,772
probably
watch a little TV...

964
01:02:27,841 --> 01:02:30,105
- go to bed early...
- Happy New Year.

965
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:32,202
Same to you!

966
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:57,099
Now, back to our special New
Year's Eve coverage with Hugh Downs.

967
01:02:57,171 --> 01:02:59,799
To recap, it was
less than 48 hours ago...

968
01:02:59,873 --> 01:03:02,239
that Ray Brown called
to confirm his plans...

969
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:04,402
to take Jane Goodale out
this evening,

970
01:03:04,478 --> 01:03:06,776
a clear indication
that he was, indeed,

971
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:10,010
regretting his decision
to terminate their involvement.

972
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:13,883
So the question remains,
why hasn't he shown up yet?

973
01:03:13,954 --> 01:03:17,720
By all accounts, it would appear
that Mr. Brown is sticking firmly...

974
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:20,316
to his September sanctions.

975
01:04:20,687 --> 01:04:26,125
Nine, eight, seven,

976
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:31,859
six, five, four,
three, two, one!

977
01:04:31,932 --> 01:04:33,866
Happy New Year!

978
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,031
Jane!

979
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:51,442
Whoo!

980
01:04:55,689 --> 01:04:57,680
Ahh...

981
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,588
Ohh...

982
01:05:13,173 --> 01:05:15,971
Jane!

983
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:31,718
Happy New Year!

984
01:05:40,134 --> 01:05:43,297
- Jane?
- Don't even bother.

985
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:46,066
- L-I need to talk to you.
- Shh...

986
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,576
Excuse me. Why didn't you...
Why didn't you return my calls?

987
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:51,668
You mean the calls that came
after the call you didn't make?

988
01:05:51,745 --> 01:05:53,906
L...
This is not true.

989
01:05:53,981 --> 01:05:57,576
It's so true.

990
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:04,248
Will you stop
for just a moment?

991
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:06,259
- Hey, Jane.
- Listen, I know it was inexcus...

992
01:06:06,327 --> 01:06:08,261
- Good morning!
- Hi, Jane. Ray.

993
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:11,787
- There's a reason I didn't show up that night.
- I'm sure there is.

994
01:06:11,865 --> 01:06:13,799
And you know what?
I couldn't possibly care less.

995
01:06:13,867 --> 01:06:15,801
So let's forget about it.
Okay!

996
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:18,030
I don't suppose you're
interested in hearing me out.

997
01:06:18,105 --> 01:06:20,232
You know what, Ray?
The truth is...

998
01:06:20,307 --> 01:06:23,105
Hi!
You did me a favor.

999
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:26,044
Any delusions I may have still
had about you, they're gone now.

1000
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:29,711
It was a gift.
You released me.

1001
01:06:29,783 --> 01:06:32,274
- For the first time in months,
I feel great.

1002
01:06:32,353 --> 01:06:36,153
- Staff meeting in my office in two minutes.
- Okay, be right there.

1003
01:06:38,325 --> 01:06:42,386
Uh, what's wrong?

1004
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:45,523
Diane's wearing your shirt.

1005
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,534
The shirt I bought you
on the sidewalk.

1006
01:06:54,108 --> 01:06:57,339
So, does that mean
that the, uh...

1007
01:06:57,411 --> 01:07:01,211
- the two of you are...
- Seeing each other again.

1008
01:07:01,282 --> 01:07:04,740
- Yes. That's what I've been trying to explain.
- Wait. Stop.

1009
01:07:04,818 --> 01:07:07,150
Did you say, "Again"?

1010
01:07:07,221 --> 01:07:10,520
I should have told you
a long time ago,

1011
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:13,219
but Diane insisted
on keeping it quiet.

1012
01:07:13,294 --> 01:07:15,489
- We got back together right before New Year's and...
- Oh...

1013
01:07:15,562 --> 01:07:19,328
and we went away for a couple of days, and
it was terrible of me to not call, but I...

1014
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,301
Ray, I've got
Tony Robbins on line three!

1015
01:07:22,369 --> 01:07:26,362
- Ohh! Go on.
- I'm really sorry, Jane.

1016
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,659
Hey, what is it?

1017
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:52,790
- "D... " She's "D."
- I'm not following.

1018
01:07:52,866 --> 01:07:55,596
Di... Di... "D."
Diane is "D."

1019
01:07:55,669 --> 01:07:58,433
Yes. "D" is for Diane.
"E" is for Eddie.

1020
01:07:58,505 --> 01:08:01,269
Ray's "D."
She's the one!

1021
01:08:01,342 --> 01:08:03,776
I mean, she was... She
is the one. I mean, she...

1022
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:05,835
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

1023
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:07,938
- Just breathe.
Breathe, Jane. Breathe.

1024
01:08:08,015 --> 01:08:10,483
Now, let me get this straight.
Ray and Diane are together?

1025
01:08:10,551 --> 01:08:13,111
- Back together. Together again.
- All right. I get it.

1026
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:15,587
- Let it go. Ray and Diane?
- Yeah!

1027
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,590
Okay. Shh...
It doesn't matter.

1028
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:19,751
That chapter's over, remember?
It doesn't matter.

1029
01:08:19,827 --> 01:08:21,886
Now we got to go in there,
so pull it together.

1030
01:08:21,962 --> 01:08:24,226
Do you hear me?
Don't cry.

1031
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:26,766
- Don't cry, please.
You're gonna be fine.

1032
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:28,893
- Okay.
- We're gonna go in there.

1033
01:08:28,969 --> 01:08:31,995
- Good. You all right?
- Okay.

1034
01:08:33,607 --> 01:08:37,043
Jane, where are we
for next week?

1035
01:08:37,111 --> 01:08:40,603
Uh, we're-we're all set with
Gerard Depardieu. Right, Jane?

1036
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:44,617
Oh, good.
New movie?

1037
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:46,880
Am-Amazing.
Amazing.

1038
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:49,582
L- I actually, uh...
I saw it. It's, uh...

1039
01:08:49,656 --> 01:08:51,988
about a man whose whole
marriage falls apart and...

1040
01:08:52,059 --> 01:08:54,687
I mean, it's brutal,
actually. I mean...

1041
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:56,992
You know, they show
the whole love story first.

1042
01:08:57,064 --> 01:09:00,795
You see that this woman means...
everything to this-this man.

1043
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:03,894
In fact, there's this-this...
this one scene...

1044
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:07,634
where he actually sits
in just a... a dark... uhh...

1045
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:11,906
It's very touching. He's sits
in a dark room, and he just...

1046
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:15,471
You just start to see
the-the tears and stuff.

1047
01:09:15,549 --> 01:09:19,349
I mean, the man is completely,
you know, broken, and you feel it.

1048
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,820
You really feel it, and it's
devastating. It's a devastating...

1049
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:27,589
Is this a joke?

1050
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:30,688
N- No.
What do you mean?

1051
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,800
I mean...
I mean, is this a joke?

1052
01:09:37,871 --> 01:09:42,240
- No, I saw it two nights ago.
- What's so funny, Jane?

1053
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:46,040
- Oh, can you believe this guy?
- I know, I...

1054
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:49,014
So sensitive... So...

1055
01:09:49,082 --> 01:09:52,916
So devastated when it comes to
some chubby French guy, but, oh!

1056
01:09:52,986 --> 01:09:56,979
Stomp on somebody's heart in real life,
and where's his sorry-ass pity then, huh?

1057
01:09:57,057 --> 01:10:00,026
Nowhere! Why?
Because he doesn't get it!

1058
01:10:00,093 --> 01:10:02,493
He never gets it!

1059
01:10:02,563 --> 01:10:04,554
Someone please
explain it to me.

1060
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:09,159
Because I don't know
what you are talking about!

1061
01:10:17,644 --> 01:10:20,442
- Evelyn, is she free?
- Yeah. She is.

1062
01:10:20,514 --> 01:10:22,448
Thanks.

1063
01:10:31,258 --> 01:10:35,058
I'm sorry, Diane. L... I don't
know where that came from.

1064
01:10:35,128 --> 01:10:38,586
Well, I do. I know
exactly where it came from.

1065
01:10:38,665 --> 01:10:40,599
You do?

1066
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:43,602
Some guy crushed you
under his boot heel,

1067
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:46,104
and you lashed out
at poor Ray as being...

1068
01:10:46,173 --> 01:10:48,266
representative of the prick
that did that to you.

1069
01:10:48,342 --> 01:10:52,745
- I'm right, aren't I?
- More or less.

1070
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:54,747
Well, you can't do it, Jane.

1071
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:57,545
- I don't care how much it hurts.
- I know.

1072
01:10:57,618 --> 01:10:59,643
No, you don't know.
Now, sit down and listen to me.

1073
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:07,723
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1074
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:13,557
About six months ago,
my boyfriend tried to leave me.

1075
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:17,126
Well, he did.
He left.

1076
01:11:17,204 --> 01:11:22,665
And I was devastated. I was
destroyed. Did you see it?

1077
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:29,546
- No. L-I-I didn't. No.
- Right.

1078
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:33,882
Do you know why?
Because if I fall apart,

1079
01:11:33,954 --> 01:11:36,047
everything around me
falls apart...

1080
01:11:36,123 --> 01:11:41,584
everything that I have worked
my entire life for.

1081
01:11:41,662 --> 01:11:43,960
- Do you love him?
- Wh-Who?

1082
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:48,593
- Him. The guy.
- I don't know.

1083
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:52,332
Of course you do. Now, have
you talked to him lately?

1084
01:11:52,406 --> 01:11:56,001
No. No. Not ex...
Not exactly talked.

1085
01:11:56,076 --> 01:12:00,137
Do it. Do it.
Talk to him.

1086
01:12:02,316 --> 01:12:07,276
I used to feel that if I
kept my heart to myself,

1087
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:11,950
If I never let him know how much I
needed him, that he would never leave me.

1088
01:12:12,025 --> 01:12:14,892
Well, guess what?
He did.

1089
01:12:14,962 --> 01:12:19,524
And I lived in a private,
pathetic puddle...

1090
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,125
until I couldn't
stand it anymore,

1091
01:12:22,202 --> 01:12:25,262
And so you know what I did?
I showed up at his doorstep...

1092
01:12:25,339 --> 01:12:29,139
with two corned beef sandwiches
on rye, lightly toasted,

1093
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:33,703
and I told him that
I was lost without him.

1094
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,941
You said that?

1095
01:12:36,016 --> 01:12:40,009
Pretty progressive, huh?
And I'm happy. Go figure.

1096
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:42,078
I never thought
I'd be happy.

1097
01:12:47,559 --> 01:12:49,686
And you believe her?

1098
01:12:49,761 --> 01:12:52,821
This is true love? This is what
we all should be looking for?

1099
01:12:52,898 --> 01:12:55,458
That is the most tragic thing
I've ever heard.

1100
01:12:55,534 --> 01:13:00,130
We're talking about a woman whose boyfriend
was screwing you in order to get away from her.

1101
01:13:00,205 --> 01:13:02,366
And she's the authority
on romance?

1102
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,273
The only reason she believes
that crap is because she has to.

1103
01:13:05,343 --> 01:13:07,709
She's an old cow.

1104
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:11,943
Truth is all we need to do
is adjust our radar a bit.

1105
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:15,043
You know, learn to be attracted to
men we're simply not attracted to.

1106
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,112
Whoa. Hang on.
What are you talking about?

1107
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:21,216
Well, for example, normally...

1108
01:13:21,293 --> 01:13:24,524
I might be attracted
to a guy like you.

1109
01:13:24,596 --> 01:13:28,464
But thanks to Dr. Charles, I've learned
to control my passion for testosterone,

1110
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:30,467
and now I can proudly say...

1111
01:13:30,535 --> 01:13:34,972
that I no longer find you
in the least bit desirable.

1112
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,975
Oh, gee.
That's swell.

1113
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:40,273
I need a drink.

1114
01:13:41,947 --> 01:13:45,439
Does she have any idea
that she's completely insane?

1115
01:13:45,517 --> 01:13:49,817
No. She's right. Diane is an old
cow. He cannot go back to her.

1116
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,379
Okay, that's it.

1117
01:13:52,457 --> 01:13:57,417
Jane, these are people,
not cows!

1118
01:14:08,073 --> 01:14:10,007
Hello.

1119
01:14:16,715 --> 01:14:18,842
I should have known
you would take his side.

1120
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:22,375
This isn't about sides, Jane.
It's about dealing with reality.

1121
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:25,321
- And you need to get a grip.
- Oh, that's rich...

1122
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:28,791
coming from an emotional moron who's
whoring his way through Manhattan,

1123
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,488
using women
like A.T.M. Machines.

1124
01:14:31,563 --> 01:14:34,862
Oh, that's great. I get dumped,
sleep around, and I'm a moron.

1125
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:37,333
You, you get dumped
and become the disciple...

1126
01:14:37,402 --> 01:14:40,166
of some crone-slash-quack
behavioral scientist...

1127
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:43,298
who can't tell the difference between
quadrupeds and bipeds, and you're normal.

1128
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,900
- She is not a crone. And she is not a quack!
- How do you know?

1129
01:14:45,977 --> 01:14:48,571
Who gives a shit?

1130
01:14:48,647 --> 01:14:52,378
You know, while you were out there buying
these theories about the horrors of men...

1131
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,816
- And why guys like Ray
won't ever come back,

1132
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:57,184
deep down inside
you're hoping he would.

1133
01:14:57,255 --> 01:15:00,850
Men are evil. Men are scum. But please,
Ray, won't you make a liar out of me?

1134
01:15:00,926 --> 01:15:03,486
Well, you got
what you asked for, Jane.

1135
01:15:03,561 --> 01:15:06,553
He did go back. He just
did it with the wrong girl!

1136
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,468
It's over! Over.

1137
01:15:12,704 --> 01:15:15,434
- Why can't you just let it go?
- Because.

1138
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:17,702
- Because why?
- Because I can't.

1139
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:21,644
- Why?
- Because I was happy.

1140
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:24,648
Because if this...
theory is wrong,

1141
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:27,742
men don't leave all women,
Eddie, they leave me.

1142
01:15:35,393 --> 01:15:38,954
I know what
it does to you. I know.

1143
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:42,488
Maybe that's why
we hold on as hard as we do.

1144
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:47,300
We just can't believe that such a
miracle can ever happen to us twice.

1145
01:15:47,372 --> 01:15:52,207
And...

1146
01:15:52,277 --> 01:15:54,268
But it can.

1147
01:15:56,281 --> 01:15:59,944
Someday you'll
find it again.

1148
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:03,818
- I promise you.
Look at me.

1149
01:16:03,888 --> 01:16:07,483
- A mess.
- I'm looking at you.

1150
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:13,096
And you're beautiful.

1151
01:16:13,164 --> 01:16:17,328
Hey, you are beautiful.

1152
01:16:19,237 --> 01:16:24,231
You're intelligent... and real.

1153
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,008
And Ray is not the last man
you're ever gonna love.

1154
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,659
I promise you he's not.

1155
01:16:48,033 --> 01:16:51,002
Shh. Shh...

1156
01:17:43,755 --> 01:17:46,781
Oh, my God.

1157
01:17:56,634 --> 01:18:00,934
Oh...

1158
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:20,680
Mmm...

1159
01:18:28,032 --> 01:18:31,126
Hmm...

1160
01:18:31,202 --> 01:18:33,432
Hi.

1161
01:18:34,706 --> 01:18:36,640
Hi.

1162
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:40,439
Uh... listen.

1163
01:18:43,314 --> 01:18:45,305
- L...
- No, no, no.

1164
01:18:45,383 --> 01:18:47,817
No. No.

1165
01:18:47,886 --> 01:18:50,753
No, you're not going
to analyze this one, Jane.

1166
01:18:50,822 --> 01:18:55,225
- I'm not?
- No. No.

1167
01:18:55,293 --> 01:18:59,229
You're so hell-bent on making sure things fit,
you miss out on all the fun when they don't.

1168
01:18:59,297 --> 01:19:01,288
- Eh? Oh...
- Well, I...

1169
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:05,735
No? Right now you're trying
to rationalize last night.

1170
01:19:05,803 --> 01:19:08,465
Yeah? Worrying about
what might have happened.

1171
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,338
Me, I'm just getting a kick
out of the fact that I, uh,

1172
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:13,934
spent an entire night
with you in my arms,

1173
01:19:14,012 --> 01:19:16,003
and I didn't even cop a feel.

1174
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:24,077
Well...

1175
01:19:24,155 --> 01:19:27,522
maybe one.

1176
01:19:31,162 --> 01:19:34,620
- Whew!
- What?

1177
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:38,032
Well, I'm relieved.

1178
01:19:38,102 --> 01:19:41,731
I mean,
for a second there, I...

1179
01:19:41,806 --> 01:19:47,108
I thought maybe you
thought last night was, um...

1180
01:19:47,178 --> 01:19:52,775
You know, or that
you would... think...

1181
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:56,877
That would've really blown your
Dr. Charles out of the water, huh?

1182
01:19:58,523 --> 01:20:02,619
Temporarily maybe, but you would
have shown your spots eventually.

1183
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:07,222
- My spots.
- Oh, come on, Eddie.

1184
01:20:07,298 --> 01:20:10,495
Men never fail to do
what's in their nature to do.

1185
01:20:15,306 --> 01:20:18,036
And what is that, Jane?

1186
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:22,011
Disappoint you?
Abandon you?

1187
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,311
Hmm?

1188
01:20:25,383 --> 01:20:29,088
What's really behind
these theories, huh?

1189
01:20:29,221 --> 01:20:31,951
What are you hiding?

1190
01:20:32,024 --> 01:20:34,925
Nothing.

1191
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:40,158
Sorry. What you see
is what you get.

1192
01:20:40,232 --> 01:20:43,668
Is it?

1193
01:20:46,705 --> 01:20:50,004
You know, this is not about my
nature, Jane. This is about yours.

1194
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,688
- Hello.
- Janey?

1195
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,955
Listen, Stephen.
Can I call y'all back?

1196
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:15,466
Your sister's in the hospital.
We lost the baby, kiddo.

1197
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:26,277
Hey, Janey.

1198
01:21:38,924 --> 01:21:41,950
Did you see Stephen?

1199
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:44,222
I saw him in the hallway...

1200
01:21:44,296 --> 01:21:46,287
- Getting water.
- Getting ice.

1201
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:49,994
Good luck.
God love him.

1202
01:21:50,068 --> 01:21:53,560
They break so easily,
don't they?

1203
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,547
Last weekend,
he woke up in a panic.

1204
01:22:04,616 --> 01:22:08,814
He said that he had to go
shopping for the baby.

1205
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:12,550
You know how anal he is. I thought
he was gonna come back with...

1206
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:16,424
thermometers and baby blankets
and safety gates.

1207
01:22:16,495 --> 01:22:21,592
When he walked in the door,
all he had was this little, tiny bag...

1208
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:26,434
and inside was this...

1209
01:22:26,505 --> 01:22:29,030
this perfect little
baseball mitt.

1210
01:22:38,684 --> 01:22:42,916
He got it in his head that
it was going to be a boy.

1211
01:22:42,988 --> 01:22:45,752
Janey.

1212
01:22:53,865 --> 01:22:56,459
Okay, I've got ice.

1213
01:22:56,535 --> 01:23:01,063
I've got blankets.
I've got magazines.

1214
01:23:08,313 --> 01:23:12,181
Look at my wife.

1215
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,720
Have you ever seen
anyone more beautiful?

1216
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:22,521
You're nuts.

1217
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:56,222
Diane, it's Jane.

1218
01:23:56,295 --> 01:24:01,062
I found Dr. Charles,

1219
01:24:06,038 --> 01:24:09,838
Okay, is everybody ready
to have a good time?

1220
01:24:09,908 --> 01:24:12,274
Now, come on. You're going to
have to do a lot better than that.

1221
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:16,913
Okay, let me explain how everything
on the show's gonna work.

1222
01:24:16,982 --> 01:24:20,213
- It's a really informal show...
- Yo, Ray! Do we have her on the line yet?

1223
01:24:20,285 --> 01:24:24,187
Two minutes. The magazine's
putting her through.

1224
01:24:24,256 --> 01:24:27,487
- All right!
- Two minutes.

1225
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:31,290
- Diane, two minutes.
- So, Diane's going to come out.

1226
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:33,923
The first guest is going to come.
We have about a 15-minute segment.

1227
01:24:33,999 --> 01:24:37,025
Our first interview is gonna be
on the telephone, okay?

1228
01:24:37,102 --> 01:24:39,036
Dr. Marie Charles.

1229
01:24:50,649 --> 01:24:54,949
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Are you 100% sure you want to do this?

1230
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:57,318
I'm sure. I'm sorry
to put you in this position.

1231
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:59,721
Don't worry about me. I just want to
make sure you haven't lost your mind.

1232
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:02,817
- Maybe I have.
Here she is, Ray.

1233
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:07,422
Dr. Charles.

1234
01:25:11,536 --> 01:25:15,529
Welcome. Rarely have I
had the honor to host...

1235
01:25:15,607 --> 01:25:18,075
such a distinguished
and extraordinary guest.

1236
01:25:18,143 --> 01:25:22,102
Today, Dr. Marie Charles
speaks out for the first time...

1237
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,546
since the publication
of her searing article...

1238
01:25:24,616 --> 01:25:26,948
Network says we've already
had 20,000 hits on the web site.

1239
01:25:27,018 --> 01:25:30,476
- Holy cow.
The reclusive Dr. Charles...

1240
01:25:30,555 --> 01:25:34,685
has agreed to an exclusive,
live telephone interview.

1241
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,422
And I consider it
a rare gift...

1242
01:25:37,496 --> 01:25:42,160
from someone whose work has meant
a tremendous amount in my life,

1243
01:25:42,234 --> 01:25:45,169
as I'm sure yours.

1244
01:25:45,237 --> 01:25:48,570
Dr. Marie Charles

1245
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,801
Hello, Dr. Charles.
Are you there?

1246
01:25:50,876 --> 01:25:54,903
Hello, Dr. Charles.
Can you hear me?

1247
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,811
I'm getting nothing.

1248
01:25:59,684 --> 01:26:01,652
- Where the hell is she? Where's the feed?
- Excuse me.

1249
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,188
We seem to be having
some technical difficulties.

1250
01:26:04,256 --> 01:26:06,747
If you'll just bear with us,
I'm sure we'll get it repaired.

1251
01:26:09,428 --> 01:26:11,760
Tell them to patch it through
on the other line.

1252
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:14,094
- We can't. We only have one dedicated line.
- Shit!

1253
01:26:18,603 --> 01:26:20,537
Okay, take us to commercial.

1254
01:26:20,605 --> 01:26:22,869
Uh, she's here.
She wants to go on.

1255
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:26,533
Ho-Hold that.
Hold that. Hold that.

1256
01:26:26,611 --> 01:26:29,341
- She's here.
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

1257
01:26:29,414 --> 01:26:31,974
it seems that the reason we've
been unable to get through...

1258
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,018
to Dr. Charles
telephonically...

1259
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:36,553
is because at this moment
she is right here in our studio,

1260
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:39,454
having decided to do
the interview in person after all.

1261
01:26:39,524 --> 01:26:42,049
- Holy shit.
- So let's not waste any more time.

1262
01:26:42,127 --> 01:26:45,187
Join me in welcoming
Dr. Marie Charles!

1263
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:52,466
- Makeup?
- Stop. Stop.

1264
01:26:52,537 --> 01:26:54,801
Show yourself, Dr. Charles.

1265
01:26:57,075 --> 01:27:00,476
Wake up!

1266
01:27:06,218 --> 01:27:08,743
Jane, what's going on?
Where's Dr. Charles?

1267
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,322
There is no Dr. Charles.

1268
01:27:14,392 --> 01:27:16,622
There never was.

1269
01:27:18,964 --> 01:27:23,867
I invented her, Diane.

1270
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:27,871
- You...
- I invented her because...

1271
01:27:27,939 --> 01:27:32,501
I had something to say,
and... somehow...

1272
01:27:32,577 --> 01:27:39,278
I thought if... if-if-if it were
coming from a 65-year-old Ph. D.,

1273
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:41,546
that you would
see it the way I had...

1274
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:47,422
as a truth, as a legitimate,
scientific truth.

1275
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:51,952
But it isn't.
It's completely ridiculous.

1276
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:56,831
And...

1277
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:59,268
I lied to you all,
and I lied to myself.

1278
01:27:59,337 --> 01:28:03,735
Because
the real truth is that...

1279
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,739
I was heartbroken...
and lost.

1280
01:28:10,816 --> 01:28:14,616
You know, and I just wanted
to understand it somehow.

1281
01:28:14,686 --> 01:28:19,589
I wanted it to be...
about them.

1282
01:28:19,658 --> 01:28:22,821
So everything I thought I had figured
out was completely upside-down.

1283
01:28:22,894 --> 01:28:25,454
I thought this bull had gone on
to another new cow,

1284
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:28,158
when, in fact, she was an old cow
who had become a new cow again.

1285
01:28:28,233 --> 01:28:30,997
I mean, what was
I talking about?

1286
01:28:31,069 --> 01:28:34,971
I was comparing
men to animals,

1287
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,476
- which... okay, let's face it...
sometimes they are.

1288
01:28:40,645 --> 01:28:44,103
But sometimes they are not.

1289
01:28:44,182 --> 01:28:48,016
Sometimes
you open the barn door,

1290
01:28:48,086 --> 01:28:50,020
or the hospital room door...

1291
01:28:50,088 --> 01:28:54,855
or the bedroom door and...

1292
01:28:54,926 --> 01:28:58,384
you find the real thing.

1293
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:02,263
You find a guy who...

1294
01:29:02,334 --> 01:29:05,394
can sit with you when you
are at your absolute worst,

1295
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:08,598
when you are knee-deep in Kleenex, and
your face looks like a punching bag,

1296
01:29:08,673 --> 01:29:11,267
and you are a complete
and total mess.

1297
01:29:11,343 --> 01:29:14,676
And he...

1298
01:29:14,746 --> 01:29:17,874
can still look at you
and tell you...

1299
01:29:17,949 --> 01:29:22,886
that Ray is not the last man
you're ever going to love.

1300
01:29:38,203 --> 01:29:42,435
Eddie! Oh, my God.

1301
01:29:47,979 --> 01:29:51,107
Hey, are you all right?

1302
01:29:51,183 --> 01:29:54,311
All right.
There you go. Late edition.

1303
01:30:01,426 --> 01:30:04,486
I been searching
a long time

1304
01:30:07,632 --> 01:30:10,760
For someone
exactly like you

1305
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:18,241
- I've been traveling all around the world
- Eddie!

1306
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,642
Eddie!

1307
01:30:20,712 --> 01:30:25,274
- Oh, Eddie!
- Waiting for you to come through

1308
01:30:26,651 --> 01:30:33,557
Someone like you
can make it all worthwhile

1309
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,753
Someone like you

1310
01:30:36,828 --> 01:30:39,456
- Keep me satisfied
- Eddie! Eddie!

1311
01:30:39,531 --> 01:30:44,025
Stop. Stop.

1312
01:30:46,538 --> 01:30:48,472
Whew.

1313
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:57,279
So, what you see
is what you get, huh?

1314
01:30:59,684 --> 01:31:03,381
Minus a few gray hairs
and a Ph. D., yeah.

1315
01:31:06,691 --> 01:31:09,489
I'm really sorry, Eddie.

1316
01:31:11,896 --> 01:31:14,228
You should have told me.

1317
01:31:14,299 --> 01:31:16,927
I should have told you
a lot of things.

1318
01:31:18,003 --> 01:31:19,994
You were right.

1319
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,135
It was about my nature.

1320
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:29,006
Out of all the things
you said to me that night,

1321
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:32,413
what scared me
the most is...

1322
01:31:32,484 --> 01:31:35,647
that I would find it again.

1323
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,156
Because I have.

1324
01:31:44,496 --> 01:31:48,557
Would you please
say something?

1325
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:54,236
No.

1326
01:31:59,911 --> 01:32:03,972
I have been

1327
01:32:04,049 --> 01:32:07,951
All around the world

1328
01:32:08,019 --> 01:32:11,511
Marching to the beat
of a different drum

1329
01:32:14,759 --> 01:32:17,922
So you're saying?

1330
01:32:19,397 --> 01:32:22,730
What do we got to lose?

1331
01:32:22,801 --> 01:32:26,396
- Everything?
- Exactly.

1332
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:30,407
Someone like you

1333
01:32:30,475 --> 01:32:33,000
Can make it
all worthwhile

1334
01:32:33,078 --> 01:32:36,741
Someone like you

1335
01:32:36,815 --> 01:32:39,113
Keep me satisfied

1336
01:32:39,184 --> 01:32:42,585
Someone exactly like you

1337
01:32:44,456 --> 01:32:49,393
Someone exactly like you

1338
01:32:52,163 --> 01:32:56,293
Someone exactly like you

1339
01:32:59,003 --> 01:33:03,702
The best is yet to come

1340
01:33:05,443 --> 01:33:08,742
The best is yet to come

1341
01:33:18,789 --> 01:33:20,723
Yeah

1342
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:30,262
How do you do it
anyway

1343
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:33,666
Like there
ain't nothing to it

1344
01:33:33,737 --> 01:33:36,763
To make me stay

1345
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,037
No tricks
with smoke and mirrors

1346
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:42,840
Not anything
up your sleeve

1347
01:33:42,913 --> 01:33:45,609
A second look and
it can't be clearer

1348
01:33:45,682 --> 01:33:48,048
It's no mystery

1349
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:53,522
It's in the way you love

1350
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:58,926
It's in
the little things you say

1351
01:33:58,995 --> 01:34:03,056
It's in the way you live

1352
01:34:04,935 --> 01:34:10,805
And give your heart away

1353
01:34:10,874 --> 01:34:16,437
It's in
the chance you took

1354
01:34:16,513 --> 01:34:22,315
It's in the way
you look at me

1355
01:34:22,385 --> 01:34:28,255
That sets you
a world apart

1356
01:34:28,325 --> 01:34:33,661
And makes you
who you are

1357
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:37,496
And you are

1358
01:34:37,567 --> 01:34:39,728
Beautiful

1359
01:34:39,803 --> 01:34:41,794
You are

1360
01:34:46,676 --> 01:34:52,342
Pressed on my soul
your fingerprints

1361
01:34:52,415 --> 01:34:57,512
Goin' where
no one's ever been

1362
01:34:57,587 --> 01:35:00,954
Well, I don't know how
but I know you're in it

1363
01:35:01,024 --> 01:35:03,857
My life
my world, my dreams

1364
01:35:03,927 --> 01:35:06,452
I try but I just
can't pin it

1365
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,794
Down to one thing

1366
01:35:08,865 --> 01:35:14,235
It's in the way you love

1367
01:35:14,304 --> 01:35:19,037
It's in the little things
you say

1368
01:35:22,946 --> 01:35:27,280
Fighting fire with fire

1369
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:29,284
Watch out

1370
01:35:29,352 --> 01:35:31,582
You might get
what you're after

1371
01:35:31,655 --> 01:35:33,589
Cool babies

1372
01:35:33,657 --> 01:35:36,421
Strange but not a stranger

1373
01:35:36,493 --> 01:35:40,862
I'm an ordinary guy

1374
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:42,899
Burning down the house

1375
01:35:44,534 --> 01:35:46,559
Hold tight

1376
01:35:46,636 --> 01:35:49,002
Wait till the party's over

1377
01:35:49,072 --> 01:35:51,063
Hold tight

1378
01:35:51,141 --> 01:35:54,008
We're in for nasty weather

1379
01:35:54,077 --> 01:35:58,275
There has got to be a way

1380
01:35:58,348 --> 01:36:01,112
Burning down the house

1381
01:36:01,184 --> 01:36:03,846
Here's you ticket
Pack your bags

1382
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,514
Time for jumpin' overboard

1383
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:10,048
Transportation is here

1384
01:36:10,126 --> 01:36:15,120
Close enough but not too far
Maybe you know where you are

1385
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:18,167
Fight fire with fire

1386
01:36:19,669 --> 01:36:21,603
All wet

1387
01:36:21,671 --> 01:36:23,969
Hey, you might need
a raincoat

1388
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,974
Shakedown

1389
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:28,408
Dreams walking
in broad daylight

1390
01:36:28,478 --> 01:36:33,245
Three hundred
sixty-five degrees

1391
01:36:33,316 --> 01:36:36,547
Burning down the house

1392
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:41,455
Here was once upon a place
Sometimes I listen to myself

1393
01:36:41,524 --> 01:36:45,255
Gonna come in first place

1394
01:36:45,328 --> 01:36:50,288
People on their way to work
Baby, what did you expect

1395
01:36:50,367 --> 01:36:54,064
Gonna burst into flame

1396
01:36:54,137 --> 01:36:58,870
I don't know what you expect
staring into your TV set

1397
01:36:58,942 --> 01:37:02,275
Fighting fire with fire

1398
01:37:08,318 --> 01:37:10,343
Burning down the house

1399
01:37:20,318 --> 01:37:22,343
