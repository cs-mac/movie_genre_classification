1
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:18,707
HANUSSEN

2
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,950
Our Father, who art in Heaven.

3
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:17,025
Hallowed be thy name,
Thy kingdom come.

4
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,100
Thy will be done, on earth.

5
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,950
As it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread

6
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,725
And forgive us our sins,

7
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,998
as we forgive those who sin
against us.

8
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:33,725
And lead us not into temptation,

9
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,995
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

10
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,798
Attack!

11
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,868
Forward! Come on!

12
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,110
Forward to the Chapel!

13
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,995
Help me.

14
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,995
Help me!

15
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,467
Read me those letters.

16
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,950
Sit down, please.

17
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,075
E.

18
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,075
L.

19
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,075
A.

20
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,650
Are you dizzy?

21
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,950
- No.
- What do you feel then?

22
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,499
a...

23
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,499
void.

24
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,950
A deep, dark void.

25
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm scared of falling into it.

26
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,950
Where is this deep, dark void?

27
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,650
In me.

28
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,800
And this void is always present?

29
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,800
- I wish I could sleep.
- Give me your hand.

30
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,100
I'll give you some pills.
You need a lot of sleep now.

31
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,800
What are you thinking about
now?

32
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,950
I'm afraid they will stand me
against a wall and shoot me.

33
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,499
Were you afraid of this, before?

34
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,100
- Yes often.
- Yes, I know this feeling.

35
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,499
- Do you ever dream?
- Yes.

36
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,650
What about?

37
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,800
About the burning house...

38
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,650
and I must flee.

39
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,800
- What sort of a house?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,800
A pharmacy. And I must run.

41
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,100
And then I miss the train.
Or the ship.

42
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,800
I have had dreams like that,
too.

43
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,100
Just as I get there, the ship
casts out.

44
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,499
He has a peculiar way of looking
into my eyes. - Oh?

45
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,499
- I feel he's always watching me.
- And that he is in love with you.

46
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,950
And if you fall for him, I
shall kill you both.

47
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,499
- He is very sensitive.
- Like you?

48
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,800
Yes like me.

49
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,950
Schneider's case is very
interesting.

50
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,499
He could be cured by hypnotism.

51
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,295
I may even finish my book, by
analyzing his case.

52
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,950
Major please. I can't take
anymore.

53
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm afraid I'm losing my mind.

54
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,800
The monarchy is finished!

55
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,100
- Is that what you think?
- Can't you see everything falling apart?

56
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,800
Quite a few other people think
that, Schneider.

57
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,899
Believe me, I also have my fears.

58
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,223
Images appear to me.

59
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,998
As a child, my father was a
doctor in a small town.

60
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,875
One day, the people were
aroused by someone.

61
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,725
They set the synagogue on fire.

62
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,950
They terrorized the Jews into
the river.

63
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,499
Somehow a child escaped.

64
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,499
He climbed up on a tree.

65
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,100
They set fire to the tree and
waited until the boy fell.

66
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,800
This image often appears to me.

67
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,499
And other too, about people
and events.

68
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,499
Sometimes I can see myself
on that tree.

69
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,499
Or in the water.

70
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,950
For you, it's a burning pharmacy.

71
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,650
Please lay down over there.

72
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,800
Come.

73
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,800
Whose pharmacy?

74
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,499
The Toth family. They lived
across the street.

75
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,499
- Why did the pharmacy burn down?
- I don't know, I was six.

76
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,499
Just before the fire, I ran
across to them.

77
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,800
and brought their little girl
to our house.

78
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,650
Do you remember this?

79
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,800
May I ask you a question?

80
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,950
Have you ever had the feeling
that you can see the future?

81
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,800
I am no clairvoyant,

82
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,800
but sometimes I also have
premonitions.

83
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,800
Doctor...

84
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,800
Can you cure me?

85
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,499
Relax.

86
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,950
That's it, there.

87
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,800
Lie down.

88
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,499
Slacken your arms and shoulders.

89
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,499
That's it, yes.

90
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,800
One has to train one's will power.

91
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,950
One's will power is one's most
important weapon.

92
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
Especially when one is a second
class citizen.

93
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,800
What do you mean by that?

94
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,800
An artist, for example.

95
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,800
Try to breath very calmly now.

96
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Very calmly.

97
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,800
Don't be afraid of falling
asleep.

98
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,800
You are very exhausted.

99
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,650
You want to sleep.

100
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,650
Sleep.

101
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,650
Have a good rest.

102
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,650
Doctor, you are wanted.

103
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,499
I am  Captain Trantow-Waldbach.

104
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,499
Captain Tibor Nowotny.

105
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,499
Major, we have orders concerning
your territory.

106
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,499
His Majesty is going to inspect
this section of the front

107
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,499
and will probably visit the
hospital.

108
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,100
The Emperor will probably
doctorate some of the wounded

109
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,499
and the ladies in attendance,
will give out presents.

110
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,100
We have to establish a hero's
cemetery, inaugurated by the Emperor.

111
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,499
I need a few men for the job.
Fresh air is good for convalescents.

112
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,499
Why a cemetery, here?

113
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,499
Battle victims here are buried
in common graves.

114
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,499
We will exhume them and bury
them in the hero's cemetery.

115
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,499
Left turn.

116
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,499
Right turn.

117
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,800
About turn.

118
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,499
About turn.

119
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,499
Oh God, all these cripples.

120
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,499
Most are in such bad shape,

121
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,950
they won't be able to stand
attention for ten minutes.

122
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,499
It's not their fault.

123
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,800
They lost an arm or a leg for
the monarchy.

124
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,950
- They are symbols of loyalty.
- But there are too many. Remove some.

125
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,100
You two, go back to your ward.
You too, and you.

126
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,499
And you.

127
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,950
- I am good enough to perish, eh?
- But you can't look in the Emperor's eyes

128
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,499
Stop arguing and go back to
your bed.

129
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,499
Do you want to fall on your face
in front of the Emperor?

130
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,499
- I shall not fall.
- Go back to bed.

131
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,800
- I want him to see what I've become.
- Shut up.

132
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,800
Follow your orders.

133
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,499
I have given enough for the
monarchy.

134
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,499
I have the right to say what
I will.

135
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,328
Hurrah

136
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,328
Hurrah

137
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,650
Don't be afraid.

138
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,950
It won't last much longer.
I promise!

139
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,499
The closer the better.

140
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,800
We put an end to it together!

141
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,650
Don't!

142
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,650
No!

143
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,650
He's crazy!

144
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,800
A second to end it all!

145
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,650
Stop!

146
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,650
Wait for me!

147
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,800
Not so quick!

148
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,650
Let me come to you.

149
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,650
You are right.

150
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,260
This world is not ours any longer.

151
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,800
It's full of wickedness.

152
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,650
Sordidness.

153
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,800
Betrayal, fear.

154
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,650
Pompousness.

155
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,499
This world is sentenced to death,

156
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,950
but it goes on killing and
destroying, trying to save itself.

157
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,650
You are a victim.

158
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,650
And so am I.

159
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,800
Do you understand?

160
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,800
It's difficult to do what you've
undertaken to do.

161
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,650
Think about it.

162
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,800
Think about every detail.

163
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,650
Take a deep breath.

164
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,444
As I do. Look slowly.

165
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,254
Let's think it over together.

166
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,110
Let's do it together.

167
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,650
Inhale.

168
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,800
Exhale.

169
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,650
Inhale.

170
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,650
Exhale.

171
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,800
Inhale.

172
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,650
Exhale.

173
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,650
Inhale.

174
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,650
Exhale.

175
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,650
Relax.

176
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,650
Head.

177
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,650
Shoulders.

178
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,800
Arms.

179
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,650
Hands.

180
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,650
Fingers.

181
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,800
Give me your hand.

182
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,650
Give me your hand.

183
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,800
Give me your hand.

184
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,650
You are exhausted.

185
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,283
Can you feel it?

186
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,650
Yes!

187
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,800
Don't be afraid of being tired.

188
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,650
Give into it...

189
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,650
There is no...

190
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,650
resistance left in you.

191
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,650
Lie down.

192
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,650
Have a good rest.

193
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,650
Sleep.

194
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,650
Sleep.

195
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,650
Sleep.

196
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,650
Sleep.

197
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,499
I couldn't have done what
you did.

198
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,499
This ability of yours. Must be
used for curing people.

199
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,800
This is a very special talent.

200
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,899
You could save a lot of lives.
You will come to my clinic?

201
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,740
Do you still have a headache?

202
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,890
I'll send you for a medical
examination. Betty will go with you.

203
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,650
What I did...

204
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,455
with that Hungarian,

205
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,499
- Is that will-transference?
- Yes.

206
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,800
Could I learn more about it?

207
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:18,025
The chief physician can't see
you before tomorrow.

208
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,718
We'll find you a room in the
hotel.

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,845
We have no free beds.

210
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,650
How do you feel?

211
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,725
Is everything alright?

212
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,208
Yes.

213
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,374
I'd like to see your bandage.

214
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,650
Sit down, Major.

215
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,950
- Will you please sit down.
- Oh, yes?

216
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,800
I knew this would happen on
this trip.

217
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:27,998
- One has premonitions, you know.
- I'm afraid of what will happen.

218
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,208
What were you afraid of?

219
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,770
If you loved me too much and
asked.

220
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,868
- I can't ask?
- I must be careful.

221
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,980
Personal contact with soldiers
is forbidden.

222
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,725
- I was afraid of you, too.
- Why?

223
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:44,998
Because of Dr. Bettelheim, we
have become friends.

224
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:47,875
- I know, he told me.
- What if he finds out?

225
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,725
But he mustn't find out.

226
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,224
EMPEROR
FRANCISCO JOSE

227
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,163
ARCHDUKE
FRANCISCO FERNANDO

228
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,950
- What's so funny?
- I am in good spirits, sir.

229
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,725
- Why, may I ask?
- Because of the crosses.

230
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,950
- Do you find them so funny?
- Yes.

231
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,725
Haven't you read?

232
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,208
What?

233
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,800
Damn it!

234
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,877
Where is the idiot who did this!

235
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,800
I'll be court marshalled for this.

236
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,199
Sargent Kovacs!

237
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,695
Why can't you take care of this?

238
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,725
Do you all take me for an idiot?

239
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,875
You said they can write whatever
they can think of.

240
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,950
I'll shoot you. Then we'll have
at least one cadaver here.

241
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,950
I want proper names: Wajda, Menczel, Jancso.

242
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,725
- Do you understand?
- Yes, captain.

243
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,998
Major, I know these people.

244
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,875
The names you've mentioned, they
are magicians, illusionists

245
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,725
- How do you know?
- I used to work variety shows.

246
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,800
Another proof of my theory:

247
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,875
An artist always has his eyes
open.

248
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:06,998
Imagine his Majesty saluting me
in front of his own grave.

249
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,875
The Hungarians did it, I bet.

250
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:14,025
Traveling circuses and variety
shows. I know them as well.

251
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,800
Cabaret Nowotny, Prague, Brno.

252
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:22,025
I am planning to stage a variety
show. Participate?

253
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,800
I wouldn't mind a roll with her.

254
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,650
Come here to me!

255
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,800
We shall listen to the lady once
more tonight!

256
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,998
Let's welcome now a friend of
yours,

257
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:15,025
someone you have all known for
some time as a clairvoyant.

258
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,499
It is Schneider!

259
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,800
Schneider!

260
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,100
Comrades, hide an object
somewhere in the hall.

261
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,950
And the Sargent will find it
with the help of a medium.

262
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,224
Yes, that's it. Over there.

263
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,950
Now our clairvoyant will choose
a medium.

264
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,149
He goes down to you. And the
1st man he touches

265
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,853
Will take you to the hidden
object.

266
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,800
Give me your hand...

267
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,890
and think hard of the object.

268
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,725
Why are you so uncertain?

269
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,800
Concentrate on the object.

270
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,224
I want to see it in front of me.

271
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,499
It's form.

272
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,650
It's bulk.

273
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,650
It's weight.

274
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,110
What are you afraid of?

275
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,800
The object won't explode,
will it?

276
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,110
Lead me to the object.

277
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,650
Go on.

278
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,800
Stop.

279
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,650
Stop.

280
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,049
Come back.

281
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,499
The war is over!
They signed an armistice.

282
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,950
Charles the IV, Emperor of Austria
and the King of Hungry

283
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,650
have issued orders to every unit.

284
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,250
Negotiations of the enemy powers
have ended today, satisfactory.

285
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,950
Military actions of every unit
should cease immediately.

286
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,725
Along with the divisions.

287
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,800
UNIVERSITIY OF MEDICINE

288
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,725
Sargent Schneider!

289
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,899
Major, at your service.

290
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,223
Good morning, Klaus.

291
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,995
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

292
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,868
- Have you found a place to stay?
- No I've just arrived.

293
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:09,875
I've brought Betty here with me.

294
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,898
Please send Sister Betty to me.

295
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,950
- The three of us, together again.
- Yes, Major.

296
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:18,875
You mustn't call me Major again.

297
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,950
Those times are over Thank God.
There is a revolution, here.

298
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,650
I've seen a demonstration.

299
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,950
Most important thing is we can
work in peace at the clinic.

300
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:31,875
We've created a ward for the
suicidals.

301
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,725
You will be able to work
wonders here.

302
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,725
Just believe in yourself.

303
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,650
Do you have any complaints?

304
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,800
I've even forgotten I was wounded.

305
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,950
- Proof of our successful methods.
- I'm very grateful to you doc.

306
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,650
Don't be:

307
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,875
God thought "This man knows
something."

308
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,224
"Let me see what he can do with
it."

309
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,650
Sargent!

310
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,800
Civil clothes suit you.

311
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,260
You are prettier than ever, Sister.

312
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,950
I thought we agreed you'd
call me Betty.

313
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,800
- Where ?
- At the front.

314
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,998
You talk like so many
Cassandras, gentlemen.

315
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:22,998
I've never had more respect for
Jeremiah, then the last year of the war.

316
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:27,998
But this is your world now,
the way you wanted it. Your wish.

317
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,875
The problem is that people who
aspire to power

318
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,725
don't inspire trust.

319
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:35,070
They don't want our trust,
Professor.

320
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,853
They want the following of the
masses.

321
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,149
I'm sure they'll eventually
convert them.

322
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,703
Then they might become our enemies.

323
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:45,845
Just like the Monarchy used to
be our enemy.

324
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,725
Yes, you can count on that
gentlemen.

325
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,800
Why do you say that?

326
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,100
Suddenly I saw of picture of
you standing there

327
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,650
and you are the enemy.

328
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,800
- And you?
- I?

329
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,198
Yes, maybe I am also with you.

330
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,845
- Standing where?
- Against the wall maybe?

331
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,950
- Waiting to be executed?
- No.

332
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,668
I don't really know.

333
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,358
Actually, the Riverside promenade
or Danube bank.

334
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,055
Middle class intellectuals wearing
dark suits, overcoats and hats.

335
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,800
And they are the enemy.

336
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,800
An interesting vision.

337
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,875
And where shall I be?

338
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,650
You won't be there.

339
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,800
You'll live in America by then.

340
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,650
In America?

341
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,650
How do you know?

342
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,100
You have thought of emigrating
there several times tonight.

343
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,650
Am I correct?

344
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,950
Is he right?

345
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,725
Well? Tell us the truth.

346
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,950
Yes it crossed my mind.

347
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,800
- But how did you know?
- I looked at you.

348
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,725
And that was what you were
thinking about.

349
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:17,025
Then you must know what I was
thinking about.

350
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,950
Sorry, I wasn't looking at you
Professor.

351
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,875
And what do I think of now?

352
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,998
About the future and you're
anxious.

353
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:30,725
You think about Therese and
Edith.

354
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,208
You are afraid for them.

355
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,650
Tell me, please...

356
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,800
Shall I ever be a mother?

357
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,100
Let's go to the drawing room
for coffee and cigars.

358
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,800
After you.

359
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,380
Please.

360
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,650
Please.

361
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,950
Do you feel the forces of
love,

362
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,725
flowing through your hands?

363
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,800
Do you feel it?

364
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,650
Do you feel it?

365
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,800
- This is Mr. Klaus Schneider.
- How do you do?

366
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,950
Would you care to say
something to him?

367
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,800
No, I don't want to say anything
to you.

368
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,950
Never let anyone see your hands.

369
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,875
Your palm is naked.

370
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,725
One can see everything in it.

371
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,995
Go away from here.

372
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,100
Go away and do what you want
to do, so you can shine.

373
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,224
- Where is your suitcase?
- Klaus.

374
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,800
I thought it over last night.

375
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:35,875
- I can't leave him.
- What do you want?

376
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,110
He is married.

377
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,110
I'll wait.

378
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,800
Don't go, stay with us.

379
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,800
Take care of yourself.

380
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,260
Train is about to leave for
Gyor, Vienna!

381
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,110
I don't want to hurt your
feelings,

382
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,800
but I've been thinking about your
name:

383
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,725
Klaus Schneider.

384
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,950
- No ring to it.
- It's my name.

385
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,650
It's too bourgeois.

386
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:21,875
You need a well-sounding name
in the future.

387
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,725
Nero? Wolfgang Amadeus?

388
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,110
I am serious.

389
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,800
You need a special name.

390
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,299
A name people hear once and
never forget.

391
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,980
- A unique name.
- A stage name?

392
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,650
- Baldini?
- No.

393
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:42,499
- Rastelli?
- It should be original, not phony.

394
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,490
A European name sounds more
genuine.

395
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:47,725
Yet sometimes there is something
different about it.

396
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,650
Something magic!

397
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,998
The gentlemen represent the New
Free Press and the Kronenzeitung.

398
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:01,998
Capitan Nowotny is Mr Hanussen's
representative.

399
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,725
Sit down, please.

400
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:06,530
Mr. Hanussen is resting.

401
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,208
He may join us later.

402
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,875
His appearances demand such
extended periods of rest.

403
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,950
His name makes it difficult
to tell where he's from.

404
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:18,875
He is from the north and his
father's roots are also there.

405
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,800
His mother is from the south.

406
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,725
His mother tongue is German,

407
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,998
but he also speaks, Czech,
Hungarian, Italian, French, English.

408
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,725
I asked him, "How did you learn
so many"?

409
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:33,998
He said: "I have a passion. I
want to understand people."

410
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,725
The most important thing

411
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:39,998
is he can understand the
message of the future.

412
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:43,998
- Where was Mr. Hanussen born?
- A small village in Styria.

413
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:47,998
- Can you also see the future?
- No, but I believe in him.

414
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,725
How did you find out about his
talent?

415
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,950
Tell you a secret, don't
publish this.

416
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:56,725
We severed together at the front

417
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:00,998
when he foretold exactly the
outcome of the war.

418
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:02,725
Fantastic absolutely!

419
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,650
Ladies and Gentlemen.

420
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,800
The gentlemen I'm about to ask

421
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,950
is a gift that is beyond
comprehension.

422
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,725
He is is capable of knowing,

423
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,875
our thoughts and wishes.

424
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,358
Hears the sounds of our spirit.

425
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,755
He can penetrate our will by
the gift of the mind.

426
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,099
He makes us do what he wants
us to do.

427
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,998
Directed by forces with hypnotic
power,

428
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,998
the transfer of thought and
the will.

429
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:53,725
He that knows what lies ahead.

430
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:55,725
Erik Jan Hanussen!

431
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,950
Write your questions on the
cards.

432
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:09,998
And make sure to seal them in
the envelopes.

433
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:14,025
I will guess who has asked the
question.

434
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,650
A young lady.

435
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,650
Yes.

436
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,800
A young lady.

437
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,950
Members of my family left for
America last week.

438
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,875
Will they become millionaires?

439
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:56,725
Should I follow them?

440
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:58,725
Is that the question...

441
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,800
that you want me to answer?

442
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,650
Yes.

443
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,800
The ship...

444
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,110
The ship...

445
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,800
What about the ship?

446
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,800
I can't see it anymore.

447
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,800
The ship will sink?

448
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,800
You are not going to America.

449
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,950
- What is it?
- Look at the papers.

450
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,800
Death in the Waves.

451
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:09,725
Ship disaster. Hundreds dead.

452
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,725
You knew it last night.

453
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,650
I saw it.

454
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,800
I saw it!

455
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,374
To see what this woman says,
in response.

456
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,650
Mr. Hanussen?

457
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,650
Yes.

458
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,875
It's a pleasure to congratulate
you in person.

459
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:57,725
I saw your performance last night

460
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,950
and must say I was very impressed.

461
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,950
When I heard this morning about
the ship...Incredible.

462
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,110
I admire you.

463
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,950
If we politicians could see the
future,

464
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,725
many tragedies could be avoided
in this world.

465
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,100
If you come to Berlin, you
must come and see me.

466
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,650
Here's my card.

467
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,224
- Dr. Rattinger.
- How do you do.

468
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,800
My pleasure.

469
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,650
Gentlemen.

470
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,998
- Sorry for being late.
- No, I came to early.

471
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:44,875
Is it convenient if we stay here?

472
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:45,575
Yes.

473
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,650
Great.

474
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,650
Well?

475
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,950
Do you have any doubts or
concerns over your predictions?

476
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,070
Yes, but I burden the public
with my doubts,

477
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,998
my fears, my mistakes,
my difficulties, my complexes

478
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:07,875
my pessimism, these are all
parts of my gift.

479
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,950
Did you know you'd have an effect
on the public, beforehand?

480
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:16,025
If I say yes, you'll call me
conceited.

481
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,800
- Are you interested in politics?
- No.

482
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,800
No I'm not interested in politics.

483
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:25,998
I don't belong to any party,
nor will I ever.

484
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:27,725
I am interested in life itself,

485
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,725
the secret of life.

486
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,374
Who are your friends, those
you are fond of.

487
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,650
Bettelheim, Emil.

488
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,800
Doctor, professor.

489
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:39,575
And?

490
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,650
Nowotny Tibor.

491
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,800
Captain.

492
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,650
All of them, men?

493
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,650
What about women?

494
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,800
What sort of medium would I be?

495
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,950
Martha, not a suitable name
for a medium.

496
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,800
- Another name then?
- Wally.

497
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,950
Erik Jan Hanussen...

498
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:19,725
and Wally, right?

499
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,950
What do you really want from me?

500
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:28,025
Now you can do with me, what
you will.

501
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,650
Get up.

502
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,800
Get up.

503
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,650
Open the window.

504
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,224
Stand on the sill.

505
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,800
And now, jump.

506
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,800
Why don't you jump?

507
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,610
I'm not crazy.

508
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,950
See, I'm not really a hypnotist.
You'd have jumped.

509
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,800
You don't really want me to
jump do you?

510
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,650
I do.

511
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,224
You'd be arrested and sentenced
for it.

512
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,998
"Lady lady throws herself to
death for Erik Jan Hanussen,

513
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:28,175
the man with the telepathic gift,
she jumps off the 5th floor."

514
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,950
I can read it in the newspapers.

515
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,725
What a story for the papers!

516
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,650
Jump.

517
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,650
Yes?

518
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,725
I have the newspapers.

519
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,650
They all talk about you.

520
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,950
This is Martha, a journalist.
You know each other of course.

521
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,800
- Wally.
- Wally?

522
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,950
You have to be the best if you
want to remain here.

523
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:04,220
With your present fans, however,
you could do anything in Karlsbad.

524
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,800
You would be a star amongst them.

525
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,725
Fire eaters, sword swallowers.

526
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:11,875
And you, the master. Telepathy
and clairvoyance!

527
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,800
I tell you the future.

528
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,800
I tell you the future.

529
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,725
Don't live in insecurity.

530
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,950
I can see the future, don't
live in insecurity.

531
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,800
Go on, he won't mind.

532
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,950
Excuse me, could I have your
autograph?

533
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,110
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

534
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,950
- I must speak with you privately.
- Sit down, Rudi.

535
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,725
- Please, somewhere else
- Sit down.

536
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,800
Well?

537
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:28,998
The police are upset over the
newspaper articles.

538
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:30,725
The police? Who exactly?

539
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:33,875
Everybody. They are calling you
a charlatan.

540
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,800
I didn't break into a bank.

541
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:39,875
I think it would be wise, if
you got out of Karlsbad.

542
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:41,725
Before they find and arrest you.

543
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,800
You better be careful.

544
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:46,725
Please, go away!
You smell badly!

545
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,950
If they charge charlatanism,
you should take it seriously.

546
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,650
Go away, where?

547
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,950
Berlin would be the best place
for you.

548
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:14,725
Berlin?

549
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,110
No.

550
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,800
- Eric Jan Hanussen?
- Yes.

551
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:28,610
I am arresting you

552
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:31,875
under the law of Czech Republic.

553
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:33,438
This is the warrant for your
arrest.

554
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,950
You received another name at
birth. What is it?

555
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:40,875
Klaus Schneider.

556
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,800
And your name changed overnight?

557
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,800
Isn't that fraudulent?

558
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,800
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

559
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:56,250
Who gave you this unique name?
The ex-Emperor?

560
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,650
I chose it myself.

561
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,800
Like so many well known historic
personalities,

562
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:03,875
I had a feeling this name could

563
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,950
expresses me and my aims better.

564
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:09,725
Does it express your objectives?

565
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:11,725
I think it hides your true self!

566
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,950
Prosecutor, please refrain from
your comments.

567
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:16,575
Yes, your honor.

568
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,198
You have visited all the spas

569
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,845
throughout the German-Czech
border?

570
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,800
I'm interested in people,

571
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:26,725
who turn to me with their
questions.

572
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,950
- What is your citizenship?
- Austrian.

573
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,800
Do you love your country?

574
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,650
Yes.

575
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:40,998
Then why don't you appear on
stage at home?

576
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:43,875
The people have no questions
for you there?

577
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:45,725
They do not want to know the
future?

578
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:48,875
Don't want to have problems?

579
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,875
- Where do you really belong?
- To middle Europe.

580
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,950
Where we have been sharing the
same destiny for a long time.

581
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,950
May I know the charges against
me?

582
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:06,998
Charlatanism and deceiving people
of good faith.

583
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:09,299
We'll see what else comes to
light.

584
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,650
what's your occupation?

585
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,650
I'm a clairvoyant.

586
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,950
- You can read other's thought?
- Yes.

587
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:18,725
And can control them?

588
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,725
To a certain extent.

589
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,725
- And tell them their future?
- Yes.

590
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:27,025
- And my own future?
- You'll lose this case.

591
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,998
May I remind you are the accused,
and in court.

592
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:34,149
Refrain from jokes.

593
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:36,269
The prosecutor called me a
charlatan,

594
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,950
because I maintain I know people's
longings and fears.

595
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,998
I do because I am one of them,
since I live in Middle Europe,

596
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:48,998
what use to be the Austro-Hungarain
Monarchy, I live in one of the

597
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:51,875
countries destroyed by war, where
we have no security of ourselves,

598
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:56,025
because we are afflicted by
inflation.

599
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,998
I do know the fears and longings
of those present as well.

600
00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:05,025
I can feel the unsolvable and
suppressed problems of the soul

601
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,110
flowing towards me.

602
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,950
These issues bring people to
the churches and fortune-tellers.

603
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:14,998
I just express what they didn't dare
express.

604
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:18,998
In order to have a vision of
the unknown, the future...

605
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:21,875
The Future of war widows and
orphans,

606
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:24,875
the abused and abandoned of this
mad world of ours.

607
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:27,875
Is this what we are all longing
for? No.

608
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,998
In everyone's eyes, the same
question: What will happen to us?

609
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:36,025
I now ask this question, and
on their behalf. Stand up.

610
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,800
Stand up with me? Very
talented.

611
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,650
The masses...

612
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,224
"You are talented."

613
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,800
The masses behave like
frustrated women.

614
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:58,025
Take me, lay me, rape me.

615
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,110
If you are acquitted,

616
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,868
I'll go to a church with you
so you can render thanks.

617
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,800
- Who shall I thank?
- Doesn't matter.

618
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,110
Just express your gratitude.

619
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,650
What are your plans?

620
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,950
First, rest and then we are off
to Berlin.

621
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:21,725
Do you have faith and optimism
in the future?

622
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,110
I live.

623
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,110
Sorry.

624
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,110
It's alright.

625
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,800
I'm Valery of the Sea.

626
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,950
So familiar to me. Do we know
each other?

627
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,800
Vali Toth from Eisenstadt!

628
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,800
Klaus Schneider.

629
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,650
Vali!

630
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,800
Do you still remember the smoke?

631
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:31,575
What?

632
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,800
Yes of course. When our
pharmacy burned down.

633
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:36,725
Vali Toth of Eisenstadt!

634
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,950
- Really so happy to see me again?
- I could dance.

635
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,998
I see 100.000 marks in the canal,
a beggar has thrown them away.

636
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:53,998
A paper that costs 100.000
costs 500.000 in the afternoon.

637
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:56,875
Those who have saved all their
lives become beggars.

638
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,950
Those who understand bribery, swindle
and cheat to move up in the world.

639
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:05,998
I see many jobless men in front
of smart restaurants.

640
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:11,049
Faint with hunger, they stare
through the windows.

641
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,998
And those sitting inside,
couldn't care less.

642
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:18,449
Not that shop windows are empty
No they are full!

643
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,800
Disparities are growing day
by day.

644
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,845
Corruption sweeps aside common
interests.

645
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,860
In place there is a void.

646
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,868
and people are gathering in
this void.

647
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,049
Those that are sick and have
no chances.

648
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,998
They need bread, work, security
and order.

649
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:37,725
What they have is hate.

650
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,800
Hate towards this Republic.

651
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:42,725
I see the hatred in their eyes.

652
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:46,998
This hatred might be misused
by a demagogue.

653
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:48,725
These are dreadful times.

654
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:53,599
Times of waiting and the time
of maneuvering for position.

655
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,231
It's like rope-walking over
the abyss.

656
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,049
Bravo.

657
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,718
Gentlemen,

658
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:11,380
after this vision,

659
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:13,895
Do you have any questions?

660
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:16,875
Unlike previous generations,
the youth of today

661
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:19,875
would never agree to be forced
to do something.

662
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:24,025
- What about weapons?
- They're free and wouldn't take up arms.

663
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,950
- Thank you
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

664
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:32,998
I have a personal question.

665
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:34,725
My name is Baron Stadler.

666
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:38,998
could you please tell me what the
price of cotton will be tomorrow?

667
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:41,875
- Sorry, I have no idea.
- You must be joking.

668
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:45,998
- I really don't know.
- The price is now 93.

669
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:49,998
- Just say a number.
- Can it be a house number?

670
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:54,025
Feuerwehr Strasse #25. It was
my grandmother's address.

671
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,100
- 25... that's impossible.
- I know where she used to live.

672
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,650
Thanks, sir.

673
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,650
Thank you very much.

674
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,224
Your welcome.

675
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,100
- Some coffee and warm milk, please.
- In a minute.

676
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,800
Unexpected plunge. Cotton
prices down to 25.

677
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,950
Price of cotton falls to 25.

678
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,725
Your coffee, sir.

679
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:42,875
- Has something happened, sir?
- No.

680
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,650
Here you are.

681
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,650
Would you like a lottery
ticket?

682
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:53,380
No, thanks.

683
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,800
Lottery ticket, perhaps?

684
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,800
Give me ten.

685
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,650
Here you are.

686
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:11,875
Thank you.

687
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,110
Lottery ticket?

688
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,110
Lottery ticket?

689
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,110
Mr. Hanussen.

690
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,800
I'm Fabian, a journalist for
several evening papers

691
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,100
Yesterday you said the price of
cotton would fall to 25.

692
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,239
How did you know?

693
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,690
- I have great contacts.
- In the coat room?

694
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,803
Even there. Is it true?

695
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,495
Yes.

696
00:55:46,496 --> 00:55:47,239
And?

697
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,690
- The price did fall to 25.
- Yes, I said it would.

698
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:52,239
How did you know?

699
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,239
Did no one tell you I can see
into the future?

700
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,939
- Can we talk about it?
- I'm sorry, not right now.

701
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,735
- Maybe tomorrow at 3 at the cafe.
- No. right now, please.

702
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:04,063
Tomorrow you won't still be
interested?

703
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,889
I'm not sure.

704
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:10,893
You might give an interview
before then and I won't be.

705
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,964
Ten minutes, all right.

706
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,540
- Shall we sit down?
- Yes, alright.

707
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,540
So you are a prophet?

708
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,390
I won't say that.

709
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:26,465
I have certain premonitions.

710
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,690
I can glimpse into the human soul,
I know little telepathy.

711
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:33,615
And I always know what the
person I'm talking to thinks.

712
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,840
- What am I thinking about now?
- That you'd like to smoke a cigar.

713
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,390
Have you had any training?

714
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,620
I was born this way.

715
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,738
Why speak at the bourgeois democrats
club? Are you a member of the party?

716
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,615
I don't belong to any party, nor
have any interest in politics.

717
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:56,765
I tell the truth to all I see,
even if it's unpleasant.

718
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,540
What you said at the club, suits
their policy.

719
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,540
Why did you come to Berlin?

720
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,690
- To conquerer it!
- Only the best succeed at that.

721
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,038
If you're not well known, you're
nobody in Berlin.

722
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:15,720
Think of your countrymen, Adolf
Hitler. No one knew him.

723
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,540
He is leading a revolution in
Munich,

724
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:21,615
although he didn't know it would
led to failure.

725
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:24,615
Yet he tried it and the case
became a sensation.

726
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,540
Give me your address and
telephone number.

727
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,390
If you're article is good,

728
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,690
I'll let you know in advance.
Agree?

729
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,390
I agree.

730
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,540
Well, are you having a good time?

731
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,738
- Berlin is a good idea.
- I knew it was the place for you.

732
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:40,615
- Your favorite has made a good start.
- Yes, thank God.

733
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:42,465
And thanks to the circumstances.

734
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:46,738
- Is that what you think?
- Don't misunderstand me. You have
a special gift.

735
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:49,615
Someone would have been
necessary yesterday.

736
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:52,615
And who knows what people will
need tomorrow.

737
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:54,465
Embrace the opportunity.

738
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:59,239
Your secret is that you awaken fear.
And that is what is needed now.

739
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,690
No one should fear me. It's
enough I fear myself.

740
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,465
Don't be so conceited.

741
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:07,269
The Gods don't like it, not
even yours.

742
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,735
Thank you.

743
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,390
Thank you.

744
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,540
- What did you think?
- You were fantastic.

745
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,390
And you?

746
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:21,615
You have bewitched me again,
like before.

747
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:24,615
- But we should talk about our childhood.
- Good idea.

748
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,690
- We were friends growing up.
- Have you meet?

749
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,390
Tibor Nowotny.

750
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,390
Valery.

751
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,143
Wally.

752
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,495
- "Wally"?
- Yes.

753
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,540
Valery, you are enchanting.

754
00:59:41,739 --> 00:59:43,465
Pardon my interruption,

755
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:46,615
but this young man has turn into
a rival.

756
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,690
He's been raving about Valery
all night.

757
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,690
- Do I know you?
- We met at the Italian front.

758
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:56,465
At your service, Capitan Nowotny.

759
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:59,615
Is the whole Piave army
posted here?

760
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,690
- You all know each other?
- Middle Europe is a village.

761
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,465
What are you doing in Berlin?

762
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,615
Haven't you heard of EJ
Hanussen?

763
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:10,465
You're him?

764
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,690
Would you like to work for the
police?

765
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,690
You could foresee murders or
bank robberies.

766
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:22,615
We go there, arrest criminals
and lock them up.

767
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,840
- No, I'm not interested.
- You can read people's thoughts?

768
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,390
If I want to.

769
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,690
What sort of miracles can we
expect from you in the future?

770
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,465
Charleston.

771
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:46,465
Who's going to dance with me?

772
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:47,948
You, Klaus?

773
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,720
Yes.

774
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,630
I might be wrong, but did you
cry for help a while ago?

775
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,540
What do you mean?

776
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,540
I can't explain it here, it is
a private matter.

777
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,690
Is it true you saved suicidals
in Budapest?

778
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,540
If that's what they say.

779
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,540
- A dance?
- No, maybe later.

780
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,630
I've been in this business for
40 years.

781
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:20,738
You see our posters all over
Berlin.

782
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:22,983
We'll place a sticker on them
reading: "Hanussen".

783
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,540
If Mr. Hanussen appears in your
theater,

784
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:27,465
you'll have to print new
ones.

785
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,540
His name should be three times
as large and in a different color.

786
01:02:30,739 --> 01:02:34,738
The poster will read:
"Prof. Gdor's 50th anniversary".

787
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:37,615
- And I'll slip across, "Hanussen".
- Erik Jan.

788
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:40,615
Do you know much artist like
you have cost me?

789
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,000
These types appear everywhere
now, creating disorder.

790
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,480
When shall we have order again?

791
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:54,465
Changes in the government!

792
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,690
Rattinger, is the new under
secretary of foreign affairs!

793
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:02,738
Unfortunately, those who demand
unlimited power for themselves

794
01:03:02,739 --> 01:03:05,443
in the name of democracy keeps
growing. As well as their influence.

795
01:03:05,739 --> 01:03:07,465
But they abuse democracy

796
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:09,465
in the search of such power.

797
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,540
Since the assassination of
Engelmann,

798
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:18,225
we must realize the same thing
could happen to any one of us.

799
01:03:56,739 --> 01:04:01,339
What did you say? No one would
have attempted this before me.

800
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,390
Ladies and gentlemen,

801
01:04:41,739 --> 01:04:44,039
I'll save any unnecessary words,
just say his name.

802
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,390
Erik...

803
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,239
Jan...

804
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,390
Hanussen!

805
01:04:56,739 --> 01:05:00,738
He will first demonstrate to you
the force of the human spirit.

806
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:02,465
We shall blindfold him. Wally

807
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,738
- What a cheap trick!
- You can examine the item yourself.

808
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:21,765
- Another one of the phoneys
- Get you ticket.

809
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,540
- The artist cannot see
- Sure!

810
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:27,615
Anyone want to come up here?

811
01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:31,738
To make sure the artist is blind.

812
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:33,465
You're the one who makes people
sleep!

813
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,239
- Does that mean that you are tired?
- You heard what I said.

814
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,964
- Why?
- This place makes one feel tired.

815
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,035
Then you must sleep. You can
hardly open your mouth.

816
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,994
I paid for my ticket.

817
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,938
Yes, so you can say what  you
like.

818
01:05:58,939 --> 01:06:02,735
Also, if it's so important,
then why not say it on stage?

819
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,964
Come up here.

820
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,480
Wally, grab a chair for our
guest, please.

821
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:18,615
Think about what you want to
say to the audience.

822
01:06:18,739 --> 01:06:21,615
You must concentrate. We don't
want you stammering.

823
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:23,465
- All I want to say...
- Hold on...

824
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,540
You're tired, aren't you?

825
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,964
Sit down please.

826
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,467
He would like to say something
to us.

827
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:45,465
Something important.

828
01:06:45,739 --> 01:06:47,465
But he is tired.

829
01:06:47,739 --> 01:06:50,615
Maybe after a rest, he will
say it.

830
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:53,615
Have a rest, nobody will
bother you.

831
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:55,465
Rest.

832
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:57,465
No one will disturb you.

833
01:06:57,739 --> 01:06:59,465
Rest.

834
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,840
Your arms feel heavy.
Let them fall.

835
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,850
Sleep.

836
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,850
Sleep, now.

837
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,850
You are falling asleep.

838
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,480
You are fast asleep.

839
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,850
You sleep.

840
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,850
You are fast asleep...

841
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,850
ya.

842
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,540
He is content now.

843
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,963
Is he asleep?

844
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,738
He will wake up when he is
rested tomorrow morning.

845
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:02,765
But he can't wake up, until
a cock crows three times.

846
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,690
But, where shall we find a cock
now?

847
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,480
He, himself will be the cock.

848
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,540
When this watch chimes,

849
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,690
you will climb on the chair
and crow three times.

850
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:20,465
This will wake you up.

851
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:25,840
After this refreshing sleep

852
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,540
you'll tell us who paid you to
disturb our show.

853
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,904
You may stand.

854
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,964
Thank you!

855
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,540
And now tell our audience.

856
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,465
Why did you interrupt the show?

857
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,540
I just carried out orders.

858
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,690
Get your cronies and leave
the theater.

859
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,949
Tell the person who gave you
the orders,

860
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,578
that Erik Jan Hanussen would
like to meet him.

861
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,690
So many fortune-tellers.
What do you think of them?

862
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,540
Most are charlatans.

863
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:11,385
There's always been and always
will be people like that.

864
01:10:11,839 --> 01:10:14,600
Especially in times when people
need extra help.

865
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:18,189
And live in difficult times
and can't get help.

866
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,964
How can you predict the future?

867
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,540
As a composer can hear notes,

868
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:28,030
so can I sense forces composed
of thoughts. Wishes. Fears.

869
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,850
They flow towards me.

870
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:35,840
You must know who will be
German's chancellor in January.

871
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,850
Do you know or not?

872
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,690
- I don't wanna play this game.
- Which means you don't know.

873
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:46,738
I've declared several time,
party struggles, no comment.

874
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:50,738
You don't say anything out of
fear you'll be proved wrong.

875
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:52,465
You all know I am never wrong.

876
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,850
- Then tell us!
- I can't.

877
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,690
- I'm a guest in this country.
- Not the only one.

878
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,738
- You have no idea, admit it.
- I won't, because I know.

879
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,615
If you knew you'd have told us
long ago.

880
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:16,615
Adolf Hitler will be chancellor.

881
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,615
Haven't we agreed you wouldn't
get mixed up in politics?

882
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:39,465
How can you support a
scoundrel?

883
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,690
You do realize the consequences
of this?

884
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:46,615
I know what I say and whatever
I say I see.

885
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:50,738
The future belongs to Hitler.
Even you can see it.

886
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:54,765
- Why say it in public?
- The truth can be unpleasant.

887
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,850
But it must be told.

888
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,540
Who organized this press
conference? You did.

889
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,690
Whose idea was to "conquerer
Berlin"?

890
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:06,983
I did not praise or support
Hitler.

891
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,690
No you didn't, just that he
would be chancellor.

892
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:15,738
Realize the people listen to
you, "The clairvoyant said so."

893
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:18,615
Are you a member of the party?
Show me your membership card.

894
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,540
I've never seen a membership
card in my life.

895
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,690
I do not belong to any party,
nor will I ever.

896
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:27,465
I am myself and will remain
myself.

897
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,540
If it doesn't suit you, leave.

898
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:33,615
If your announcement appears in
the papers, I will.

899
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,840
- I'd be a Hitler propogandist.
- What I see isn't always what I want.

900
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,540
But I always tell what I see.

901
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,488
They can take it as a warning.

902
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,540
Who do you think you are?

903
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,540
A biblical prophet or Christ
himself?

904
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:53,465
Do you know who you are?

905
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,943
Just another 2nd class magician
with a few clever tricks.

906
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,690
Thanks to Dr. Bettelheim you
can sell yourself better.

907
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,390
Well.

908
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,850
Let me tell you something.

909
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,540
Germany needs order right now.

910
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,630
More rights and freedoms.

911
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:13,465
Whoever brings this, wins.

912
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,738
- And it's Hitler.
- Why mix with politics?

913
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:20,178
You might be right,

914
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,630
but do you realize the
propaganda you just created?

915
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,630
With him, we know what
will happen.

916
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,480
Are you a prophet?

917
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,465
Of course not.

918
01:13:32,739 --> 01:13:35,615
- Then leave it to me.
- As you wish.

919
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,480
Coming, Wally?

920
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,480
I better say goodbye.

921
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,630
We may meet again in the next
war.

922
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,780
If it breaks out soon, we can
have a variety show at the front.

923
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,850
And you?

924
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,850
Why do you stay?

925
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,540
Since I don't want that to
happen again.

926
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,690
The Prophet Says: Hitler
will be chancellor.

927
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,615
You did right naming Hitler.

928
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:17,465
Frightened those who hesitate.

929
01:14:17,739 --> 01:14:21,738
Now they realize what will happen
if they don't stand up to him.

930
01:14:21,739 --> 01:14:24,615
Hitler has no mass support.

931
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:27,615
His rough, uneducated storm
troopers only scare people away.

932
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,540
Hitler's position can only be
temporary.

933
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:32,063
You really think so?

934
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,234
The infiltration has filled
people with hatred.

935
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,540
It's brought forth humiliation
and stirred up filth.

936
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,540
We both knows what that leads
toward.

937
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:44,615
A hatred of democracy and a
new racism

938
01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:46,465
and the wish for a strong hand.

939
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:48,120
And now?

940
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,985
We are losing, but won't admit
it yet.

941
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,840
Everyone knows the future,
various forces hungry for power.

942
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,840
A variety show manager wants to be
Minister of Culture, demanding censorship.

943
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,390
And we? We die?

944
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,850
Do you have a bodyguard?

945
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,850
No, I haven't.

946
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,690
You'll need one soon. I'll
provide it.

947
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:43,738
Hitler asked me if you belong
to the party.

948
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,615
I said no, since it was against
your principles.

949
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,465
How did you know that?

950
01:15:48,739 --> 01:15:51,615
One sometimes reads what is
put on one's desk.

951
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,630
The head of propaganda of the
party wants to meet you.

952
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,390
I'll lead you to him.

953
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,690
Hitler congratulates you, you
see the future of German, clearly.

954
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,540
Hitler is the future and you
should stake on him.

955
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:07,063
Have children?

956
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,934
- No.
- Why not?

957
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,338
You see the future, why not
have children?

958
01:16:12,339 --> 01:16:14,525
- Make the effort. I have five.
- Congratulations.

959
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:19,915
We need children, the future
of Germany demands this.

960
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,964
May I have a few words?

961
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:28,738
It's good you don't belong to
any party or faction.

962
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:31,615
You can't be accused of being
partial.

963
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:35,738
This is very good for Hitler.

964
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:38,615
In this country social standing
and education are everything.

965
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:42,738
People can't imagine that a
simple soldier can lead as well.

966
01:16:42,739 --> 01:16:45,615
We will put Hitler's mystical
force

967
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:48,615
against the arrogance of the
aristocracy and the upper class.

968
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:51,615
- Where did you meet the count?
- At the Italian front.

969
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:53,465
Was he a good soldier? And you,
elegant?

970
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,850
I was a Sargent.

971
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,735
So was I.

972
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,540
Everything here is on the brink
of collapse.

973
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,840
Predict a new future of Germany,
you won't be sorry.

974
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,690
- Things look hopeless.
- Better for us.

975
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,690
It means our time is getting
closer.

976
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:17,925
I'm sure you know everybody:

977
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:20,578
the penniless, the unemployed,
the soldiers...

978
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:24,738
but really everybody is ready
to swear on any cause,

979
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:27,615
if it means a return to order.

980
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,738
For our people, order to more
important than anything.

981
01:17:32,739 --> 01:17:37,915
They don't know what to do with
their freedoms for the future.

982
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,540
When we take power,

983
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:44,189
we shall organize an institute
for the research of the future.

984
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:50,488
Henni Stahl.

985
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,690
I am a film director and
photographer. Heard of me?

986
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,738
- Yes, I've heard of you.
- Can I offer you some advice?

987
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:03,465
Make sure you are never lit
from above.

988
01:18:03,739 --> 01:18:06,615
- As a magician, you understand.
- Of course.

989
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,840
Would your radiance be effective
on film, I wonder.

990
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,738
Hitler is very forceful, even
if only his voice on the radio.

991
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:20,615
It's not easy, however, to
take a good picture of him.

992
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:25,738
I'd like to find your most
effective faces.

993
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:27,465
Will you call me, Mr. Hanussen?

994
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,480
Who was she?

995
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:35,615
Henni Stahl, wants to take
pictures of me.

996
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,480
He's there!

997
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,850
Autograph for me.

998
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,540
Me too.

999
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,620
Klaus.

1000
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,803
Doctor!

1001
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,690
They say they care for the
wounded of the revolution.

1002
01:19:16,739 --> 01:19:19,615
But I have laid my roots.

1003
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,690
Hugarians are far away from
successful.

1004
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:25,465
My success doesn't exist.

1005
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:27,465
I was not patient.

1006
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:30,615
People avoid me.

1007
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,690
- Could I practice here?
- You should leave here.

1008
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,540
Berlin is now the center of
the word.

1009
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:41,075
They have the best institute
of Psychiatry.

1010
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,690
Betty knows Count
Trantow-Waldbach.

1011
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,178
He might be able to help us.

1012
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:49,465
I brought all my histories
of patients.

1013
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:51,465
- Even me as well?
- Yes.

1014
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,690
Maybe we can buy a small house.

1015
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:59,765
How many people invest here?
In gold, silver, tapestries, art?

1016
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,630
- What is stable?
- Diamonds.

1017
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,850
If you go, goodbye.

1018
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,593
- But if you do not?
- Leave.

1019
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:10,465
- But to where?
- To America.

1020
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,465
To America, me?

1021
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,480
Budapest is my home.

1022
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,690
- They'll be looking for culprits.
- Scapegoats? Nothing new.

1023
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,690
- Someone you can kick out?
- The Jews.

1024
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,390
Or the intellectuals.

1025
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,540
Or artists tempted to sin.

1026
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,690
Writers, journalist, actors,
dancers of easy virtue.

1027
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:34,465
What about nurses?

1028
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,480
The lady...

1029
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:42,178
sings in Hungarian.

1030
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,540
What it would be like, living
in peace.

1031
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,540
"Not afraid of the future."

1032
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,690
Rattinger assassinated!

1033
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,690
Rattinger assassinated!

1034
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,540
Rattinger Secretary of State
assassinated.

1035
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,540
The murderers to jail.
Democracy!

1036
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,850
What is he doing here?

1037
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,738
The morning is the best time
to meet your requirements.

1038
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:07,465
But not the afternoon.

1039
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:10,615
Do not plan at noon.

1040
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:15,738
Watch what he says outside of
his house.

1041
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:20,738
- What can I expect this year?
- The new year will bring success.

1042
01:22:20,739 --> 01:22:22,960
You will rise to great heights.

1043
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,540
Anymore questions?

1044
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,889
No, thank you.

1045
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,443
- Whose turn?
- Mr. Hanussen.

1046
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,540
Why not, very interesting.

1047
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,540
Are you afraid?

1048
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:40,765
- You don't believe horoscopes?
- I don't want to partake.

1049
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,390
No, why not?

1050
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:47,150
- Your date of birth?
- He was born April 20th.

1051
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:04,690
The same birthday as Hitler?

1052
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,540
Your husband is also Austrian?

1053
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,964
Yes.

1054
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,840
You only care for yourself.

1055
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,540
And you have no idea of love.

1056
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,540
True, I haven't.

1057
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,630
That feeling all of you talk
so much about...

1058
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,850
I felt it once for a day.

1059
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,964
I can hardly remember.

1060
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:42,738
But the count knows about love.
Doesn't he?

1061
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:44,063
Yes.

1062
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:47,229
In depth.

1063
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,889
Who can it be?

1064
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:52,040
Relax.

1065
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,360
They'll leave.

1066
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,850
Good morning.

1067
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,690
The nightclub I work was
smashed up last night.

1068
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:10,465
Guest were beaten up.

1069
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,850
I packed my things.

1070
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,540
Will you come with me, Valery?

1071
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:20,090
- Right now? Where?
- Paris.

1072
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,480
What's the hurry?

1073
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,540
No, I haven't had enough
wandering about.

1074
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,840
I know the Count will protect
me.

1075
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,690
You're lucky. It could have
been him waiting all night.

1076
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:36,063
I'm sorry.

1077
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,645
- Why didn't you come up?
- Didn't want to disturb you.

1078
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:42,615
- We know that.
- How long are you staying, here?

1079
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:45,484
As long as possible.

1080
01:24:45,739 --> 01:24:47,983
Let me say goodbye to you as
well.

1081
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,205
Let me look at you for a moment.

1082
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:54,925
For the last time. I'll never
return.

1083
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,540
Women need tenderness, Mr.
Hanussen.

1084
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,540
Much tenderness.

1085
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:15,738
Ladies and gentlemen, pass this
part of the house, you leave Berlin.

1086
01:25:15,739 --> 01:25:17,465
Forget yourselves.

1087
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:19,465
Feel free and open.

1088
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,178
Let yourselves go.

1089
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,540
What will the new year bring?

1090
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,540
There will be great changes.

1091
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:49,638
A bright new star will rise.

1092
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,540
Man is the pawn of fate.

1093
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:01,634
Do we live in chaos and
uncertainty

1094
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,540
We are on the threshold of a
new age.

1095
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:13,482
What brings this new age?

1096
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,904
Order.

1097
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,480
Thank you and now the girls.

1098
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,540
Excuse me, the gentleman has
arrived.

1099
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:04,690
Please sit down, I won't be a
moment.

1100
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,690
Up there on top, stretch your
arm.

1101
01:27:09,739 --> 01:27:11,063
That's it!

1102
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,735
Fine. Thank you.

1103
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,540
And now one more pyramid.

1104
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:24,840
Stretch your arms as if
holding a torch.

1105
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,964
You two on top.

1106
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,964
As if you carried a torch!

1107
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,964
Thank you we have finished.

1108
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:40,840
Can you feel how their bodies
radiate a cosmic natural force?

1109
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,889
I'm fed up with decadence.

1110
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:46,593
This is the new way of
photography.

1111
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:49,620
How to show demonic power
effectively, on stage or screen...

1112
01:27:49,621 --> 01:27:51,135
That's the essence of it.

1113
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:55,746
Please go to the mirror, will
you?

1114
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,858
What is the secret of charisma?

1115
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:36,045
Here, read this. Look at this!

1116
01:28:40,864 --> 01:28:42,588
Henni Stahl.

1117
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,164
There.

1118
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,164
Fantastic, isn't it?

1119
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,740
We shall have them published.

1120
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:13,378
Mr. Fabian, please.

1121
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,439
Come and see me right now.

1122
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,164
Get into a cab.

1123
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,164
Photos, that's all I'll say.

1124
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,089
Right now.

1125
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,240
Alright.

1126
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,089
You are totally crazy!

1127
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:28,793
- I know what I'm doing.
- I'm leaving!

1128
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,089
Bettelheim!

1129
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:32,953
We have to see about your money.

1130
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:34,643
- I don't want your money.
- Please!

1131
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,740
- Please!
- Let me go!

1132
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,164
Doctor...

1133
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,164
I'm fond of you.

1134
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,164
Very fond.

1135
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,740
Shall we have another drink?

1136
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,164
It's so particular.

1137
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,740
That we are still on formal
terms.

1138
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,740
You were my patient. But if
you like.

1139
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,151
Cheers.

1140
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:23,040
You have a greater effect on
people, because of your gift.

1141
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,890
On the other hand, I know what
one can achieve with it.

1142
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,089
I'm not a genius.

1143
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:33,793
Since Freud, there is nothing
left to discover.

1144
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,740
Everything depends on your
approach.

1145
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,590
Your moral approach.

1146
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,740
We should stay together.

1147
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,680
Maybe we...

1148
01:30:46,939 --> 01:30:48,665
can appear together again.

1149
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,740
If we survive this, why not.

1150
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,740
Maybe I could join a circus.

1151
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,740
Fortune telling Rabbi with
miraculous powers.

1152
01:30:57,939 --> 01:31:01,965
I could learn a few tricks and
forget about Hippocrates.

1153
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,104
Do you want to come with me?

1154
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,890
They think you know the future,
but if you say

1155
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:12,239
something disagreeable, they'll
call you a false prophet.

1156
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,740
They will try to destroy you.

1157
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,890
Why don't you believe us?

1158
01:31:18,939 --> 01:31:21,815
We have known for a long time
unspeakable things

1159
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,050
that happen in the natural way.

1160
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,050
And I...

1161
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:28,793
I am sitting with you here in
Berlin.

1162
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,404
Drinking and waiting instead
of fleeing!

1163
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,740
And I sweat with fear.

1164
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,050
We've drunk to much.

1165
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,643
We should sleep a little.

1166
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,680
Don't ever sell yourself.

1167
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,740
It can happen so quickly.

1168
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,890
Rank and title are such
temptations.

1169
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,890
To be a head physician or
university professor...

1170
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,740
But it's not worth it.

1171
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:43,778
A Charlatan wants to conquer
Berlin.

1172
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:45,665
A fraud that wants to resemble
Hitler.

1173
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,740
Call the count, immediately.

1174
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,680
Tell him you want to speak
to him.

1175
01:32:52,939 --> 01:32:56,965
The count, I don't think he is
fond of me, is he?

1176
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,089
That's true.

1177
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:03,403
- Call the chief of propaganda.
- The whole thing originates with them!

1178
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,154
Can't you read it properly?

1179
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,154
Don't upset yourself.

1180
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,740
Shall we disappear somewhere
for the weekend?

1181
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,740
To the Harz Hills or Austria?

1182
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,680
What are you afraid of?

1183
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:23,890
- Time is on your side, yes?
- No.

1184
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,935
Time is not on my side.

1185
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,740
Ladies and gentlemen.

1186
01:33:51,939 --> 01:33:53,665
Erik Jan Hanussen!

1187
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:05,190
I will examine a question
today that interest us all.

1188
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,890
Is it possible to transfer
one's will power over another?

1189
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,740
Can we manipulate someone
else's will?

1190
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,839
A difficult problem. Will
someone come up to help me?

1191
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,530
Maybe you?

1192
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,439
You?

1193
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,590
Or you?

1194
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,680
Yes, you madame.

1195
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,680
Come up on stage, please.

1196
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:25,935
Thank you.

1197
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:27,935
Yes, please come.

1198
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,935
Come up here.

1199
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,890
Thanks for your willingness
to help in the experiment.

1200
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,740
May I ask you a question.

1201
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:42,938
If I asked you now to set fire to
the theater, what would you say?

1202
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:45,815
- I'd laugh at you.
- Thanks.

1203
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,439
Did you like to gaze into the
fire as a child?

1204
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,050
Yes, I did.

1205
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,350
Please look into the flames of
this torch.

1206
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,740
A pretty flame.

1207
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,050
Isn't it?

1208
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,740
Do you remember your childhood?

1209
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,590
Warmth.

1210
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,590
Light.

1211
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,050
But heat as well.

1212
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,050
And glow.

1213
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,680
You like fires.

1214
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,680
Look at me.

1215
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,830
You'd like to set fire to
everything now.

1216
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,050
That's what you'd like best.

1217
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,740
Set fire to the curtain.

1218
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,278
Firemen!

1219
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,680
Thank you, have fun for the
rest of the show.

1220
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,740
Ridiculous Tomfoolery.

1221
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,050
Is that what you think?

1222
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,890
Order is there!

1223
01:38:13,939 --> 01:38:18,938
The purifying fire that we
have set aflame.

1224
01:38:18,939 --> 01:38:20,665
Now we must...

1225
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:23,815
all of us, lift a torch...

1226
01:38:24,139 --> 01:38:29,085
A torch that lights the way
for our people,

1227
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:34,040
one that sets fire to everything
that is pulling back our nation

1228
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:38,938
into the  world of traitors!

1229
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:41,815
This common meal...

1230
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:46,425
should be the symbol of our
common struggle.

1231
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:29,890
Mr. Hanussen, can you explain
hypnosis to them?

1232
01:39:29,939 --> 01:39:31,665
Let's pack and leave here.

1233
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,164
You still want to go away
with me?

1234
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:40,040
Leave the burning building and
watch the others burn?

1235
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:47,040
- Have you gone crazy?
- I always foresaw everything.

1236
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,200
You say it was a mistake.
Maybe it was.

1237
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,680
Would it be better if I said:

1238
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:58,040
I warned you. I told you you
were going to crash?

1239
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:01,838
Would that give you
satisfaction?

1240
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:04,164
I have no influence, whatsoever.

1241
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,439
Why am I here?

1242
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,890
He was nervous and upset when
he came home.

1243
01:40:09,939 --> 01:40:11,665
His hands were shaking...

1244
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,050
He said later:

1245
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,890
- "They want some kind of a fire."
- A fire?

1246
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,050
Yes, word by word.

1247
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:25,830
The great magician has become
fond of you.

1248
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,740
You're mistaken.

1249
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,050
He loves Valery.

1250
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:34,928
Try to stay close to him. Be
his mistress. Thank you.

1251
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,740
Call Capitan Becker.

1252
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:45,890
Stay alert. Soon you'll join
your friend in Switzerland.

1253
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,050
Be careful though.

1254
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,243
Good bye.

1255
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:57,040
Get a hold of the gentlemen that
were at my house two nights ago.

1256
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:59,793
Also a list of the most important
buildings in the city.

1257
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:02,815
We may have to move the Count
from Berlin.

1258
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:04,665
He's having visions of fires.

1259
01:41:04,939 --> 01:41:07,815
He thinks that an opera house
or the Reichstag will burn.

1260
01:41:07,939 --> 01:41:10,815
He organizes the Aristocrats
among the officers

1261
01:41:10,939 --> 01:41:13,239
to uncover a possible arson.
Ridiculous.

1262
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,050
He says it's an opportunity,

1263
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:18,928
to remove those petite bourgeois
from around Hitler.

1264
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:20,263
It concerns us.

1265
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,134
You know the saying:

1266
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:25,928
Beat your own, so that
strangers will fear you.

1267
01:41:25,939 --> 01:41:27,665
Shall I stay where I am?

1268
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:30,050
Or shall I go away forever?

1269
01:41:32,939 --> 01:41:34,665
I am so alone.

1270
01:41:34,939 --> 01:41:36,378
Can no one help me?

1271
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,050
Is there no hope?

1272
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,680
Shall I be a member of
Parliament?

1273
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,680
A member of Parliament?

1274
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,935
Where?

1275
01:41:57,939 --> 01:41:59,665
In the Reichstag?

1276
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,935
But, sir...

1277
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,935
The Reichstag?

1278
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,740
There is no Reichstag anymore.

1279
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:12,740
It will soon be burning.

1280
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,740
I can see flames rising from
it's dome.

1281
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,680
The sky is fire-red over
Berlin.

1282
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:24,688
The whole building is ablaze!

1283
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:27,815
The flames keep rising!

1284
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,680
The question is:

1285
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,740
Who set it on fire?

1286
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,695
The Reichstag...

1287
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,935
Will burn.

1288
01:43:16,418 --> 01:43:20,093
"The Reichstag in flames?
Prophecy of Hanussen."

1289
01:43:20,244 --> 01:43:23,006
Withdrawal every newspaper
immediately.

1290
01:43:22,939 --> 01:43:25,815
Intercept those being
delivered by train.

1291
01:43:25,939 --> 01:43:27,665
About the afternoon edition,

1292
01:43:27,939 --> 01:43:31,965
censor everything about
Hanussen. Fires, prophecy, all.

1293
01:43:45,087 --> 01:43:48,192
Count Trantow-Waldach
Victim of a Motorcycle accident.

1294
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:56,050
Hanussen.

1295
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,050
You must come with us.

1296
01:43:58,136 --> 01:44:00,110
Where?

1297
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,890
My superior wants to talk to
you.

1298
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,980
- My show starts in five minutes.
- Sorry, I have my orders.

1299
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:12,050
Cancel the show.

1300
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:15,935
I don't understand.

1301
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:17,628
This problem doesn't concern
me.

1302
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,050
Come, we must go.

1303
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,740
Where? I must know.

1304
01:44:23,939 --> 01:44:25,665
Don't cause problems, madame.

1305
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,740
- You stay here.
- I don't want to leave you.

1306
01:44:28,939 --> 01:44:30,665
- Who are you?
- His life partner.

1307
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,935
You may also come.

1308
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,680
Well, Hanussen.

1309
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,980
Can you predict your future?
Blindfold him, it may help.

1310
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,680
Why do you sweat?

1311
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,935
Are you afraid?

1312
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:23,938
I've heard a person who knows
about his future,

1313
01:45:23,939 --> 01:45:26,815
wets himself or shits his pants.

1314
01:45:26,939 --> 01:45:29,815
- Is your friend often afraid?
- Yes.

1315
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:31,378
How come?

1316
01:45:31,639 --> 01:45:33,710
Someone as conceited as he...

1317
01:45:33,939 --> 01:45:37,938
- He's not presumptuous.
- Has this impostor deceived you?

1318
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:39,378
I am not an impostor.

1319
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:43,628
Maybe not, then we made a mistake.

1320
01:45:43,629 --> 01:45:45,798
Posterity will decide that.

1321
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:48,890
- You can't just make me disappear.
- Can't I?

1322
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,684
I'd just like you to sleep.

1323
01:45:51,844 --> 01:45:56,063
You'll wake up when the cock
crows three times.

1324
01:45:55,939 --> 01:45:58,675
And you will be the cock.

1325
01:45:58,675 --> 01:46:01,775
There is a tree behind you.
Climb it.

1326
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:07,154
Go on.
Climb it!

1327
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:20,050
Fine.

1328
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:23,745
Now crouch on that branch,
little cock.

1329
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,989
And now I want you to crow.

1330
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,990
Oh Lord...

1331
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,740
Please make them not crow.

1332
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:44,050
Our father,

1333
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:46,778
who art in heaven, hollowed
by the name,

1334
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,050
thy kingdom come.

1335
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:51,778
They will be done,
in earth as it is in heaven.

1336
01:47:51,939 --> 01:47:53,665
Give us this day our daily
bread.

1337
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:55,665
And forgive us our trespasses,

1338
01:47:56,139 --> 01:47:57,635
as we forgive those who trespass
against us.

1339
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,164
And lead us not into
temptation,

1340
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,164
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

1341
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:08,050
Once more!

1342
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:49,705
Prophet.

1343
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:51,096
You don't exist anymore.

1344
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,678
You are finished.

1345
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,680
You'll never be a prophet
again.

1346
01:48:54,939 --> 01:48:56,665
You don't exist anymore.

1347
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,050
Never again.

1348
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,740
Are you trying to hypnotize
me?

1349
01:49:09,939 --> 01:49:11,378
Try harder.

1350
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:14,740
Struggle a little longer,
prophet.

1351
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,050
Have you lost your power?

1352
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,740
You will all perish.

1353
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,935
Why?

1354
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:14,320
Why?
