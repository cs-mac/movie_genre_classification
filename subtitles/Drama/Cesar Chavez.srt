1
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,122
I was born in Yuma, Arizona
in a ranch owned by my family

2
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,601
but we lost it in the depression.

3
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,850
Like many other families, we moved
to California to work in the fields.

4
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,442
<i>But when we arrived, we found out that
there was more people than jobs.</i>

5
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,724
<i>We went from being farm owners
to farm workers in one day.</i>

6
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,242
<i>And at the age of 11,
I started working in the fields.</i>

7
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,088
<i>That's where I witnessed,
for the first time,</i>

8
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,006
<i>the injustice and the indignities
suffered by the farm workers.</i>

9
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,447
<i>You see the problem is that in 1936
the country changed,</i>

10
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,811
<i>because the National Labor Relations Act
went into effect.</i>

11
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,728
And it gave most workers the right
to join the union and bargain collectively.

12
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,209
Except the farm workers,

13
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,763
they were excluded from this protection
and I was one of them.

14
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,602
I wanted to do something, so I joined
the CSO, Community Services Organization.

15
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,202
And that is where I learned
how to organize people.

16
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,088
<i>We were working in the cities and I
realized that, to make a difference,</i>

17
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,243
<i>I had to get out
and start organizing the workers.</i>

18
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,405
<i>So, in 1962, I went back
to the fields to do just that.</i>

19
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,163
Juan de la Cruz!

20
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,405
I'm a friend of your cousin, Felipe.

21
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,446
Are you Juan?

22
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,121
Can we talk?

23
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,926
Sure. But not here.

24
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,480
I'm done in about 4 hours.

25
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,130
You need to leave now. They're coming.

26
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,290
Can I help you, sir?
Were you talking to those workers?

27
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,166
Is there something I can do for you?

28
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,924
I'm talking to you.

29
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,121
Do you own anything?

30
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,961
No.

31
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,087
Can you read or write?

32
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,205
Well... No.

33
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,331
Of course not.

34
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,087
Who in your family works?

35
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,120
Me and my wife.

36
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,245
And my kids. The older ones anyways.

37
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,120
The other ones are still too young.

38
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,161
Do you want more for your kids?

39
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,684
Of course.

40
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,611
But...

41
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,081
Most of the people are afraid.

42
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,323
They have to feed their kids.

43
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,324
It's not easy doing it alone.

44
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,808
I'll return in one month
to help you start organizing.

45
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,369
But I need you to gather
everyone you can here.

46
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,770
OK, that's fine.

47
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,451
And you won't be alone anymore.

48
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,963
If we want to organize farm workers,
if we're really serious,

49
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,720
it's not gonna happen here, not with them.

50
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,489
It's just one setback, Cesar, it takes a while
to build trust, you have to be patient.

51
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,528
You know, they really don't care about
the farm worker, Fred.

52
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,641
Gilbert, that's not true.

53
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,088
See that's what I'm talking about, Fred,
see I have to be where it's happening.

54
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,891
I have to get out of Los Angeles
and go back to the fields where I started.

55
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,883
You know, we are doing this together, okay?

56
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,122
You knew this could happen,
that is why we have a plan.

57
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,086
But not in an office.

58
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,446
It's not the time to walk out now.

59
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,124
You know what it takes,
that is why I brought you in.

60
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,687
The CSO will be behind you, no matter what,
but please at least sleep on it.

61
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,006
I am not tired, Fred.

62
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,570
I want to get my hands dirty.

63
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,971
- Cesar...
- I'm with him. He's right.

64
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,646
You will go to new schools
and make new friends.

65
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,208
You're going to be fine.

66
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,890
Your father and I grew up on the fields.

67
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,450
Which team plays for Delano?

68
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,368
Your tio Ruc and tia Petra live in Delano,
so do our cousins. It's gonna be good.

69
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,569
Okay, let's take a vote.

70
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,162
Who wants to go to Delano?

71
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,562
<i>...a wonderful day
in Southern California.</i>

72
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,569
<i>- Sandy Koufax on the mound.
- No!</i>

73
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,650
<i>Sandy coming off that
beautiful no-hitter last week.</i>

74
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,805
<i>Caullison just waving that bat
back and forth.</i>

75
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,888
<i>- Pare,</i> I <i>am trying</i> to listen to <i>the game.
- Koufax trying to keep</i>

76
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,121
<i>his winning streak going.</i>

77
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,931
Could you stop? Stop!

78
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,085
<i>Top of the fourth,
Dodgers leading two to nothing.</i>

79
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,928
<i>Koufax delivers and it's
a line drive down the left field line...</i>

80
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,087
<i>Fair ball!</i>

81
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,601
I can't hear. Can you turn it up?

82
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,726
I think we, uh, lost the signal.

83
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,206
You promised me a three-bedroom house.

84
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,884
I said I would try, Mansi.
It was short notice.

85
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
But I gave you 2 months.

86
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,526
That's short notice!

87
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,840
Uncle Cesar.

88
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,520
- That goes in the bedroom, Chato.
- It doesn't fit.

89
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,647
It doesn't fit.

90
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,609
Hey, Cesar, we've lived in a lot worse.

91
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,681
We'll be fine.

92
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,086
Can you get the heavy stuff
in the truck please?

93
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,250
If you put eight kids in that one car,
you can put them in that house!

94
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,683
We can find a bigger one
in a couple of months.

95
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,882
And then we gotta
move all over again?

96
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,123
48, 49,

97
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,490
50, 51,

98
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,685
52,

99
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,725
53!

100
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,201
That's all for today!

101
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,921
I hear they are looking for bodies
at the onion fields.

102
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,008
I found the same thing in Hanford.

103
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,369
The workers are scared.

104
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,449
Then we need to hold twice as many
house meetings than we did in Selma.

105
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,447
- What's the matter?
- It's my back.

106
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,210
You can't take real work anymore.

107
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,362
It hurts even when I don't work.

108
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,363
You should take it easy.

109
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,764
What, and live on just
what Helen makes? No.

110
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,289
We are going to make the kids work
on the weekends now.

111
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,084
but she went and told everybody
at the church,

112
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,565
and now everybody has...

113
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,127
Look who is here.

114
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,364
And very dirty.

115
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,845
Did you walk here from Oxnard?

116
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,967
Ola.

117
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,641
I thought maybe you weren't coming back.

118
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,042
- It's only been two weeks.
- It's been 18 days.

119
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,121
Eighteen days...

120
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,921
Cesar.

121
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,127
Dolores!

122
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,208
Look at you.
You definitely got your hands dirty.

123
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,121
This is Angela. Say, "Hi, Cesar."

124
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,531
Hey, mamita.

125
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,841
I'm gonna put her to bed.

126
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,729
How long are you guys visiting us?

127
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,724
Oh, well, word is you can't
do this without me, so...

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,081
You are staying?

129
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,046
Well, of course. You think I'm going to
let you mess up what you've started here?

130
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,806
But before you do anything,
you need to go talk to Fernando.

131
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,004
I need to go talk to Fernando?

132
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,447
Okay.

133
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,806
Hi, Poli.

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,884
What happened to your eye?

135
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,486
Nothing.

136
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,287
You wanna talk about this nothing?

137
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,486
Nope.

138
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,368
The kids here are idiots.

139
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,009
They hate us, you know?

140
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,605
<i>They came up on me and Chats,
a bunch of them.</i>

141
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,480
They wouldn't stop calling us "beaners."

142
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,809
Beaners? Is that the best they got?

143
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,488
I've been called much worse.

144
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,010
<i>Greaser,</i>

145
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,601
"wetback,

146
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,646
"spic."

147
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,287
That one doesn't even make sense.

148
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,961
"Brown nigger."

149
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,569
I never heard that one.

150
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,721
Uh-huh.

151
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,484
I learned a lot in the Navy.

152
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,883
Here, put this on your eye.

153
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,330
Who started it?

154
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,009
I told you, they started calling us names.

155
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,725
No, who started the fight?

156
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,247
We didn't have a choice.

157
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,162
You always have a choice.

158
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,722
I knew you wouldn't get it.

159
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,682
<i>although the
official military word is that</i>

160
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,808
<i>these are only mopping up operations,</i>

161
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,684
<i>in five separate actions...</i>

162
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,047
We need to bring the
people together, like a convention.

163
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,122
We need to get
everybody together in one place

164
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,924
so they can see how strong we are.

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,968
We should start a credit union.

166
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,605
To loan people money?

167
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,361
It'll give us credibility
and it will help people during the winter.

168
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,606
<i>Hey, remember me? Eli Ordonez.</i>

169
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,287
I saw you in Salinas at that other meeting
you were doing.

170
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,442
If you want, I can help pass those around.

171
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,286
I have a cousin who has no papers.

172
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,129
You tell your cousin,
if he works in the fields,

173
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,248
he has the right to representation.

174
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,443
What is happening here in Delano

175
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,286
is the same thing that is happening
in Salinas or in Stockton.

176
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,924
If we don't get organized,
the bosses are going to treat us like...

177
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,331
Excuse me.

178
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,166
Who are you?

179
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,481
Cesar Chavez.

180
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,680
How much are you
asking for, Chucho?

181
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,326
25 dollars.

182
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,246
How about 10, Chucho?

183
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,561
Look at all these other people
who also want money.

184
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,640
My daughter has some questionnaires.

185
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,922
We want to know what concerns you.

186
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,451
Come on, just do that for us.

187
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,441
Here, people can put messages
to their family, or anyone, it's free.

188
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,563
Want to see the union paper?

189
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,165
Sheriff, every night this goes on.

190
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,920
And I have to tell my husband to rush home

191
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,928
because I'm frightened
about what is going on over there.

192
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,650
We are decent folk
and don't want any trouble.

193
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,371
I'm terrified for my children
and who knows where...

194
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,444
Okay... Okay... Ladies... Ladies...
Let me make sure I understand this.

195
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,841
- You say they get together every night?
- Every night.

196
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,921
And there is 50 of them?

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,480
57. I count 57.

198
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,486
57?

199
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,081
Mr. Chavez?

200
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,886
Yes?

201
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,200
How are you doin' today?

202
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,601
Fine. How can I help you?

203
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,450
I just wanted to introduce myself.

204
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,040
- I'm Sheriff...
- I know who you are.

205
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,771
You seem to be gathering quite a crowd.

206
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,681
Is there a law against that?

207
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,601
No, not really.

208
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,484
But I would like to ask you some questions

209
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,407
about some of the people around you
and their affiliations.

210
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,841
Affiliations to what?

211
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,449
Let's say the communist party.

212
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,564
- Communists?
- Yes.

213
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,009
Do you mind tellin' me what's so funny?

214
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,129
It's that we are Catholic.

215
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,131
How can Catholics be communists?

216
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,969
I've seen stranger things.

217
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,931
Mr. Chavez, do you mind
if we take a look around?

218
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,401
Do you have a warrant?

219
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,081
Not on me.

220
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,485
So you're asking me for a favor?

221
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,681
I think you'd be doing yourself a favor.

222
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,491
Come on. There's nothing to see here.

223
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,846
Come in.

224
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,610
We have nothing to hide.

225
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,161
So what they doin' here?

226
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,640
You givin' away free pinatas or something?

227
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,766
It's a credit union.

228
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,721
No shit.

229
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,206
Where's the money coming from?

230
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,566
Donations.

231
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,205
Here's a box if you're interested.

232
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,444
I don't know exactly what you're up to here

233
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,962
but the citizens of Delano,

234
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,607
they don't care much for subversives.

235
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,609
They respect the law.

236
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,566
So do we.

237
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,161
Especially the Bill of Rights.

238
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,569
Ever read the Bill of Rights?

239
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
Let's go.

240
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,680
<i>Listen up, all of you in there.</i>

241
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,961
<i>You have 10 minutes
to vacate the premises.</i>

242
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,122
<i>You are now trespassing and will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</i>

243
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,440
We are not moving!

244
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,007
<i>Is that you, Larry?</i>

245
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,888
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

246
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,209
<i>Larry, you get your people out of there now
and get back to work.</i>

247
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,201
<i>I'll forget everything.
No blacklisting, no nothing.</i>

248
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,880
Sorry, that's not good enough.

249
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,728
You cut our wages too goddamn much.

250
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,167
We starve on what you pay us anyhow.

251
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,247
Go.

252
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,881
Nobody leave!

253
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,603
Stay together, stay strong!

254
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,449
The growers cut their pay in half.

255
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,847
Now they have barricaded themselves
in the camps.

256
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,921
This thing is blowing up.

257
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,570
- The Filipinos?
- Yeah.

258
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,530
And now the growers are recruiting
our people to break the strikes.

259
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,965
That's why Larry specifically asked
for you, Cesar.

260
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,601
He knows he can't win without us.

261
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
Oh, and by the way,

262
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,131
who gives a shit about the Filipinos?

263
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,526
No mames.
They undercut us left and right.

264
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,369
Do you think they would strike for us?

265
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,410
They play the races against each other,
that is their tactic.

266
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,690
Are we a union or not?

267
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,884
Our brother Cesar Chavez
will speak to us now.

268
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,600
Brothers and sisters.

269
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,203
Today our fellow Filipino workers
have taken a vital step

270
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,888
towards the fight for freedom and dignity

271
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,522
that poverty has denied us.

272
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,686
And they have come to us
and asked a very important question.

273
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,088
Whether we're prepared to set our
differences apart and join their strike.

274
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,961
But the most important thing to consider

275
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,563
is if news of this strike remains only in
Delano, then we will have been defeated.

276
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,362
Because they not only own the land,
but also the police and judges.

277
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,481
If we show the world
their abuse, greed, and brutality

278
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,965
then our voice will be heard
and responded to.

279
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,000
And when they see that our actions are just

280
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,926
they will understand
that our cause is just.

281
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,405
Then we will prevail.
Yes we can!

282
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,481
Strike! I

283
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,366
The growers are going to be...

284
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,488
Larry, now that we are together,
the growers are gonna have to...

285
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,528
I'm not worried about them.

286
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,409
My people are angry.

287
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,408
This thing has been building for too long,
it's ready to explode.

288
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,722
Everyone is angry, we just have
to manage our own people.

289
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,610
I have people from Stockton to Coachella!

290
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,727
I didn't say it was going to be easy,

291
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,371
but if you take care of your side,
I take care of mine, we'll be fine.

292
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,729
- There are things we can't control.
- No, there are things we have to control.

293
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,569
So who the hell is this Cesar Chavez?

294
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,845
Nobody knows.

295
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,323
Somebody said he was from Arizona.

296
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,291
Word is he used to hang around Alinsky
and the other commies from the CSO.

297
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,569
He's been up and down the valley,
stirring up trouble.

298
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,210
I heard he's Mexican.

299
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,684
Seems a safe bet.

300
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,687
They've come out with this newspaper.

301
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,571
Got this beaner character in there
named Don Sotaco.

302
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,441
There he is.

303
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,124
He's kinda funny.

304
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,365
Well, it's a cartoon,
but I'm not sure it's funny.

305
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,847
Who cares, most of our workers
are illiterate.

306
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,046
Yeah, but you can understand a cartoon
without being able to read.

307
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,204
So, this Don Sotaco,

308
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,726
he, uh, informs the workers
about their rights.

309
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,886
- And this is what, a weekly?
- Mmm-hmm.

310
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,730
Thank God it isn't a daily.

311
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:14,763
Although, 52 weeks a year,
that is a lot of rights, Sheriff.

312
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,366
Long live the strike!

313
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,326
Long live the farmworker!

314
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,242
Long live our cause!

315
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,927
Long live our farmworker movement!

316
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,560
Did they confirm?

317
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,046
- Of course.
- Anyone...

318
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,442
Mostly local, but some are actually
coming down from San Francisco, Arizona...

319
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,080
- Where are they?
- I don't know. They should be here by now.

320
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,367
Get the hell off our property!

321
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,566
Go back to Mexico!

322
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,689
Stay calm, don't react.

323
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,762
We don't need you. Wetbacks.

324
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,490
- Get out of here!
- Don't react, just keep moving.

325
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,170
We don't need you.
We want you out of our country.

326
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,210
We want you back to Mexico.
Get the hell out of our country!

327
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,288
What do you think you are looking at, huh?

328
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,001
Damn spics! We don't need you! Get out!

329
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,201
Keep marching. Keep marching, please.

330
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,966
- Get these sons of bitches off my land.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,088
We aren't going anywhere,
we have the right to be here.

332
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,161
Suit yourself.

333
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,163
Deputies, now, you're witnesses.
This horde invaded my property

334
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,329
and we are just defending ourselves.

335
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,281
A man has a duty to defend his property.

336
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,930
You are damn right he does.

337
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,968
Cesar, they will shoot.

338
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,321
You get rid of them!

339
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,490
Everybody move! Move back!

340
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,728
Back to the main road,
everybody move back now!

341
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,689
Move back! Move back! No, no, no!

342
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,246
Are you going to do something?

343
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,808
You hard of hearing?
The boss told you to clear out.

344
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,530
He's not my boss.

345
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,563
And our tax dollars pay
for this public road.

346
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,846
Tax dollars?

347
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,810
There's your tax dollars.

348
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,169
Hey, Gilbert!

349
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,163
Hey, that's enough now. Come on, that's
all. Let's go. Get on over here.

350
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,250
Hello, you are late.

351
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,921
<i>Farm workers
in Delano, California</i>

352
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,769
<i>have begun an unprecedented strike</i>

353
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,887
<i>in the central valley.</i>

354
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,522
<i>Filipino and Mexican workers
have joined forces</i>

355
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,241
<i>to demand fair wages and better working
conditions for their members.</i>

356
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,802
<i>Would you say that most of
your workers are making a decent living?</i>

357
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,402
<i>All I can say is that the men
have to be their judges of their own,</i>

358
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,444
<i>what they want,
because they have chosen this way of life</i>

359
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,648
<i>and, if they were not happy,
they wouldn't be here.</i>

360
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,570
<i>How much have you been getting
for a day's work?</i>

361
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,245
<i>Only 2 dollars.</i>

362
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,245
<i>- 2 dollars a day?
- Yes.</i>

363
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,407
- Are you sure it's not broken?
- I'm sure.

364
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,605
Dad?

365
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,122
It's okay, Fernando.
Go back to sleep, please.

366
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,803
I said go back to sleep, Fernando,
you have school tomorrow.

367
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,402
Here. Put it on.

368
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,683
Does this help?

369
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,843
I told you five minutes ago
to sit down at the table.

370
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,481
Mmm.

371
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,531
To all the growers, their lawyers
and this garbage injunction.

372
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,645
At least they finally got Fred
to come down here.

373
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,650
This court ruling bans all mass picketing.

374
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,810
Mmm. And the best part,

375
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,362
they got a ban on saying
the word "Huelga" anywhere near the fields.

376
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,561
- "Huelga?"
- <i>"Huelga-"</i>

377
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,484
Can you say "Strike"?

378
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,290
As long as you don't translate it.

379
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,931
You would think a bunch of lawyers
would have heard of the First Amendment.

380
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,048
It's a joke.
They'll get it thrown out on appeal.

381
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,288
Yeah, by the time the state court
hears the appeals,

382
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,522
the grapes will be picked,
the growers know that.

383
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,802
There's only one thing we can do.

384
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,451
We have to get people
to violate the injunction,

385
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,800
and make the Sheriff enforce it.

386
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,526
You mean get arrested.

387
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,563
Make them arrest us and fill up the jails?

388
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,769
And give the white press
exactly what they want? Hmm?

389
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,365
Rowdy Mexicans in jail.

390
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,926
Have you had your head in the dirt
this whole time?

391
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,365
Things are changing.

392
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,209
Okay, but who is gonna go?

393
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,201
I'll do it.

394
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,641
Once they get you in their jails,

395
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,843
they can figure out ways of keeping
you there a long time, Cesar.

396
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,407
So I'll do it.

397
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,246
Do what?

398
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,890
I'll get arrested.

399
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,850
You can't get arrested.

400
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,886
What? Why not?

401
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,048
Well, who is going to
take care of the kids?

402
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,690
The kids are fine.

403
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,286
- They are big, they take care of themselves.
- No.

404
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,884
Cesar, you are the one who says
we can't ask our members

405
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,530
to do things we are not willing
to do ourselves.

406
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,284
I said no.

407
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,131
Dolores, what do you think?

408
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,930
I think it's a good idea.

409
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,247
I think it's a good idea, too.

410
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,285
Come, let's eat.

411
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,964
You know how it works,
they don't understand.

412
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,486
Strike!

413
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,565
Strike!

414
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,404
Mrs. Chavez,

415
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,247
we have a court order that forbids you
from saying the word "Huelga. <i>"</i>

416
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,971
Strike!

417
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,246
This is your first warning, Mrs. Chavez.

418
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,449
This is your second!

419
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,480
- Good morning to you.
- Good morning, sir.

420
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,010
- Good morning, Grace.
- Good morning.

421
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,282
Call my wife and tell her
I'm not going to be able to make lunch.

422
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,124
Come on, let's go.

423
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,286
I need you to take the trucks across
the border into Mexico,

424
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,201
and I want y'all to bring me back
some illegals

425
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,442
who are willing to work
for an honest day's pay.

426
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,490
And I want you to bring them back here
by the truckload, you hear me.

427
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,645
'Cause we are gonna break
this goddamn strike.

428
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,164
You'll see what these sons of bitches do

429
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,640
when they see their cousins
out there working on 'em fields.

430
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,764
Everyone gather up.

431
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,361
Who's thirsty?

432
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,487
Here, have some cold water.

433
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,360
It's free...

434
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,404
I've been told that some union members

435
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,731
affiliated with the communist party

436
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,843
have been talking with you.

437
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,363
Making promises.
These promises are nothing but lies.

438
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,728
You could even end up in jail.

439
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,409
And for what?

440
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,128
What's wrong, Cruz?

441
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,570
Aren't you thirsty?

442
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,929
If any of you has a problem,
tell me about it.

443
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,209
We don't want any problems here.

444
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,404
- Jail was amazing?
- Yeah, it was.

445
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,290
I got to meet so many amazing people.

446
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,805
There was this woman, Irene,

447
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,601
she was so smart, and I'm gonna
put her on the Credit Union.

448
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,806
And also there was this man
who was laying next to me.

449
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,291
Laying next to you?

450
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,131
Yeah, I saw when he got arrested.

451
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,971
The cops were beating him,
and they were calling him names,

452
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,004
and they were trying to get him
to fight back and he wouldn't.

453
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,123
Do you plan on seeing him again?

454
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,125
Cesar, I don't know what
you are talking about.

455
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,641
Well, you know what? Maybe we can
make him part of the team, you know?

456
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,410
We are always looking for good men.
I mean amazing.

457
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,005
'Cause it was amazing, right?

458
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,560
- Cesar, don't be jealous.
- No.

459
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,130
I'm not jealous.

460
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,289
I'm just glad that you had
such a good time in jail.

461
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,930
Cesar!

462
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,610
Cesar! Hey, Cesar!
It's Jerry Cohen, remember me?

463
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,482
- Who's that?
- He's a lawyer.

464
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,806
You know that man?

465
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,769
How much do you know about
what we are doing?

466
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,366
I've been analyzing your strategy,
and one thing is clear,

467
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,726
you have to stop these injunctions.

468
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,003
I mean they are a catch-22,
the bail alone is going to bankrupt you.

469
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,003
With all due respect,
I know you went to a fancy school,

470
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,161
that doesn't make you an expert.

471
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,720
Well, I also worked the California Rural
Legal Assistance.

472
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,165
- For how long?
- 2 years.

473
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,806
2 years, huh? Why did you leave?

474
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,241
Um...

475
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,084
It's complicated.

476
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,286
That's what I heard.

477
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,400
You are hired.

478
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,244
Hired?

479
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,209
I want you full time, starting now.

480
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,163
I thought maybe I'd do some consulting?

481
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,767
No, as of now you are in charge
of the United Farm Workers' legal team.

482
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,320
- Who else is on the team?
- Just you.

483
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,326
Doesn't it take more than one person
to make a team?

484
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,642
Oh, you'll be doing more work
than one person.

485
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,524
Against one of the biggest
law firms in California.

486
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,007
And you'll be getting paid
five dollars a week.

487
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,570
5 dollars a week?

488
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,604
You'll be happy to know that
makes you the highest paid employee.

489
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,001
Also our lowest paid employee.

490
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,684
Everybody makes five dollars a week?

491
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,845
Hey! If you wanna make money,
go work for the growers.

492
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,522
We're here to help.

493
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,645
Don't be afraid.

494
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,529
United we will stand.

495
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,364
They will not defeat us.

496
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,409
United we will stand.

497
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,965
They will not defeat us.

498
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,282
This movement is for you, the people.

499
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,727
They will not defeat us.

500
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,370
Long live the strike!

501
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,369
Long live Cesar Chavez!

502
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,722
Son! Son!

503
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,407
They're not paying you enough!
Come join us!

504
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,600
Join the cause!

505
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,050
Son, they're not paying you enough.

506
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,609
Don't betray your people.

507
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,401
Hey, come join us!

508
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,001
Come!

509
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,165
Don't be afraid!

510
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,447
Come on, come on, come on!

511
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,403
Come!

512
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,921
Get closer!

513
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,847
- Closer together!
- Run, get together!

514
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,242
Move back! Move back!

515
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,523
We are not leaving!

516
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,601
Don't move! Stay together.

517
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,523
Pesticide! Helen!

518
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,081
Helen!

519
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,291
- it burns.
- I know.

520
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,886
I almost got it.

521
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,962
That was really scary, Cesar.

522
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,647
What if something happened to us?

523
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,201
What would happen to the kids?

524
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,250
<i>People are starting to lose hope,
and I don't blame them.</i>

525
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,844
They know the growers have broken
the strike with the illegal workers.

526
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,370
And the sweetheart deal with the teamsters.

527
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,043
We can't ask them to keep going when
they see people working in the fields.

528
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,088
We have to take the next step.

529
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,691
We are too weak.

530
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,160
We have no laws to protect us here.

531
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,210
With the boycott,
there are no laws to stop us.

532
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,883
This is the moment, Cesar.

533
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,761
This is what we came here to do.

534
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,640
We just can't
boycott all the growers.

535
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,408
We need to start small, we need a face,
a brand, that's what we need to focus on.

536
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,244
And that face is Victorre Wines.

537
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,764
<i>Dolores Huerta will be recruiting
in the west counties,</i>

538
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,320
<i>and Gilbert Padilla
will be recruiting in the southern cities.</i>

539
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,601
<i>And the rest of the state we will
divide amongst each other.</i>

540
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,564
Anybody that can travel, talk to Richard.

541
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,208
My brother knows how to travel.

542
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,570
To be successful,

543
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,241
we have to have an army of boycotters,
willing to do the hard work.

544
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,723
The bigger the army, the
bigger the success.

545
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,043
You start small, you get wins.

546
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,406
The army will get bigger.

547
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,610
The people to best recruit
are the students.

548
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,762
Civil rights groups, some church groups,
those are the best recruits.

549
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,690
Well, any kind of recruit
is the best kind of recruit for us.

550
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,442
So, we need to hit the streets
with aggressive leafleting.

551
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,724
And make so much noise

552
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,882
that they won't be able to ignore us.

553
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:48,400
Picket lines, in churches,
entertainment venues, colleges, factories.

554
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,482
Anywhere there's a large number of people.

555
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,886
That's where you need to go.

556
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,724
<i>Once we got their attention,</i>

557
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,886
<i>we need to get on every radio show,
and every television show.</i>

558
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,968
There's no bathrooms in the fields.
There's no minimum wage.

559
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,440
The best thing that you can do,
the way we can put pressure,

560
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,610
is to boycott.

561
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,482
You can help by boycotting Victorre Grapes.

562
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,647
Okay, thank you.

563
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,081
<i>And tell them personal stories.</i>

564
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,841
<i>Firsthand, from the people
that have suffered in the fields.</i>

565
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,970
<i>Because we are fighting
for basic human rights.</i>

566
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,929
<i>The attention of national
legislators was focused on Delano</i>

567
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,129
<i>when the Senate Subcommittee
on migrant labor conducted hearings</i>

568
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,360
<i>in the Delano high school.</i>

569
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,127
<i>Headed by New Jersey's Harrison Williams.</i>

570
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,207
<i>It also included California's George
Murphy, and New York's Robert Kennedy.</i>

571
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,044
Senator Kennedy
can be very supportive

572
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,921
if he thinks the cause
can make a difference.

573
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,447
So, when he comes, make sure you
walk with him so they can take pictures.

574
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,847
How are you, sir?

575
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,601
How are you? Thank you.

576
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,681
Hi, how are you?

577
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,446
Senator Kennedy, great to see you again.
I'd like to introduce Cesar Chavez.

578
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,965
- It's a pleasure...
- It's likewise.

579
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,530
Go, go, go.

580
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,841
You were supposed to walk with him.

581
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,281
Hi, John, how are you? Good to see you.

582
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,449
Don't believe everything you hear today.

583
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,530
Yeah, it looks like he is not even
talking to them either so...

584
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,361
Do you write down the license
plate numbers of everyone in the city?

585
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,724
I'm glad he came,
but I think it's just for show.

586
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,731
I think you're wrong, Fred.

587
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,401
I hope so.

588
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,923
I also see complaints here
from Mr. Chavez that, uh,

589
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,365
pesticides have been sprayed
on some of his picketers.

590
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,209
I'm aware of no such incidents.

591
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,051
What about shots being fired
in their general direction?

592
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,488
We've looked into every one
of Mr. Chavez's complaints

593
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,331
and haven't found an ounce
of truth to any of it.

594
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,361
Lie.

595
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,564
Is it true that you detained some
picketers as a preventive measure?

596
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,369
Your arrest record seems to confirm it.

597
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,284
If I have reason to believe that
there's going to be a riot started,

598
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,240
and someone tells me there's going
to be trouble unless I stop them,

599
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,243
it's my duty to stop them.

600
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,640
You just go out there and arrest them?

601
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,920
Absolutely.

602
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,520
Who told you they were going to riot?

603
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,926
The foremen.

604
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,770
Right out there in the fields.

605
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,607
The ones we were talking to,
said that if we didn't stop them,

606
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,489
they were going to cut their hearts out.

607
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,962
So, rather than let things get out of hand,
we just removed the cause.

608
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,084
This is the most interesting
concept, I think,

609
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,124
that you suddenly hear talk of
somebody who's gonna get out of order,

610
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,965
perhaps violate the law,

611
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,200
and so you go in and arrest
the intended victim of the crime,

612
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,328
and they haven't done anything wrong.

613
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,451
I want to thank Sheriff Smith
for his services to the citizens of Delano.

614
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,931
We'll now take an hour recess for lunch.

615
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,288
Excuse me, can I suggest...

616
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,529
I would just like to suggest that,
in the interim period of time,

617
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,409
in the luncheon period of time,

618
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,404
that the Sheriff
and the Kern County District Attorney,

619
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,689
read the Constitution
of the United States of America.

620
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,489
I guess I was wrong.

621
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,289
Hey! Fuck you!

622
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,808
We are going to
get you, little beaner.

623
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,446
Wetback!

624
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,962
We are going to kick your ass.

625
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,321
You should talk to
Fernando before you go.

626
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,046
Hmm.

627
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,562
He's having trouble with those kids again.

628
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,486
Where is he?

629
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,846
He's at Richard's.

630
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,367
He's been spending a lot
of time there lately.

631
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,684
Maybe that's not such a good idea.

632
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,689
Maybe you should talk to him.

633
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,682
I'll talk to him when I get back.

634
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,210
Cesar, you know that boy
is as stubborn as you are.

635
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,767
Your clean socks are on the top shelf.

636
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,245
Take all of them.

637
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,401
It's a lot of socks.

638
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,565
It's a long walk.

639
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,846
Cesar.

640
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,203
You got a permit for this march?

641
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,410
It's not a march, Sheriff. It's a
pilgrimage all the way to Sacramento.

642
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,921
And our families are here
just to say goodbye.

643
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,691
Do you hear that?

644
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,484
They don't like working for a day's wage,
but they'll walk over 300 miles for free.

645
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,444
Even pilgrims ain't allowed in the street
without a permit.

646
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,322
Fine, we'll use the sidewalk.
It's open to the public.

647
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,890
If we leave at 10 p.m.,
we can catch them in Modesto.

648
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,200
Yeah, I know Dad.

649
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,244
Fernando, what are you doing?

650
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,441
I'm not going with you guys.

651
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,086
We're going to see your dad
and from there we can go home.

652
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,571
I don't want to see my Dad.

653
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,244
He'll be happy to see you!

654
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,480
He won't even know I'm there.

655
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,522
He only cares about the Union.

656
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,929
Check this out.

657
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,686
Big article about the auto workers
standing down to show solidarity.

658
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,081
Hmm.

659
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,286
Front page?

660
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,727
Page six, but we are moving up.

661
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,362
And those longshore workers
are standing down too.

662
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,646
Rookie!

663
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,531
Mansi!

664
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,162
I saw everybody on the news.

665
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,685
I got tired of just sitting around,
watching a lot of TV, you know.

666
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,002
I got some donations from
a department store.

667
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,050
I am glad you came.

668
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,766
I am glad you came.

669
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,521
Donations.

670
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,881
Boots.

671
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,725
They're brand new.

672
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,368
Yeah, about 150 miles too late.

673
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,723
Boycott Victorre!

674
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,242
<i>I am Chief Executive Officer
of the United Church of Christ.</i>

675
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,682
<i>My name is Rabbi Tannenbaum.
I came here from New York City.</i>

676
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,526
<i>We believe the United Farm Workers
and their leader, Cesar Chavez, represent</i>

677
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,400
<i>the hope and aspirations
of a vast majority of farm workers.</i>

678
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,770
<i>I think every American has a stake to bring
about social change within the system,</i>

679
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,651
<i>because if nonviolent means fail,</i>

680
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,764
<i>this becomes a setback for
the entire democratic process.</i>

681
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,962
In colors, in colors,

682
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,051
are the little birds
that come from outside.

683
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,731
In colors, in colors,

684
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,010
is the rainbow that we see shining.

685
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,044
And that is why I love

686
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,605
The great loves of many colors

687

<i>My union, the U.A.W.

for as long as it takes to win their strike.</i>

689
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,006
The average farm worker only lives to 49.

690
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,682
They say they won't
give you bathrooms in the fields

691
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,087
because Mexicans don't know
how to use them.

692
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,323
<i>I'm Jackie Stringer.
We just drove down from Portland.</i>

693
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,561
<i>That's a long drive.</i>

694
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,729
I've been watching the news.

695
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,485
I saw pictures of the children
working in the fields...

696
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,165
We'd like to help in some way.

697
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,568
Well you can do this, don't buy
any more Victorre products.

698
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,529
No more Victorre wine at dinner.

699
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,530
- And then have your friends do the same.
- I will.

700
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,685
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

701
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,721
You have to sit on your damn booze,
you hear me?

702
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,286
I don't care if you have
to sit on it for a year.

703
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,490
We need you to stay strong.
We need you to hold the line.

704
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,642
We're all counting on you. All of us.

705
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,811
Excuse us.

706
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,047
Strong? Stay strong?
This boycott is killing us!

707
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,130
Have you seen the headlines
they're getting?

708
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,202
Not just in San Francisco,

709
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,291
but in L.A. and San Diego
and Fresno and Sacramento.

710
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,283
They're pulling our products
all over the damn state!

711
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,490
That's costing us money, real money,
Mr. Bogdanovich.

712
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,564
You wanna come in here and explain that
to our shareholders?

713
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,287
You wanna reimburse us those losses
so our stock price doesn't dip?

714
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,411
Can we sit?

715
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,561
<i>A 340 mile pilgrimage

<i>where more than 10,000 supporters

722
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,601
Cesar!

723
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,930
There's a guy on the phone,
he says he's from Victorre.

724
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,609
And he wants to negotiate.

725
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,765
He's called three times.

726
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,281
Get Jerry up here!

727
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,761
Okay!

728
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,324
Fine, you've got your deal,
but if we're gonna pay top dollar,

729
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,169
we expect top dollar work.

730
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,882
That means no one, and I mean no one, is
gonna cut unripe grapes to pad their lugs.

731
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,291
Or stick them full of god damn dirt clods.

732
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,447
Objection.

733
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,128
Objection? What do you mean?

734
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,805
Well, it's a personal objection.

735
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,489
You may not be aware but these people
have been doing this for a very long time.

736
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,682
They don't need you to tell them
how to pick a grape.

737
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,411
Well, you tell them that
when they're packing my grapes...

738
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,964
Well that was the most eloquent piss
I've ever heard.

748
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,570
I'm standing up for my son.

749
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,249
Because somebody has to.

750
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,251
So what's your plan?

751
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,531
You can't stay at your
grandparents' house forever.

752

Don't act like all of a sudden
you are interested in what I'm doing.

753
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,530
Of course I'm interested.

754
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,085
You're my son.

755
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,081
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

756
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,691

759
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,289
It's going to be fine.

760
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,126
Aren't you going to eat something?

761
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,286
You want some carrots or broccoli
that your grandpa grows?

762
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,770
You still hungry? Carrot?

763
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,924
I just got word.

764
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,848
Chavez is going to target us next.

765
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,685
Zucchini.

766
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,050
Dad? What should we do?

767
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,851
I don't know, John.

768
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,248
I'm not the one who went to college.
I'm not the one with the Master's Degree.

769
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,243
I'm only the one
who invested a lot of money

770
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,766
in his only son,

771
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,368
hoping that one day, he would be able
to answer one simple question.

772
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,007
How do I not drive my father's business
into the fucking ground?

773
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,526
I'll, um, talk to the Sheriff.

774
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,486
You're a big man.

775
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,323
Broccoli.

776
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,366
Hmm?

777
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,883
It's time for his nap, Sir.

778
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,482
No, no. You can leave him. He is fine.

779
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,329
Yes, sir.

780
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,722
Maria, you know about this Chavez, no?
Do you really think he's one of you?

781
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,765
Yes, sir.

782
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,846
Hmm.

783
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,888
Well, I'm one of you too.

784
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,361
I came from Croatia with nothing.

785
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,202
Everything I got, I built with my own
hands, my own labor, and my own sweat.

786
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,887
I don't see why anyone should be able
to take that away from me.

787
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,004
So now you want me to help you?

788
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,320
No, no. It's very simple.

789
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,687
I want you to do your job.

790
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,926
Patience.

791
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,244
Is that what you told Victorre?

792
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,764
Because this time we actually
need you to do something.

793
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,402
You see, after the senate hearings,
I can't do nothing about nothing.

794
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,926
Unless they break the law.

795
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,129
Did you hear what I just said?

796
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,604
They are targeting my family now.
Do you understand?

797
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,729
Or do you need my father
to repeat it to you, hmm?

798
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,290
I got too much heat on me.

799
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,083
I can turn a blind eye,
but that's as far as I can go on this.

800
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,770
You do that.

801
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,964
Sit on your ass.

802
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,561
Hey! You okay?

803
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,085
Yes, I'm okay.

804
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,161
Okay, don't move.

805
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,165
Stop it! That's enough!

806
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,561
I said stop! Leave him alone!

807
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,007
You don't want to do this!
You don't wanna hurt this man!

808
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,241
What are you doing, Cesar?

809
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,845
Leave him alone.

810
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,009
This son of a bitch needs to pay
right here, right now.

811
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,081
No, no, no.

812
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,687
The next person who lays a hand on him
is out of the Union!

813
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,851
He's gone!

814
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,760
You don't want to do this!

815
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,128
Not like this!
This is not the way to do things.

816
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,522
Get that piece of shit out of here.

817
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,727
What did you say?

818
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,087
Eli! Come on!

819
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,929
- What?
- Stop it!

820
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,129
I said get that piece of shit
out of here and throw him in the trash.

821
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,680
Do you need
someone to translate that for you?

822
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,125
Stop! You're out of the Union!
You're out of the Union! You hear me?

823
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,726
You are out! Go! Get out!

824
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,208
<i>We have completely lost our way.</i>

825
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,163
<i>How can we condemn
police brutalities in the inner cities,</i>

826
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,720
<i>yet advocate violence
out here in the fields?</i>

827
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,690
How can we criticize the carnage
in Vietnam, yet cry for blood here at home?

828
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,088
This isn't about Vietnam,

829
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,206
this is about Delano,

830
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,168
this is about being a man,

831
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,082
this is about enough is enough!

832
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,844
No, no, no.

833
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,083
Those of you running around,
destroying things,

834
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,165
giving into your hatred

835
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,602
and your chicken shit macho ideals

836
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,001
are seriously sabotaging
the efforts of La Causa,

837
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,610
and I will not stand for it!

838
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,361
I failed you.

839
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,402
I failed you as a leader.

840
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,570
And I have something to tell you.

841
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,248
Three days ago I stopped eating.

842
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,362
I will continue to fast until everyone,

843
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,211
and I mean everyone,
in our beautiful movement

844
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,641
makes a pledge recommitting themselves

845
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,451
to nonviolence.

846
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,962
'Cause we move forward together,
or not at all.

847
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,929
So that's your big solution?
Starvin' yourself?

848
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,843
That helps them more than us!

849
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,921
Settle down.

850
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,241
Yes or no? Yes or no?

851
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,481
- Yes!
- No!

852
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,924
Settle down. Come on. Please sit down.
The meeting is not over.

853
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,761
You okay?

854
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,328
I had a bad dream.

855
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,248
Dreamin' about food again?

856
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,560
Mmm-mmm.

857
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,243
No. The ranch...

858
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,691
The horses were screaming.

859
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,042
Like, when the bulldozer came.

860
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,570
I couldn't move my legs

861
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,090
and everyone left me behind.

862
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,606
I haven't thought about that
bulldozer in years.

863
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,764
What I remember most

864
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,124
was that feeling,

865
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,600
that feeling of

866
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,361
impotence.

867
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,281
When that bulldozer knocked over the farm.

868
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,689
Dad couldn't look me in the eye.

869
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,045
That look on his face...

870
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,440
The shame behind his eyes...

871
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,085
It never left him.

872
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,961
It's the first time I saw the old man cry.

873
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,722
That's what I'm scared of, Rookie.

874
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,244
To go back and face my family,

875
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,601
after everything that
I've put them through,

876
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,971
and tell them that it
was all for nothing...

877
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,130
So this is how you face them?

878
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,281
Mansi, listen,

879
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,567
you know I've been with you.
Through thick and through thin.

880
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,682
But we need a leader not a martyr.

881
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,241
I need to understand what you're doing.

882
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,001
I've lost my way...

883
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,526
We all lost our way.

884
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,927
The violence, the anger...

885
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,525
I'm angry too!

886
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,684
I'm angry that I live in a world

887
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,962
where a man who picks your food
can't feed his family.

888
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,931
I used to think

889
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,011
the fight was with the growers.

890
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,689
It's with ourselves.

891
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,609
We need to stop acting like victims.

892
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,720
I'm not going to stop,

893
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,042
I'm going to see it all the way through.

894
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,560
Because if we lose...

895
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,722
I won't be able
to look at my family in the eye.

896
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,211
What if you die, Mansi?

897
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,163
Who are we going to look to then?

898
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,768
Get up there, it's a great shot.

899
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,491
<i>If you are
just arriving, please,</i>

900
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,409
<i>head to the registration table to check in</i>

901
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,727
<i>and sign our pledge of non-violence.</i>

902
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,206
Dear brothers and sisters.

903
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,851
As we prepare to celebrate
the mystery of Christ's love,

904
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,490
let us acknowledge our sins.

905
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,962
I confess to almighty God

906
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,045
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have sinned through my own fault

907
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,885
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and have failed to do.

908
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,645
Through my fault, through my fault
through my most grievous fault.

909
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,045
It's okay. It's okay, Cesar.

910
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,367
<i>There is no
strike in the vineyards.</i>

911
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,450
<i>Our workers have
sought to stay with us,</i>

912
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,047
<i>and continue work without any interest
in this outside organization.</i>

913
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,281
<i>They don't belong here</i>

914
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,727
<i>and I wish they would all go back
to where they came from.</i>

915
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,123
<i>The Chavez group are
seeking to force the growers</i>

916
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,568
<i>to recognize their group
as the bargaining agent.</i>

917
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,250
<i>And they've interfered
with our daily workers.</i>

918
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,402
<i>And the only contracts that
were signed between Mr. Chavez's union</i>

919
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,320
<i>and a few wineries that signed up
under the coercion of his threats...</i>

920
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,241
<i>What if something happens to us?</i>

921
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,321
<i>I'm standing up for my son!</i>

922
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,890
<i>What would happen to the kids?</i>

923
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,570
<i>Mr. Chavez!</i>

924
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,682
They've been coming in bigger numbers
ever since Chavez quit eating.

925
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,683
How long can a man go without food?

926
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,964
It depends on the man, John.

927
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,122
Everything depends on the man.

928
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,922
Maybe we let, uh, Chavez
starve himself to death,

929
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,282
then we won't have to do anything.

930
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,203
Unfortunately, I don't think
he is the suicidal type.

931
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,402
Ma! I'm gonna leave
some more stuff here.

932
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,482
Mostly clothes I don't wear anymore.

933
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,291
Mom, what's wrong?

934
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,802
Does he know what he's doing to you?

935
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,844
No. He doesn't.

936
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,441
Please go see your father before you leave.

937
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,330
How is he?

938
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,330
He's not good.

939
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,202
Thank you. My brother appreciates it.

940
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,442
- Hi.
- Hi Cruz, how're you doing?

941
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,490
I brought my cousins to sign the pledge,
they just crossed the border.

942
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,728
Well done, have them sign.

943
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,446
Look.

944
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,648
I brought Cesar some food.

945
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,884
Please tell him to eat something
and stop being stubborn.

946
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,328
- You wanna lie down?
- No.

947
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,920
Come on. I'll fix your pillow for you.

948
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,765
No, no. I'm okay.

949
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,570
I'm going to go home now.

950
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,890
Do you need anything?

951
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,326
Did Fernando come?

952
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,521
No.

953
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,127
And he took bread in his hands

954
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,726
blessed it

955
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,485
and gave it to his disciples and said

956
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,089
"Take this all of you, and eat it"

957
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,561
"this is my body
which will be given up for you."

958
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,041
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

959
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,806
Amen.

960
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,525
I come as an American citizen

961
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,041
to honor him for what he has done.

962
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,442
Not just for you, not just for the state.

963
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,564
But for all of the United
States of America.

964
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,967
I come here out of respect

965
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,044
for one of the heroic figures of our time,

966
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,563
Cesar Chavez!

967
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,647
<i>The consumer
has a tremendous interest</i>

968
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,326
<i>and, I think, should support the
farm worker and support the farmer.</i>

969
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,801
<i>And the farm workers are
in that field, in that ranch,</i>

970
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,530
<i>they're working, they're not on strike.</i>

971
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,686
<i>Meanwhile, Cesar Chavez has
organized his efforts to employ a new tactic,</i>

972
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,888
<i>one that would have a national effect.</i>

973
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,645
<i>One of the biggest facts is that</i>

974
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,566
<i>the American public won't stand
for injustice as long as they know.</i>

975
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:09,724
<i>And we are fighting for legitimate wages
in a legitimate way.</i>

976
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,202
<i>One of the biggest weapons
we have is the boycott.</i>

977
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,922
<i>Not only is it an economic weapon
but it's also a non-violent weapon.</i>

978
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,240
<i>Picket lines
have been put around...</i>

979
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,321
Prick.

980
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,368
<i>Supermarkets in 23 major cities.</i>

981
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,569
<i>Most supermarkets in the country
still stock grapes.</i>

982
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,883
<i>But a significant number of shoppers,
mostly housewives,</i>

983
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,166
<i>are not buying the grapes.</i>

984
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,322
<i>They are observing the boycott.</i>

985
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,291
<i>That's a report from Delano, California.
This is Charles Walker...</i>

986
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,811
We know that your organization supported
us in the picket lines in Pittsburgh,

987
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,927
and we were wondering if you could

988
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,844
organize another team of people again
this coming week.

989
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,684
What city are you in?

990
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,841
Montreal?

991
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,321
Wisconsin is next, okay?

992
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,686
Okay, I'll tell everyone.

993
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,560
Thank you, bye.

994
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,486
Last report estimates that we've cost them

995
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,321
$17 million to date!

996
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,327
I wish they'd paid that in fair wages.

997
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,801
What is your view
of the strike of the grape industry?

998
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,166
The grape boycott...

999
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,767
Well, I've classified that
in the past in a number of public occasions

1000
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,207
as immoral. I think it is.

1001
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,850
Get me John on the phone!

1002
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,921
Yes, sir.

1003
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,160
Did you see it?

1004
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,570
Man of the year!

1005
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,649
I thought they were going to make
him Pope.

1006
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,651
I know... It's all right.

1007
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,004
Well, let's get together on Sunday.

1008
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,567
I saw her last week.
She told me and I forgot.

1009
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,564
But she looks great. She looks great.

1010
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,687
Yes, she does.

1011
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,364
Gentlemen.

1012
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,761
Look,

1013
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,849
I say it's time for the families to
put their differences aside

1014
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,688
and speak together with one voice.

1015
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,081
I agree.

1016
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,329
Let's sit down with these bastards
and settle this thing once and for all.

1017
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,365
Jack, are you serious?

1018
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,807
You want to sit down with these characters?

1019
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,010
We can't hang on much longer.

1020
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,488
This boycott is bleeding us to death.

1021
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,090
If we sit down with them it won't
be a boycott, it will be an insurrection.

1022
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,731
We still gotta negotiate.

1023
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,521
We don't have to negotiate,
we have to dictate terms.

1024
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,481
Look,

1025
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,763
I hate dealing with these dirty foreigners,

1026
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,650
but we can't keep
putting on fake labels forever.

1027
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,449
I'm a dirty foreigner, Jack.

1028
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,327
You know what I mean.

1029
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,128
I'm not the only one who feels like this.

1030
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,530
You're not? Well, who else feels that way?

1031
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,011
Jack's got a point.

1032
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:25,162
It's time for us to cut our losses
and negotiate.

1033
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,728
You don't negotiate with children.

1034
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,282
You don't give children
every piece of candy in the store.

1035
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,722
With children, you set the rules
and you make sure they obey them.

1036
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,881
How you been?

1037
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,245
I'm good. I broke 70.

1038
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,761
You know, when the Chinese
came to America to build the rail roads,

1039
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,721
you know what
they demanded of their overseers?

1040
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,841
No.

1041
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,561
Food. Good food.

1042
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,725
And enough time to enjoy it.

1043
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,200
And if the owners skimped on that,
they wouldn't lift a finger.

1044
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,642
Give the Chinese a good meal every day

1045
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,881
and they could
build the infrastructure of a continent.

1046
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,164
Their meal is what gave
their lives dignity.

1047
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,922
And to them, dignity was
more important than money.

1048
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,008
That's nice, huh?

1049
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,451
You have this annoying habit
of turning everything into a lesson.

1050
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,130
I just like Chinese food.

1051
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,201
How you doing?

1052
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,564
I told you. I'm good.

1053
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,810
With golf?

1054
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,846
What's wrong with golf?

1055
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,368
You are becoming a real American.

1056
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,530
Golf is from Scotland.

1057
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,082
<i>We interrupt to bring
you this bulletin from Los Angeles.</i>

1058
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,528
<i>New York Senator Robert Kennedy
has been shot in the head,</i>

1059
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,171
<i>minutes ago as he left the platform</i>

1060
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,289
<i>from which he made his victory statement
in Los Angeles.</i>

1061
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,603
<i>The detailed report
which we did receive initially</i>

1062
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,725
<i>pictured Kennedy
on the floor of the hotel kitchen.</i>

1063
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,850
<i>Blood streaming from his face,
his eyes open but unseeing.</i>

1064
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,130
<i>He is on his way,
or perhaps has already arrived</i>

1065
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,487
<i>at an unnamed hospital in Los Angeles.</i>

1066
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,923
<i>The moment further word is received
we will pass it along to you immediately.</i>

1067
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,890
<i>The final act in the
stunning tragedy of Robert Francis Kennedy</i>

1068
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,962
<i>began this morning
with a touching ceremony</i>

1069
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,289
<i>in St. Patrick's Cathedral
here in New York City.</i>

1070
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,091
<i>The late senator was then
transported to his final resting place,</i>

1071
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,526
<i>near his brother the late President
at Arlington National Cemetery.</i>

1072
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,248
<i>I, Richard Milhous Nixon,
do solemnly swear...</i>

1073
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,247
Everyone, stop working for a minute.

1074
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,723
Come, join the strike.
Cesar Chavez wants to defend you!

1075
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:22,484
<i>That I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States...</i>

1076
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,521
<i>And will to the best of my ability...</i>

1077
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,327
<i>Preserve, protect and defend...</i>

1078
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,324
<i>The Constitution of the United States...</i>

1079
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,529
<i>So help me God.</i>

1080
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,888
Slow down!

1081
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,886
Slow down! Slow down!

1082
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,363
- Call an ambulance!
- Juan! Juan!

1083
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,404
Help! Help!

1084
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,486
<i>We thank you
for all that you are doing for us.</i>

1085
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,324
<i>We very much appreciate it.</i>

1086
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,201
Yes, sir.

1087
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,248
Well, you're someone
who understands business

1088
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,563
and you're a Californian,
we're all Californians here...

1089
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,411
Yes, sir.

1090
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,770
I'll do my best.

1091
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,207
And thank you, thank you so much.

1092
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,529
Take care, bye.

1093
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,001
Nixon has promised
to sell our grapes in Europe.

1094
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,531
And whatever's leftover

1095
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,888
he'll have the Department of Defense
buy and feed to our soldiers.

1096
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,091
<i>They're getting you
out in 5 days,</i>

1097
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,969
but I'm not sure about the others.

1098
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,451
It's all lies.

1099
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,450
They're saying we provoked them.

1100
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,808
That the strike is not legal, they are
painting us to look like criminals.

1101
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,243
And ever since they dumped the grapes
in Europe, their sales have gone up there.

1102
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,970
By 140%.

1103
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,169
We're not gonna survive Nixon.

1104
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,365
Then we have to go over there.

1105
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,646
To Europe?

1106
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,087
If they're running, we have to catch them.

1107
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,880
We can barely keep things together here,
Mansi.

1108
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,041
I know.

1109
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,160
I never thought
I'd be saying this in my life.

1110
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,089
To Richard Milhous Nixon!

1111
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,766
To Nixon!

1112
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,890
Focus on human law,
since it actually exists over in Europe.

1113
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,446
The growers have completely
subverted the system here,

1114
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,443
but Europe still defends workers' rights.

1115
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,960
I hear they
get one month vacations there.

1116
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,005
You might want to mention that

1117
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,924
Vietnam is basically awash
in Bogdanovich's grapes and napalm.

1118
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,729
I heard the food is terrible over there.

1119
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,849
I don't care how bad the food is,
you're not starting a fast, Cesar.

1120
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,001
Where is my coat?

1121
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,201
<i>Hey, Helen.</i>

1122
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,049
You should see this place.

1123
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,731
How are the kids?

1124
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,320
And Fernando?

1125
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,121
Okay.

1126
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,760
<i>I'll see you in a couple of days.</i>

1127
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,167
Fares please.

1128
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,487
Yes, sir.

1129
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,681
- Albert.
- 2p please.

1130
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,607
- Mr. Chavez?
- Yes.

1131
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,687
Lovely to meet you.

1132
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,086
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

1133
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,001
We're here with Cesar Chavez,
the civil rights activist,

1134
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,845
who has caused quite a stir in America
from his ongoing boycott

1135
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,970
<i>that has meant millions of Americans
have stopped eating table grapes.</i>

1136
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,166
Does that work for you, Mr. Chavez?

1137
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,441
Thank you.

1138
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,320
<i>We are making a plea
of common sense, to an industry</i>

1139
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,523
<i>that refuses to recognize
the basic human rights of its workers.</i>

1140
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,763
<i>Besides this boycott,
your movement has marched and striked</i>

1141
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,047
<i>and you yourself have done a 25 day fast.</i>

1142
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,321
<i>Why has it gone this far?</i>

1143
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,371
<i>Well, despite the success we had
against the growers in California,</i>

1144
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,122
<i>they still refuse
to sit down and negotiate with us.</i>

1145
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,201
And it's not
a question of economics anymore.

1146
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,970
<i>It's more a stubbornness.</i>

1147
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,407
<i>They want to show that
they're strong and not weak.</i>

1148
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,124
<i>So they would
rather export the grapes</i>

1149
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,725
<i>than sit down and negotiate with you?</i>

1150
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,805
They'd rather sell their grapes to London,
or Stockholm

1151
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,083
and think that that will erase all
the indignities that people have suffered.

1152
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,400
<i>And what kind of support have you
received here in Great Britain?</i>

1153
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,769
Here in Britain, we have the Transport and
General Workers Union support,

1154
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,042
<i>and they have endorsed our boycott.</i>

1155
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,722
<i>The dock loaders refuse to unload grapes.</i>

1156
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,121
What are you saying to me now?

1157
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,089
Wait a minute! We had a deal!

1158
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,567
Which is a great endorsement
of our boycott.

1159
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,725
<i>We're optimistic to have
similar support from other countries.</i>

1160
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,044
<i>Diverse religious groups throughout the
continent have shown their support.</i>

1161
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,329
<i>Even the Pope has agreed to meet us.</i>

1162
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,880
I've got them grapes
halfway through the Atlantic.

1163
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,201
Hello?

1164
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,244
So, what are you hoping to achieve?

1165
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,411
<i>Well, it's never been
about the grapes.</i>

1166
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,841
<i>It's always been about the people.</i>

1167
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,566
<i>The poorest of the poor, the marginalized.</i>

1168
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,246
<i>The ones who have been ignored.</i>

1169
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,566
<i>There would be no food on the table
without these people.</i>

1170
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:04,287
<i>And these people have
names, faces, families.</i>

1171
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,762
<i>And I guess what we want to accomplish
is to give these people a voice.</i>

1172
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,569
<i>But will this be enough,
considering the amount of resistance?</i>

1173
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,448
Once social change begins,

1174
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,005
it can't be reversed.

1175
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,126
<i>You can't uneducate someone
who has learned how to read.</i>

1176
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,963
<i>You can't humiliate someone
who has pride.</i>

1177
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:46,768
You can't oppress someone
who is not afraid anymore.

1178
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,768
We have seen the future
and the future is ours.

1179
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,321
Ready?

1180
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,201
Don't answer it!

1181
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,447
I'm right here.

1182
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,288
Don't take 3 hours.
I have to drop this off.

1183
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,407
What's wrong?

1184
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,247
They want to sign.

1185
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,961
Who?

1186
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,802
All of them. All the growers want to sign.

1187
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,602
It's an interesting day
you choose to be late.

1188
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,849
Come on, they are waiting inside.

1189
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,841
You have to admit,
this old Croat put up a hell of a fight.

1190
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,161
Yeah, I can do that, as long as you can
admit this little Mexican kicked your ass.

1191
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,320
<i>Brothers and sisters of the fields,</i>

1192
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:07,171
<i>all around us were those
who said it could never be done.</i>

1193
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,367
<i>People said that
the growers were too powerful,</i>

1194
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,644
<i>the police would be against us...</i>

1195
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,209
And the courts would beat us down,

1196
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,520
and that sooner or later

1197
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,564
we would fall back into the poverty
and despair of our forefathers.

1198
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,526
But we didn't!

1199
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,681
We didn't

1200
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,925
because our common suffering

1201
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,207
and love for each other kept us together.

1202
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,370
5 years we were on strike!

1203
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,163
It kept us sacrificing and fighting
for a better tomorrow,

1204
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,243
a better tomorrow that we all dream about

1205
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,202
as we work among these beautiful vines.

1206
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,889
And when millions and millions of
Americans stopped doing one thing,

1207
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:00,926
eating grapes,

1208
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,530
we won the strike!

1209
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,281
We won!

1210
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,810
Yes, we can!

1211
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,450
<i>I know there is no way
to justify the things that I've done...</i>

1212
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,929
<i>Or that I've not done for you.</i>

1213
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,649
<i>It saddens me to think that</i>

1214
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,281
<i>we never got a chance
to go fishing together</i>

1215
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,844
<i>or catch a baseball game</i>

1216
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,124
<i>or even go watch a movie.</i>

1217
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,088
<i>There's no way to turn back the clock</i>

1218
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,131
<i>and to make up for lost time.</i>

1219
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,601
<i>But I want you to know that</i>

1220
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,927
<i>your mother and I
miss you very much, Fernando.</i>

1221
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,649
<i>It seems so ironic to think that,</i>

1222
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,128
<i>because I've tried to do things that
my father could never do for us,</i>

1223
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,810
<i>I'm now so distant from you.</i>

1224
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,490
<i>Please know that
the day you came into this world</i>

1225
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,206
<i>was also the day that I
received the clarity</i>

1226
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,729
<i>that I so desperately needed.</i>

1227
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,449
<i>You and your brothers and sisters</i>

1228
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,889
<i>are the purpose for my struggle.</i>

1229
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,330
<i>Everything I do is for you.</i>

1230
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,363
<i>And I hope you remember that.</i>

1231
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,160
<i>I also hope that one day</i>

1232
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,566
<i>you can be as proud of me as I am of you.</i>

1233
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,728
<i>But I want
more than anything else,</i>

1234
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,245
<i>I would like to see the poor</i>

1235
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,251
<i>take a very direct part in shaping society.</i>

1236
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,930
<i>And let them make the decisions.</i>

1237
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:56,247
<i>And in our case, if the poor are not
involved, then change will never come.</i>
