                     THEN WHAT?

421
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,460
RIGHT, UM, I CALLED OUT,
NO ONE ANSWERED.

422
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,190
I CALLED OUT AGAIN,

423
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,830
AND THEN I WALKED THIS WAY,

424
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,400
AND I FOUND HER THERE.

425
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,440
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED?

426
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,970
             WELL... IT APPEARS

                     SOMETIME
             AROUND 2:00 A.M.,

428
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,210
 SHE WENT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS,

429
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,450
         AND TRIPPED
 OR LOST HER BALANCE SOMEHOW

430
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,620
         AND FELL.

431
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,290
YOU'RE SAYING ACCIDENT.

                 PRETTY SURE.

    NO SIGN OF A STRUGGLE,

434
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,730
         THE HOUSE
    HASN'T BEEN ROBBED...

435
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,090
        WAIT A SECOND.

436
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,260
 I WAS HERE JUST LAST WEEK
     FOR A GARAGE SALE.

437
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,030
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE WAS
 A BREAK-IN, JUST LIKE--

438
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,970
             HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

439
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,770
     I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
     SOMETHING UPSTAIRS.

440
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,110
     YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

441
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,080
     YEAH.

442
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,160
YOU SEE ANYTHING
UNUSUAL?

443
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,330
     NO, IT ALL LOOKS
     PERFECTLY NORMAL.

444
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,260
NOW, IF THERE
WAS A BURGLARY,

445
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,900
THIS PLACE WOULD
LOOK LIKE A TORNADO.

446
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,970
         NOT IF SHE SURPRISED
             THEM IN THE ACT.

447
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,910
OKAY, LOOK AT THIS.

448
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,340
 IF THIS WAS A HOME INVASION,

449
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,840
         THESE WOULD BE GONE,
             AT THE VERY LEAST.

450
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,350
     THERE'S NO BURGLARY HERE,

451
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,250
 AND THE FACT THAT SHE HAD
 A GARAGE SALE LAST WEEKEND

452
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,480
             IS A COINCIDENCE.

     I SEE YOUR POINT.

454

         SHE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB.
     SHE DIDN'T NEED TO WORK.

         A FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

SO WHY WOULD THEY HAVE
A GARAGE SALE?

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,900
         IT'S FUNNY,
 I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION.

 SHE WANTED TO REDECORATE.

     MOVE OLD STUFF OUT

        NEW STUFF IN.

         I APPRECIATE
        THIS SO MUCH.

1121
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,390
                     IT'S JUST,
                 IT'S SOMETHING

1122
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,430
     THAT I'D REALLY
        RATHER NOT DO.

1123
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,530
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

1124
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,600
         THE CEREMONY TOMORROW

1125
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,830
                    WILL BE FOR
         IMMEDIATE FAMILY ONLY.

1126
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:46,960
OF COURSE.

1127
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,470
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE
         OF THE FACT

1128
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,570
     THAT THE HOUSE WAS
         BROKEN INTO.

1129
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,070
I THINK IT WAS JUST
BAD TIMING ON THEIR PART,

1130
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,270
THAT'S ALL.

1131
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,780
     YEAH, THE DETECTIVE
     SEEMED PRETTY SURE,

1132
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,710
     AND IT MAKES SENSE.

1133
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,880
 WHY BREAK IN, ATTACK SOMEONE,

1134
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,080
         AND THEN NOT
     CLEAN THE PLACE OUT?

1135
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,150
         I AGREE.

1136
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,650
                I'VE GOT TO GET
             OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

1137
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,020
         ARE YOU OKAY INSIDE?

1138
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,050
OH, YES, I'LL BE FINE.

 ANY TIME THIS AFTERNOON.

1143
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:17,600
 FOR THE DRESS, DID YOU HAVE
     SOMETHING IN MIND?

1144
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,800
             OH.

 THERE WAS A NAVY BLUE DRESS

1147
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,750
        THAT SHE LIKED.

1148
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,950
         IT WAS SILK.

1149
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,050
     AND ANYTHING ELSE

1150

    MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE.

                YOU KNOW, I CAN
             STAY IF YOU WANT.

1152
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,360
     NO. NO, YOU GO ON.
        I'LL BE OKAY.

1153
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,700
     JUST CLOSE THE DOOR
 WHEN YOU LEAVE, IT'S LOCKED.

1154
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,600
             YEAH.

OH, AND...

1156
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,270
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY

1157
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,870
 TO KNOW THAT THOSE PURSES

1158
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,340
    WERE GOING TO BENEFIT
         HER CHARITY.

1159
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,810
THEY'RE IN THE WALK-IN CLOSET
 ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE.

     I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

1202
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,640
I HAD THE WEIRDEST
DAY TODAY.

1203
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,680
FIRST I WENT
TO A PAWN SHOP

1204
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,040
WITH DETECTIVE IVERSON,

1205
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,210
WHO, BY THE WAY,
WANTS TO ASK HANNAH OUT.

1206
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,050
             I WISH HIM LUCK.

1207
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,620
AND THEN WE WENT TO
INTERROGATE THE THIEVES.

1208
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,150
 YOU INTERROGATED THE THIEVES?

1209
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:14,320
I WATCHED.

1210
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,920
        THE GUYS LIED.

1211
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,590
     THE GIRL ADMITTED
     TO BREAKING IN,

1212
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,420
BUT SAID KATE
WAS ALREADY DEAD.

1213
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:22,960
     I NEED YOUR HELP
     TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

1215
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,930

00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,200
         BOTH. PLEASE?

1217
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,270
I DROPPED ONE OF HER EARRINGS,

1218
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,570
     AND I KNEELED DOWN
        TO PICK IT UP,

1219
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,310
 AND I SEE, UNDER THE BED,
     AN ACRYLIC NAIL TIP.

1220
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,380
I'M NO EXPERT
ON NAILS,

1221
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,080
BUT THEY DO
BREAK OFF, RIGHT?

1222
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,380
                 YEAH, THEY DO,

1223
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,420
     BUT KATE TOLD ME
SHE WAS HAVING HER NAILS DONE

1224
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,080
    THE DAY BEFORE WE WERE
 SUPPOSED TO HAVE LUNCH,

1225
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,490
     AND WHEN I SAW HER
     AT THE FUNERAL HOME,

1226
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,850
     HER NAIL WAS BROKEN.

1227
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,790
     I'M NOT GETTING
 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS.

1228
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,660
         IT'S JUST...

1229
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,430
 IT'S JUST LITTLE THINGS
 ADDING UP TO SOMETHING.

1230
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,000
             OKAY.

1231
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,400
                 I WENT TO HER
                    JEWELRY BOX

1232
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,570
                TO GET A STRING
                     OF PEARLS.

1233
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,370
 I SEE ONE OF HER BRACELETS,
     DIAMONDS, BEAUTIFUL.

1234
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,340
 BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

1235
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,970
SO I HOLD IT UP TO THE WINDOW.
        IT'S NOT REAL.

1236
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,340
    HONEY, I'M STILL LOST.
 SO SHE HAD A FAKE BRACELET.

1237
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,580
     WELL, THE PEARLS
     WERE A FAKE, TOO.

1238
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,610

    HAS ME FREAKED OUT...

1239
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,350
 IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS
     A LITTLE DRIED BLOOD

1240
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,390
     ON THE BED FRAME.

00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,600
     YES, BUT WE NOW KNOW

00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,930
 THAT THERE WAS A BREAK-IN
 THE NIGHT THAT SHE DIED.

        FAKE ANYTHING.

1251
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,410
 SHE WAS PROUD OF HER HOME,
         THEIR CARS,

1252
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:47,140
        HER LIFESTYLE.

1253

         IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1682
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,040
                     I THOUGHT

01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,240
     YOU WERE GOING TO
     LEAVE THIS ALONE.

TO TRY TO GET MY GROOVE BACK...

1688
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,650
    AND THEN I HAD AN IDEA.

1689
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,450
 AND I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

1690
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:06,790
    BECAUSE I PROMISED YOU
         I WAS DONE.

1691
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:09,230
 WELL, THE BAD GUY WOULD HAVE
     GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT

1692
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,130
        IF NOT FOR YOU.

WELL, THIS WAS
A GENIUS IDEA.

1704
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,670
ALL THE STUFF WE BOUGHT
AT A THOUSAND GARAGE SALES,

1705
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:54,470
WE TURN AROUND, SELL IT,

01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:56,510
AND THEN GIVE AWAY
THE MONEY.

        -THERE YOU GO.

1715
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:09,920
WHY DIDN'T I
THINK OF THAT?

1716
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,320
         -HEY, ADAM.
         -MM-HM?

1719
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,000
IT'S AN ANTIQUE BADGE.

1720
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,440
             NICE.

1721
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,790
         VERY NICE.

1722
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:46,720
         THAT'S FOR
 WATCHING OUT FOR MY MOM.

1723
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,360
                    I DIDN'T DO
             A VERY GOOD JOB.

1724
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,500
     WELL, WITH HER,
    ALL WE CAN DO IS TRY.

         HEY, MOM!

1726
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,740
 I FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING

1727
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,970
         INSIDE THIS WOODEN BOX

1728
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:02,870
         FILLED WITH THESE OLD
            METAL TOY SOLDIERS.

1729
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,680
                     IS THIS TO
            A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX?

1730
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,710
    MAYBE WITH CASH INSIDE?

1731
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:12,880
            OH, NO.

1732
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,380
                 THIS KEY HAS
                A NUMBER ON IT.

1733
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:19,760
