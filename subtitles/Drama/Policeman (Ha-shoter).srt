2
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,525
Your power to tell the future
is the question..

3
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:51,378
Answer you already know.
Why, I called you here

4
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:53,068
So, tell me Prophet!

5
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,021
In this... we have any
any reason to fear

6
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,764
The skills my Lord Conquer
on the battle field

7
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,114
are exceeding those of any other

8
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,495
opponents in the world, now.

9
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:05,201
Your mastery of Martial Arts
promises a clear victory

10
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:08,322
and no Name in the south nor...
Sword Saint in the north

11
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:15,092
Your studies are just like
my Jester, over there

12
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,082
Oh Master! I didn't tell him
what to say

13
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:20,973
If he is correct,

14
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,505
if we fight with Sword Saint
and we defeat it

15
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:29,269
it is possible to match with...
and rule the world.

16
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,270
I have to tell you,
there may be complications here.

17
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:38,144
I think, you may have to wait
almost for ten years...

18
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:39,996
to fight with Sword Saint.

19
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,613
Why do you say that?

20
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:47,127
I sense the time is all wrong

21
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,824
My Lord, I have a gift for you

22
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:54,793
What is it?

23
00:03:56,526 --> 00:04:00,018
A prophesy!
"When the Wind and Cloud combine,

24
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,621
the Fish with Golden Scales
becomes a Dragon"

25
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,112
I give you
these two birth charts

26
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:16,284
they are for the two disciples
your attention is required

27
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:19,369
One is named Wind

28
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,122
and the other one is named Cloud

29
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,180
Why, Wind and Cloud?

30
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,724
The wind is a beam without
form, light and frame

31
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:36,589
The cloud is forming motion
constantly changing

32
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,534
Cloud...unpredictable.

33
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:43,127
These three is for me the essence of 108...

34
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,357
the circumstances, how you will find them?

35
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,511
that depends entirely on your fate

36
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:54,262
What is the Curse,
when I locate them?

37
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,846
It is written that
You will be invincible

38
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:59,446
for the first half of your life

39
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,411
The second half!
What about that?

40
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,713
You must deal with
Wind and Cloud first half.

41
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,226
Jester!

42
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:14,707
Yes, my Lord!

43
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:16,195
What do you desire?

44
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:22,082
Use Heaven and Earth,
You must...

45
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:26,683
I must find Wind and Cloud

46
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,846
Right!

47
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:37,138
Be hold! My Lord!
This is a great treasure from Persia.

48
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,023
it is very old order packed

49
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,196
called, the Ying Yang Magic Box

50
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:46,824
and on the box, there are 108 Celestial Stems
and Terrestrial Branches

51
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:49,402
My Lord is so intelligent,

52
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,889
He will master...

53
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,053
if you can identify
the correct combination of elements

54
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:56,701
and arrange them in proper order

55
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:57,873
the box will open

56
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:01,079
and it will reveal its secrets to us.

57
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,572
That My Lord!
then I can interpret

58
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,816
the direction of
the second half of your life;

59
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,276
Once this is done

60
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,229
I will be able to give you
more complete explanation

61
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:13,195
of your destiny.

62
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,635
A warning before you begin

63
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:20,133
... You must not attempt to use
force to open this box

64
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:22,615
If you do...
results, disappear.

65
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,145
The box could explode
on your face

66
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:26,988
Your hands will be lost

67
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:31,518
Good!

68
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:35,828
I should have no difficulty
in opening this box

69
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:49,999
Get Back!

70
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,385
Out of my way!
"By order of Lord Conquer...

71
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:55,449
... any children who match with the
birth charts we have just posted

72
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:58,160
must come this side
of the Clan immediately"

73
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:06,033
Father!

74
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,233
Wind!

75
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,753
... of any help to you

76
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:11,539
No! Hurry!

77
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,076
Father!

78
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:46,469
Over the last three years

79
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,324
we have been growing
and gaining prominence

80
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,529
We become a
powerful Clad in the world.

81
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,864
Further to strengthen us

82
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,835
today I am naming my heirs.

83
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,735
Therefore, I accept
my closest disciple

84
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:04,767
Frost! Cloud!

85
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,967
and Wind

86
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:12,290
With the Wind blows, the Cloud forms
and the Frost serving our force.

87
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,853
We will be an invincible force.

88
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,046
"Unable to meet in battle

89
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:53,832
Duel to death in ten years. Sword Saint"

90
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:55,447
Exactly, as predicted.

91
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:58,466
Mud Buddha!
You are a true prophet.

92
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,069
Why you are not attacking
with the full force?

93
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:49,744
Young Master's body is
invaluable or not?

94
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,694
You fool!
If I cannot handle your attacks,

95
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,109
then I deserve to die

96
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:00,683
Master Cloud!

97
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:02,493
His Lordship wants to see you.

98
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:04,628
you and Master Wind.

99
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,819
Collect the cultured stones
and bring them to Charity.

100
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:13,967
Yes, Master!

101
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:30,609
This is the place

102
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,116
Charity, we are not allowed
to every where

103
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:35,499
Its forbidden.

104
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:37,875
Frost!..to outsiders, Yes

105
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:40,635
but to the daughter of Conqueror
one should not create...

106
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:42,940
It is the Sword Grave,
we will keep our weapons

107
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,684
It may not be forbidden,
but, it is pretty dangerous

108
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,117
That's why my reason
having you alone

109
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,166
I'll go in myself, cowards

110
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,606
You go with Wind!

111
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:57,115
I will keep watch for you.

112
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:58,966
You, sweet heart Frost!

113
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:00,403
Let's go

114
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:02,091
Any trouble

115
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:11,367
Look! Magic fire!

116
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:14,771
These are just fire flies
and nothing more.

117
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:17,480
I want to catch up here

118
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,265
Guards! Someone's coming.

119
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:26,439
Come on! Let's go

120
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:06,871
What you see here
is the prophesy given by Mud Buddha.

121
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,530
As soon as I am able to retrieve
the final words from the Magic Box

122
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,521
I would be able to determine

123
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:18,570
what fate holds for the second half of my life.

124
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,745
But, unfortunately, for me

125
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:24,706
the retrieval process
is taking longer than I thought it would

126
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,079
For the past ten years
I have been unable to discover

127
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,942
the right combination and
for that sake Theorian Mud Buddha

128
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,874
has completely disappeared

129
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:39,831
Frost! Wind!
I have been patient for these many tears

130
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:42,629
but, I can wait no longer
I want to go out

131
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:45,428
find Mud Buddha for me
and bring him back here

132
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,191
His choice is simple

133
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:52,199
Now, if you want to find Mud Buddha,
one must first seek the Fire Monkey"

134
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:54,345
It should help in your search

135
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:55,852
Aren't you coming with us to help

136
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:59,326
No, I am only a..action

137
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,763
Once I step outside these gates

138
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:02,625
I'll be doomed.
I am Very fragile, you know!

139
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:05,154
I am quite delicate,
I can't take any kind of hardships

140
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:06,748
Jester!
My Lord!

141
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,822
Wind, your martial arts
techniques are good.

142
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,464
But you lack
battle experience.

143
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,686
So, I am putting
Frost in charge of this trip

144
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:18,494
I want you to obey him.

145
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:19,811
As you wish..

146
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:21,078
and Cloud!

147
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:24,405
I have an important
mission for you

148
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:27,157
At your service.

149
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,834
Lord Fong in Unchallenged City says

150
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:34,452
his wish to become our ally

151
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,152
I agreed on condition

152
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:41,568
that is, his Unchallenged Sword
is to be handed over to prove he is sincere

153
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:45,056
I want you to meet Lord Fong
on his birthday

154
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,981
I would come back
with the Sword, Master!

155
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,234
I want more than that...

156
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,959
I want you bring
Lord Fong's head back with you

157
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:02,636
You do this for me.

158
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:04,900
I will.

159
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,863
Hawk and Bat go along
to support you

160
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,889
Your skill is already at 7o%

161
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:20,023
You will succeed
with their help

162
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:23,841
Wait, Father, I would like
to go as well

163
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,087
What’s come over you, Charity?

164
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:27,889
You want to be Viol?

165
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,450
me. No, It has nothing on me, Father.

166
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:36,346
Alright!

167
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:41,456
Well, whom do you go
with Wind or Cloud?

168
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,941
You are going to kill,
I can't help

169
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,161
Wind, I'll go with you

170
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,569
We're not going
to the place of game

171
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:54,924
I know that,
We can help out the weak

172
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:56,148
I know that
we...

173
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,511
.. you are mistaken...

174
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,771
Jester, let them be out.

175
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:07,393
It’s all settled, then.
You will leave tomorrow.

176
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:08,629
We obey.

177
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,136
Charity, stay with me
for a moment

178
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:12,939
Yes sir!

179
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:20,108
Cloud!

180
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,955
Have you been to the forbidden
cave with Charity?

181
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,383
Yes, please don't tell the Master.

182
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,307
... Better to leave, these soldiers
have spoiled our fight.

183
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:27,672
Surround him!

184
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:33,487
I don't want to harm you

185
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:36,657
I respect your position
as a monk

186
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:38,621
Give me the Fire Monkey!

187
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,231
That’s not possible

188
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,561
The Fire Monkey belongs to Shaolin Temple

189
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:44,982
It was stolen
I am returning it.

190
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:47,590
You refused
Penalty is be taken

191
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,160
I am Whispering Wind
Sorry to intrude you

192
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:15,888
Aah, They are going to have a fight
We, then leave

193
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,708
Wait old man!
Hope, you are in such a hurry to go

194
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,404
Who knows?
We have to find out there

195
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,566
It will be dangerous to stay here

196
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,210
Who dares in
my business?

197
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:28,756
I am introducing
I thought you surely would recognize

198
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:33,889
the Master Wind and Master Frost
the Masters of Conquer's Clan...

199
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:43,870
He refused to give The Fiery
The Monk is right!

200
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:46,848
We are still one family
Why fight each other?

201
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,803
Help us in our mission, cousins!

202
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,460
Don't be presumptuous?

203
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:54,499
You seem to be lacking an honour

204
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,519
Look at this, You sent your battalion
to fight one man

205
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,963
You mean,
we don't have to fight...

206
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,762
He is right,
we should not have a fight.

207
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:20,332
I use to have my powers...

208
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:22,669
... Buddha!

209
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:29,698
Your Holiness, this is my first quest

210
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,027
Lend me the Fire Monkey

211
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:35,026
I swear I will return it
I will be back to you within one month

212
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:37,130
I said it belongs to
the Shaolin Temple...

213
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:39,166
If you steal it,

214
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:41,704
you will be the same as these people

215
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:46,950
Without Fire Monkey,
we won't find Mud Buddha

216
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,410
I would fail My Lord.

217
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,065
Sorry, I can't help you.

218
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:53,644
You have no respect for me at all!

219
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,082
You are right!

220
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:58,748
Shut up!

221
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,915
Oh Monk! Get us ahead
We need that Fire Monkey

222
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:07,769
It’s not my integere.

223
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,766
Sorry Holiness!...

224
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:37,020
Insult me as you want

225
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:39,418
Now that I have Fire Monkey. Hah!

226
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:43,306
Wind!

227
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:47,278
Forget him

228
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:48,109
Why?

229
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:49,945
We only needed it
to find Mud Buddha

230
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,890
Since..., he already is here

231
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,389
we don't need that
Fire Monkey.

232
00:22:57,305 --> 00:23:00,028
We can drop disguise now.

233
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,635
How did you recognise me, Frost!

234
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:07,069
You have got a reputation as one,
you can change your appearance

235
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:09,676
I saw her telling
why you were in the midst of heavy fighting

236
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:10,890
Now, that was my clue...

237
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,630
and when the innocent girl

238
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,578
cried out, so that
she was worried about the monkey,

239
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,739
Convince me.

240
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:23,872
Grand Father, where are
the soldiers are taking Fiery?

241
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:29,053
Don't worry, they are not to hurt him
I promise!

242
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:35,639
I revealed too many secrets
about the future

243
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:41,260
and I was punished for it.
I have the boils all over my body now.

244
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,579
Only this animal, Fire Monkey
can suck out the poison

245
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,418
and can ease my pain

246
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:53,710
I beg you, Masters
Please bring it back to me

247
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:56,602
I will promise you
We both do our best

248
00:23:58,134 --> 00:23:59,564
That's a great comfort.

249
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:02,535
I am ready to go

250
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:05,259
Your Master must be anxious to see me

251
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,142
Up to you!

252
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:31,024
Who is that?

253
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:34,796
Forgive my intrusion.

254
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,749
Oh! You must have been sent
by Lord Conquer, Correct?

255
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:43,629
He asked me to bring
the proof of your...

256
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:19,651
Please don't kill me!

257
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:30,412
How did this happen?

258
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:39,191
Father!

259
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:41,715
What good is Mud Buddha?

260
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:42,801
What good are you?

261
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,453
Fire Monkey is innocent. Don't punish it

262
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,465
Please
Your Holiness, please

263
00:25:56,738 --> 00:25:58,331
I beg for your guidance..

264
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,537
Help me to bring the murderer
and justice

265
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,785
All this happened in a single night
It’s obvious

266
00:26:05,803 --> 00:26:07,473
Only Conquer can do this

267
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:11,031
Ah,...Buddha!

268
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:17,841
Wind!

269
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:19,694
What is in your mind?

270
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:26,135
Here is the cave.
My father died there

271
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:27,764
Master rescued me

272
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:29,928
According to myth...

273
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:32,677
The Cave is
with Blood Bodhi fruits

274
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:36,163
They heal the people
and increase the powers

275
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,522
No one has ever been
able to go in there...

276
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:41,444
and come out alive.

277
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,009
They say a Fire Beast guards the fruit

278
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:49,083
Master Wind!

279
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:53,115
do you know much about
your father?

280
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:56,832
Are you knowing that too?

281
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:05,749
Ofcourse!
Southern Unicorn as well

282
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:07,858
Authorities killed them.

283
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:12,509
I request
a favour from you

284
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,649
This little girl

285
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:18,551
according to Pigtails
she lost her parents

286
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:21,635
I'm the only family
she has now

287
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:24,156
and we must find someone
to take her in.

288
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,324
Do you expecting
something bad?

289
00:27:27,524 --> 00:27:28,367
What happened to you?

290
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:34,082
When Mud Buddha travels
across the river,

291
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:36,520
he is in great peril.

292
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:32,050
Grandpa! come back,
Grandpa!

293
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:03,740
"The Dragon is powerful
but will be stranded

294
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,002
when Wind and Cloud become a storm"

295
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:12,676
Buddha, you have disappeared

296
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:15,260
you left me with this piece of junk

297
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,705
Now that the puzzle is revealed

298
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:24,418
... promise you made
at that time

299
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:26,429
Tell me, What the prophesy means?

300
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:32,338
"Wind and Cloud will make you,
and break you as well"

301
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:37,216
That means, terrible.

302
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:40,492
You can't escape your fate.

303
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,732
My Lord's ten years of good fortune
has passed

304
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,305
you reached the turning
point of your life

305
00:29:48,505 --> 00:29:51,415
your destiny,
future will tell us.

306
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:59,302
"Wind and Cloud will make me,
and break me"

307
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:04,197
Obviously, it means that my life is now
controlled by wind and cloud

308
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:07,402
But does any wind and cloud...

309
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:13,712
or is it Striding Cloud
and Whispering Wind?

310
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:21,260
My Lord! It is written
The Master will be crushed by slaves.

311
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,949
This is destiny. Mortals cannot fight it

312
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,553
Destiny?

313
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:37,567
Don't talk to me about destiny
I don't believe in destiny or fate

314
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:42,433
When destiny favored him
My Lord accepted it

315
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,827
Suddenly, he doesn't believe in...My Lord

316
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:54,103
Someone has to say
if... wants to escape,..God now

317
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:56,788
even you,
Lord Conquer!

318
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:02,347
We set our own fate!

319
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:06,106
I will force my destiny
straight at my will

320
00:31:07,587 --> 00:31:10,860
and when I want
I will change my fate!

321
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:19,917
Four famous weapons
of the martial arts world...

322
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:22,716
One blade. Three swords
All priceless

323
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,719
But one blade
the most precious of all

324
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,839
is buried in Cirrus Cave.

325
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:32,420
The Ultimate Sword, which
has never been found

326
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,537
Fire Unicorn Sword
and the Unchallenged Sword

327
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:39,912
these are both mine.
And I am pleased

328
00:32:40,012 --> 00:32:42,537
These stand as testimonials
to my power.

329
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:50,651
Cloud, you didn't disappoint me

330
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:53,366
You taught me well

331
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:55,112
That's Good!

332
00:32:58,585 --> 00:32:59,298
Father!

333
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:04,677
Charity!
You behave yourself modest

334
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,643
Sorry!
Someone said Cloud is here.

335
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,755
I wanted to come
and welcome back.

336
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,376
I appreciate!

337
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:13,336
It wasn't just for you?

338
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:16,280
I want to see whether
you are going to honour your word

339
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,719
Well,
Did you bring them?

340
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:20,895
Charity!
What is it Cloud owes you?

341
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:25,235
Father,
your passion is to collect famous swords

342
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:28,385
well, I am collecting
on my passionate colorful stones

343
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:31,284
Master Cloud owes me 19
for my collection

344
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:39,536
..stupid!

345
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:42,338
My Lord! My Lord!

346
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,991
Masters Frost and Wind have returned
from mission

347
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,160
Where are they? Jester!

348
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,539
Outside, but they are
too afraid to come in

349
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:01,783
Get up!

350
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:07,917
Don't be ashamed.
You lost Mud Buddha due to inexperience

351
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:09,329
You did your best

352
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,840
Thank you,
Thank you, My Lord!

353
00:34:11,888 --> 00:34:14,631
But your brother
Cloud succeeded in his mission

354
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:17,551
He was able to
bring back the Unchallenged Sword

355
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:19,925
I'm going back to my chambers

356
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:31,957
Cloud's mood is
like a wild horse...unpredictable

357
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:34,654
It's been ten years,

358
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:36,944
with Fong's death...

359
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:38,938
I'll soon hear from Sword Saint

360
00:34:39,138 --> 00:34:41,847
He wanted our intervention
over killing his brother

361
00:34:42,953 --> 00:34:45,651
I must finish for..
long away this duel

362
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:46,798
I have to increase

363
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:48,099
my Trinity Strength

364
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:52,542
But, first
Come

365
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,675
Before I go into seclusion,

366
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:04,670
I fear
I must settle something

367
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:08,122
You Wind among my three disciples,
are purest

368
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,115
and so, it is my wish
you marry Charity.

369
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,173
I will arrange for a suitable date

370
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:21,689
Charity, I take it you do like Wind?
Don't you?

371
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,941
I couldn't say

372
00:35:27,837 --> 00:35:28,510
See to her

373
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,864
Can we talk about
this marriage later?

374
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:39,554
No,
Your father and I promised

375
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,974
to each other one
both just.. have more children

376
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,605
I didn't tell you earlier

377
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:47,439
because it wasn't the right time

378
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:50,512
I want You and Charity
grow up together

379
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:54,727
I have never seen
who perfectly suit each other

380
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:56,370
I think you make a wonderful couple

381
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,663
and should you do not consent
I will be disappointed

382
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,731
Congratulations, Wind

383
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:14,846
Skinny, Girlie, I have a problem...

384
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:16,630
I am really thorned

385
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:23,284
That..
I do like Wind...

386
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:28,254
and I also like Cloud

387
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:51,382
Charity, it's Wind

388
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:52,046
Are you busy?

389
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,033
Hi!

390
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,524
I think we should talk

391
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:08,698
Come in

392
00:37:08,798 --> 00:37:11,674
This is not Sword Grave
You won't be punished

393
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:15,253
It won't take long

394
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:16,144
Talk

395
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:20,522
I felt very scared
when your father brought me here,

396
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:23,469
you gave me a cup of tea

397
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:27,117
You helped me feel
I had a home here

398
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,832
Father told me he hadn't rescued you,

399
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,974
you would've snatched by wolves

400
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:34,484
He was right!

401
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,776
Anyway, when he mentioned
marriage today,

402
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:40,490
I was very happy

403
00:37:41,502 --> 00:37:44,892
But I must realize love must
come from both sides

404
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:48,429
I don't know whether
merely it is your father's idea

405
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:51,141
I hope, it was you want?

406
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:01,131
But if this is not,
I won't force you

407
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,792
she approved the marriage?

408
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:39,364
That’s in-consequential question?

409
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:43,677
As a father, I make the decision
She has to accept it

410
00:38:45,384 --> 00:38:46,276
You are angry?

411
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:50,683
The expression in your eyes is the same as
when I took you in ten years ago

412
00:38:54,158 --> 00:38:55,504
If you're unhappy about this

413
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,952
you may be excused from attending
the wedding banquet

414
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:27,697
I am Doctor Yu from Lake region

415
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:30,086
I want to present
sixteen towns

416
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,301
I want to give it to master.

417
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:32,639
Your invitation?...

418
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:35,633
Oh! you mean
some kind of celebration

419
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:38,731
How is this? wonderful, What a function exiting!
I have never been to a banquet!

420
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:43,582
Can you tell me
it’s a baby or a marriage celebration

421
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:49,080
Yah,Look at the crowd!
I think here one more

422
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:51,856
or one less wouldn't even matter
... please, let us go inside.

423
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:56,211
... over there..
Master Jester, I am Doctor Yu

424
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,921
Oh! Mr. White Face, How much time
wait outside somebody to get inside?

425
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:01,569
What a Smell!.
It stinks!

426
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,896
It’s a women's scent.

427
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:08,071
Ah! woman, actually we gathered
some herbs. That’s is the smell

428
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:10,796
Why?... You mean, you are
Doctor Yu with the Fire Beast Arm?

429
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:14,217
Give us
He also mean you...

430
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:17,718
Thank you for your visit
We will hand it over to Lord Conquer

431
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:21,511
Come with me
we'll talk after the banquet

432
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:33,338
Father!

433
00:40:33,538 --> 00:40:37,022
Conquer, you bastard!
We have come to avenge your people.

434
00:40:37,222 --> 00:40:40,637
Hold! Ming!
You think, you can't wait and fight against us

435
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:43,258
You must be...
something

436
00:40:43,723 --> 00:40:45,261
Your people murdered my Clan

437
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:47,235
and stole Unchallenged Sword

438
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:50,202
we are not going
without any punishment

439
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:53,105
We want Unchallenged Sword
be given back

440
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:58,710
Hold!
What brings you here.

441
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:01,043
Monks should be charitable and kind

442
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:03,319
So I promised this Young Master...

443
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,540
and helps out to find
the murder of his family

444
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:08,085
I hope you will resist us,
in the name of Buddha

445
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,827
For those, who doubt now
... Today is my daughter's wedding

446
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,753
It will be a happy occasion

447
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:31,765
I don't want any conflict interrupted

448
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:34,374
The Shaolin Priests are
the best known

449
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,393
but, there are many other Clans

450
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:38,708
we are the largest of them

451
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,286
Simply put by virtue of size and strength

452
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:45,132
choose...is obvious

453
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:51,237
Align with us and prosper
Or oppose us and die!

454
00:41:53,738 --> 00:41:54,693
Buddha have pity

455
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:57,212
You clearly outlined your position

456
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:59,507
Ming must now decide
what to do?

457
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,290
How do you wish
to proceed in this matter?

458
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,058
My Martial Arts skills
are too weak,

459
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:12,848
Wirlspring Wind can beat me

460
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:16,213
So, I have no way to defend my honour

461
00:42:17,914 --> 00:42:21,855
I give up, my uncle
Sword Saint send you this..

462
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:38,698
Ten years has already passed

463
00:42:38,898 --> 00:42:40,711
There is no reason
but to fight

464
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:43,722
"We will battle
on the autumn solstice"

465
00:42:46,126 --> 00:42:48,795
Well, I have waited for
this time to happen

466
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:53,365
Everything's fine now!

467
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:54,626
Thing is the celebration

468
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:57,559
Hold the wine,
we have A Toast and Bride, Yes!

469
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:42,192
Now Wind, You have to promise,
to treat Charity well

470
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,856
Do I have you a word?

471
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:46,151
Absolutely My Lord!

472
00:43:47,382 --> 00:43:48,536
Let's bow to the ancestors.

473
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:49,395
Hold it!

474
00:44:03,211 --> 00:44:04,021
What are you doing?

475
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:06,259
Cloud!

476
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:07,434
Come!

477
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:14,031
How dare you
to do such a thing?

478
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:16,245
You would never go
This is my...!

479
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:37,167
I thought you are never coming!

480
00:44:37,732 --> 00:44:39,102
Why did you agree to marry him?

481
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,463
You never asked why

482
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:44,135
I cannot bear another man touch you!

483
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:46,701
I can marry him
and see you

484
00:44:48,156 --> 00:44:48,892
Charity!

485
00:44:52,545 --> 00:44:53,352
Over here!

486
00:44:54,086 --> 00:44:56,648
I obeyed you for 10 years now

487
00:44:58,294 --> 00:44:59,893
I'm leaving here
with Charity

488
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:06,952
If you're a man,
you fight for your wife

489
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,443
You cannot afford to have
the world laugh at you, Coward!

490
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:14,184
Defend for your reputation!

491
00:45:33,994 --> 00:45:34,259
Wind!

492
00:45:48,132 --> 00:45:49,260
Master! Shut up!

493
00:46:26,505 --> 00:46:27,107
Father!

494
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:29,598
Look out!

495
00:46:35,312 --> 00:46:35,508
Charity!
Charity!

496
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:43,793
She is already my woman. Go away!

497
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:47,061
Is it fine? Tell me.

498
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,389
I'm sorry, Wind

499
00:46:56,631 --> 00:46:58,408
Why you married me then?

500
00:47:01,398 --> 00:47:03,080
Did you love me ever?

501
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:05,769
Yes

502
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:14,070
Don’t worry, you are mine.

503
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:17,682
It makes no difference!

504
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:19,134
We will be together, forever.

505
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:22,553
Nothing will come
in between us.

506
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:43,261
Charity, I love you!

507
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:51,095
I am always...

508
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:09,493
Master!

509
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,468
I killed my own daughter...

510
00:50:06,182 --> 00:50:09,538
Striding Cloud, return Charity's body

511
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:11,247
No one can take her away

512
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,717
You are not that strong

513
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:18,417
I never completed your lessons
the craft of Cloud Palms

514
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:21,123
Prepare!

515
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,827
You will get a demonstration
you can die in peace.

516
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:51,082
Your Cloud Palms will not work
here in the desert

517
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:54,829
Yours...to be effected

518
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:58,436
However Clock, I am also
the Master of other techniques.

519
00:51:11,044 --> 00:51:13,388
Now, let us see
how much blood you have

520
00:52:24,637 --> 00:52:26,121
I will be back...

521
00:53:04,057 --> 00:53:06,313
Father, Come on
Someone wounded badly

522
00:53:07,596 --> 00:53:10,252
yeh!
It's Striding Cloud who stole the bride!

523
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:10,787
What!

524
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:53,788
Striding Cloud...

525
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:01,340
Striding Cloud!

526
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:01,660
Cloud!

527
00:55:04,683 --> 00:55:05,291
Cloud!

528
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:07,265
Its lunch time.

529
00:55:13,915 --> 00:55:15,543
You missed her a lot, Right?

530
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:22,858
I have to tell you
when I saw your lover

531
00:55:22,964 --> 00:55:25,041
that wearing beautiful Bridal Gown
she was...

532
00:55:25,216 --> 00:55:27,919
watching and watching
and I am in pride of that

533
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,643
I am envious of the woman

534
00:55:32,973 --> 00:55:33,972
Have you got news?

535
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:36,354
I am amused easily

536
00:55:37,278 --> 00:55:40,348
Don't be silly!
I was just blessed by a Muse

537
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:41,678
on the day I was born

538
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:44,402
so,...me that if you..

539
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:49,677
Thank you,
for rescuing me that day.

540
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:52,445
Come and sit on it.

541
00:55:54,973 --> 00:55:56,084
You are planning
to go back to the Clan?

542
00:55:56,409 --> 00:56:00,778
I have to go back
for revenge

543
00:56:02,683 --> 00:56:04,789
.. secrets...so on

544
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:14,425
In this world some men
have no friends and no lover and aligns

545
00:56:15,683 --> 00:56:16,775
I am such a person!

546
00:56:35,751 --> 00:56:39,073
Master Wind!
Have some water.

547
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:41,626
Thanks!

548
00:57:19,676 --> 00:57:20,616
... all over the place

549
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:53,271
This must be
Blood Bodhi fruit!

550
00:57:54,366 --> 00:57:57,650
His Lordship says...
just one increases powers

551
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:17,787
Go away!

552
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:19,305
Go Away!

553
00:58:26,323 --> 00:58:27,671
Come on here!

554
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:29,609
Fire Beast!

555
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:31,666
Master Wind!
Come out!

556
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:33,221
House him.
He is dangerous.

557
00:58:45,363 --> 00:58:46,576
Sir, Please don’t blame us.

558
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:50,664
It’s the same who killed, all 296 people
at Unchallenged City completely

559
00:58:50,698 --> 00:58:52,665
and tact works out very quickly

560
00:58:52,865 --> 00:58:54,802
your flesh and bones
both bright

561
00:58:55,384 --> 00:58:56,558
Why did you do it?

562
00:58:57,004 --> 00:58:58,785
We must obey
Our Master ordered it.

563
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:02,611
It doesn't make sense.

564
00:59:02,811 --> 00:59:04,730
Lord Conquer said
bring back your head

565
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,107
and the fruits
we'll be rewarded

566
01:00:17,012 --> 01:00:18,596
I'll give you back the fruit

567
01:00:26,669 --> 01:00:28,486
Then it may be even. Right?

568
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:03,386
"With a heart as clear as ice,
the sky may fall and I will not fear"

569
01:02:03,943 --> 01:02:05,464
But Horns clear as ice!

570
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,127
Who is it?

571
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:11,160
It's me, Jester

572
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,596
Congratulations my Lord,

573
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:16,829
You have increased straight 100% powers!
You now can dominate the World

574
01:04:20,615 --> 01:04:21,632
What you are saying?

575
01:04:23,352 --> 01:04:26,354
I am saying Sword Saint,
such fool challenged you my Lord

576
01:04:26,986 --> 01:04:30,691
You have gained Powers
Oh yes! He is there

577
01:04:30,862 --> 01:04:32,595
Oh! You are bound to be...

578
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:39,251
What you are telling me?

579
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:41,112
You're fulfilling destiny

580
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,029
Destiny, you say

581
01:04:48,393 --> 01:04:53,032
You are a complete idiot, you don't know
what you are talking about

582
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:56,727
you are right, Master.
I am a complete idiot

583
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:58,160
But every word comes
from my heart

584
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,503
Get out!

585
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:06,877
Yes Sir!

586
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:29,362
You are the only one
I trust

587
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,347
Wind and Cloud have disappeared
without a word

588
01:05:34,943 --> 01:05:37,204
and tomorrow
I must go into battle

589
01:05:38,696 --> 01:05:42,176
So, Frost!
you must take out...

590
01:05:42,376 --> 01:05:44,872
and help me
to rule the world

591
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,193
I hope that, I am
not capable sir!

592
01:06:09,608 --> 01:06:11,141
I have full confidence in you

593
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:13,869
You, are ready.

594
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:16,853
My life's goal to
beat Sword Saint

595
01:06:17,275 --> 01:06:19,521
You will become leader
of the Clan when I do

596
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:23,885
Congratulations!

597
01:06:23,985 --> 01:06:24,469
Thank you, Master

598
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,050
Knowing that battle is imminent

599
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,509
We can't afford mistakes...
to preserve our interests...

600
01:06:42,842 --> 01:06:45,380
Any one disloyal to me
has to die

601
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:50,081
Jester has betrayed the Clan
kill him at once.

602
01:07:11,376 --> 01:07:12,775
Jester, been around here?

603
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:15,288
No, no
I haven't see him, Sorry.

604
01:07:16,685 --> 01:07:17,479
Wait a minute!

605
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,616
Don't kill me, please
Master Frost!

606
01:07:21,392 --> 01:07:22,632
Don't believe
what Lord is saying

607
01:07:23,226 --> 01:07:24,612
He is using tricks on us all

608
01:07:24,618 --> 01:07:25,432
You are a liar.

609
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:27,938
You betrayed Master.
Now you must die!

610
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:30,659
No, He murdered
the parents of Wind and Cloud

611
01:07:30,882 --> 01:07:32,790
Look, believe me
I can prove it.

612
01:07:33,113 --> 01:07:33,832
I will take you to Mud Buddha,

613
01:07:34,032 --> 01:07:35,553
Lord Conquer has...

614
01:07:41,118 --> 01:07:44,346
Take me to him.
..uniform?

615
01:07:44,663 --> 01:07:47,907
Use your..down

616
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:50,249
I have to hurry
Can you wait here?

617
01:08:16,074 --> 01:08:19,014
Master Frost...

618
01:08:20,909 --> 01:08:25,492
So the man who kidnapped
was Lord Conquer

619
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:30,256
I must fight. I must command
I must command!

620
01:09:33,484 --> 01:09:34,656
I won't die here

621
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:39,287
I want...

622
01:10:22,504 --> 01:10:26,468
You need to know the truth
Master Wind!

623
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:30,690
Lord Conquer killed your parents

624
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:35,149
I purposely gave him

625
01:10:35,346 --> 01:10:38,178
birth charts of you and Cloud

626
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:41,554
so he would let you live

627
01:10:43,229 --> 01:10:45,835
Destiny...Young Master

628
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:52,929
All things go in cycles
Cause, in fact...

629
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:57,129
Everyone faces judgment.

630
01:11:01,811 --> 01:11:02,635
What can I do?

631
01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:08,895
"The Dragon is powerful,

632
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:15,851
but it will be stranded
when wind and cloud become a storm"

633
01:11:22,135 --> 01:11:23,707
Sword Saint has come for the duel

634
01:11:35,188 --> 01:11:37,812
Well, I waited many years for this

635
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:40,252
Although I now dominate the world

636
01:11:40,466 --> 01:11:43,132
Thanks to my extra ordinary
Martial Arts Skills

637
01:11:43,451 --> 01:11:46,942
now having defeated you
I comfort my throat

638
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:50,358
I want
comfort...mood

639
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:52,841
I am aware your danger strength

640
01:11:53,624 --> 01:11:55,827
that keeps fair and fine

641
01:11:56,527 --> 01:11:59,713
If I can't defeat you at the
waiting today's battle

642
01:11:59,976 --> 01:12:03,832
I know that I can
die as a peaceful man

643
01:12:04,406 --> 01:12:06,543
Peace will come from
my Challenge Sword

644
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:12,901
Once I use...You Saint Sword
and your family are defeated in the battle

645
01:12:15,925 --> 01:12:18,077
Only I will...

646
01:12:39,629 --> 01:12:40,562
Wait here.

647
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:48,388
Is he human? Why is he not moving?

648
01:13:50,743 --> 01:13:51,161
No!

649
01:14:38,157 --> 01:14:40,547
You wait here, I am going in.

650
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,032
Uncle! Uncle!

651
01:14:50,228 --> 01:14:51,555
Don't go, I don't care!

652
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:52,414
I must fight

653
01:15:12,983 --> 01:15:14,738
He has come to know...

654
01:15:18,813 --> 01:15:21,805
Help me,.. revenge

655
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:49,847
Wind and Cloud must be together

656
01:15:49,905 --> 01:15:50,995
Or it won't be a storm

657
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:52,040
Cloud!

658
01:15:57,242 --> 01:15:59,242
Blood Bodhi can increase
your powers

659
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:32,406
It’s over Frost,
You may announce to the world,

660
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:35,208
I have defeated my ultimate opponent

661
01:16:35,372 --> 01:16:37,605
and I am now truly invincible

662
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,623
You killed the disciple's parents

663
01:16:43,219 --> 01:16:46,192
You ordered you men
Hawk and Bat to kill Wind,

664
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:46,741
right?

665
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:48,897
Admit it

666
01:16:50,683 --> 01:16:53,752
So apparently
you didn't kill Jester, I ordered?

667
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:57,843
You bastard
you are murderer!

668
01:17:00,707 --> 01:17:02,118
I was right
about you

669
01:17:04,197 --> 01:17:07,247
Of the three, you are most naive

670
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,898
You never made me your heir

671
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:15,590
You're...that’s all

672
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,709
It’s the way in the world

673
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,349
The King manipulates the power
Frost!

674
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:27,585
You must be my den
To be in yours is quite foolish

675
01:17:28,854 --> 01:17:30,335
Align now once more.

676
01:17:35,236 --> 01:17:36,481
Where do you think
you are going?

677
01:17:39,251 --> 01:17:40,283
I'm leaving your Clan

678
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:43,846
You think that easy

679
01:17:46,557 --> 01:17:50,108
No one leaves my Clan
unless I give permission to go

680
01:18:04,206 --> 01:18:04,614
Frost

681
01:18:09,895 --> 01:18:11,519
So two of you
are still alive

682
01:18:11,662 --> 01:18:13,565
Some of you
disobeyed my order

683
01:18:13,765 --> 01:18:17,357
Now the real question is
why you have come back here

684
01:18:18,329 --> 01:18:19,743
Sword Saint is dead

685
01:18:21,732 --> 01:18:22,871
I will... you, bastard

686
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,794
I will avenge my Family

687
01:18:29,396 --> 01:18:30,592
Well, I took you in

688
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:33,103
I knew this day has to come and

689
01:18:33,398 --> 01:18:34,409
I have planned for it.

690
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:11,236
Master Wind

691
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:13,496
Take hint.

692
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:16,686
You have great power
You must not use it at all

693
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:20,169
It ends soon
to Conquer to be killed.

694
01:20:33,765 --> 01:20:37,347
I taught you all the martial arts
as one of you ever knew

695
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:39,993
Don't think I did leave few moves out

696
01:21:19,294 --> 01:21:22,782
Cloud is unpredictable, Wind is formless

697
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:31,245
You two definitely aware it
you can't assault me

698
01:21:31,605 --> 01:21:33,938
...fight here

699
01:21:34,024 --> 01:21:37,220
Since this will now be... inside

700
01:21:37,538 --> 01:21:40,179
Prepare to die!

701
01:22:14,777 --> 01:22:17,039
I taught you Fists, Palms and Kicks,

702
01:22:17,252 --> 01:22:20,291
but I never told that
my greatest skill is in the sword!

703
01:22:20,491 --> 01:22:22,097
Which I neglected to teach you

704
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,106
"The Dragon is powerful,

705
01:22:38,206 --> 01:22:41,556
but will be stranded
when wind and cloud become a storm"

706
01:22:46,924 --> 01:22:50,020
Well Mud Buddha,
I don't believe in your prophesy

707
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:53,021
the truth is
I only believe in myself

708
01:23:29,455 --> 01:23:30,437
you.. cannot use the sword

709
01:23:30,721 --> 01:23:31,729
It might be true.

710
01:23:31,938 --> 01:23:33,826
But you also require my boy's blood..

711
01:25:48,965 --> 01:25:49,482
Wait

712
01:25:56,839 --> 01:25:57,767
Dead razors

713
01:25:57,967 --> 01:26:16,727
I will...I am.

714
01:26:16,827 --> 01:26:17,826
.. end to soul

715
01:26:19,149 --> 01:26:22,607
... to challenge the...
Conquer to be killed

716
01:26:23,051 --> 01:26:27,482
..I am the Conquer of the world!

717
01:26:27,798 --> 01:26:31,179
... I am the Conquer of the world!

718
01:26:34,949 --> 01:26:38,833
... I am the Conquer of the world!

719
01:26:47,904 --> 01:26:52,839
... I am the Conquer of the world!

720
01:26:54,212 --> 01:27:13,054
