1
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,928
Emmy. you better turn down
towards Cincinnati.

2
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,092
If we could find your uncle.
Ned Arrowsmith.

3
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,033
I guess he'd take us in.

4
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,332
Nobody ain't gonna take us in.
We're going West.

5
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,809
There's a whole lot of new things
I aim to be seeing yet.

6
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:00,776
And that was your grandmother. Martin.
Fine stock to come from.

7
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:05,450
Pioneer stock.
Stubborn stock.

8
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,154
That would make a medical man
out of you. if anything will.

9
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,632
It would make a real scientist out of you.
if you live up to it.

10
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,191
- Reading old Gray. eh?
- Yes. sir.

11
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,294
That's right.

12
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,602
Physician's library. Three books...

13
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:27,442
<i>Gray's Aratomy</i>. The Holy Bible.
Shakespeare.

14
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:33,077
Study. Martin.
Someday you may be a great doctor.

15
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,745
Get training.

16
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,985
Go to college before you go
to medical school.

17
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,423
Study chemistry.

18
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,985
Latin. physics. biology.

19
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,190
Be a fine doctor.

20
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,474
- Yeah. well?
- My name's Arrowsmith.

21
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,077
- Arrowsmith?
- Martin Arrowsmith.

22
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,712
I'm just starting medical school.

23
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,122
and I thought I'd like to take
my Bacteriology with you this fall

24
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,287
instead of waiting till second year.
That is. if you don't mind.

25
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,125
Yeah? But I do mind.

26
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,189
Well. I'm not going to be just
an ordinary doctor.

27
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,255
No?

28
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,667
No. I want to be a research scientist
like you. Dr. Gottlieb.

29
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,672
Not as great as you are.
of course. but...

30
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,970
but I'm not interested
in just giving pills to people.

31
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,705
I'd rather find a cure for cancer.

32
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,510
Yeah. if you can do that.
you will be much greater than I.

33
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,381
I really mean I want to
find out things for myself.

34
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,649
I know how little I know.
and I'm not afraid of hard work.

35
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,658
So now we begin to talk sensibly.

36
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,973
M o

37
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,316
To be a scientist.
that is born in a man.

38
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,150
And in very few men.

39
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,193
It may be born in you.

40
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:25,059
But first. go and be a medical student.

41
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,157
Go learn the names of the diseases.

42
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,362
Learn to work in the dissecting school
without being sick.

43
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,464
Learn to watch the blood flow
without fainting.

44
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,477
Go and get your M.D. after your name.

45
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,312
And then... come back to me.

46
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,723
- All right. Doc. up you go.
- Fine.

47
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,566
- You're new. aren't you. Doc?
- I'll say so. I was born yesterday.

48
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,898
That's why I come along.

49
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,496
These people get kinda excited
down here once in a while.

50
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,637
Does anyone here speak English?

51
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,118
- <i>Tutto</i>. sure.
- Where's the patient?

52
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,024
Well. congratulations.
You're the father of a fine boy.

53
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,298
No. no. I'm the uncle.
he's the father.

54
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,204
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

55
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,307
<i>Viro?</i> Why. certainly.

56
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,382
You know. Doctor.
he's his first baby.

57
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,277
Well. it's my first baby. too.

58
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,395
- Nurse. I want to find Ward D.
- Do you?

59
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,873
- Can you direct me?
- I could. yes.

60
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,710
- Well. if it isn't interrupting your work...
- This isn't my work.

61
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,577
Nurses aren't supposed to scrub floors.

62
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,946
Superintendent caught me
smoking a cigarette.

63
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,952
You go back for Ward D.
turn right and then left.

64
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,454
I've been informed
that the first duty of a nurse

65
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,993
is to stand
when she speaks to a doctor.

66
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,494
Gee. I've been getting fresh again.

67
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,398
It may interest you to know
that I'm Dr. Gottlieb's assistant

68
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,734
and that I'm on my way to Ward D to take
a strain of a very dangerous microbe.

69
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,777
When I've done what I came here to do.
I shall report you. What's your name?

70
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,368
- What's yours?
- Arrowsmith.

71
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,176
- You're not reporting me. you know.
- Gee. there I go again.

72
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,184
Scrubbing floors
just makes me rebellious.

73
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,244
and being rebellious just naturally
makes me fresh. and there you are.

74
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,780
My name is Leora Tozer.
It's a silly name. isn't it?

75
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,921
What's wrong with it?
I kinda like it.

76
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,485
Thanks.

77
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,892
When can you get away for dinner?

78
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,833
With you?

79
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,896
I've decided to overlook reporting you.
How about tonight?

80
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,033
- Well...
- Why not?

81
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,511
- I don't mind.
- What time?

82
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,578
You will report the patient's temperature
to me every hour.

83
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,450
I'll look in again at 7:00.
At 7:00.

84
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,668
- I've talked too much.
- You haven't bored me.

85
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,835
- I've been pretty technical.
- I liked it. Made me feel intelligent.

86
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,370
Well. at that. you've got to get used
to hearing my ideas.

87
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:40,681
- I'm gonna hear a lot of them?
- You're going to marry me.

88
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,415
- You don't tell me.
- I certainly do.

89
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,520
Now. you know.
I shouldn't wonder if you're right.

90
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,559
Of course. it's a little early in the game
to be dead sure.

91
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,065
but I shouldn't wonder.

92
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,895
Guess you're pretty pig-headed
and self-centered. aren't you?

93
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,633
But I like you so much.
I'd be a fool to pass you up.

94
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,073
Have you got a nickel?

95
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,411
Certainly.
What for?

96
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,349
I want soft music.

97
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,081
You know. I wasn't being funny.

98
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,479
I didn't think you were.

99
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,831
M oa ovo
M ovo oovo

100
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,628
I hope you mean that.

101
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,135
Because. I warn you.
I'm never going to give you up.

102
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,263
I've found you. My life's begun.

103
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,702
I have sent for you. Martin. to tell you
that I am leaving this place

104
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,614
where I teach young doctors
to kill their patients.

105
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,450
I have been called to
the McGurk Institute of New York

106
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,149
where I shall do only my own research.

107
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,451
McGurk?

108
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:57,053
The McGurk Institute is the greatest
scientific plant in the world.

109
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,859
I am very happy.

110
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:05,666
- Yes. sir. I should think you would be.
- And I am happy for you. too. Martin.

111
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,572
I have arranged for you to go with me
as my assistant.

112
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,476
You will have great opportunity there.

113
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,714
You're the greatest man
I've ever known. Dr. Gottlieb.

114
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,621
I'd black your shoes for you.

115
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,682
But I can't go to New York with you.

116
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,559
It is many years since my shoes
have been black. Martin.

117
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,567
Anyway. I was not taking you
as a bootblack.

118
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,504
Why can't you go with me?

119
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,033
I'm going to be married.

120
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,841
And a man can't marry
on what a lab assistant makes. so...

121
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,072
I'll just have to practice medicine
after all.

122
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,414
Practice?
Practice!

123
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,852
To give pills to ladies.
to hold their hands for them.

124
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,288
to make their diets for them.
Practice? You?

125
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,657
You. who have the stuff
that makes scientist in you?

126
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,492
I'm sorry. sir. but that's how it is.

127
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,332
Oh. well.

128
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,337
I am too wise to argue
with a man in love.

129
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,343
You will be a bad doctor for a while.
and then you will find your way back to us.

130
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,577
And when you do. Martin.
let me know. and...

131
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,983
I will make a place for you.

132
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,481
Go.

133
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,355
Good luck to you.

134
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,126
- I wish you happiness.
- Thank you. sir.

135
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,599
By the laws of God
and by the laws of the state.

136
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,465
I hereby pronounce you
man and wife.

137
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,366
Two dollars. please.

138
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,171
The lady gets it.

139
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,746
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

140
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,980
Don't mention it. Next.

141
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,906
Well... we're married.

142
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,431
- I don't feel any different.
- I feel kind of flat.

143
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,173
- So. where do we go from here?
- You start practicing.

144
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,308
How does a doctor start practicing?
I've often wondered about that.

145
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,750
Well. I thought you might take a train
with me to my hometown.

146
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,187
- That's Wheatsylvania. South Dakota.
- Dakota?

147
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,885
We got 366 inhabitants
in Wheatsylvania.

148
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,224
And not a doctor in the lot.

149
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,024
Dakota. yeah!

150
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,066
Real man's country.
Frontier! Opportunity!

151
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,898
You're gonna love South Dakota.
Come on. we're on our way!

152
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,115
For what we are about to receive. Lord.

153
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,021
and for all the many blessings
Thou hast bestowed upon our house.

154
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,959
may we be truly grateful.
Amen.

155
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,657
- I always...
- Leora.

156
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,392
- What is it. Mom?
- Look!

157
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,558
Oh. that.

158
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,125
- That happened day before yesterday.
- This is too much.

159
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,639
- Do you mean to tell me...
- You've broken your old parents' hearts.

160
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,697
- Now. Iook. here. l...
- Martin. please. let me.

161
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,403
I'm sorry. darling. but I've got to
make my position clear.

162
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,641
Mr. Tozer. I've been living alone
and working hard for a long time.

163
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,275
I intend to go on working hard.
But I'm not gonna live alone any longer.

164
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,876
That is. I'm not gonna live
without Leora.

165
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,649
You couldn't have stopped us
getting married.

166
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,883
But you would have tried
to stop us getting married.

167
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,550
And I can't waste time now.

168
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:52,291
You asked me this afternoon if l...
if I had any money. and l...

169
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,595
If you think for a moment you're going
to get one red cent out of this family

170
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,466
simply because you've butted in
where you weren't invited.

171
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,506
I wanna know about it.
I certainly wanna know about it.

172
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,042
I'm not asking for money.
I'm asking for your good will.

173
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,044
I'm asking you to help me to start
in practicing here. so I can support...

174
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,672
Martin may not be asking
for any money. but I am.

175
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,308
Pa's gonna lend Martin $1.000
to start up an office.

176
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,648
Martin'll pay him interest on it.

177
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,746
That is. if Pa doesn't want to give it to us
as a wedding present.

178
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,620
- A thousand...
- You can afford it. Pa. You know you can.

179
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,852
- A thousand...
- You sit down.

180
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,757
And I don't wanna hear
any more talk about it.

181
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,661
because Martin's giving up a great career
as a research scientist

182
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,325
to be a country doctor
so he can support a wife.

183
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,631
And... and you all ought to just
get down on your knees

184
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,604
and appreciate him
and stop scrapping.

185
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,265
Will you give me a cigarette.
please. Martin?

186
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,209
- Leora!
- You ain't learned to smoke cigarettes?

187
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,271
Yes. I have. And now you can scream
at me for a while and lay off Martin.

188
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,838
Hey. Lee. Iook.

189
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,080
That ought to bring 'em rolling in.

190
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,382
Come inside
and see what I've got.

191
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,959
What have you got?

192
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,326
Wait till you see.

193
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,567
- What's that?
- It's Pa's old Prince Albert.

194
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,865
- What. for me to wear?
- Certainly!

195
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,932
Come on.

196
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:45,272
Martin. stop. Now. this is serious.
You put that on.

197
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,734
Come on.

198
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,980
- Now. let me see.
- In a Ford.

199
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,862
Well. you're a doctor. aren't you?

200
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,761
I'm a country doctor.

201
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,824
You bet you're a country doctor. Martin.

202
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,302
You gotta to make the young folks
get married when they ought to

203
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,532
and stay married
when they don't want to.

204
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,040
You gotta lecture the big boys
on the evils of drink

205
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,771
and do your own drinking
with the shades down.

206
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,439
You gotta see that
the backyards are tidy.

207
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,744
and the milk's fresh.
and the meat's pure.

208
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,183
That's what being a country doctor
means. Martin.

209
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,413
I'm proud to know you.

210
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,381
Fellow citizens!

211
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,086
Do you realize. fellow citizens.

212
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,857
there are 366 human souls in this town.

213
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,491
and only one man to keep 'em fit?

214
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,797
Yay!

215
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,472
Leora. sweet.
I didn't know a man could be so happy.

216
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,122
- Is it a patient?
- I think so.

217
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,751
Hello. yes. the doctor speaking.

218
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:15,460
My little girl. Mary. she's got
a terrible sore throat.

219
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,593
She look bad.

220
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,433
Can you come right away?

221
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,098
Yeah. I'll be right there.

222
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,106
Sore throat.

223
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,907
Might be diphtheria.

224
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,035
- First patient.
- About time.

225
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,073
There's always a time when
things begin to happen.

226
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,301
- Four miles to go.
- Four miles to glory.

227
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,106
Four miles in eight minutes.

228
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,840
Good luck. Martin!

229
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,142
Don't cry. Mama.
Doctor's here now.

230
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,120
She looks pretty bad.

231
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,986
We done all we could for her.

232
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,755
Last night and tonight
we steamed her throat.

233
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:21,664
and we put her in the new bedroom.
I think it's croup.

234
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,646
A little wider.

235
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,124
That's a good girl.

236
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,684
A little more. That's it.

237
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,206
Croup. huh?

238
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,799
It <i>is</i> diphtheria.

239
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,242
Diphtheria?

240
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,211
What's that. diphtheria?

241
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,907
I don't know.

242
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,508
You fix her up good. Doc?

243
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,985
You should have called a doctor
before this.

244
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,354
If this were a hospital. I'd operate.

245
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,917
Try and... try and get some sleep.

246
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,422
I'll let you know
if there's any change.

247
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,288
No. Doctor.

248
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,388
Gottlieb was right.

249
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,893
I am a rotten doctor.

250
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,905
Don't say that. Martin.
You did your best.

251
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,440
No. I didn't. though.

252
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,173
I should have operated.

253
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,145
No matter what.
I should have operated.

254
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:21,703
You have followed me tonight
through the jungles of Africa.

255
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:29,016
You have seen how David Bruce
conquered sleeping sickness there.

256
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,956
You have waded with me
in the Italian marshes

257
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:40,295
where Grassi identified and doomed
the malarial mosquito.

258
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:47,271
I have sung to you tonight the praises
of your four American doughboys

259
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:53,767
who sacrificed their lives. volunteered
to become human guinea pigs.

260
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,544
that mankind might
be saved from yellow fever.

261
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:05,154
Here in India. and in China. too.
from where comes the bubonic plague.

262
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:09,660
I have seen village after village dying.

263
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:15,030
with no help from no doctor nowhere.
except me.

264
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,596
I sound like
pretty important fellow. huh?

265
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,164
Well. I am.

266
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:30,175
Not so far ago the whole population
of London was nearly wiped out

267
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:35,550
because a little rat carried the germ
of the bubonic plague

268
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,056
on a ship from China to England.

269
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,287
Now that could happen again.

270
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:47,958
I tell you. we don't want
no more old-style soldiers.

271
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:52,470
We want
new-style doctor-soldiers.

272
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,405
Scientific soldiers. Yeah.

273
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,669
That's all.

274
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,754
- Thank you. Doctor. very nice.
- Thank you. thank you. Yeah.

275
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:18,757
- And you. you have questions to ask?
- My name's Dr. Arrowsmith.

276
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,027
I thought perhaps if you weren't
due someplace.

277
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,897
you might care to come out
and have a...

278
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,063
- A drink?
- Something of that description. yes.

279
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,565
I just think I would.

280
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,634
You know some nice place.
cool place. here in Detroit...

281
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,475
Where am I tonight?

282
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,276
- This is Minneapolis.
- Min...

283
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,647
Yes. there's a fine beer joint here.
With real beer.

284
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,419
I buy you a drink.
Come on.

285
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,797
I was assistant to Max Gottlieb.
You know him?

286
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:02,600
Gottlieb! The greatest.
The spirit of science.

287
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,871
I had once the pleasure
to speak to him in New York.

288
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,208
But let us not be serious.

289
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,840
Let us drink. Let us sing.

290
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:16,452
She's a dark and roving eye

291
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:20,423
And her hair hung down in ringlets

292
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,325
She's a nice girl...

293
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,764
Yes. I've a new lease on life.

294
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,002
No doubt about it. you can see
for yourself. I'm a new man.

295
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,978
I've been stagnating for two years.
I'm not going to stagnate any longer.

296
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,381
- Have some coffee.
- Thanks.

297
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,653
Bacon? Eggs?

298
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,786
No. thanks.

299
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,261
Have some toast.

300
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,326
- You must eat something. you know.
- I can't.

301
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,872
Lee. sweet.

302
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,953
It's all right. Lee. sweet.

303
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,181
Good babies always
make their mothers a little sick.

304
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,883
Poor Martin.

305
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,950
- You'll be tied down worse than ever now.
- What do you mean. tied down?

306
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,189
I don't have to go to Africa
to save mankind.

307
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,664
Plenty of mankind around here.

308
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,328
We'll see the world yet.
And we'll take the boy with us.

309
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,462
Even if he turns out to be a girl.
we'll take him.

310
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,167
Martin. going places!

311
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,234
In the meantime. you watch me
stand this town on its ear.

312
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,208
- Doc.
- Dr. Arrowsmith.

313
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,255
- What is it?
- It's about Johnny.

314
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,416
- Johnny?
- He wants to get his tooth pulled.

315
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,484
Are you Johnny?

316
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,722
All right. get around to the front.

317
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,394
I guess I can't save mankind
till I've saved Johnny.

318
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,937
Poor Martin.

319
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,983
Come on. Johnny. Stand over here.
and let's have a look at that tooth.

320
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,185
You boys sit on the sofa.

321
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,423
And you better hold that dog.
He might think I'm hurting Johnny.

322
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:42,364
I wouldn't hurt him.
Only dentists do that.

323
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,026
And I'm no dentist.
Now open your mouth.

324
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,204
Is that the one?

325
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,208
Yes. I thought it would be.

326
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,842
All right. Johnny.
you sit over here.

327
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,988
You can shut your mouth.

328
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,185
Did you ever stop to consider. Johnny...

329
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,753
...how wonderful nature is?

330
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,991
In giving us two chances
of growing teeth?

331
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,368
We get a practice set first.
Just to practice brushing our teeth on.

332
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,430
Then we get a real set later.

333
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,005
And you know. Johnny. somehow...

334
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,947
I don't think you're making the most
of your tooth-brushing opportunities.

335
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:38,120
Had coconut pie for supper
last night. didn't you?

336
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,349
All right.

337
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,508
Now. Johnny. I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

338
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,568
The pain is gonna leave that tooth

339
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:05,912
and it's gonna come all the way
along this... this piece of string

340
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,387
and disappear into something
I've got here in my hand.

341
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,047
Now look out. Johnny. it's coming!

342
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:13,948
There you are.

343
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,094
Hey. boys. listen.

344
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,895
Here's half a dollar.

345
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,198
That's a soda apiece
and a dime over for gumdrops.

346
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,932
then I can get the rest
of your teeth. Come on.

347
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,564
- Thank you. Doc.
- Thank you.

348
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,575
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Doc.

349
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,273
What's the matter. Henry.
trouble?

350
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,646
Well. my cattle got blackleg
out by my farm.

351
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:43,518
- Blackleg?
- Yeah. Half my cows is dead already.

352
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,715
Blackleg. What do you do for that?

353
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,887
- Well. the state "vegeteterian." he come.
- The state what?

354
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,261
The... the cattle doctor.
That's him over there.

355
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,390
Oh. yes. the vet.

356
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,595
Yeah. he's got a needle thing
just like you got.

357
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:04,666
But he don't do no good.
The poor cows just die quicker.

358
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,608
Come on. let's have a look at it.

359
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:10,011
Come on. Henry. I'll be turning vet
on you before you know it.

360
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,110
That's a pretty bad swelling.

361
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,378
You better milk her
before she dies on you.

362
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,919
- Hello. Doc.
- Howdy. Doc.

363
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,018
That's my cow there.

364
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,689
I'm sorry. gentlemen. but this corral
has been commandeered

365
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,962
as a state experimental station.
It ain't open to the public.

366
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,434
- Are you the state veterinarian?
- That's me.

367
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,199
Well. I'm Dr. Arrowsmith.

368
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,174
- I don't believe I know that name.
- Well. I'm only a physician.

369
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,144
Well. if you've got any influence
with these crazy Swedes around here...

370
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,907
they seem to think I'm a miracle man.

371
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,415
There's no medicine on earth
that's sure-fire.

372
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:49,442
- Novak says you use a serum.
- Sure. we use a serum.

373
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,751
I like to fool around
with a microscope. Doctor.

374
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,950
and if you'd let me have
a bit of your serum

375
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,084
and a blood specimen from
one of these sick animals...

376
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,958
just for the fun of the thing.

377
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,295
Why. sure.
You. let me have some of that.

378
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,537
- Great things. these serums.
- Oh. yes. yes.

379
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,171
- What is it?
- Research. darling. research.

380
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,251
Blackleg. cattle disease.
I'm turning vet on you.

381
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,083
Saving cows may not be the same thing
as saving mankind.

382
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,488
but it's a step in the right direction.
Here's the blood and here's...

383
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,593
- Yes. Martin.
- I was right. That serum wasn't any good.

384
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,659
Yes. Martin.

385
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,467
Now. I'm ready to go.
and we'll try mine in the morning.

386
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,973
Yes. Martin.

387
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:50,814
I'm gonna take it over to Henry's
and shoot all his cattle full.

388
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,076
Yes. Martin.

389
00:30:54,018 --> 00:31:01,220
You see. I'm gonna try a different...
a different strength dose on every cow.

390
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,783
And then we can see which gets well
quickest and which dies quickest.

391
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,329
Yes. Martin.

392
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,094
Darling. are you hungry?

393
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,266
Darling. are you hungry?

394
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,743
Hungry?
Yes. by gosh. I'm famished.

395
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,747
- I'm not surprised. it's after 10:00.
- Well. let's have some dinner.

396
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,749
How can I cook dinner when
you're using the whole stove

397
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,341
to cook your old cow medicine?

398
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,817
We can have some sandwiches.

399
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,583
We've had nothing
but sandwiches for days!

400
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,681
What's the matter
with sandwiches. dear?

401
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,294
Five days. Henry.
and not a new case yet.

402
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,562
Not a one. Doc.

403
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,867
I thought she was a goner.
but she looks all right now.

404
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:53,309
By golly. Doc. you should be
state's vet in South Dakota.

405
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,642
I'm sorry about that pair. Henry.

406
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,710
You should have shoot
your stuff in them. too.

407
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,411
That's where you're wrong.

408
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:09,358
Listen. the ones we gave
the serum to are all right.

409
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,622
The ones we didn't give it to
are dead.

410
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:16,129
Don't you see? You have to try
both ways when you're experimenting.

411
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,134
That's how you find out
which way is best.

412
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,901
Well. I ain't kicking. Doc.
How much I owe you?

413
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,941
Forget it.
It was just for the fun.

414
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,273
Pretty good fun for me all right. Doc.
Thanks.

415
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,349
Next time you see Dr. Arrowsmith.

416
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,113
tell him for me that I don't stand
for this kind of monkey business.

417
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:38,917
and if he can't keep off my cattle.
he'd better keep out of my way.

418
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,457
I'll run him out of the state.

419
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:44,393
I'll see the governor. see that
his license is taken away from him.

420
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,020
Hiya. Doc.

421
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,359
How are ya. Doc?

422
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,008
- I've got some things to show you.
- You got nothing to show me.

423
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,068
- You know best.
- Where you been. Doc?

424
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,375
- You're quite a vet. Doc.
- Best in town.

425
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,577
- I'm back on the bellyaches now. though.
- That's where you belong.

426
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,951
- How's that?
- I say bellyaches is where you belong.

427
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,027
I don't want to say anything. Doc. but...
I don't quite like the tone in your voice.

428
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,223
- It's about time you understood...
- What?

429
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,697
Suppose you try understanding

430
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,564
that I've made a blackleg serum
that's better than yours.

431
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,798
because mine cures the cows.
and yours doesn't.

432
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,032
When you get that through your head.

433
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,836
drop over and I'll show you how
to make more like it.

434
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,001
If you think you're gonna discredit me
and then hold me up...

435
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,068
I'm not holding you up.
I'm giving you this.

436
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,376
Well. you see this?
It's what I'm giving you.

437
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,611
If you won't take the serum from me.
you'll take it from the government.

438
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,085
I've sent my reports and samples
in to Washington already.

439
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,188
Now. what was that
you were going to give me. Doctor?

440
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,451
Why. you!

441
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,952
- That's all right.
- You're all right. Doc.

442
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,830
Right on the jaw.

443
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,566
- Dr. Arrowsmith!
- What is it. Johnny?

444
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,902
- They've been looking for you all over.
- They? Who?

445
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:07,638
Everybody at your house. Your wife
took sick this morning after you left.

446
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:15,208
I'll have to ask you to be quiet. Doctor.
I'm Dr. Hesslikn. of Leopolis.

447
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,754
They called me
when they couldn't locate you.

448
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,953
The baby?

449
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:25,093
But you can't blame yourself. Doctor.
You couldn't possibly have foreseen it.

450
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,994
It would have happened anyway.

451
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:29,890
Well...

452
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,796
...as long as I've still got her.

453
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,264
Thank you. Doctor.

454
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,303
My darling!

455
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,044
Lee. sweet!

456
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,571
My darling.

457
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,712
There...

458
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,692
I'll never forgive myself
for leaving you like this.

459
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,091
Shh. darling.

460
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,958
N o o

461
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:08,472
Now I can't have a baby.
I'll have to bring you up.

462
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,767
I know.

463
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,709
Make a great man that
everybody will wonder at.

464
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:19,717
Like... like your... Sondelius.
or your Gottlieb. even.

465
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,350
Don't feel badly. Martin.

466
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,189
Lee. sweet.

467
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,259
If we could only...

468
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,636
Anyway. now we...

469
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,299
Oh. let's get out of this!

470
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,272
Now I remember.

471
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,178
I got a telegram in my pocket
for Doc Arrowsmith

472
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,011
from New York City.

473
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,645
Well. I...

474
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,614
I'm gonna love New York!

475
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,013
- Scares me. though.
- Yeah. me. too.

476
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,575
I guess this is us.

477
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,215
- All of that?
- No. Only the 25th floor.

478
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,588
Way up there?

479
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,430
"McGurk Institute only."

480
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,910
- Did you say 25th floor. Martin?
- 25th. yes.

481
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,173
I'm not going up that high yet.

482
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,474
- No. sir. I've got to get used to this first.
- Right.

483
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:01,809
Going up!

484
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,718
Go.

485
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,524
I'd like to see Dr. Gottlieb. if I may.

486
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,928
Have you an appointment?

487
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,093
Well. he's expecting me.
I wired him I was coming.

488
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,136
My name is Dr. Arrowsmith.

489
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,002
It's Dr. Tubbs you want to see.

490
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,538
Dr. Tubbs is our director.

491
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,410
You may come with me.

492
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,990
- Doctor.
- Martin. my boy! So...

493
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,122
you have come back to me.
as I said you would.

494
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,426
Glad to be with you again. sir.

495
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,526
And you have come back
on your own feet.

496
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,264
without any help from me.

497
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,965
- I am very glad.
- Thank you.

498
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,668
So this is the big cow doctor
from the West.

499
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,778
Delighted to welcome you.
Dr. Arrowsmith.

500
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,939
A most interesting experiment
of yours with the cattle disease.

501
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:42,645
Yeah. Martin. this is Dr. Tubbs.
our director.

502
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,087
And this is Terry Wickett.
a fine chemist.

503
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,285
You will be able to meet
your other colleagues later.

504
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,850
But. Dr. Gottlieb...

505
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:55,627
You will leave my prodigal son
to me for a moment. eh?

506
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,225
Let me conduct him to his laboratory.

507
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,044
Do you think I know enough
to work here. Dr. Gottlieb?

508
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,520
Now. let us be clear. Martin.

509
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:23,026
You will do your own work here
and have no one but yourself to satisfy.

510
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,832
A man should do fine work with all this.

511
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,774
This? This does not make a scientist.

512
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,005
His equipment is here.

513
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,938
And a man who cannot make
his own laboratory

514
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,609
out of toothpicks
and a piece of string.

515
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,746
he should buy his ideas
along with his fine equipment.

516
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,193
God give me clear eyes
and freedom from haste.

517
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,995
God give me anger
against all pretense.

518
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,434
God keep me... looking
for my own mistakes.

519
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,806
God keep me at it
till my results are proven.

520
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,346
God...

521
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:27,354
...give me strength
not to trust to God.

522
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,796
Winter again.

523
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:39,131
Well. it was bound to come.
I mean. it always has come.

524
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,936
That's a fine mess of bugs
you got here.

525
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,672
Shove them in the incubator.
and let's go out and catch a drink.

526
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:53,843
Well. I'll put them in the incubator.
but. if you don't mind. I'm going home.

527
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,818
Martin. for the love of Pete!

528
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,514
I'm sorry. Terry.
but I don't feel like drinking tonight.

529
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,389
- You are in a bad way. So long.
- So long. Terry.

530
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,747
- Is that you. Martin?
- Yup.

531
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,615
How did things go today. any better?

532
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,450
About as usual.

533
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,985
It just scares me to death
to see you this way.

534
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,260
Well. you won't be
scared much longer. Lee.

535
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,334
I've made up my mind to chuck it
before they fire me.

536
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:55,035
I've been down there two whole years
and haven't accomplished a darn thing.

537
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,906
I'm no good. I'm worse at science
than I was at doctoring.

538
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,645
You mustn't say such things.
I won't have it.

539
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:05,746
You may be on the verge
of a great discovery this very minute.

540
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,485
I've got kind of a feeling that you are.

541
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,084
No. don't look at me like that.
I mean it.

542
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,859
And you'll feel much better
when you've had your dinner. too.

543
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,298
It's a swell dinner. I bought
a beautiful fish this afternoon.

544
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,237
Fish.

545
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,431
I wish you'd get that old lab
out of your mind.

546
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,599
I'm through with the lab. all right.

547
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,018
I'm not hungry. Lee.

548
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,923
Neither am I.

549
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,791
I think I'll go for a walk.

550
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,259
- I'll come along.
- In this snow?

551
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,768
I love snow. Come on.
I'll get your things.

552
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,666
We'll hike across the park. Martin.

553
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,006
It'll be like
the Canadian Northwest tonight.

554
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,552
The park's this way!

555
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:53,791
- Why. Lee. sweet!
- I thought you'd be coming back here.

556
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,391
And you... you tagged along all that way?
You poor kid.

557
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,095
That's all right. I didn't mind.

558
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,270
I'm a brute. You ought
to get a new husband.

559
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,269
- Come inside. I'll get you a taxi.
- I don't want a taxi.

560
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,439
- Let me go up with you.
- But. my dear. l...

561
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:15,246
- I have to work. It may be late.
- I don't care. I won't bother you.

562
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,618
I promise not to open my mouth.
Only please. don't send me home.

563
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,351
It-it's such a scary night...

564
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,588
- I'll imagine things.
- What things?

565
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,156
Things.

566
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,059
All right. Come along.

567
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,417
Well... what...

568
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:52,648
What is it?

569
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,952
It's got me. Something funny.

570
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,693
I left these three flasks
thick with bugs.

571
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,729
And these two
are still thick with them.

572
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,863
But this one...

573
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,573
They've completely disappeared
from this one.

574
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,810
Nothing ever happened
like that before.

575
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,278
Is that good luck or bad?
I wouldn't know.

576
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,372
I don't know. We're just starting on
something new. it's...

577
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,045
- Then it is bad luck. I'm sorry.
- I don't know that it's bad.

578
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,287
Might be something...

579
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,627
...better than anything.

580
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,799
Quick. Lee. light that...
light the burner.

581
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,919
Give me that stain.

582
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,081
No. the other one.

583
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,852
What is it. Martin?

584
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:41,019
I was right. They're dead.

585
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,498
Bugs don't commit suicide.
What killed them?

586
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,727
Does it matter?

587
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,497
"Does it matter?"
Lee. I'll say it matters.

588
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,266
Something in this clear flask
killed them.

589
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,847
Maybe it was some fool mistake of mine.
but I've got to find out what it is.

590
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,387
Because it might...
it might just happen that...

591
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,214
...that it turns out to be
the greatest thing...

592
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,554
How?

593
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,026
I won't say it. I won't throw my luck.
I'm going to work it out.

594
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,086
- Tomorrow. Martin.
- No. no. tonight.

595
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,995
Right now. You go home
and get some sleep.

596
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,433
What I need... I've got to have
some of...

597
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,937
some clean flasks.

598
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:36,011
That is enough of chemistry
for today. Terry.

599
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:41,651
We go out now. and drink
maybe one glass of beer.

600
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,956
Maybe one. maybe two. Sounds
reasonable. Chief. I'll get Martin.

601
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,759
Where's he been keeping himself lately?
I haven't seen him since...

602
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,869
- For the love of Pete!
- Martin. what is it?

603
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,770
- Been working.
- You look it.

604
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,036
All night long. Two nights.
a couple of weeks. I don't know. Look.

605
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,244
Notes. Wish you'd look at them. Chief.

606
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,714
- Think I may have found something.
- What?

607
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,080
Don't ask me.

608
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,817
All I know is it's...
it's hell on the bugs.

609
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,793
Dissolves them. eats them up.

610
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,261
slaughters them. wipes them off the...

611
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,890
You're groggy. aren't you?

612
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:29,032
It's all right. Terry. I fancy
I must have been all in...

613
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,937
when I started.

614
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,999
I need sleep.

615
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,138
Food.

616
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,079
I need a drink.
Terry. I need that more than anything.

617
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,582
I'll get it for you.

618
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,357
Here. Just wrap yourself around this.
Two shakes of a lamb's tail.

619
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,346
What?

620
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,789
You have a big thing here.

621
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,522
A great thing.

622
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,029
Terry. Iook.

623
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,527
N o

624
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,464
Now you must find out what it is.

625
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,738
How many different kinds of bacteria
it will destroy.

626
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,439
That way you will find out
what it is good for.

627
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,614
You will begin working in earnest.

628
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,084
I am very glad. Martin.

629
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,121
I'm glad you feel that way. sir.

630
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,716
Boy! You are shooting high!
We're gonna celebrate.

631
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,386
I don't care how tired you are.
we're gonna celebrate.

632
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,590
- I always knew the kid had talent!
- Thanks. Terry.

633
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,459
- What do you mean by getting up?
- I got to go back to work.

634
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,197
Look at you!

635
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,000
What's wrong with me?
I shaved.

636
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,838
You promised you'd stay in bed 12 hours.
and you haven't been there three.

637
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,242
I couldn't sleep those three hours.

638
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,474
I'm not gonna have any more of this.
do you hear that?

639
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,209
I'm not gonna stand by
and see you kill yourself.

640
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,910
I'll walk out on you. I mean it.

641
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:25,250
You mustn't ever say that.
no matter how mad you get.

642
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,984
Lee. I love you so.

643
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,384
Even if this darned work
does tie me up.

644
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,760
I know I've been neglecting you.

645
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,321
But when this is over.

646
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,233
I'll take time off every day.
and we'll go to the movies.

647
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,065
and we'll have friends in.

648
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,606
and I'll send you flowers
every morning.

649
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,504
Nice big red roses.

650
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,736
I'll even learn to play bridge.

651
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,482
Stand by. old girl.

652
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,586
Have some coffee?

653
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,117
You got the nastiest way of treating me.
Martin Arrowsmith.

654
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:05,719
As if I wanted flowers every morning.
All I want is for you to take care of yourself.

655
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,321
You're a rotten husband.

656
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,060
But I'd rather have you
than all the decent ones in the world.

657
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,398
Please. go back to bed!

658
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,336
What is it?

659
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,274
- Where's my hat?
- What's the matter?

660
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,443
That cheap publicity hound Tubbs
is the matter! Murder's the matter!

661
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,680
Make a cheap fake
out of me. will he!

662
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,120
You wait a minute!

663
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,893
You forgot your...

664
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,030
- Hello. Dr. Arrowsmith.
- How about a picture?

665
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,502
- Very good.
- Is Mr. Tubbs down yet?

666
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,232
Yes. Dr. Arrowsmith.
I'll see if he's engaged.

667
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,365
- No. I'll see for myself.
- Just a minute. Doctor!

668
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,508
- Good morning. Martin.
- Are you responsible for this?

669
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:02,347
I don't deny the responsibility.
I claim it.

670
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:06,116
A slight overstatement
to catch the public eye...

671
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,713
A slight overstatement.

672
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,588
You tell the papers
that I can cure all disease

673
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,718
when you know I can't even cure
whooping cough yet.

674
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,820
And you call that
"a slight overstatement."

675
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,798
- I can understand your surprise.
- My surprise?

676
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,732
My only surprise is that
I don't wring your fat neck.

677
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:23,000
- My husband's a violent man.
- I know your husband.

678
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:26,600
And I mean the world to know him
and appreciate him as I do.

679
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,543
After all. he's still
got his name to make.

680
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:30,705
You've done that for me.

681
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,715
You've made my name smell
from one end of this country to the other

682
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,580
as a quack and a faker
and a racketeer.

683
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,450
Call your reporters in
and tell them I'm through with you

684
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:42,549
and your front page publicity
and your cheapjack institute.

685
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:47,154
I'd much rather tell them
of the paper I've just signed.

686
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,858
Yes. Dr. Gottlieb.
We are busy at the moment.

687
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,796
Busy turning my friend Martin
into a megaphone.

688
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:58,204
- That's all right. Chief.
- Something has happened.

689
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,108
But it's something
not altogether bad.

690
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,412
Martin is not the discoverer
we thought he was.

691
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,483
But you don't mean that someone
has stolen...

692
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:15,423
Yes. A Frenchman. D'Herelle
of the Pasteur Institute of Paris.

693
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,928
He has published his report.

694
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,553
It is the same thing.

695
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:27,026
You have got into the newspapers
too soon. Dr. Tubbs.

696
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,834
Of course. there can be no talk
of the Head of Department now.

697
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,932
No raise of salary. either.

698
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,611
Well l... I've got to say something
to those reporters.

699
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,221
I am sorry. Martin.

700
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,850
Come to my office later.

701
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,635
I love that man Gottlieb.
He might have gloated.

702
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:37,070
Three stowaways
in the hold. sir. dead.

703
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,907
What is it?

704
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,519
Come on. Sondelius.
we have a look.

705
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:02,027
Where was your last port of call?

706
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,623
Blackwater. St. Hubert Isle.

707
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:08,967
Did you hear anything there
about bubonic plague?

708
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,007
- No.
- No.

709
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:15,170
These three men
died of bubonic plague.

710
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,645
I tell you. gentlemen.

711
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,622
in West India
is bubonic plague.

712
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,023
Are you certain of this.
Dr. Sondelius?

713
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,651
I have investigate.

714
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,926
If you don't believe me. call up
my good friend Captain Gunnersson

715
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,560
of the steamer <i>Sverker.</i>
He will tell you.

716
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:44,198
He live by the hotel... What the devil's
the name of that hotel in Hoboken?

717
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,903
My dear Dr. Sondelius.
I'm not questioning your authority.

718
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,605
but it's difficult to believe
that in the West Indies...

719
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,377
Nothing is difficult to believe
where rats are concerned.

720
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,012
I am no novice at rats neither.
Dr. Tubbs.

721
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:02,491
I am only novice
in scientific institutions

722
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,292
where. all day long. scientists
sit and look through microscopes

723
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,661
and see nothing.

724
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,256
But. my dear Dr. Sondelius!

725
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:15,464
- In common justice to a fine institution...
- Excuse me. Dr. Tubbs.

726
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,233
Yes. Miss Robbins?

727
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,707
A cable just came from London.
Doctor.

728
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,904
It's from the Colonial Office.

729
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,048
There. Dr. Sondelius.
is your confirmation.

730
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,350
I don't need none.

731
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,289
I should like the Institute
to have a part in this.

732
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:40,625
Miss Robbins. ask Dr. Arrowsmith if he
can receive Dr. Sondelius and myself.

733
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:41,755
Yes. Doctor.

734
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,296
Well. what does Dr. Arrowsmith...?

735
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,901
Only one year ago.
one little year. Dr. Tubbs.

736
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:52,908
you were so excited about
my friend Arrowsmith's discovery.

737
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,638
Oh. yes. to be sure!

738
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,077
But that was...

739
00:56:57,147 --> 00:57:00,844
Only something that killed bacteria.
that is all?

740
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,920
Thank you. Dr. Gottlieb!

741
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,388
- I wonder...
- I think so.

742
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,915
Arrowsmith...

743
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,791
Don't I know that name?

744
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:16,457
Young fellow? Dark?
Mustache?

745
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:20,560
Sure! Didn't I got drunk with him
in Montreal?

746
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,333
No. no. Indianap...

747
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,408
Well. well. Arrowsmith.
it is the same.

748
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,913
How are you. my friend?

749
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:36,181
So. you are become great!

750
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:41,349
You hold the stuff of salvation
in your hands.

751
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,949
I'd like to believe that.
I can't quite believe it yet. though.

752
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,793
Martin is a very careful fellow.
Dr. Sondelius.

753
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,731
He has only worked
one year on this discovery.

754
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,031
After five years. he may be confident
that he is right.

755
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:57,266
Five years?
He cannot wait for five years.

756
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:03,176
In five years. the whole population
of the West Indies will be wiped out.

757
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,909
The bubonic plague
will be raging in New York.

758
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,110
I don't know anything
about bubonic plague.

759
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:14,521
But I know. I will teach you
what I learn in China and in India.

760
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,287
Give me blood germs.
give me rats.

761
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,295
rat fleas. little jumpy fleas.

762
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:24,891
I will teach you what I learned
in China and India.

763
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:28,563
I will show you.
Then I will go with you.

764
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:33,070
So. you are off
to the West Indies tomorrow.

765
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,235
That's right. sir.

766
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:40,510
We have called you in. Terry and I.
to give you your final instructions.

767
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,983
What are they. sir?

768
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:47,580
Can you be trusted. Martin. to conduct
an experiment where you are going?

769
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,559
What is the experiment?

770
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:57,926
It is agreed that it will be of value to know
what this stuff of yours is good for.

771
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,935
Why. yes. of course.

772
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:00,992
Well...

773
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,467
If you could give injections to. say...

774
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,806
only half your patients.

775
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,643
and sternly deprive
the other half of them...

776
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,147
then you would know.

777
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,412
I certainly would. yes.

778
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,116
That is the experiment. Martin.

779
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,866
I've done that sort of thing with cattle.
but. good Lord. these are human beings.

780
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,734
So. you're just
a country doctor. after all.

781
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,966
Country doctor be blowed.
I've got compassion in me.

782
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,441
These people are gonna be dying
and begging me for help.

783
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,671
It's up to you to stand up
and take it on the chin.

784
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:47,182
So many men are kind and neighborly.
so few ever add to human knowledge.

785
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,684
It's a good deal to ask. just the same.

786
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:54,280
Spare your pity
for generations not yet born. Martin.

787
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:57,986
and you may be
the man to end all plague.

788
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,026
I am an old man. Martin.

789
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,435
I have been an honest scientist
all my life.

790
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,565
I look to you to carry on
my work after me.

791
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,571
Are you going to fail me?

792
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,846
No. sir. no. I am not going to fail you.

793
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,045
I...

794
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,283
I knew.

795
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:35,055
For the old man's sake.
keep your notes complete down there.

796
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,156
And keep them in ink.

797
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,098
You sound as though
you thought I wasn't coming back.

798
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,136
Don't be silly.

799
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,709
All ashore who's going ashore!

800
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,718
I'm not much
of a seeing-off committee.

801
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,450
but good luck to you down there
and take care of yourself.

802
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,651
- Take care of Gottlieb.
- I will.

803
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:04,784
Good luck to you. Doctor.

804
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:08,558
We will drink your health
in good West Indian rum.

805
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,459
It's time. Lee.

806
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,471
Yes. Martin.

807
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,904
We won't say good-bye.

808
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:23,074
- Will you try not to be too lonely?
- I will.

809
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,373
That's a brave girl.

810
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,973
Excuse me. madam. but which cabin
does the trunk belong in?

811
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,046
- In Dr. Arrowsmith's. of course.
- Yes. madam.

812
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,578
- Wait. I haven't got a trunk.
- Don't confuse him. It's my trunk.

813
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,318
- What do you mean. your trunk?
- You had to find out sooner or later

814
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:37,859
that I'm going along with you.

815
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,862
- Lee. you're not.
- Yes. I am. in spite of everything.

816
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,832
You'll do no such thing.
Hold that gangplank!

817
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:45,890
On board?

818
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,868
- What is it. Doctor?
- Get her ashore.

819
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:50,428
- Have to step lively. madam.
- No. I won't step lively.

820
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,940
I told you I wouldn't let you go there
without me and I meant it.

821
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:56,103
And you can't put me off. Nobody
but the captain can. I've got a ticket.

822
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,840
- No. Lee. please!
- I love you.

823
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:00,712
- She stays.
- Step to the cabin. madam.

824
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,584
I shall divide my group into two halves.

825
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:11,993
To one. I shall give
injections of our serum.

826
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,899
I shall deprive the other half
of any injections whatsoever.

827
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:22,063
I shall then watch which half
resists the plague more successfully.

828
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,231
When I have done that.
I shall know what our serum is worth.

829
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,605
Good heavens!
The man's a lunatic.

830
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,746
Order. gentlemen. order. order.

831
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:34,442
I can handle this. Order.

832
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,246
Do you mean to say you can't find

833
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,446
any other way to test your serum?

834
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,182
There is no other way.

835
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,557
You call yourself a doctor
and want to see half your patients die?

836
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:48,427
No. sir. no. no. The uninjected half
will be fully as well taken care of

837
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,227
as they are at present.

838
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,462
You actually propose
using the inhabitants of this island

839
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,096
as you use guinea pigs
in your laboratories?

840
01:02:56,172 --> 01:03:01,200
Well. you put it unpleasantly. Sir Robert.
but that is what I do precisely propose.

841
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,768
and for precisely
the same benefit to mankind.

842
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:07,748
Well. we decline the honor
in the name of civilization.

843
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,114
Hear. hear!
Hear. hear!

844
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,916
I think civilization's on my side.
Sir Robert.

845
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,424
You see only this one epidemic
on this island.

846
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:20,792
I have to see whole continents
and generations of children yet unborn

847
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,991
in China. in India. and even.
it seems. in your own West Indies.

848
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:28,264
I have to say to all humanity.
"This is the prevention. this is the cure.

849
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:31,238
"You may count on it as you count
on quinine for malaria

850
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,138
and castor oil for the bellyache."

851
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,507
Because that is
what humanity wants to hear.

852
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,876
Humanity is not going to hear it
at our expense.

853
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,676
Well said. Sir Robert!

854
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:40,738
N o

855
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,615
While you are on this island.
you stick to your doctoring.

856
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,951
- That is for me to say. not you.
- What the devil do you mean?

857
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,821
I mean that if you
prevent this experiment.

858
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:53,885
my instructions leave me free to withhold
my serum until you come to heel.

859
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,863
Confound your instructions.

860
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,628
But what...
what are we going to do. sir Robert?

861
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,669
Sir Robert.
hadn't we better reconsider?

862
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,260
Order. order.

863
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,737
This meeting is adjourned.

864
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,865
But. Sir Robert. what shall we do?

865
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:07,500
Die like men...

866
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,910
before we let these bandits
turn us into a shambles.

867
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,278
If it weren't for the quarantine.

868
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,910
I'd drive them off the island
with whips and scorpions.

869
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,731
Sir Robert is quite right.
I tell you this...

870
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,603
- That was a fine fight.
- If I hadn't lost it.

871
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:39,869
You didn't mean that.
about holding the serum back?

872
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:43,434
I made them think I meant it.
Call me inhuman!

873
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,072
I'll show them
what the word really means!

874
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,146
How's that. Gottlieb?

875
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:54,949
Dr. Arrowsmith.

876
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,828
My name is Oliver Marchand.
Dr. Marchand.

877
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,866
I have my M.D. from Howard University.

878
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,699
I've been listening
to your proposal. Doctor.

879
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,999
I need hardly say
that it has my complete sympathy.

880
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,231
Thank you.

881
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,467
May I offer you an alternative?

882
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,133
If you care to come along with me.

883
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,940
I believe I can provide
the opportunity you're after.

884
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,148
- Did you hear that. Gustav?
- Yeah. I hear.

885
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:23,981
It will be a privilege to assist you.

886
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:29,116
And if you succeed. it will be a privilege
for my people to have served the world.

887
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,121
How soon will you be starting?

888
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,596
If you'll come over to my place...

889
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:44,263
You don't have to tell me.
it came off all right.

890
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,776
For once you're wrong. Lee.
It couldn't have come off worse.

891
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:49,606
That is. until my savior turned up.

892
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,147
This is my savior.
Dr. Marchand. my wife.

893
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,582
- How do you do?
- Come in. Doctor.

894
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,345
We've got to move fast.
no time to lose.

895
01:05:56,419 --> 01:06:00,822
I'll put my things in here.
Lee. throw some clothes in a knapsack.

896
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,256
- You're going away?
- You bet I'm going.

897
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,816
- With him?
- With him. God bless him.

898
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,920
He had the nerve to take a chance
and let me do my stuff.

899
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,261
Yes. he's a man after my own heart.

900
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,630
Wait. where are you going?

901
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,828
To his district. Island of Carib.

902
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:18,101
Native population. plague raging.
Ideal conditions.

903
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:19,732
- Are you going now?
- As soon as we get packed.

904
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,004
Sondelius is out chasing up
his squad of rat catchers.

905
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,012
You might put his things in.
too. will you?

906
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,140
- Excuse me. Doctor.
- I'll wait outside.

907
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:30,778
What is it. Lee?

908
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:37,184
Are you planning to leave me behind?

909
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:39,454
Lee. I've got to.

910
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,962
I didn't come here to be left behind.

911
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:44,556
I should have choked you
before I brought you along here.

912
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,692
You did everything but choke me
to stop me.

913
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,897
But now that I'm here.
I'm not going to be left behind.

914
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,098
I've come here to look after you.

915
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,731
How can I look after you
if you leave me behind?

916
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,368
- I'll be all right. sweet.
- How do I know that?

917
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,968
lt... it might get you.

918
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,480
And if it did. there's nobody
but me could nurse you.

919
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:03,416
And even if it didn't get you.
I'd go mad being without you.

920
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,049
Can't you see?
I haven't got any life beside you.

921
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:10,854
I'm you. and I've got to be with you.
You cannot leave me behind.

922
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:14,123
Lee. sweet.
Be reasonable.

923
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:18,155
We don't know where we'll be living off.
what we'll be getting into.

924
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,600
I daren't take you along with me.
It's no place for a woman.

925
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,035
Darn being a woman!

926
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,370
Give me the comfort
of knowing you're safe.

927
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,438
- All right.
- There's a brave girl.

928
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:32,879
N o

929
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,178
Now. will you help me
with this knapsack?

930
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,121
Bella?

931
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,124
Will you come in here. Bella?

932
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,090
Bella. I want you to pack
the doctors' knapsacks for them.

933
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:51,998
I want you to put in their pajamas.
the thin ones.

934
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,229
and their underwear
and their socks.

935
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:57,636
And. Bella. their razor. toothbrushes.
and toothpaste.

936
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,506
Can I help you. Martin?
I'm all right now. Sorry I cracked up.

937
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,705
That's a good girl.

938
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,510
Now. here we are.
Alcohol. serum...

939
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,414
hypodermics. notebooks.
Yes. they're ready.

940
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,214
- Fountain pen.
- Fountain pen. Thanks.

941
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,518
- How about these? You want these?
- No. I don't want those.

942
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,019
Have you got any water boiling
on the stove?

943
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,688
There should be.

944
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,232
Stick the whole works in. will you?

945
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,758
- I can't leave those around.
- What is it?

946
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,065
Plague virus.

947
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,300
Enough to kill half a dozen armies.

948
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,003
Everything's ready. missy.

949
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:39,403
All right.

950
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,616
I'm off to glory. Lee.
Wish me luck.

951
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,056
I can't go outside.

952
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,092
Will you kiss me good-bye here?

953
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:30,257
No. no. Lee. Steady. old girl.

954
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,062
This is only the first of our big hikes.

955
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,262
If I pull this thing off
on Marchand's island.

956
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,134
I'll be a great man in science.

957
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,402
I do love you. Martin.

958
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,875
Wait for me. Lee. I won't be long.

959
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,152
Here's where we land. Doctor.
It's the island of Carib.

960
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,753
You can see the jetty
right ahead of us.

961
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:37,264
The worst-infected place
in the entire colony.

962
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,767
You'll have plenty of opportunity here
to do what you want.

963
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,869
Voodoo.

964
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:57,309
Their voodoo is just about as effective
as anything we've been able to do.

965
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,787
Yeah. we show them
a new kind of voodoo.

966
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:25,412
The only thing to do with this place
is to burn it.

967
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,745
- If we can only get the authority.
- We'll take the authority.

968
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:30,341
General Sondelius is now in command.

969
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,114
We'll get these people out of here
and find them a clean place.

970
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:35,384
We'll take off our coats and get to work.
We'll get in the supplies.

971
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,357
- The medical supplies.
- And build a hospital.

972
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,986
Sure. we'll kill the rats.
the bugs. the germs.

973
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,360
I'll get these people out of here.

974
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:56,374
Here. here is food.
canned food.

975
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,504
- Where is the owner?
- The owner lives in London.

976
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,104
- How about the agent?
- The agent. he's dead.

977
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,650
- Who are you?
- I'm watchman.

978
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:06,313
Good. you are a fine watchman.
Break down the door. Come on.

979
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,227
What the devil is the meaning of this?

980
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,636
You have empty bunkhouses
and beds.

981
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,141
We want them right away
for emergency hospital.

982
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:31,407
If you think you're going to bring
that filthy plague onto this plantation.

983
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,072
you can go to blazes!

984
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:35,582
That's just where we are going.
We accept your hospitality.

985
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:36,777
Martin. move in.

986
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,012
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

987
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,625
- All right. Gustav.
- Yeah. Martin.

988
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:30,798
Don't forget. half to get the injection.
half to be sternly deprived.

989
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,932
All right. Marchand. let them in.

990
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,370
We're off. Gottlieb.

991
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,469
All right. two lines here.
Right and left.

992
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,674
Go on.
Go on through.

993
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,946
- Don't we get nothing. Doctor?
- Not on the right. Keep moving.

994
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,918
It's Dr. Arrowsmith's orders.

995
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:50,755
Half to the left. half to right.
You ought to be glad to be hurting.

996
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,139
I'm sorry. I can't do anything
for him. poor baby.

997
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,937
You take him.

998
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,755
Don't holler before you're hurting.

999
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:37,563
I am clumsy.

1000
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,836
That's four hypodermics
I broke this morning.

1001
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,842
Get some more
from Dr. Arrowsmith.

1002
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,879
Hot. <i>ja?</i>

1003
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:57,084
I think I'll sit down.

1004
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,258
Just a little.

1005
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:25,252
I apologize if I seemed to be
unfriendly last night. Doctor.

1006
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,720
Didn't know what you were up to then.

1007
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:30,519
I approve thoroughly.

1008
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:33,026
Indeed. it's splendid
what you're doing. Doctor.

1009
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,394
No objections to giving us a shot?
We stood in line with the rest.

1010
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,433
We'll step over to the other line if you like.

1011
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,765
Doctor. this is my daughter.

1012
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,632
And this is Mrs. Lanyon.
from your New York.

1013
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,334
Marooned here with the rest of us.

1014
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:51,470
That's quite all right if you'll get
into line with the rest.

1015
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:01,745
I didn't mean to be rude just now.
but you took me by surprise.

1016
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,822
I wish you'd find something
I could do to help you.

1017
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:05,985
You?

1018
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,656
Yes. I feel an awful rotter
doing nothing.

1019
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,289
You!

1020
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,427
Why? Do I strike you
as being so hopelessly useless?

1021
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,806
If I had a twin sister.
I think she'd be rather like you.

1022
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,309
That's how you strike me.

1023
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,180
That's an original compliment.

1024
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,008
That's no compliment.
it's a scientific fact.

1025
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,350
Now. would you pass along. please.
and let science carry on?

1026
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,083
All right. Miss Twyford.

1027
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,959
Dr. Sondelius is sick. sir.
Would you come right away?

1028
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:49,196
Sondelius sick?

1029
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,039
What's the matter with him?

1030
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,975
Here. Marchand!
You take over for me. I've got to...

1031
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,341
Gustav!

1032
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:05,979
- What is it. Gustav. what is it?
- I don't know. Martin.

1033
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,820
I'm not feel so good all day.
but now l...

1034
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:18,831
Good Lord.

1035
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,061
Maybe the bugs have got me. Martin.

1036
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:23,434
You wouldn't take your shot before.
but you're gonna take it now.

1037
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:26,133
- Quick. bring me one of those trays.
- At my age!

1038
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:31,168
I was just thinking. Martin.
I am nearly 60 years of age.

1039
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:36,380
I could lift weights once
no sailor could touch.

1040
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:40,116
And now... l'm so weak. I...

1041
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:42,179
- Bring me a glass of rum.
- No. Later.

1042
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:45,351
You're going to take this shot now
and go back to Blackwater

1043
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,587
and have Leora nurse you.

1044
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:52,066
I. who have quarantined so many.
It is my turn now.

1045
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:58,472
Why the devil didn't I bring
Leora along with me?

1046
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:18,345
No chance?

1047
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:20,753
Steadily worse. I'm afraid.

1048
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,551
Thanks. Don't let us keep you.

1049
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:35,760
- Rain.
- Only a shower. I'll take you home.

1050
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,271
No. you go. Mr. Twyford.
I'll wait. if you don't mind.

1051
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,035
You'll get soaked.

1052
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,047
You ever think

1053
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:50,949
the jokes God plays?

1054
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:54,916
The best one is on the tropics.

1055
01:19:56,191 --> 01:20:01,219
He made them so beautiful
and so rich.

1056
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:04,060
And then He give them the plague.

1057
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,267
All right. I am quite peaceful.

1058
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,775
Did you ever see Sto...

1059
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,277
You ever see Stockholm?

1060
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:28,354
I would like just once more to see
the Strandvagen at dawn.

1061
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:33,690
with the young snow falling white.

1062
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:36,230
and stagger home through it

1063
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:40,325
with one more last good drunk.

1064
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,102
I feel fine now.

1065
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,074
I think I'm a little weak.

1066
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,317
It's a great life.

1067
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:12,498
You try to save all these poor devils.

1068
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,498
Save all of them.

1069
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:20,107
Let science experiments go.

1070
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:28,471
I never knew before
people could hurt me so much.

1071
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:35,150
I think I'll sleep... just a little.

1072
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,206
I'm sorry.

1073
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:34,309
He used to troupe all over the country
lecturing on heroes of health.

1074
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,714
Now he's one of them. all right.

1075
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,712
It was good of you to come.

1076
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,779
You take it pretty calmly. Doctor.

1077
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,416
When one of your field officers
in the war died in battle.

1078
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:45,925
you couldn't stop to mourn for him.

1079
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:49,657
You must come home with us.
You must let us put you up.

1080
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,894
Well. thanks. I...

1081
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,697
I'd love to.

1082
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,464
But I can't come
till Marchand and I have...

1083
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:59,268
Let me send down two men
to do it for you.

1084
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:03,334
I'd rather do it myself. if you don't mind.
It's little enough.

1085
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,842
And then?

1086
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,889
Why. then. we...
we carry on. of course.

1087
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:33,502
Lord. Lord

1088
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:35,634
Lord. Lord

1089
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:44,416
Why hast Thou turned
Thy face away. Lord?

1090
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:47,614
Lord. save us

1091
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,749
Lord. preserve us

1092
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:56,730
Lord. don't let thy children die

1093
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,198
Lord. Lord

1094
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,031
Oh. Lord

1095
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:07,066
Arrowsmith. where are you?
Well. there you are.

1096
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,901
Your friend Marchand
wants to see you.

1097
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,570
Hello. Marchand.
Nothing wrong down below?

1098
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,978
I've been called back to Blackwater.

1099
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:17,082
I hope your working with me
hasn't made trouble for you.

1100
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:21,020
The port doctor is down. Seems there's
no one but me to call on now.

1101
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,653
You'll have to go. then.

1102
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:26,060
That means I'll have to stay longer
than I expected.

1103
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:31,057
I had intended putting Marchand
in charge of our show. but now...

1104
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:32,565
Well. somebody's got to watch things.

1105
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:35,364
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you care to. Doctor.

1106
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,701
- Ten days should do it. Doctor.
- Ten days.

1107
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:43,568
Is there anything I can do for you
in Blackwater?

1108
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:46,637
You might look in
on my wife. Marchand. Tell her...

1109
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:49,205
- Tell her not to worry.
- Certainly.

1110
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,348
Hold a while. please.
he'll be here in a minute.

1111
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,124
- It's for you. Arrowsmith.
- Thanks.

1112
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,996
Dr. Arrowsmith?

1113
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,205
This is Marchand calling
from Blackwater.

1114
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,036
Yes. Marchand. what is it?

1115
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:27,776
I can't hear you. Marchand.

1116
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:33,280
Are you there. Marchand?

1117
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:40,325
Operator. operator. get me
the Surgeon General's office back again.

1118
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,794
Dr. Marchand.

1119
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,496
Well. you've got to make them answer.

1120
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:54,134
Then send somebody over there at once.
Dr. Marchand's ill.

1121
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,904
This is Dr. Arrowsmith at Carib.

1122
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:00,209
No. I'm two hours away.
Send somebody at once. Anybody.

1123
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:01,771
My dear fellow!

1124
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,984
It's Marchand.
It's more than Marchand. it's my wife.

1125
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:12,390
I've got to get her over here. I've got to.
She'll be alone in that hole now.

1126
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:15,429
- Bring her here. of course.
- Certainly. bring her here.

1127
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,931
- How soon can I get her here?
- How soon?

1128
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,366
What if I start now? Have you got
a boat of some sort?

1129
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:23,336
Yes. I'll get it ready.

1130
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,051
You have...
You have...

1131
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,689
You have to come home.

1132
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:24,096
Help me. Martin.

1133
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:41,707
Please.

1134
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:47,217
Gone. Missy gone.

1135
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:58,295
M goo
M goo

1136
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:00,527
M goo

1137
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:09,070
Lee! Leora. wake up. we're here!

1138
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:40,936
She's dead.

1139
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,270
I thought she'd be safe!

1140
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:45,841
But she's dead.

1141
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:48,014
We'd better pick her up.

1142
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:56,352
No. let me.

1143
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:58,118
I'd rather...

1144
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:17,542
I loved you. Lee.
You knew that. didn't you?

1145
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:20,012
Didn't you know
I couldn't love anyone else?

1146
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:23,116
Didn't you know that. Lee?

1147
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,187
Give them all the serum.
Shoot 'em full of it.

1148
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,454
Come on. open the doors.
let 'em all in!

1149
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:35,359
- Open the doors!
- Come on!

1150
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,755
Let them in!

1151
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:42,098
Come. come. children.
Let them in.

1152
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:44,434
Go on. hurry. hurry.

1153
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:46,473
Go around.
Get all your...

1154
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:49,840
Doctor. l... I just...
Great job.

1155
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:51,970
Thank you in the name of the colony.

1156
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:55,277
I'm licked! You never beat me.
but I'm licked.

1157
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:57,283
Go on. line up. get your shot.

1158
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:59,649
Get over there. get your shot.
all of you.

1159
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:07,819
Go on. line up.
Get your shot full of serum.

1160
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,534
Kill all the rats.

1161
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:18,633
Burn all the villages.

1162
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:29,348
To hell with the experiment.
to hell with science.

1163
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,612
to hell with Gottlieb!

1164
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:22,232
My dear Martin.
congratulations.

1165
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,897
There's never been anything like it.
It's stupendous!

1166
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:28,499
Letters from the British government.
You have ended plague.

1167
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:30,976
M oa ca o o

1168
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:34,378
In my enthusiasm of the moment.
I forgot.

1169
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,643
My deepest sympathy.

1170
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:39,709
Great story. Dr. Arrowsmith.
Tell us all about it. Do.

1171
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:45,486
Keep on the left.
On the left. folks.

1172
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:49,690
On the left. folks.

1173
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:52,790
You'll have to hurry.
my dear fellow.

1174
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:55,802
My man will take care
of your luggage for you.

1175
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,533
- Hold it. right there.
- Right there. please.

1176
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,075
That's fine. One more.

1177
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:03,940
Hold still. Just a minute. Doctor.

1178
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:05,774
Right. We'll get another one.
Doctor. Please.

1179
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:09,145
- One more. now. Very nice.
- Right this way. Doctor.

1180
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:12,045
What have you got to tell us?

1181
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:14,246
- Hello. Martin.
- Hello. Terry.

1182
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,290
- Sorry. Martin.
- Thanks. Terry.

1183
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:19,417
- How was it?
- Bungled it. Terry.

1184
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:23,293
- Afraid you had.
- What'll Gottlieb say?

1185
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:26,060
You'll find that out.

1186
01:33:26,133 --> 01:33:29,398
- How is the old man?
- Well. I'm afraid he's...

1187
01:33:33,741 --> 01:33:35,208
Dr. Gottlieb?

1188
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:40,010
Are you ready?

1189
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:43,749
- What for should I be ready?
- For the reception. Doctor.

1190
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,184
They're bringing him up
in the elevator now.

1191
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,722
He will come to me.

1192
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:53,783
He is my son.
More than my son.

1193
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,261
Even if you do make a clown
out of him.

1194
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:59,026
Out of my laboratory with your...
your nonsense.

1195
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:35,557
Dr. Mayne. how d'you do?
Glad you're here.

1196
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:38,799
- Where's Dr. Gottlieb?
- We'll send for him.

1197
01:34:38,873 --> 01:34:42,468
- Will you fetch Dr. Gottlieb. please?
- No. please. I'll go to him.

1198
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:48,738
Master and pupil. you know.

1199
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,689
I want to confess.

1200
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:11,269
You gave me everything
you knew of truth.

1201
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,906
And when you gave me my chance
as well. I betrayed you.

1202
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:19,937
I had an excuse. perhaps.
but I don't want to go into that.

1203
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:22,411
Because whatever I may
have accomplished.

1204
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:25,611
I did not add to knowledge.

1205
01:35:25,686 --> 01:35:29,053
I did the humane thing.
I lost sight of science.

1206
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:34,853
Now. say what you've got to say
and throw me out.

1207
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,638
Dr. Gottlieb!

1208
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:56,413
Martin. what's happened?

1209
01:35:56,484 --> 01:35:58,645
- Dr. Gottlieb.
- He's had a stroke.

1210
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,156
This is most unfortunate.
I mean. coming at a time like this.

1211
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:11,827
He's gone down into the darkness
believing in you. Martin.

1212
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:23,871
He never understood a word I said.
Not a word.

1213
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:27,107
No. no. of course.
He couldn't have.

1214
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:29,649
But you really must pull yourself
together. you know.

1215
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:32,311
We've got to get through
with this luncheon.

1216
01:36:32,386 --> 01:36:36,015
in spite of Dr. Gottlieb's
regrettable collapse.

1217
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:38,081
But before we go in.

1218
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,356
I want to tell you that from now on.
you're department head.

1219
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,453
with 15.000 a year.

1220
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:46,659
I guess that ought to buck you up.

1221
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:49,302
How are you. Martin?

1222
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,065
You didn't expect to see me. did you?

1223
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:54,107
I know all you've been through.

1224
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:57,702
If my friendship has any meaning
for you. will you take that?

1225
01:36:57,778 --> 01:36:59,541
For all it's worth. Martin.

1226
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:05,112
I'm taking him away now.
where he can be looked after.

1227
01:37:05,286 --> 01:37:07,618
But I want to tell you
what I'm going to do then.

1228
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:11,146
I'm going to clear out of this swell joint
with all its swell equipment and publicity.

1229
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:13,284
I'm going to build my own lab
in the Vermont woods.

1230
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,828
and I'm going to work.
and do nothing but work.

1231
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:17,295
And I wouldn't wonder
if you'd want to do it with me.

1232
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:21,733
because he counted on you
to carry on after him.

1233
01:37:21,802 --> 01:37:23,895
If you want me.
you'll know where to find me.

1234
01:37:25,973 --> 01:37:27,873
We are ready. Martin.

1235
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,502
Joyce. my dear.
Thank you.

1236
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:34,708
But will you try and think kindly of me.
even if you never see me again?

1237
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:37,506
I see. Martin.

1238
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:42,881
M a o o a o oa

1239
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:48,487
Ready. are you?
Well. so am I.

1240
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,164
It's all right. it's just a few things
I want to take along with me.

1241
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:57,136
Notes. notes.
where are those notes?

1242
01:37:57,204 --> 01:38:00,196
- But. my dear Martin!
- Now. what else? Yes.

1243
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:04,900
Why... what in heaven's name
are you going to do with...

1244
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:07,812
Just an old friend. Did well enough
by me before I came.

1245
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:09,611
it'll do well enough by me
after I'm gone.

1246
01:38:09,683 --> 01:38:12,447
- Gone?
- I can't stay for that luncheon after all.

1247
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:15,113
Surely the Institute deserves
better of you than this.

1248
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:17,089
It certainly does. You know
what old Gottlieb used to say?

1249
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:19,489
That the man who couldn't make
his own lab out of a few toothpicks

1250
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,723
and a bit of string had better buy
his ideas along with his fine equipment.

1251
01:38:22,796 --> 01:38:26,892
- Martin. what are you thinking of?
- The rest of my life. So long. Tubbs.

1252
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:30,135
Hey. Terry. hold your horses!

1253
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,134
Terry. wait! I'm coming with you!

1254
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:40,203
Lee and I.
we're both coming with you!
