1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,596
Operator, would you check it for me?
That line just can't still be busy.

2
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,119
All right. I'll hang on.

3
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,799
Sign here, please.

4
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,030
Yes, Mr. Groves?

5
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,879
Will you check on that shipment

6
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:14,391
of hobby horses and pinafores
to Jackson and Company?

7
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:16,990
- 'Certainly.'
- And try my home again, will you?

8
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:18,680
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,077
Hobby horses and pinafores?

10
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:23,272
What a dreamy place to work in.

11
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:25,040
Yes, I suppose it is.

12
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,437
Here's your book.

13
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:28,757
All right. Thank you.

14
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:32,719
- Well, there he is, huh, Jack?
- Yup.

15
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:36,522
- I like this change in the head.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:39,794
- Now all we have to do is find a name.
- I have a name for him.

17
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:42,484
Rex, the walkie-talkie robot man.

18
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:43,957
Uh-huh.

19
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,996
- Well, that's what he is. I like that.
- Thanks.

20
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,922
Pass the word around,
tell everyone how pleased I am.

21
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,397
You bet I will.

22
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:53,276
Rex, the walkie-talkie robot.

23
00:02:56,405 --> 00:03:00,239
- Yes, Miss Walker?
- 'Your home number is still busy.'

24
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:03,994
- What about the theatre tickets?
- 'They're sold out for this evening.'

25
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,084
'Lf you stop by the theatre,
they may have a cancellation.'

26
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:11,040
I'll do that. I hope Mrs. Groves
hasn't made other plans.

27
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,238
- 'I'll try your home again now.'
- Never mind. I'm leaving.

28
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,197
I'm going home.
See you in the morning.

29
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:21,046
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night, Mr. Groves.

30
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,166
Hello?

31
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,085
This is Ellen.

32
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,960
Oh, Gloria, hi.

33
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,477
Mum said I could stay overnight
at your house.

34
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:37,405
Isn't that absolutely atomic?

35
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:41,759
Tommy?
Yeah, he invited me to the prom.

36
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,481
I turned him down.

37
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:47,397
Just because he's the basketball champ
is no reason for him to think...

38
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,047
Dreamy looking?

39
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,125
You call him dreamy?

40
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,400
But he's only 17
and he's already 6' 4".

41
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:59,125
- Will you give that back to me?
- If you don't hang up, you've had it.

42
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,366
Yes, I'll help you with your homework.

43
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,402
I get As in biology.
It's my favourite subject.

44
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,045
- The least you can do is let me finish.
- I'll count 12. One...

45
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,243
I've got to hang up now, Gloria.
It's my brother.

46
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:15,205
Now that he's old enough to go steady,
he's an absolute mental case!

47
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:17,845
- Well, I'll see you later. Bye.
- Eight, nine...

48
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,609
Ten, eleven, twelve.

49
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:20,720
Oh!

50
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,489
Well, when can I call for you?

51
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,170
About ten minutes? Fine.

52
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:34,810
Listen, Ann,

53
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,288
are you going to be wearing
my Kappa Tau pin?

54
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,085
Oh, swell.

55
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,810
Eh? Well, you of course.

56
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,532
What about you?

57
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:47,653
Say it again.

58
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,929
- Marion?
- Shh!

59
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:54,170
- Oh, I'm sorry, son.
- Okay, Dad.

60
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,173
I'll either have to put another phone in
or buy a flock of carrier pigeons.

61
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:02,288
I've been trying to call your mother
from the office for at least an hour.

62
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,133
Marion?

63
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:06,564
- Hello, Daddy.
- Frankie. Why are you dressed up?

64
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,606
Mrs. Rogers, did you iron my sash?

65
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:12,766
- I'm waiting for the iron to get hot.
- Be very careful with it.

66
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,456
The effect will be ruined
if my sash is scorched.

67
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:16,895
Just right.

68
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,088
- Suppose you stay and supervise?
- Super what?

69
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:23,526
See that I do it correctly.

70
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,046
Hello, dear. Oh, they're beautiful.

71
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,372
- Happy birthday, Mrs. Groves.
- Thank you.

72
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:29,896
- Mother?
- Yes, dear?

73
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:32,406
- Can I borrow your baby-blue scarf?
- May I...

74
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:35,813
- May I borrow it?
- Of course. It's in my drawer.

75
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,257
- Thank you. Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

76
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,097
Oh, they're lovely.

77
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:44,177
I'll put them in a vase.

78
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:46,414
I'll do that.
You get yourself dolled up.

79
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,734
- But, Cliff...
- I've got it all arranged.

80
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:52,056
We'll drive into Los Angeles
for cocktails at the Stoddard,

81
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,658
dinner at Bordeau's...

82
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:57,977
I remembered you mentioning that show
down at the Royal so I stopped by.

83
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:02,050
I was lucky.
Two seats, first row on the aisle.

84
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,579
Oh, I could cry!

85
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,294
Going to all that trouble,
and in the rain, too.

86
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,139
Don't you know tonight
is the world-shaking event?

87
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,889
- What do you mean?
- The recital of Frankie's ballet class.

88
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,491
- I can't find the scarf anywhere.
- Darling, it's here. There you are.

89
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:17,815
Thank you.

90
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:20,853
Look, I'm very grateful
that you were born.

91
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,771
And this is the one day in the year
that belongs exclusively to you.

92
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:28,019
At my age, a birthday is a time
to turn all mirrors to the wall.

93
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:29,131
Nonsense.

94
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:33,221
You're the female Ponce de Leon,
the original fountain-of-youth girl.

95
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:35,617
- You haven't changed since...
- Mama?

96
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:36,970
Yes, dear?

97
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:40,140
Will my hair glitter across the footlights?

98
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:43,539
- Like a glow-worm, darling.
- Come and help me with my sash.

99
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:46,416
Marion, Ellen can take her
to the ballet class.

100
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:48,579
- Ellen has a date.
- Mama!

101
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:50,102
Coming, darling.

102
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,623
I've got to help her.

103
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,054
Do you know how long it is since
we were in a theatre? Three years.

104
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,573
- Impossible.
- True. Now, you get ready.

105
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:00,741
I can't. She'd be so disappointed.
In Child Guidance...

106
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:02,263
Hang Child Guidance!

107
00:07:02,384 --> 00:07:06,822
I'll explain to our little prima donna that
a mother is entitled to a life of her own.

108
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:08,344
I promised I'd take her.

109
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,854
- You'd want me to keep my promise.
- But...

110
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:18,266
- Princess?
- Yes, what is it? I'm in a hurry.

111
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:21,264
I guess your mother can't go
to the theatre tonight.

112
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:24,935
- How about you going with me?
- Thanks heaps, but I'm not in the mood.

113
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:29,140
- Gloria and I have emotional problems.
- Your mother told me you were busy.

114
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:31,383
- I'll need some money.
- Oh.

115
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,937
- Dollar all right?
- I guess so. Thanks.

116
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,820
Yeah, I'll see you in five minutes,
sweetheart.

117
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,778
Vinnie, I don't suppose
you could drive me?

118
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:41,466
- Sorry.
- Thank you!

119
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:44,386
I certainly don't see
what attracts poor Ann to you.

120
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:48,382
Son, I have a couple of tickets
for the Royal.

121
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:52,865
- I wonder if you'd like to go with me.
- Sorry but I got a date tonight with Ann.

122
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:56,220
Well, why don't you take Ann?
I hear it's a great show.

123
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:58,738
I wish we could but it's a double date.

124
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,340
Hello? Yes, Phyllis.

125
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,188
Mother, come on!

126
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,380
Ellen's gone over to Gloria's.

127
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,059
They're going to discuss
their emotional problems.

128
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,181
Goodbye.

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,343
- That's Mrs. Jenkins' car. Hurry.
- Coming, darling.

130
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:21,904
Oh, Cliff.

131
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:25,103
- Why don't you ask Ed to go with you?
- Yeah, that's an idea.

132
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:27,142
- Mother, please!
- Just a moment.

133
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:30,786
- Aren't you going to have dinner?
- We had a sandwich earlier.

134
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,665
I cooked a veal goulash
just the way that you like it.

135
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,147
All you have to do is warm it up.

136
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:39,867
Marion, let's go away
some place next weekend.

137
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:41,664
- Why, dear?
- I'd like a change.

138
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,023
I'm tired of the fog
and the smog and the rain.

139
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:46,951
- Maybe we can go to the desert.
- That would be nice.

140
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,745
Just you and I, alone.

141
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:49,862
Absolutely alone.

142
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,904
How's Tom?

143
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,785
Well, what ails him?

144
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,983
Stones? Well, how many?

145
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:59,151
The same thing happened
to a cousin of mine.

146
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:01,993
He had four stones,
about the size of mothballs.

147
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:04,867
I got to hang up
or I'll never get out of here.

148
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,349
Yes, yes. Goodbye, Selma.

149
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:10,831
Could you use a couple of tickets
to the show at the Royal?

150
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,867
Oh, Mr. Groves, any other time
I'd just jump at the chance,

151
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:16,873
but I promised my daughter I'd baby-sit.

152
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,986
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs. Rogers.

153
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:57,997
Yes?

154
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,751
- Clifford Groves!
- Yes...

155
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,029
I'm sorry, I know we've met
but I can't...

156
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,719
Have I changed that much
in these 20 years?

157
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,318
20 years?

158
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:10,952
- Norma Miller!
- Yes.

159
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,275
I can't believe it. Come in. The rain...

160
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,392
- The rain has stopped.
- Well, come in anyway.

161
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,798
I hope you'll forgive the way I look.
I wasn't expecting anybody.

162
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,912
- I've been cooking.
- Turn around. Let me help you.

163
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,315
Thanks.

164
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:28,080
Go in, won't you? I'll be right back.

165
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:50,955
I must apologise
for not having recognised you but...

166
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,075
- You look so different.
- Compared to the plain girl I was?

167
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,034
- I didn't mean that.
- I was plain.

168
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:59,075
Flat-heeled shoes, no make-up.
Very plain.

169
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:01,840
- Norma Miller.
- Norma Vail now.

170
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:03,238
- Norma Vail?
- Uh-huh.

171
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,763
Well, come in and sit down.

172
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:08,756
- After all these years!
- Yes, all these years.

173
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:11,079
- I heard you were in New York.
- I have been.

174
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:15,123
Well, it's certainly wonderful
to see you again.

175
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:18,362
- It's wonderful to see you, too.
- How did you find where?

176
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:22,239
Oh, I tried phoning this house six times
but the line was always busy.

177
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:25,755
So I decided to disobey Emily Post
and surprise you.

178
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,480
It's the nicest surprise I've had in years.

179
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:32,876
The house is beautiful.

180
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,917
Warm and cheerful.

181
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:39,959
Just as I had imagined it.
The kind you always wanted.

182
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,245
Yes, I guess I did.

183
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,003
Where is Mrs. Groves?
I'd love to meet her.

184
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:50,120
Poor Marion. It's her birthday today
and I'd planned a little celebration.

185
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:53,684
I thought we'd go to dinner
and I had tickets for the theatre but...

186
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:55,207
she had to go out.

187
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,638
And the kids couldn't go.
They were busy. I have three of them.

188
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,918
I even invited the cook.

189
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,488
I don't suppose you'd like to go?

190
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:08,169
- Why, I'd love to.
- Really?

191
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:09,927
We just have time to make it.

192
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:11,448
I'll go get my coat.

193
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:47,562
Now, do you want
to go out for a smoke?

194
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,091
No, I don't think so.

195
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,212
This is fantastic.

196
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,564
So completely unexpected,
sitting here again like this.

197
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,092
- Don't you remember?
- No.

198
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,364
The day you cancelled all appointments,
closed the office,

199
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,770
and took me to a matinee
in this very same theatre.

200
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:10,886
You wanted me to see
my first show direct from Broadway.

201
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:14,290
The next day you spoiled it all
and made me cry.

202
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:17,884
You criticised my design
for the Indian doll and I burst into tears.

203
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:20,851
- I hope I apologised.
- No.

204
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:22,374
Then I do now.

205
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,209
- Are you still in the toy business?
- Still in it.

206
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,725
Are your offices far from here?

207
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,847
No, they're just a few blocks away.

208
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,566
Why don't you ask me
to skip the second act?

209
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:41,133
You don't want to see the rest of it?

210
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:44,852
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret.
I saw this show in New York.

211
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:48,329
- Oh, well, why didn't you say?
- Oh, come on, Cliff.

212
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,527
I'd love to see
what you've been doing.

213
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:51,646
All right.

214
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,447
Oh!

215
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,648
Oh, what a wonderful display!

216
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,328
- I hoped you'd like it.
- Oh, Cliff. I'm so proud of you.

217
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,529
A trailer.

218
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,696
I've always wanted
to live in a trailer.

219
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,811
Norma, come here.

220
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,372
Yell, "All aboard."

221
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,619
All aboard!

222
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:37,740
Works electronically.
It's got a built-in light.

223
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,658
Oh.

224
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:43,660
It's an exact scale copy of a real one.
It's got a whistle, too.

225
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:49,780
And what about that one?

226
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:53,338
It's got a hole in the chimney.
When it heats up, smoke comes out.

227
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:54,861
End of the line.

228
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,018
Oh, how charming.

229
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:02,892
I didn't think you'd still be interested
after all these years.

230
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:05,583
Why not? I design clothes
for live dolls now.

231
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:06,772
Oh?

232
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:10,293
For some time I've been in New York
with a chain of dress shops.

233
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:13,336
- I want to show you upstairs.
- Your workshop?

234
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:14,453
- Yeah.
- Good.

235
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:16,097
- I want you to meet Rex.
- Rex?

236
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:18,180
- Our robot man. He's our latest.
- Oh.

237
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,263
Here, I'll get the light.

238
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,059
We manufacture him
down at the other plant.

239
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:30,704
Here he is.

240
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:32,463
Rex, the walkie-talkie robot.

241
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:35,497
'I'm Rex, the robot,
the mechanical man.

242
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,265
'Push me and steer me
wherever you can.

243
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:41,662
- 'I'm Rex, the robot...'
- Oh, he's wonderful.

244
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,777
- And he talks.
- Yeah.

245
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:46,818
- Oh, I adore him.
- We have great hopes for this boy.

246
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,335
Oh, the children will be crazy about him.

247
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:52,061
Come on. I'll show you
the rest of the workshop.

248
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:00,506
I remember this.

249
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,584
- Oh, that old relic.
- Relic?

250
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,107
Oh, no.

251
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,303
Oh, I remember it so clearly.

252
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:10,226
We were walking along the boardwalk
at Redondo Beach

253
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:13,977
and there was
that little old Italian organ grinder.

254
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,701
He was playing a tune.

255
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,186
What was the name of it?

256
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:23,298
"Blue Moon".

257
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:25,101
"Blue Moon".

258
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,065
And you suddenly got the idea for this.

259
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,829
Then we had dinner
at that fish place on the wharf.

260
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,339
I made sketches of it
on the table cloth.

261
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,665
What a time we had
buying the table cloth

262
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,224
so we could get it
into production right away.

263
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,943
Remember how many we sold?

264
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,424
Uh-huh. Two.

265
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,303
One to a fella who owned a monkey.

266
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,945
Trouble is, there weren't enough
fellas with monkeys.

267
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,470
Yes.

268
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh, but, Cliff, you've done so well.

269
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:53,270
And you look so well, so happy.

270
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:56,428
You are happy, aren't you?

271
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:58,429
Sure. Sure I'm happy.

272
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:02,348
You deserve to be.

273
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,702
When I think of all the disappointments.

274
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,427
For a while I didn't think
I'd get out of the red.

275
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:08,747
I took a gamble.

276
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:12,309
Tried to use more imagination
than other toy makers. It paid off.

277
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,264
I'm not giving you a chance to talk.

278
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:17,226
Nothing much to tell.
Hard work. Years of it.

279
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,993
Up the ladder, step by step, so slowly.

280
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:22,753
You said your name's Vail now.
You're married, then?

281
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,432
I was.

282
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,863
No one should marry
out of loneliness.

283
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,746
But that was a long time ago.

284
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:32,868
One thing I've never understood is
why you quit your job as my designer.

285
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:35,270
You didn't even give me a week's notice.

286
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:37,147
I had my reasons.

287
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:41,029
Now, when am I going
to meet Marion and the children?

288
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:44,546
- Come tomorrow night for dinner.
- I have to be in Palm Valley.

289
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:47,270
- The desert?
- There's a conference at the inn.

290
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,705
Fashion experts from all over
will be there.

291
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,555
I have to make a speech and I dread it.

292
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:54,507
Why don't we meet over the weekend?

293
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:57,026
Marion and I plan to go out of town.

294
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:59,671
Oh, well, you call me when you get back.

295
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:01,196
I will do that.

296
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:05,351
Cliff, it's been a wonderful evening.

297
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:08,196
Yes, it certainly has.

298
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:14,993
You know, tonight...

299
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:18,070
...for a little while...

300
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:20,751
...time stood still.

301
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,478
Well.

302
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,034
Cliff?

303
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,913
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

304
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,681
Did you go to the theatre with Ed?

305
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:59,841
No, I didn't go with Ed.

306
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,195
- I went with...
- Did you enjoy the show?

307
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:06,234
- Yes, it was very good.
- Frankie was a big success, too.

308
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:09,921
She was cute as a button.
Good night, dear.

309
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:13,672
Good night.

310
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:28,473
All the new designs
are here in the portfolio.

311
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:31,596
- Never mind.
- But I thought you'd like to study them.

312
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:35,434
Mrs. Groves and I are getting away.
Let's leave business out of it.

313
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,078
Hello?

314
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:41,718
Just a moment, please.

315
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,517
- For you.
- Tell them I've gone.

316
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:46,523
It's Mr. Andrews
calling from San Francisco.

317
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:49,079
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

318
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:52,039
Very well, thank you.
How are you? Good.

319
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,841
We had one of our heavy mists, water
in the streets up over the hub caps.

320
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,843
How's the weather up there?

321
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,763
Sunny, eh? You don't tell me.

322
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,037
The walkie-talkie spaceman?

323
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:07,479
I'm glad you're impressed with Rex.
I think he's going to be a hot item.

324
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,802
When do you plan on coming down?

325
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:11,360
This weekend?

326
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:15,117
Sorry, Mr. Andrews. Mrs. Groves
and I plan to go to Palm Valley.

327
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,204
How about next?

328
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:18,886
Well, that'd be fine.

329
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:23,320
I'll see you down there,
Saturday afternoon late, at the inn.

330
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:26,725
It will be good to see you, too,
Mr. Andrews. Goodbye, sir.

331
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,647
You were going to forget business
while you were away.

332
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,646
I have no objection to spending time

333
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,488
with one of the biggest
department store owners.

334
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,724
Hold down the fort.

335
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:38,762
I'm sure you and Mrs. Groves
will have a good time.

336
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,281
- Hi.
- Ellen, get towels.

337
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,606
We'll need compresses,
and lots of 'em.

338
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,847
- Towels.
- And turn down Frankie's bed.

339
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:54,960
The bed.

340
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:59,565
- What's happened?
- Frankie twisted her ankle.

341
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,090
- How?
- She was skating.

342
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,203
Oh, Daddy, it's broken.

343
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:06,404
- I'll never dance again. Never.
- Sure you will, honey.

344
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,966
- It's just a sprain.
- The doctor's on his way.

345
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:12,209
Come on, Pavlova, I'll carry you up.

346
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:15,484
No, I won't be lame. I can't be. Watch.

347
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:23,765
Darling! Let me help you.

348
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:56,688
- I finally got her settled.
- I'm glad it wasn't serious.

349
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,126
We'd better get packed.
We want to get an early start.

350
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:05,533
Cliff, you don't honestly think I can go
to the desert tomorrow, do you?

351
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:09,412
Marion, we've planned this trip all week.

352
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,415
Besides, I have an appointment
with Andrews at the inn.

353
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:16,132
- I didn't expect Frankie...
- Frankie's enjoying her injury.

354
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:17,896
Children are apt to dramatise.

355
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:20,930
Dr. Kaufman said the swelling
would be down by tomorrow.

356
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:22,969
After all, the ankle isn't broken.

357
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:27,216
I don't care what Dr. Kaufman said.
I want X-rays made to be quite sure.

358
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,727
- That's ridiculous.
- And I couldn't relax

359
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:31,929
until Frankie sees those X-rays.

360
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,970
Oh, look, Cliff.

361
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,215
If I couldn't relax, neither could you,

362
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:39,456
so what would be the use
of my going down tomorrow?

363
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:41,251
Believe me, I wish I could go.

364
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:44,452
Frankie would feel terribly rejected
with both of us away.

365
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,218
That mustn't stop your going.

366
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,695
- I'll pack your things.
- No, never mind.

367
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,978
I'll wire Andrews, ask him to meet me
in Los Angeles one day next week.

368
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,140
It's just a shame that every time we plan
anything, something gets in the way.

369
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,660
I insist that you go.

370
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:02,739
Two days of sun and
seeing Mr. Andrews will be good for you.

371
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,136
You'll look so handsome
in your new jacket.

372
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,570
Mother! Mother!

373
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:10,375
Yes, dear? What is it?
What's the matter?

374
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:13,175
Ellen's got the lights on.
She's using my cologne.

375
00:23:13,302 --> 00:23:16,260
- Get back in bed right this minute.
- My ankle!

376
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:19,340
- You see, dear?
- Give me back my cologne!

377
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:21,738
- Mother! Mother!
- Yes, I see.

378
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:58,140
Hello. I just have
a bag and a coat in the back.

379
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:12,537
You picked a nice weekend.
Three women for every man.

380
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,579
We call the cocktail lounge
"bachelors' paradise".

381
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:23,177
- I'm from Pasadena, too, you know.
- Oh?

382
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:26,664
Everyone says it's such a social town
but I don't find it so.

383
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:32,103
You lucky men,
you can always get around.

384
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:34,344
But when a woman's alone, she can't.

385
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:35,868
I suppose that's true.

386
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:39,103
- My, what an attractive jacket.
- Thank you.

387
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,982
My wife picked it out.
She has pretty good taste.

388
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:44,145
She even buys ties I don't mind wearing.

389
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:48,057
Oh, really? Excuse me.
I think I'll get some sunshine.

390
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,067
- Certainly.
- Another drink, sir?

391
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,181
Aren't you going to buy me a drink?

392
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,266
Norma! You stayed on!

393
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,587
After the conference I realised
how tired I was, so I stayed on.

394
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,669
- What on earth are you doing here?
- You gave me the idea.

395
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,147
- I didn't dream you'd still be here.
- Is Marion unpacking?

396
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:08,662
Frankie, our youngest twisted her ankle
and Marion felt she shouldn't come.

397
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,669
I'd have stayed home
but I have a business appointment.

398
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,908
A man's interested in Rex.

399
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:16,705
- Has he arrived?
- He'll be on the afternoon plane.

400
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,107
- Have you been horseback riding?
- Not yet.

401
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:22,144
- Why don't you come along?
- I haven't any clothes for it.

402
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:25,982
- I haven't been on a horse...
- What can you lose except dignity?

403
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:38,631
Don't worry, Mr. Groves.
Just ride her easy.

404
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,949
- Everything will come back to you.
- Amen.

405
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:11,270
- Oh, that was wonderful.
- Yes.

406
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:20,831
You know, Norma, it's so easy
for a man to slip into a rut.

407
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:23,835
Once he's in it,
he doesn't dare do things he used to do.

408
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,073
He doesn't feel the excitement he felt.

409
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:28,473
If anything, he feels scared of life.

410
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:32,750
But you know something? I feel
as if I just made my first touchdown.

411
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:34,277
And not a day older.

412
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,273
Excuse me.

413
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,198
Do you remember
a tune called "Blue Moon"?

414
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,311
You mean this old one?

415
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,197
- That's it. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

416
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:11,351
- Remember this? Let's dance.
- I haven't danced in a long time.

417
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:14,393
- All the more reason.
- I've probably forgotten how.

418
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:26,195
- Mr. Groves, this just came for you.
- Oh, thank you.

419
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:34,193
- Andrews is not coming.
- Oh, Cliff!

420
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:36,075
Says he'll meet me next week.

421
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:39,081
Oh, what a shame,
after all you had planned.

422
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:41,194
- Maybe it isn't such a shame.
- Oh?

423
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:44,077
I couldn't relax with Andrews here.

424
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,593
This way I can get
some rest and some sunshine.

425
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:52,040
- Then you're not going home?
- My reservation is for two nights.

426
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,563
I might as well stay.

427
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:56,404
Why don't you stay, too?

428
00:27:57,485 --> 00:28:00,045
Well, I don't have to rush back.

429
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:03,362
- But the only thing is...
- Please, for me.

430
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:04,884
I'd hate to be alone.

431
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:09,362
All right, I'll stay.

432
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,567
- Good night.
- Won't you ask me in for a nightcap?

433
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:30,687
I'm so tired I can hardly
keep my eyes open.

434
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:33,880
Let's breakfast late.
Better still, let's make it brunch.

435
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:36,806
- Fine. Call me when you get up.
- All right. Good night.

436
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,681
If your father's on business,
are you sure it will be all right?

437
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,289
He'll be glad to see us.

438
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,720
Won't a swim in a cool, blue pool
feel great, though?

439
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,841
Cool, blue pool? Boy, that's for me.

440
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,361
- Maybe he'll treat us to dinner.
- But if he has an appointment...

441
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,961
- Dad won't mind.
- Come on, step on it, old man.

442
00:29:25,252 --> 00:29:27,607
Gosh, the wind has made
a mess of my hair.

443
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,848
- I'd like to freshen up.
- So would I.

444
00:29:29,972 --> 00:29:33,408
Vinnie, why don't you get your father
and we'll meet you here?

445
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:38,605
- Mr. Clifford Groves, please.
- Shall I see if he's in, sir?

446
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,132
61, please.

447
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:45,010
- No one seems to answer, sir.
- Would you try Mr. Andrews?

448
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,693
- Mr. Andrews?
- Mr. Andrews from San Francisco.

449
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:50,408
- There's no one by that name here.
- Are you sure?

450
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,373
Maybe he's checked out.

451
00:29:52,494 --> 00:29:56,612
I'm sorry. We haven't had a Mr. Andrews
from San Francisco all week.

452
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,850
- Would you page Mr. Groves?
- Certainly.

453
00:29:58,974 --> 00:29:59,963
Boy.

454
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:03,852
- Would you page Mr. Groves?
- No need. They're together again.

455
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:06,614
She's with him. I saw him
in front of her bungalow.

456
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:07,724
Who's she?

457
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:12,527
Mr. Groves is at Bungalow 57,
Miss Vail's.

458
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:16,205
- Who?
- A friend of Mr. Groves, Miss Vail.

459
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,011
I'll just wait in his bungalow if I may.

460
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:22,775
Surely. That's 61.
Out that door and to your right.

461
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:24,329
Okay.

462
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:30,374
I don't get it. I just don't get it.

463
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,453
- You sure you heard?
- Of course.

464
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:36,047
Mr. Andrews is an old pal,
one of the biggest store owners.

465
00:30:36,177 --> 00:30:38,897
He's interested
in one of Dad's new toys.

466
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:41,327
- You heard that clerk.
- I don't understand.

467
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,733
What about
Miss What's-her-name... Vail?

468
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:46,850
- I don't know her.
- Maybe she's the business associate.

469
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:51,495
Listen, I know what you're insinuating,
and cut it out.

470
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,610
You're talking about my father.

471
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:56,977
What do you say we go
and have a cocktail before dinner?

472
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:59,408
I'd better get my wrap.
It's getting chilly.

473
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,336
- Can I get it for you?
- No, thanks.

474
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,058
Here's my stole.

475
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,259
- Oh, I dropped my earring.
- Here, I'll get it.

476
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,371
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

477
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,458
61. That must be Dad's bungalow.

478
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:24,333
- Ow, Cliff!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

479
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:30,332
You've got very pretty ears.
I've never noticed them before.

480
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,218
Sounds like they're having a good time.

481
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:34,741
Thank you.

482
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:44,855
Cliff?

483
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:50,216
You always used to wear a flower
in your buttonhole. Remember?

484
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,301
- But I looked like a floor-walker.
- Oh, nonsense.

485
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:03,019
Nobody's going
to know about this from me.

486
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:06,740
- I'm not that kind of a friend.
- Just shut up.

487
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:08,344
Let's get out of here.

488
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:15,904
- I wonder what's keeping them.
- Honestly!

489
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,141
And men say
they have to wait for women.

490
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:21,656
Oh, boy, is that pool
going to feel marvellous!

491
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:24,302
- It's happened before.
- What has?

492
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:27,816
- Oh, you know, that kind of thing.
- What kind of thing?

493
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,414
- I remember my uncle.
- I don't care about him.

494
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:32,822
He'd tell my aunt
he had a business meeting.

495
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:35,745
Then one day she caught him.
He had the sweetest...

496
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,425
I don't want to hear any more.

497
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,499
Oh, there they are.

498
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:46,063
- Let's get moving.
- What's the matter?

499
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:48,980
Where's your dad?

500
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:51,668
What is it, Bob?
Aren't we going swimming?

501
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,267
All right.

502
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:02,108
Add two and two and get five.

503
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:03,901
I can count, thank you.

504
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:06,304
How could you even think such a thing?

505
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,059
Think? I tell you, I saw Dad
and that woman and I heard them.

506
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,226
She's probably a business associate.

507
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,308
Business associates
scarcely act that way.

508
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,821
Sometimes you make me so angry.
You're like a suspicious child.

509
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,830
And you're gullible. It's obvious
he didn't have a business appointment.

510
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:26,021
I know your father.

511
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:27,584
He wouldn't lie.

512
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:31,709
I'm pretty disappointed in you,
Vinnie Groves.

513
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:36,306
How could you have left
without saying hello to your own father?

514
00:33:37,712 --> 00:33:39,509
I'd have only been in their way.

515
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:50,431
It's been a wonderful two days.
I'm glad I stayed on.

516
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:52,271
New York was never like this.

517
00:33:52,393 --> 00:33:56,147
Why do you stay there?
Why don't you come to California?

518
00:33:56,273 --> 00:34:01,143
Well, I'd be foolish to, now that
I've made some sort of success.

519
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:04,232
Besides, New York
is where my few friends are.

520
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:07,027
I've never been one
to make casual acquaintances.

521
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:09,270
You're the only one I know out here.

522
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:14,433
Norma, when you married,
you said it was out of loneliness.

523
00:34:15,435 --> 00:34:18,029
- Yes, that's right.
- Well, in all these years

524
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,111
haven't you met anyone who?

525
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,432
No. I guess
I just kept myself too busy.

526
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,706
Well, we've a long drive ahead of us.
We'd better get started.

527
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:30,955
Yes, I guess we had.

528
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,478
- No sign of him yet?
- No sign.

529
00:34:53,198 --> 00:34:56,270
9:30. Should be back by now.

530
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:57,956
He should.

531
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:01,195
Look out, Ellen,
or you'll yank those drapes off the wall.

532
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:03,992
Just take your bow
and get off the stage, hmm?

533
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,836
Wish I could find something funny
to laugh at.

534
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:11,519
This used to be such a happy home.

535
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,313
Yes, such a happy one.

536
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,237
- Having fun, children?
- Oh, yes.

537
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,510
Sure, lots of fun.

538
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,919
Listen.

539
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,871
We can't let mother know.

540
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,357
Ann, this has got to be our secret.

541
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,516
And if...

542
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:31,280
He's here.

543
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:34,632
Be casual.
Don't let on that we know.

544
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:36,592
- Ann?
- Hmm?

545
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,794
- What should we do?
- Vinnie, this is none of my business.

546
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,072
And I've got no right to advise.

547
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:46,512
But since you asked me,
I'd say keep your mouth shut.

548
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:49,110
Why, your father's incapable of deceit.

549
00:35:49,242 --> 00:35:50,880
He'll explain everything.

550
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:53,153
- I see you know everything about men.
- Shh!

551
00:35:58,883 --> 00:36:02,637
- Oh, hello, everybody.
- He's still got the flower.

552
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:05,517
- Well, welcome back.
- Thank you.

553
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:07,396
- Nice to see you, Ann.
- Hi.

554
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,162
- Hello, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

555
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:11,354
- Son.
- I thought I heard you come in.

556
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:13,952
- How nice you got home early.
- How's Frankie?

557
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:17,043
We had the X-rays taken.
It was just a sprain. She's up.

558
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:19,156
How tanned you are, and so relaxed.

559
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:20,798
- See what rest can do?
- Rest?

560
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:24,759
- I was on the go every minute.
- Did you close the deal?

561
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:27,763
- Did Andrews sign on the dotted line?
- No, he didn't.

562
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,604
He didn't even show up.

563
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:32,240
I got a wire saying
he was stuck in San Francisco.

564
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:36,359
- But I figured I might as well stay.
- Well, I'm glad you did.

565
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,762
- Doesn't Dad look wonderful?
- Didn't it get dull down there?

566
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:42,481
No, I ran into an old friend.

567
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:44,279
- You did?
- Good. Who?

568
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:46,921
Her name's Norma Miller.
She used to work for me.

569
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:50,039
Now she's a successful dress designer
called Norma Vail.

570
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,886
She was just out in California
on business.

571
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:56,523
I hope it's all right. I asked her
to come to the house for dinner.

572
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,957
- She wants to meet the family.
- Of course.

573
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:03,366
It was anything but dull. I hiked and
swam and even went horseback riding.

574
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:05,600
You must be stiff as a board.

575
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:09,404
- No, I feel great. I'm not stiff at all.
- You will be. A hot bath for you.

576
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:11,679
But I don't want a hot bath.

577
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:14,528
Cliff is such an innocent darling.

578
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,924
Well, I just knew he'd explain everything.

579
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:19,962
I'm not so sure he did.

580
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,329
What do you mean?

581
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,963
Cliff, why not ask Miss Vail
for tomorrow night?

582
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,878
Fine. I'd better go down and call her now
so she doesn't make other plans.

583
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,443
All right.

584
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:35,210
My hat's off to him.

585
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:38,084
- Just like Theodore Dreiser.
- What in the world?

586
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:40,520
- In "An American Tragedy".
- American what?

587
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:43,119
The scene where the man pretends
he's innocent

588
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:46,164
by the simple device
of telling just enough of the truth.

589
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,125
- Really?
- Oh, now, Vinnie!

590
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:50,844
I tell you, I saw...

591
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:00,169
He's not wasting any time calling her.

592
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:02,329
I'm never going to get married.

593
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:05,692
Miss Norma Vail, please.

594
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:12,374
Hello? Oh, hello, Cliff.

595
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:15,364
What?

596
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,325
Dinner tomorrow night?

597
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:19,285
Oh, that would be fun.

598
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:21,245
About 8:00? Uh-huh.

599
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:25,050
Oh, no, no, you don't have to bother.
I'll get a cab.

600
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:27,564
Well, if you insist.

601
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:29,925
All right, I'll be waiting. Bye.

602
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:44,090
Tomorrow night.

603
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:46,810
Vinnie, must we meet that woman?

604
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,569
What else can we do?

605
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,050
Come in, Cliff.

606
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:11,375
- Hello, Norma.
- Would you turn on the lights, please?

607
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:13,649
Thank you. My nails are still wet.

608
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:16,737
- Can I fan them for you?
- They'll be dry in a few minutes.

609
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,690
I was a little late getting home.

610
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:22,095
- Can you smoke while you dry?
- Thanks but I prefer my own brand.

611
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,096
Would you get one out of here for?

612
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:25,619
Oh, Cliff, I'm so sorry.

613
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,458
Think nothing of it, madam.

614
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,370
- Where on earth did you get this?
- Oh, I...

615
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,492
I came across it
before I left New York.

616
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,580
- I look like a wanted suspect.
- Nothing of the kind.

617
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:47,579
- You were a very handsome man.
- Where was it taken?

618
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,614
Oh, someone snapped it of us
at the annual picnic.

619
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:53,414
- Oh?
- Yes.

620
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,578
I looked so ghastly,
I cut myself out.

621
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:57,135
The picnic.

622
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:02,011
I remember. You mean,
you've kept it all these years?

623
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:06,774
Oh, well, you know
how women are about mementos.

624
00:40:08,263 --> 00:40:09,742
Yes, I remember.

625
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:12,775
But you've spoiled all the fun.

626
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:15,816
- I wasn't going to show you until later.
- Until later?

627
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:16,933
Yes.

628
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:20,260
I brought it along to show to Marion.

629
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:22,013
Oh.

630
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,664
I suppose she has
lots of snapshots of you.

631
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,504
Yes, she has lots of them.

632
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:34,698
Well, I'll just leave it here.

633
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:40,296
We'd better go. I don't want to be late
the first time I meet Marion.

634
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:43,945
Thank you.

635
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:55,138
- I don't think Vinnie looks like Daddy.
- Yes, Frankie, I think he does.

636
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:59,465
It's hard for a family to see it.
I can't imagine Cliff with a butch.

637
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,703
- Thank you.
- I do see a resemblance.

638
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,387
You look like your father
when I first knew him.

639
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:07,102
Really? That's interesting.

640
00:41:07,228 --> 00:41:09,867
I hope I look as pretty as Mother
when I grow up.

641
00:41:09,988 --> 00:41:13,298
Darling, what a lovely compliment
coming from my own daughter.

642
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:15,860
Of course I want to look pretty.

643
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:18,947
Not to attract boys
but for the sake of my dancing career.

644
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,424
You may change your mind
in a few years.

645
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,540
I never will, Daddy.

646
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:27,904
Marion, did you know
Cliff wore a flower in his buttonhole?

647
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:30,908
He gave it up. He thought
he looked like a floor-walker.

648
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,021
I think Cliff looks very nice.

649
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,380
My father says
that if I keep up my grades,

650
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,024
- I can go to New York next year.
- That's fine.

651
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,823
- Is it your first trip?
- Yes, and I'm so thrilled.

652
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,182
- Oh, I hope you look me up.
- Well, I'd love to.

653
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:47,542
That's better than waiting for
a man to take you on a honeymoon.

654
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,344
Well, waiting is part of being in love.

655
00:41:50,471 --> 00:41:52,382
Oh, it is?

656
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:54,661
I beg your pardon, if you'll excuse me.

657
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,384
Vinnie!

658
00:41:56,512 --> 00:41:58,389
- May I be excused, too?
- No.

659
00:41:58,512 --> 00:42:00,742
There's no reason
for you to be rude, too.

660
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:02,863
You know how she feels about dessert.

661
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:06,667
Thank you, Mother.
I'm sure you'll pardon me, Miss Vail.

662
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:09,512
Well, I won't pardon you,
so sit down, young lady.

663
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:17,585
- Frankie!
- I want to see what Vinnie's doing.

664
00:42:17,713 --> 00:42:20,274
- He looks mad.
- Frankie, sit down at the table.

665
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:22,385
Don't mind Vinnie. He's a stupe.

666
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:23,867
Frankie, really!

667
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:26,349
He's been complaining
of a headache all day.

668
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:29,352
Ann, do you think
you could persuade him to come in?

669
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:33,024
Yes, Mr. Groves.
Miss Vail, would you forgive me?

670
00:42:33,155 --> 00:42:34,554
Thank you.

671
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:46,630
Oh, that's right.
Mow down the entire garden!

672
00:42:46,756 --> 00:42:50,192
- Ann.
- You coddled four-year-old child.

673
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:54,468
I couldn't help it. Did you see
that business with the flower?

674
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:56,826
"Waiting is part of being in love"!

675
00:42:56,956 --> 00:42:59,073
You're out of your mind.

676
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:02,075
- You think I want to believe that?
- Yes.

677
00:43:02,197 --> 00:43:04,757
I don't know why, Vinnie,
but you want to.

678
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:06,868
I know sordidness and you don't.

679
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:09,909
Hallelujah, Reverend Groves.

680
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:12,188
Vinnie, come on back to the table.

681
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,309
Sorry. No, thanks.

682
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:18,113
I'm positive your father hasn't done
a thing to be ashamed of.

683
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:21,230
But you know something?
I wouldn't blame him if he had.

684
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,478
There's no sense in talking to women.
They don't know the meaning of logic.

685
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,191
Vinnie!

686
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,270
I hear your recital was a great success.

687
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,550
It must be wonderful
to be a ballerina.

688
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,229
Oh, yes, thank you. Do you know
many famous dancers in New York?

689
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,679
A few.

690
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,997
But I'd trade every New York celebrity
for a family just like this.

691
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,511
- Thank you.
- Well, enough about me.

692
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,313
Ellen, what are your plans
when you finish high school?

693
00:43:55,681 --> 00:43:57,273
She wants to study dramatics.

694
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:00,279
Ellen, you were asked the question.

695
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:01,994
What question, Daddy?

696
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:04,998
Ann, where is Vinnie?

697
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:09,717
- He went out somewhere.
- What's going on here tonight?

698
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:12,436
- Cliff!
- I'm to blame for that, Mr. Groves.

699
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:16,639
- Vinnie's been miserable all day.
- Why?

700
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:19,038
Well, I quarrelled with him this morning.

701
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:22,842
Naturally, he wasn't much
in the mood for company.

702
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,159
What did you quarrel with him about?

703
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:27,923
It's hardly worth mentioning, Mr. Groves.

704
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:30,035
Let's just talk about something else.

705
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:32,155
Miss Vail, don't you believe it.

706
00:44:35,364 --> 00:44:38,755
- I'm sorry you have to leave so soon.
- Yes, the time has flown.

707
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,353
Don't forget,
I have the perfect dress for you.

708
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:42,884
3:00 in the Gold Room.

709
00:44:43,005 --> 00:44:45,121
Ann, say goodbye
to your handsome beau.

710
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:47,634
- I had a wonderful evening.
- I'll see you out.

711
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:49,915
No, don't bother.
The cab is right there.

712
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:51,843
- Good night.
- Good night.

713
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:59,720
Mrs. Rogers outdid herself.
I think I'll give her a hand cleaning up.

714
00:44:59,846 --> 00:45:01,245
Let me help.

715
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:11,366
Ellen!

716
00:45:17,688 --> 00:45:21,078
- Who's there?
- I want to talk to your sister. Open up.

717
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:23,802
Impossible. She hid the key.

718
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:25,441
Ellen, open this door.

719
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:28,367
It's no use, Dad.
She's pretending to be asleep.

720
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:31,049
Please, please, leave me alone.

721
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:33,683
Dad, she wants to be left alone.

722
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:35,765
Ellen, if you don't...

723
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:37,888
Vinnie.

724
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:43,888
I think you owe your mother and me
an apology for your behaviour tonight.

725
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,001
I owe Mother an apology.

726
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:58,809
Ann, I've got to have
a serious talk with you.

727
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:07,524
- I've got to talk to you.
- At this hour?

728
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:09,847
Please, take a walk with me, Ann.

729
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:13,730
All right, Vinnie.

730
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:16,685
Vinnie, would you walk me home,
please?

731
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:19,805
- Yeah, sure. I won't be long, Mother.
- All right.

732
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,845
Good night, Mrs. Groves.
Thanks for a wonderful dinner.

733
00:46:22,973 --> 00:46:24,406
Good night, Mrs. Rogers.

734
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:29,329
They quarrelled.
That's the wonderful thing about youth.

735
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,526
In a while they won't remember
what it was all about.

736
00:46:32,654 --> 00:46:35,930
- There wasn't much to do.
- I did most of it between courses.

737
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:39,012
I think we'll have shrimp salad tomorrow.
Good night.

738
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:40,362
Good night.

739
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:51,287
- That was a pleasant evening.
- It was a hideous evening.

740
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:54,691
Oh, darling, you're just upset
at the way they behaved.

741
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:57,774
- They had a love spat.
- That's no excuse for bad manners.

742
00:46:57,896 --> 00:47:00,933
- I'm sure Vinnie and Ellen...
- Go ahead, defend them.

743
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:03,365
Coddle them
as if they were still in cradles.

744
00:47:03,496 --> 00:47:05,293
Cliff, why are you so upset?

745
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:09,251
I'll tell you why. I invited an old friend
to our home to meet my family.

746
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:14,167
I hoped it would be a pleasant evening.
The children made it anything but that.

747
00:47:14,297 --> 00:47:16,208
Why make a calamity out of it?

748
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,487
I am tired of the children taking over.

749
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:21,530
I'm tired of being taken for granted.

750
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:23,057
That isn't true.

751
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:26,727
I'm becoming like one of my toys.
Cliff, the walkie-talkie robot.

752
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:29,573
Wind me up in the morning
and I go to work.

753
00:47:29,698 --> 00:47:33,408
Wind me up again and I come home
at night, eat dinner and go to bed.

754
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:37,373
Wind me up the next morning
and I work all day to pay the bills.

755
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:41,014
I know it's expensive with the children,
but I do try.

756
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:42,811
I'm not talking about expenses.

757
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:45,932
I'm talking about life.
My life. Our life.

758
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,575
I'm sick and tired of the sameness of it,
day in and day out.

759
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,453
Don't you ever want to get out,
move around?

760
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,333
I'm constantly moving.
That's how I keep my figure.

761
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,817
- What with looking after the children.
- That isn't what I mean.

762
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:01,455
I wish I knew what you did mean.
Then I could help.

763
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:04,539
Every time I plan anything for us,
you find some excuse.

764
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:06,572
Like your birthday and last weekend.

765
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:08,657
That wasn't an excuse. Frankie...

766
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:10,773
The children mean more to you than I do.

767
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:12,335
Oh, Cliff!

768
00:48:13,262 --> 00:48:16,060
When we were younger,
we did so many things together.

769
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:19,618
We had fun. No two days were alike.
Life was an adventure but now...

770
00:48:19,742 --> 00:48:23,861
If life were always an adventure,
it would be very exhausting.

771
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:39,135
Cliff, dear, don't stay out there so long.
You might catch cold.

772
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:48,784
Oh, what a day I have tomorrow.

773
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:53,137
I have to pick the laundress up,
return some books to the library,

774
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:56,940
take Frankie to the dentist,
do some shopping for the children.

775
00:48:57,065 --> 00:49:01,105
Cliff? Cliff, dear, would you open
this jar of hand cream for me, please?

776
00:49:01,226 --> 00:49:03,023
And the marketing.

777
00:49:04,426 --> 00:49:06,542
- I think she's lonely.
- Who?

778
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,655
Norma Vail.

779
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:11,705
- Why do you say that?
- I sensed it.

780
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:13,624
Her life's exciting, successful.

781
00:49:13,747 --> 00:49:17,740
Cliff, excitement and success never mean
as much to a woman as to a man.

782
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:20,097
Nor do they exclude the possibility
of loneliness.

783
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:24,186
You can bet she doesn't let boredom
into her life. You heard her tonight.

784
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:27,061
I also saw the way
she looked at this house,

785
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:29,702
the way she looked
at Frankie, Ellen and Vinnie.

786
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:33,377
- I feel sorry for her.
- You feel sorry for her?

787
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:36,306
She's missed
what every woman really wants.

788
00:49:36,428 --> 00:49:38,147
I know she has a big job,

789
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:42,308
but tonight I was very proud and thankful
for my children and my home and...

790
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,108
...you, of course, dear.

791
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:48,778
Oh, I'm nice and sleepy.
Darling, please turn off the light.

792
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,585
Miss Norma Vail, please.

793
00:51:02,715 --> 00:51:03,704
Thank you.

794
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:07,906
Hello, Norma? This is Cliff.

795
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:11,908
I want to see you.

796
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,435
I have to see you.

797
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:16,990
Yes, yes, I heard you.

798
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:21,713
Er... why don't you and Marion
have cocktails with me?

799
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:23,350
No, I want to see you alone.

800
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:24,876
Oh.

801
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:30,754
All right.
I'll meet you in the lobby at 5:00.

802
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:32,755
I'll be there. 5:00.

803
00:51:33,518 --> 00:51:35,315
Good night, Norma.

804
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:19,440
Come on in.

805
00:52:20,561 --> 00:52:22,553
Vinnie, it's almost 10:00!

806
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:25,799
I didn't close my eyes all night.
I've become an insomniac.

807
00:52:25,922 --> 00:52:27,878
Me, too. Isn't it ghastly?

808
00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:29,674
The situation has gotten worse.

809
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:32,396
Gotten worse? How?

810
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:35,276
- I heard him call her last night.
- You didn't!

811
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:39,681
- They're meeting at 5:00.
- What are we going to do?

812
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:43,079
- We've got to have a showdown.
- Oh, no. With Daddy?

813
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:45,797
Uh-uh. With her.

814
00:52:45,923 --> 00:52:48,996
- When will that be?
- I don't know. Let's just wait and see.

815
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,479
But it's so terrible, just waiting.

816
00:52:51,604 --> 00:52:52,593
I know.

817
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:54,874
But we've got to be patient.

818
00:52:55,004 --> 00:52:57,199
Here, hand me my robe,
will you, please?

819
00:52:59,765 --> 00:53:03,963
- If only Ann were on our side.
- Yeah, but she isn't.

820
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:08,843
I don't understand how she can be
so gullible about the basic facts of life.

821
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:18,041
'Miss Vail,
Gold Room, please.

822
00:53:19,086 --> 00:53:20,997
'Miss Vail, Gold Room, please.'

823
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:23,435
We're not merchandising
$5.98 house dresses.

824
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,842
Try and get more distinction in that copy.

825
00:53:25,967 --> 00:53:29,846
- How do I okay these forms?
- Exactly as I explained at the meeting.

826
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:32,435
Marion, Ann, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

827
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:35,001
- Miss Byron, Mrs. Groves.
- How do you do?

828
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:37,403
Please have Mrs. Groves try on 234.

829
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:39,678
- This way, Mrs. Groves.
- Thank you.

830
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:42,527
- She'll look stunning in it.
- I need your advice.

831
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:47,517
- Vinnie has the insane idea that...
- Will you please look at this wire?

832
00:53:47,648 --> 00:53:50,083
- Have I authority?
- I hired you as manager.

833
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:54,646
When I leave for New York next week,
you'll have to make decisions.

834
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:57,158
Before Marion gets back,
I want to tell you...

835
00:53:57,289 --> 00:53:59,086
I simply must congratulate you.

836
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:02,805
Not since Antonelli's in Rome
have I been so impressed by such flair.

837
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,490
It's divine, a special place
for special people,

838
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,601
something Los Angeles always needed.

839
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,324
Goodbye, my dear.
And again, congratulations.

840
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,849
Thank you.

841
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,690
This has been a hectic day.
What's this all about?

842
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:17,883
Well, it's Vinnie.
He has the fantastic idea that...

843
00:54:18,011 --> 00:54:20,161
I don't think I can even explain it.

844
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,804
But Ann, what's the matter?

845
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:24,126
There's Marion. I can't talk now.

846
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:29,129
Miss Vail, doesn't she look fabulous?

847
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:32,881
- Marion, you look lovely. Doesn't she?
- Yes, it looks beautiful.

848
00:54:33,012 --> 00:54:35,162
It's much too youthful for me.

849
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:38,808
Well, I'm not exactly an ingenue myself
and I wear the same style.

850
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:42,323
Why don't you show it to Cliff?
I know he'll rave about it.

851
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:47,049
Cliff, rave? There speaks a bachelor girl.
After 20 years of marriage,

852
00:54:47,173 --> 00:54:49,607
a husband never raves
about what his wife wears.

853
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:53,090
Oh, I think he would about this.
Please take it on approval.

854
00:54:53,214 --> 00:54:55,250
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not for me.

855
00:54:55,374 --> 00:54:57,490
So am I,
because you look beautiful in it.

856
00:54:57,614 --> 00:54:59,013
Thank you.

857
00:55:00,494 --> 00:55:03,327
Oh, Ann,
what were you so concerned about?

858
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:08,171
Well, it's all so unbelievable
to me that...

859
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:10,763
Well, Vinnie is just
imagining things and...

860
00:55:10,895 --> 00:55:11,884
What things?

861
00:55:12,015 --> 00:55:15,246
'Miss Vail, telephone, please.
Mezzanine office.'

862
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,412
- Excuse me.
- 'Miss Vail, telephone.

863
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:20,175
'Mezzanine office.'

864
00:55:20,296 --> 00:55:22,252
Miss Vail speaking.

865
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:24,446
West coast editor of what?

866
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:25,975
All right, put her on.

867
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:29,206
Miss Duran, how nice of you to call.

868
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:32,773
Well, frankly I shudder
at the thought of your interviewing me.

869
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,291
Tonight? I'm sorry,
I have an appointment.

870
00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:43,136
But... maybe I should try
to get out of it.

871
00:55:44,298 --> 00:55:45,697
Um...

872
00:55:45,818 --> 00:55:48,173
Shall we say 7:30 at my hotel?

873
00:55:48,298 --> 00:55:49,890
Fine. Thank you.

874
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:57,258
Thank you.

875
00:55:57,379 --> 00:56:02,169
I'm sorry you didn't think the dress
was right for you, but do come in again.

876
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:06,578
Thank you for trying. I really must rush.
Cliff isn't coming home for dinner.

877
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,099
A business appointment.

878
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,576
I'm picking Frankie up
and taking her to dinner and a movie.

879
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,009
- I hope we'll see you soon.
- Yes, of course.

880
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,176
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

881
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,699
Come on, Ann.

882
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,653
Hello? Just a moment, please.

883
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:42,771
Mr. Groves?

884
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:45,582
It's for you.

885
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:48,341
Miss Vail.

886
00:56:48,463 --> 00:56:50,374
Well, I'll take it in my office.

887
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,336
Hello, Norma. I was just leaving.

888
00:57:02,944 --> 00:57:06,732
I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid
I'll have to break our appointment.

889
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:09,220
Oh? Why?

890
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:11,620
Something just came up,
an interview.

891
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:14,703
Couldn't I see you later?
It won't take the whole evening.

892
00:57:14,825 --> 00:57:16,781
I'm afraid it will.

893
00:57:16,905 --> 00:57:19,419
I'll call you tomorrow.

894
00:57:19,545 --> 00:57:23,061
Cliff, did you hear what I said?
I'll call you tomorrow.

895
00:57:23,746 --> 00:57:25,338
All right.

896
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:44,384
He told Mother he had
a business appointment this evening.

897
00:57:44,507 --> 00:57:47,306
- I don't believe it.
- I heard it with my own ears.

898
00:57:55,948 --> 00:57:57,586
That's him now.

899
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:13,420
- Why, Mr. Groves.
- Good evening, Mrs. Rogers.

900
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,508
- Where is everyone?
- When Frankie heard you'd be late,

901
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:20,703
she begged her mother to take her out
for steamed clams and a movie.

902
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,506
Ellen's up in her room
and as for the love birds,

903
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:26,508
they're around somewhere.

904
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:09,233
Let me go!

905
00:59:12,714 --> 00:59:14,433
What have I done now?

906
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:18,184
It's not so much what you've done,
it's what you've been thinking.

907
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,791
Ann, this is my problem.

908
00:59:20,915 --> 00:59:22,985
Can't you let me
work it out my own way?

909
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:26,992
- If you love me...
- Love a child like you?

910
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:28,834
- Child?
- Yes.

911
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:31,914
Suspecting your father
of a cheap back-alley romance.

912
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:36,390
I thought I was going steady with a man
but you're just a little boy.

913
00:59:37,796 --> 00:59:41,756
I'm surprised you haven't run to
your mother, howling your suspicions.

914
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:44,266
Just let me alone, Vinnie.

915
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:46,627
I can't love a man I don't respect.

916
00:59:50,077 --> 00:59:51,476
Ann!

917
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,193
- Why don't you quit Therese?
- Start your own business on the coast.

918
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,551
Why stay in New York?
What's the attraction?

919
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:31,637
Are the men that much more attractive?

920
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,434
I've hardly had time
to make a comparative survey.

921
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:38,395
It's such a clear, cool evening.
The city must look beautiful.

922
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:40,591
- Oh, it does.
- I know.

923
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:44,874
Let's make Norma fall in love and marry.
Then she'll have to stay.

924
01:00:45,002 --> 01:00:48,881
That would be bigamy. I'm already
married happily to 738 Madison Avenue,

925
01:00:49,002 --> 01:00:51,436
Therese Originals...

926
01:00:51,562 --> 01:00:54,760
Why, Cliff, what a nice surprise.

927
01:00:54,883 --> 01:00:56,953
The man at the desk
told me you were here.

928
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,233
Oh, Mr. Clifford Groves,

929
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:01,831
Miss Duran, Mr. Carl.

930
01:01:01,963 --> 01:01:06,036
Their slightest whim dictates what
women wear from Seattle to San Diego.

931
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,882
Cliff is a very old friend.

932
01:01:08,004 --> 01:01:10,598
Persuade her she must never
go back to New York.

933
01:01:10,724 --> 01:01:14,399
- Make her stay here, Mr. Groves.
- Open Vail Creations in Los Angeles.

934
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:17,596
It's getting late and we must go.
It's been a grand evening.

935
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:20,478
- Good night.
- I'll call you in the morning, Norma.

936
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:22,596
I've got to talk to you.

937
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,676
What is it?

938
01:01:26,805 --> 01:01:28,477
I've fallen in love with you.

939
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:32,284
Oh, no.

940
01:01:33,326 --> 01:01:35,157
No, this can't happen.

941
01:01:36,086 --> 01:01:39,237
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- But it has happened.

942
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,402
When I found you carried my picture,

943
01:01:41,526 --> 01:01:44,086
I knew you were in love with me, too.

944
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:46,357
That's why you said
you couldn't meet me.

945
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:48,682
I did have an appointment.
You met Ruth...

946
01:01:48,807 --> 01:01:50,559
No, you were afraid, weren't you?

947
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:52,518
After you called, I went home.

948
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:55,844
For years I'd always felt
comfortable in that house.

949
01:01:56,287 --> 01:02:00,361
I sat down, I tried to read the paper,
I tried to relax, but I couldn't, Norma.

950
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:02,922
I felt desperate
sitting in my own living room.

951
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:06,563
I felt as though I were trapped
in a tomb of my own making

952
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:09,965
and all the years until today
were stones closing up the tomb

953
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:12,649
and I had to escape
because I was still alive,

954
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:14,168
alive and wanting you.

955
01:02:19,689 --> 01:02:22,079
Oh, please, Cliff, please!

956
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:25,088
You said you were lonely.
You'll never be alone again.

957
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,762
You'll never go away from me.

958
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,564
Pardon me, sir.
This is our first trip to America.

959
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:40,127
- Is the Hollywood Bowl open?
- No, not till midsummer.

960
01:02:40,251 --> 01:02:41,889
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

961
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:47,688
- Can't we go some place?
- Cliff, let me alone.

962
01:02:47,812 --> 01:02:50,121
- Darling, I love you.
- Please.

963
01:02:50,252 --> 01:02:52,368
I beg you, let me alone now.

964
01:02:54,612 --> 01:02:57,570
All right. When will I see you?

965
01:02:58,972 --> 01:03:00,725
- Tomorrow.
- When?

966
01:03:02,173 --> 01:03:03,572
After work.

967
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:06,449
I'll be waiting here.

968
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:26,924
Daddy!

969
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:29,888
- Mum and I had the coolest time.
- Yes, real cool.

970
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,846
We went to dinner and saw a show.

971
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,443
- It was dreamy, the positive end.
- Fine, darling.

972
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:36,327
You're an old stay-out. You just home?

973
01:03:36,455 --> 01:03:39,175
I was home earlier
but I went out again.

974
01:03:39,296 --> 01:03:42,732
Take these in to Mrs. Rogers.
Three dozen most heavenly shrimp.

975
01:03:42,856 --> 01:03:46,371
I found them at the shopping centre.
They looked simply...

976
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:49,215
- Cliff, something wrong?
- Wrong?

977
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:53,967
- You sound funny. You catching cold?
- No, no, I'm all right.

978
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:57,692
- Why are you staying out here?
- I didn't feel like going in just yet.

979
01:03:58,577 --> 01:04:02,810
- Cliff, is something wrong at the office?
- No, I just have a little headache.

980
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:05,975
- I'll give you some aspirin.
- I want to get some air.

981
01:04:06,098 --> 01:04:07,611
Fine, we'll get some air.

982
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,287
Mrs. Groves, are the shrimp for?

983
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:22,562
- Ellen's doing well with her music.
- Yes, very well.

984
01:04:22,685 --> 01:04:26,598
- I missed you tonight.
- Oh? But you had fun with Frankie?

985
01:04:26,725 --> 01:04:29,115
Not really.
It was lonely dining without you.

986
01:04:29,246 --> 01:04:33,398
The movie was so young and romantic,
I kept wanting your shoulder to lean on.

987
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:36,643
- Mother!
- It's always the children.

988
01:04:36,766 --> 01:04:39,041
What did you do with my pyjamas?

989
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:59,407
Miss Vail, did the airline
contact your office?

990
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:02,645
They have your reservation
to New York a week from today.

991
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:04,839
Well, tell them to cancel it, please.

992
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:09,440
I'll be glad to, Miss Vail. How long
will you be staying on in Los Angeles?

993
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:10,968
I don't know yet.

994
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:15,798
Of course I sympathise with you,
but maybe it was all for the best.

995
01:05:15,929 --> 01:05:18,205
Maybe Ann wasn't
the girl for you. Fate...

996
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:21,959
- There'll never be another girl like Ann.
- It's all out of our hands.

997
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,685
- Sometimes you lack understanding.
- Raising your voice won't help.

998
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,280
Everyone else round here is playing it
to the hilt. Why shouldn't I?

999
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,728
You're right. Arguing won't help.

1000
01:05:34,651 --> 01:05:36,721
- This has got to be done.
- What?

1001
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:39,319
- Come on, get your coat.
- Why?

1002
01:05:39,451 --> 01:05:40,850
Do as I say.

1003
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:49,362
- Vinnie, I'm scared.
- Come on.

1004
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:51,289
We've gone too far to turn back now.

1005
01:05:55,973 --> 01:05:58,851
- Yes? May I help you?
- Miss Vail, please.

1006
01:05:58,973 --> 01:06:00,531
- Who's calling?
- Mr. Groves.

1007
01:06:00,653 --> 01:06:02,052
Just a moment, please.

1008
01:06:04,133 --> 01:06:07,524
- Will you ring Miss Vail, please?
- Oh, Vinnie.

1009
01:06:10,574 --> 01:06:11,563
Hello?

1010
01:06:11,694 --> 01:06:14,527
Miss Vail?
There's a Mr. Groves in the lobby.

1011
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:17,566
Mr. Groves?
Yes, have him come up, please.

1012
01:06:17,694 --> 01:06:20,084
Will you go up, please? 618.

1013
01:06:20,215 --> 01:06:21,614
Yes, thank you.

1014
01:06:36,216 --> 01:06:37,615
620.

1015
01:06:37,736 --> 01:06:39,374
619.

1016
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,056
618. Suppose he's with her?

1017
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,616
Cliff, I just got...

1018
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,250
Why, Vinnie, Ellen.

1019
01:06:57,377 --> 01:06:58,367
Come in.

1020
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:01,929
What a nice surprise.

1021
01:07:02,058 --> 01:07:06,256
I just got back from work
a few minutes ago.

1022
01:07:06,378 --> 01:07:09,893
Could I get you something?
Some hot chocolate or some tea?

1023
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:13,170
No, thank you.
We want to ask you something.

1024
01:07:13,299 --> 01:07:14,288
Yes?

1025
01:07:14,419 --> 01:07:18,094
Wouldn't it be better
if you went back to New York?

1026
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,492
Why?

1027
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,771
- Because of what's going on.
- Going on?

1028
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,258
Yeah. Between you and my father.

1029
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:35,534
I drove to Palm Valley
the weekend you spent with him.

1030
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:39,291
I saw you, heard you.

1031
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:44,935
And just exactly
what did you see and hear?

1032
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,370
In your bungalow.

1033
01:07:47,502 --> 01:07:49,299
Both of you were laughing so...

1034
01:07:51,142 --> 01:07:53,133
...so intimate.

1035
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:55,735
So intimate?

1036
01:07:57,062 --> 01:07:59,098
Oh, Vinnie!

1037
01:07:59,222 --> 01:08:02,613
Listen, children. In Palm Valley
two old friends met by chance.

1038
01:08:02,743 --> 01:08:05,701
They had some good talks,
laughed over old memories.

1039
01:08:05,823 --> 01:08:09,293
They had fun. That's all there was to it.
I want you to believe me.

1040
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:16,733
Don't you?

1041
01:08:16,864 --> 01:08:18,456
I do.

1042
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:20,859
But later, when Daddy came home,

1043
01:08:20,984 --> 01:08:23,293
Vinnie says he kept calling you,

1044
01:08:23,424 --> 01:08:24,413
at night.

1045
01:08:24,544 --> 01:08:27,105
He made a date
to see you yesterday.

1046
01:08:28,225 --> 01:08:31,661
I don't usually go around snooping
but I had to think of my mother.

1047
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:33,904
Oh, yes.

1048
01:08:35,065 --> 01:08:37,944
Yes, it's always Mother, never Father.

1049
01:08:38,066 --> 01:08:39,465
That's unfair.

1050
01:08:39,586 --> 01:08:44,023
Your father has been neglected
for a long time by a family he loves.

1051
01:08:44,146 --> 01:08:46,819
- That's not true.
- You've treated him shamefully.

1052
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:50,735
Everyone has taken him for granted
because he's a good man.

1053
01:08:52,907 --> 01:08:54,898
Do you know how much he loves you?

1054
01:08:57,747 --> 01:09:00,545
You should hear his plans
for your future, Vinnie.

1055
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:04,138
And how his eyes shine
when he speaks about the princess.

1056
01:09:04,268 --> 01:09:08,056
Yes, in spite of your rudeness
the other night at the dinner table.

1057
01:09:09,748 --> 01:09:13,343
Do you think if you gave your father
half the love you give your mother,

1058
01:09:13,468 --> 01:09:17,178
you would have needed to come here
with your accusations today?

1059
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:20,221
Why should Cliff need me
if he was given love at home?

1060
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:21,941
Why would he go outside for it?

1061
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:24,139
- We love Father.
- Then why neglect him?

1062
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:27,420
Why do you take and not give back
one shred of love in return?

1063
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:30,383
How many years do you think
a man will put up with that?

1064
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:32,421
So that's why he fell in love with you.

1065
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,709
Listen, Ellen...

1066
01:09:40,471 --> 01:09:42,382
Love is a very reckless thing.

1067
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:45,703
Maybe it isn't even a good thing.

1068
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,588
When you're young and in love,

1069
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:51,305
nothing matters
except your own satisfaction.

1070
01:09:52,872 --> 01:09:55,466
The tragic thing
about growing older is that...

1071
01:09:56,752 --> 01:09:59,141
...you can't be
quite as reckless any more.

1072
01:09:59,912 --> 01:10:03,985
You begin to understand
what is important and what is not.

1073
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:05,512
And to your father,

1074
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:09,228
the most important thing, believe me,
is his family's happiness.

1075
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:13,783
You couldn't be as blind
as not to have known that.

1076
01:10:13,913 --> 01:10:17,349
Can you blame anybody but yourselves
if he is thinking of leaving you?

1077
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:26,586
Oh, Miss Vail, I know we're to blame.

1078
01:10:28,194 --> 01:10:29,786
But please...

1079
01:10:30,715 --> 01:10:33,229
Please don't take Daddy away from us.

1080
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:35,152
Don't take him away!

1081
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,548
I'm sorry. I'm late.

1082
01:10:42,635 --> 01:10:44,035
I have an appointment.

1083
01:11:06,557 --> 01:11:10,551
- Here's a sketch of the doll.
- It looks very nice, Mr. Groves.

1084
01:11:10,678 --> 01:11:13,954
- Could I see the doll made up?
- Do we have one in the stockroom?

1085
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:16,797
- Show it to Mr. Mayer, will you?
- This way, please.

1086
01:11:16,918 --> 01:11:19,557
Watch your head here.

1087
01:11:19,678 --> 01:11:21,988
What about Rex, Mr. Mayer?

1088
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:25,191
Send me a gross of them
and I'll see how he sells.

1089
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:29,073
I have an appointment. I'll have to run.
Jack will take good care of you.

1090
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,709
Remember that place
overlooking the ocean?

1091
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,310
- Cliff, listen to me.
- I've been planning all day.

1092
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,674
Do you remember that place
where we celebrated my first contract?

1093
01:11:48,801 --> 01:11:50,200
We'll drive there now.

1094
01:11:50,321 --> 01:11:53,119
We'll sit by the fire
and watch the storm on the ocean.

1095
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:56,438
- I'm trying to tell you something.
- I'm sorry. What is it?

1096
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:59,440
I'm flying to New York tonight
on the 6:00 plane.

1097
01:11:59,562 --> 01:12:00,836
Why?

1098
01:12:00,962 --> 01:12:04,637
- Norma, nothing makes any difference.
- Listen to me carefully.

1099
01:12:06,362 --> 01:12:09,240
20 years ago I left here
because I was in love with you.

1100
01:12:09,362 --> 01:12:10,796
Yes.

1101
01:12:10,923 --> 01:12:14,120
Norma Miller, the little girl
who couldn't face reality.

1102
01:12:15,683 --> 01:12:18,720
Today Norma Vail is leaving
because she can face reality.

1103
01:12:18,843 --> 01:12:20,561
- There's only one reality.
- No.

1104
01:12:20,683 --> 01:12:24,882
The only reality is 20 years
of Clifford Groves as a husband

1105
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:27,074
and as a father.

1106
01:12:28,204 --> 01:12:30,957
20 years of my being a career woman

1107
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:33,200
with an eye
to design and merchandising.

1108
01:12:33,804 --> 01:12:35,875
- Norma, I love you.
- No, no.

1109
01:12:36,005 --> 01:12:38,200
No, you don't love me.

1110
01:12:38,325 --> 01:12:39,917
It's your...

1111
01:12:40,045 --> 01:12:42,275
It's your search for youth,

1112
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:45,602
to push back the years,
to feel carefree again.

1113
01:12:45,725 --> 01:12:47,875
And you can't, not ever.
None of us can.

1114
01:12:48,766 --> 01:12:50,324
That isn't life.

1115
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:54,277
But you have a wonderful life
with Marion and the children.

1116
01:12:57,446 --> 01:12:59,277
And I, too, have a life.

1117
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:03,404
And I'm going back to it.

1118
01:13:04,127 --> 01:13:05,719
You can't leave me.

1119
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:10,324
And if I don't leave you?

1120
01:13:13,448 --> 01:13:16,440
What would you do
the day we're together

1121
01:13:16,568 --> 01:13:19,640
and you read in the paper
that Vinnie Groves is graduating?

1122
01:13:21,288 --> 01:13:23,358
You'll want to run from me
and be with him,

1123
01:13:23,488 --> 01:13:25,444
but you'll wonder if he'll see you.

1124
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:30,602
And the day you hear
about the first professional recital

1125
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:33,084
of that young dancer, Frances Groves.

1126
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:37,838
You'll feel sick at not being invited.

1127
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:42,361
And I'll feel sick for you.

1128
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,128
- Norma!
- And Ellen's wedding?

1129
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:48,285
- Stop it, Norma.
- Oh, no, her father isn't here.

1130
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:50,720
He ran away with another woman,
remember?

1131
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:52,523
At his age! The poor kid.

1132
01:13:52,651 --> 01:13:55,404
- Norma!
- Oh, face it, Cliff! I've had to face it.

1133
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,408
You know you'll want
to see Marion again,

1134
01:13:57,531 --> 01:14:01,046
hear her voice, quarrel with her
over the bills and the children.

1135
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,963
She's the one who belongs in your life.

1136
01:14:06,892 --> 01:14:08,484
Your first love.

1137
01:14:12,092 --> 01:14:13,889
And that's the way it should be.

1138
01:14:15,693 --> 01:14:17,649
It's such a good life.

1139
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,248
What have I to give you
to take its place?

1140
01:14:31,694 --> 01:14:33,446
Be happy, Cliff.

1141
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:36,646
You will be happy.

1142
01:14:39,134 --> 01:14:40,328
Norma!

1143
01:14:40,454 --> 01:14:42,252
Pardon me, Cliff, about the doll.

1144
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:44,013
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Mayer here...

1145
01:15:00,056 --> 01:15:01,455
Taxi.

1146
01:15:07,897 --> 01:15:09,296
Norma!

1147
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,297
Ann. Ann, wait.

1148
01:16:09,422 --> 01:16:10,821
Let me explain.

1149
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:14,014
I went to see Norma.
She's a wonderful woman.

1150
01:16:14,142 --> 01:16:16,337
Well, that's no surprise to me.

1151
01:16:17,142 --> 01:16:20,931
What do you want me to say?
That I've been a kid? I admit it.

1152
01:16:21,063 --> 01:16:23,338
And I was wrong
about Norma and Cliff, too.

1153
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:25,374
What more do you want?

1154
01:16:25,503 --> 01:16:27,539
I've learned a lot in the last 24 hours,

1155
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:30,814
but most of all what it means
to really care for someone.

1156
01:16:30,943 --> 01:16:34,732
Well, you needn't be so forcible about it.

1157
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,743
I love you.

1158
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:44,978
I never knew how to give love,
only how to take it.

1159
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:50,141
I guess it's the hardest job to learn
in the whole world,

1160
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:52,938
how to give love
and expect nothing in return.

1161
01:16:54,745 --> 01:16:56,303
Well, what do you know.

1162
01:16:57,705 --> 01:16:59,981
Long pants at last.

1163
01:17:02,026 --> 01:17:03,015
Oh, Vinnie!

1164
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:09,376
- Ellen, where did you put my cologne?
- It's on the dressing table somewhere.

1165
01:17:09,506 --> 01:17:11,099
It is not. I looked.

1166
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:12,546
Oh, yes, Gloria, hi.

1167
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:15,306
- Where is it?
- You're too young to use it anyhow.

1168
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,897
- That's what you think.
- It's Frankie being dramatic again.

1169
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:21,746
- Yes, go on.
- You're the ham.

1170
01:17:21,867 --> 01:17:23,665
But Gloria, darling,

1171
01:17:23,788 --> 01:17:28,384
the question is, can a woman like me
love a basketball player all of her life?

1172
01:17:28,508 --> 01:17:30,419
Ooh, cut out the mush!

1173
01:17:30,548 --> 01:17:32,982
Oh, yes, tell me all about it.

1174
01:17:33,108 --> 01:17:35,099
- He did?
- Who did?

1175
01:17:35,228 --> 01:17:37,185
Oh, Gloria!

1176
01:17:39,269 --> 01:17:41,225
- Gosh, that's awful...
- Hi, Daddy.

1177
01:17:42,869 --> 01:17:44,268
Hello, Pavlova.

1178
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:46,061
Is it still raining?

1179
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,868
No, it's stopped raining.

1180
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:54,181
Oh, Daddy, hi.

1181
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:57,143
- Hello, Princess.
- I'll be through in a minute.

1182
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:00,421
I'll be at your house at 8:00
and we can do our homework.

1183
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,382
I want my cologne.

1184
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,581
Yes, Gloria. Okay, see you tonight.

1185
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:05,746
Bye.

1186
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,023
Hello, Dad.

1187
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:09,550
Hello, Vinnie.

1188
01:18:09,671 --> 01:18:13,107
- How are you feeling?
- I'm... I'm fine.

1189
01:18:16,432 --> 01:18:19,390
- I'm glad.
- My watch seems to have stopped.

1190
01:18:21,432 --> 01:18:23,821
- Dad, what time is it?
- Oh...

1191
01:18:24,952 --> 01:18:26,864
- It's a little after 6:00.
- Thanks.

1192
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:30,463
Gloria and I have emotional problems
to discuss. New ones.

1193
01:18:50,874 --> 01:18:53,264
- Would you like a magazine?
- No, thank you.

1194
01:19:32,078 --> 01:19:34,717
Hello, dear.
Feeling better tonight?

1195
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:35,827
What?

1196
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:40,474
You've worried me these last few days.
It's not like you to be irritable.

1197
01:19:40,598 --> 01:19:41,998
I know.

1198
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:45,710
- But I'm all right now.
- Good.

1199
01:19:47,759 --> 01:19:49,829
You know me better
than I know myself.

1200
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:52,835
I should after a lifetime with you.

1201
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,594
They make a handsome couple,
don't they?
