1
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,560
Usurer!

2
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Usurer!

3
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,160
"If a man is righteous, and
does what is lawful and right,"

4
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,040
"if he has not exacted usury
nor taken any increase"

5
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,240
"but has withdrawn his
hand from all iniquity"

6
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,240
"and executed true judgment
between men and men,"

7
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,680
"if he has walked in my statutes"

8
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,720
"and kept my judgment faithfully, then
he is just and he shall surely live."

9
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,880
"But if he has exacted
usury and taken increase,"

10
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,720
"shall he then live?"

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,920
"No, he shall not live. If he has
done any of these abominations.."

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
".. he shall surely
die, says the Lord."

13
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,920
And yet you live by
theft and robbery..

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Antonio.

15
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,640
Antonio.

16
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
Bassanio.

17
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,680
Wind's coming back, sir.

18
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,280
Signior Lorenzo.

19
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
Jessica.

20
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,640
In truth, I know not
why I am so sad.

21
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,600
It wearies me. You
say it wearies you.

22
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,760
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
that I have much ado than know myself.

23
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,400
Your mind is tossing
on the ocean.

24
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,080
Believe me, sir, had I
such venture forth,

25
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,280
the better part of my affection
would be with my hopes abroad.

26
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,280
I should be still plucking the
grass to know where sits the wind,

27
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,440
peering in maps for ports
and piers and roads.

28
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,760
And every object that might make
me fear misfortune to my ventures

29
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
out of doubt would make me sad.

30
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,600
My wind, cooling my broth,

31
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,440
would blow me to a fever if I thought what
harm a wind too great might do at sea.

32
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Believe me, no.

33
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,680
Why, then you're in love.

34
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Fie, fie, fie!

35
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,760
Not in love either?

36
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
Then let us say you are sad

37
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
because you are not merry.

38
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,440
Here comes my lord Bassanio.

39
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,520
- Good morrow, my good lord.
- Good signiors. When shall we laugh?

40
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,920
We shall make our leisures
to fit in with yours.

41
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,520
- Bassanio.
- Signior.

42
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,680
My lord Bassanio, since you have found
Antonio, we too will leave you.

43
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,560
You look not well,
Signior Antonio.

44
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
You have too much
respect upon the world.

45
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,720
They lose it that do
buy it with much care.

46
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,200
I hold the world but as
the world, Gratiano -

47
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,440
a stage where every man must play
his part, and mine a sad one.

48
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
Come, good Lorenzo.

49
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Fare thee well awhile. I'll end
my exhortation after dinner.

50
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,520
Fare thee well.

51
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,000
Gratiano speaks an
infinite deal of nothing,

52
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,280
more than any man
in all of Venice.

53
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,280
Well?

54
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,960
Tell me now..

55
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,920
that which today you
promised to tell me of.

56
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,200
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, how
much I have disabled mine estate,

57
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,920
but my chief care is to come
squarely out of the great debts

58
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,760
wherein my youth,
something too prodigal,

59
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,840
has left me pledged.

60
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,640
To you, Antonio, I owe the
most in money and in love,

61
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,560
and from your love I have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes

62
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
how to get clear of
all the debts I owe.

63
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,760
Pray, good Bassanio,
let me know it.

64
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:11,280
And, if it stand, as you yourself
still do, within the eye of honour,

65
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,760
be assured my purse, my
person, my extremest means

66
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,200
lie all unlocked
to your occasion.

67
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
In Belmont is a
lady richly left -

68
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,680
and she is fair, and
fairer than that word -

69
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
of wondrous virtues.

70
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,040
Sometimes, from her eyes
I did receive fair..

71
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
speechless messages.

72
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,320
Her name is Portia, no less a beauty
than Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.

73
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Nor is the wide world
ignorant of her worth,

74
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,520
for the four winds blow in from
every coast renowned suitors.

75
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,560
O my Antonio,

76
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,320
had I but the means to hold a
rival place with one of them

77
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,960
then I should questionless
be fortunate.

78
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,680
Thou knowest my
fortunes are at sea.

79
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,440
Neither have I money nor commodity
to raise a present sum.

80
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,400
Therefore, go forth.

81
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,040
Try what my credit
can in Venice do.

82
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,720
It shall be racked, even to the
uttermost, to furnish you to Belmont,

83
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
and fair Portia.

84
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,960
I swear to you, Nerissa,

85
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,960
- I am more weary of this great world.
- You would be, sweet madam,

86
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,320
if your miseries were as plentiful
as your good fortunes are.

87
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,360
And yet, from what I see,

88
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,760
they are as sick that have it in excess
as those that starve with nothing.

89
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,120
If doing were as easy as
knowing what were good to do,

90
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,160
chapels had been churches,

91
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,080
and poor men's cottages
princes' palaces.

92
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,000
But this reasoning is not in the
way to choose me a husband.

93
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,360
O me, the word "choose"!

94
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,240
I may neither choose who I would
nor refuse who I dislike.

95
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,280
So is the will of a living
daughter ruled by a dead father.

96
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,960
Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I
cannot choose one nor refuse none?

97
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Your father was always virtuous,

98
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,880
and holy men, at their death,
have good inspirations.

99
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,520
Therefore the lottery,
that he devised

100
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,680
in these three chests of
gold and silver and lead,

101
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,160
so that who chooses his
meaning chooses you,

102
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,480
will no doubt only be guessed, rightly,
by someone who you shall rightly love.

103
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,840
Right.

104
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,960
What warmth is there
in your affection

105
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,200
towards any of these princely
suitors that are already come?

106
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,360
Pray name them, and as you name
them I will describe them,

107
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,960
and, according to my description,
level at my affection.

108
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,800
How say you of the French
lord, Monsieur Le Bon?

109
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,040
Oh, God.

110
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,320
God made him, and therefore
let him pass for a man.

111
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,920
I know it is a sin to
be a mocker, but he..!

112
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
What say you to Falconbridge,
the young baron of England?

113
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,120
How oddly he's suited!

114
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,440
And the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

115
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,680
Very vilely in the morning
when he is sober,

116
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,680
and most vilely in the
afternoon when he is drunk.

117
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,400
O Nerissa!

118
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,320
Wait! Wait.

119
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,040
If he should offer to choose,
and choose the right casket,

120
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,520
you should refuse to perform your father's
will if you should refuse to accept him.

121
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Therefore, for fear of
the worst, I pray thee,

122
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,040
set a deep glass of Rhenish
wine on the contrary casket.

123
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,800
I will do anything, Nerissa, ere
I will be married to a sponge.

124
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,000
Three thousand ducats.

125
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,640
Well.

126
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,160
Ay, sir, for three months.

127
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,640
For three months?

128
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,440
- Well..
- For which, as I told you,

129
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,400
Antonio shall be bound.

130
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,440
Antonio shall be bound?

131
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,680
Well..

132
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,200
May you help me? Will
you pleasure me?

133
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Should I know your answer?

134
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,240
Three thousand ducats
for three months,

135
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,560
and Antonio bound.

136
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,600
Your answer to that.

137
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,360
Antonio is a good man.

138
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,120
Have you heard any
imputation to the contrary?

139
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,360
No. No, no, no, no. My meaning
in saying that he is a good man

140
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,400
is to have you understand
that he is of good credit.

141
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,440
Yet his means are in question.

142
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,240
He hath a ship bound for
Tripolis, another to the Indies.

143
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,680
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto,
he hath a third ship at Mexico,

144
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,720
a fourth for England,

145
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,960
and other ventures he
hath squandered abroad.

146
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,120
But ships are but boards,

147
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,640
sailors are but men,

148
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,280
there be land rats
and water rats,

149
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,960
water thieves and land thieves.

150
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,840
I mean pirates.

151
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,520
Then there is the peril of
waters, winds and rocks.

152
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,360
The man is, notwithstanding,
of good credit.

153
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,800
Three thousand ducats.

154
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,240
I think I may take his bond.

155
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,080
- Be assured you may.
- May I speak with Antonio?

156
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
If it please you, dine with us.

157
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,360
Yes, to smell pork,

158
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,800
to eat of the habitation which your
prophet the Nazarite conjured the
devil into.

159
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,800
I will buy with you, sell with you, walk
with you, talk with you, & so following,

160
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,480
but I will not eat with you,
nor drink with you,

161
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,520
nor pray with you.

162
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,560
Who is he comes here?

163
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,520
This is Signior Antonio.
Antonio!

164
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,120
Antonio.

165
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,160
How like a fawning
publican he looks.

166
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,320
Shylock! Shylock, do you hear?

167
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,200
I am debating of
my present store,

168
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,640
and by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross

169
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,760
of full three thousand ducats.

170
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,400
But Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew
of my tribe, will furnish me.

171
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,560
Benjamin. Go, seek out Tubal.

172
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,080
But soft, how many months?

173
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,040
Rest you fair, good signior.

174
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,760
Your worship was the
last man in our mouths.

175
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,360
- Is he possessed how much you would?
- Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

176
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,400
And for three months.

177
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,240
Ah, I forgot. Three
months, you told me so.

178
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,560
But soft, erm.. me thought you said you
neither lend nor borrow with interest.

179
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,080
- I do never use it.
- Well.

180
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,240
Three thousand ducats,
'tis a good round sum.

181
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
Launcelot.

182
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,240
The rates.

183
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,760
Three months.. from twelve.

184
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,080
Let me see the rate.

185
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,840
Well, Shylock,

186
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,400
shall we be beholden to you?

187
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,640
Signior Antonio..

188
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,000
many a time, and
oft in the Rialto,

189
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,400
you have reviled me about
my moneys and my usances.

190
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,880
Still, I have borne it
with a patient shrug,

191
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,880
for sufferance is the
badge of all our tribe.

192
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,920
You call me misbeliever,

193
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,680
cut-throat dog,

194
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,320
and spit upon my
Jewish gaberdine.

195
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,000
And all for use of
that which is my own.

196
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,760
Well, it now appears
you need my help.

197
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,440
You come to me and you say,
"Shylock, we would have money."

198
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,720
You say so. You, that did
void your rheum upon my beard

199
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,520
and kick me as you spurn a
stranger cur over your threshold.

200
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,520
Money is your suit. What
should I say to you?

201
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
Should I not say,
"Hath a dog money?"

202
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,560
"Is it possible a cur can
lend three thousand ducats?"

203
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,560
Or shall I bend low

204
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,400
and, in a slavish voice, with bated breath
and whispering humbleness say this..

205
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,600
"Fair sir, you spat on
me on Wednesday last,

206
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,360
"you spurned me such a day,
another time you called me dog."

207
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,560
"For these courtesies, I'll
lend you thus much moneys."

208
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,480
I'm as like to call you so again, to
spit on you again, to spurn you too.

209
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,600
If you would lend this money,
lend it not unto your friends.

210
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,280
For when did friendship take a breed
for barren metal from his friends?

211
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,640
Lend it rather to your
enemy who, if he break,

212
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,920
you may with better
face exact the penalty.

213
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,960
Why, look how you storm. I
would be friends with you

214
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,480
and have your love.

215
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,640
Forget the stains that
you have shamed me with.

216
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,160
Supply your present wants, and take not
a drop of interest for my moneys..

217
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,760
and you'll not hear me.

218
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,280
This is kind I offer.

219
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,880
- This is kindness.
- No..

220
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,160
This kindness I will show.

221
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,200
Go with me to a notary

222
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,640
and seal me there
your single bond.

223
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,040
And in a merry sport,

224
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,160
if you repay me
not on such a day

225
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,600
in such a place, such a sum or sums
as are expressed in the condition,

226
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,240
let the forfeit be nominated..

227
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,600
for an equal pound
of your fair flesh

228
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,360
to be cut off and taken

229
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,080
in what part of your
body pleaseth me.

230
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,720
Content, I'faith.

231
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,200
I'll seal to such a bond,

232
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,160
and say there is much
kindness in the Jew.

233
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,000
You shall not seal such a bond for me.
I'd rather live in my necessity.

234
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
Why, fear not, man.

235
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,280
I will not forfeit it.

236
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,760
Within these two months, that's
a month before this bond expires,

237
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,880
I do expect return of thrice three
times the value of this bond.

238
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,600
O father Abraham, what
these Christians are,

239
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,680
whose own hard dealings teaches them
suspect the thoughts of others.

240
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,960
I pray you, tell me this.

241
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,280
If he should break his day, what should
I gain by the exaction of the forfeiture?

242
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,880
A pound of a man's flesh taken
from a man is not so estimable,

243
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,600
profitable neither,

244
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,560
as flesh of muttons,
beefs, or goats.

245
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,360
I say, to buy his favour,
I extend this friendship.

246
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,400
If he will take it, so.
If not, adieu.

247
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,560
And, for my love, I
pray you, wrong me not.

248
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,000
Shylock..

249
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,920
I will seal unto this bond.

250
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,720
Dislike me not for
my complexion,

251
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,760
the shadowed livery of the burnished sun,
to whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

252
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,640
Yallah! Yallah!

253
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,160
Bring me the fairest
creature northward born,

254
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,360
where the sun's fire
scarce thaws the icicles,

255
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,000
and let us make
incision for your love

256
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,920
to prove whose blood is
reddest, his or mine.

257
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,840
I tell thee,

258
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,320
lady, this aspect of mine
hath feared the valiant.

259
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,680
Yea, by my love I swear, the most regarded
virgins of our clime have loved it too.

260
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,120
I would not change this hue, except to
steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

261
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,400
In terms of choice, I am not solely led
by nice direction of a maiden's eyes.

262
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,160
Instead, the lottery of my destiny bars
me the right of voluntary choosing.

263
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,800
But if my father had
not restrained me,

264
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,480
and hedged me by his wit
to yield myself as wife

265
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,960
to him who wins me by
that means I told you,

266
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,720
yourself, renowned prince,

267
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,520
then stood as fair as.. any comer I
have looked on yet for my affection.

268
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,840
Even for that, I thank you.

269
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,840
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to
the caskets to try my fortune.

270
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,400
Yes?

271
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,040
I pray you, Leonardo, these things
being bought and orderly bestowed,

272
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,880
return in haste, for I do feast tonight
my best esteemed acquaintance.

273
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,560
Let supper be ready at the
latest by nine o'clock.

274
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,960
See that these letters
are delivered.

275
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,920
And put the livery
to the making.

276
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,920
Certainly my conscience would forbid
me to run from this Jew, my master.

277
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
Ho!

278
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,560
I pray you, which way
to the master Jew's?

279
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,400
Do you not know me, Father?

280
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,600
Lord, how art thou changed!

281
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,040
How dost thou and thy master agree?
I brought him a present.

282
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
Famished in his service, Father.
I'm glad you've come.

283
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,160
Give your present to
one master Bassanio,

284
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,400
who indeed gives
rare new liveries.

285
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,160
Si.

286
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,120
Bassanio!

287
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,120
Bassanio!

288
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,360
- Gratiano.
- I have a suit to you.

289
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,640
- You have obtained it.
- You must not deny me -

290
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
I must go with you to Belmont.

291
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Why, then you must. But hear thee, you
are too wild, too rude, too bold of voice,

292
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,360
things that become you happily enough
& in such eyes as ours appears not false.

293
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,720
But where you are not known, why, there
they show something too.. liberal.

294
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,600
Pray you, take pain to dilute with some
cold drops of modesty your skipping spirit,

295
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,080
lest through your wild behaviour I
be misconstrued in the place I go

296
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,120
and lose my hopes.

297
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,640
Signior Bassanio, hear me.

298
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,120
If I do not put on a sober habit, talk
with respect, and swear but now & then,

299
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,320
look demurely, nay more,
while grace is saying,

300
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,480
hood mine eyes thus with my hat

301
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,560
and sigh and say, "Amen,"
never trust me more.

302
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,480
Well, we shall see your bearing.

303
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,880
Oof!

304
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,720
Nay, but I bar tonight.

305
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,280
You shall not gauge me
by what we do tonight.

306
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
God bless your worship.

307
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,720
Signior Bassanio.

308
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,520
Many thanks.

309
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
Would you something from me?

310
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,520
- Here is my son, sir, a poor boy.
- Not a poor boy, sir,

311
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,120
but the rich Jew's
man that would, sir,

312
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,120
as my father shall specify.

313
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,960
He hath a great infection, sir,
as one would say, to serve.

314
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,880
Indeed, sir. The short
and the long is,

315
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,320
I serve the Jew, and have a desire,
as my father shall specify.

316
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,160
To be brief, the very truth is, as my father,
being an old man, shall fruitify unto you..

317
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,680
I have here a dish of doves I
would bestow upon your worship.

318
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,120
And my suit is..

319
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,480
In very brief, the suit
is impertinent to myself,

320
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,080
as your worship shall know
by this honest old man.

321
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,040
And, though I say it, though old
man, yet poor man, my father.

322
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,280
One speak for both.
What would you?

323
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,440
- Serve you, sir.
- That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

324
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,600
You have obtained your suit,

325
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,760
if it be preferment to
leave a rich Jew's service

326
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,280
to become the follower
of so poor a gentleman.

327
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,840
The old proverb is very well parted
between my master Shylock & you, sir.

328
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,200
You have the grace of God,
sir, and he has enough.

329
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,120
You speak it well. Give him a livery more
guarded than his fellows'. See it done.

330
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,160
I'm sorry you will
leave my father so.

331
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,920
Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil,
did rob it of some taste of tediousness.

332
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,760
And Launcelot, soon at supper
shall you see Lorenzo,

333
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,080
who is thy new master's guest.

334
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,120
Give him this letter.

335
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,920
Do it secretly.

336
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,960
And so farewell.

337
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,480
I would not have my father
see me talk with thee.

338
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,600
Adieu.

339
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:25,840
Tears exhibit my tongue. Most
beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew.

340
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,800
O Lorenzo, if thou keep promise,
I shall end this strife,

341
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,640
becoming Christian and
your loving wife.

342
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,040
Jessica?

343
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,880
Well.

344
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,560
You will see, your eyes
will be the judge,

345
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,560
the difference of old
Shylock and Bassanio.

346
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,720
You will not gourmandise with
him, as you have done with me,

347
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,320
nor sleep and snore
and wear apparel out.

348
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,800
Not with him.

349
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,760
- Jessica, I say!
- Why, Jessica.

350
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,800
Who bids you call?

351
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,720
I do not bid you call.

352
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Your worship was used to say I
could do nothing without bidding.

353
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,840
Oh.

354
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,680
Call you?

355
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,480
- What's your will?
- I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.

356
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,520
There are my keys.

357
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,600
Wherefore should I go?

358
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,240
I am not bid for love.

359
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,400
Oh, they flatter me.

360
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,600
Yet I will go and feed upon
the prodigal Christian.

361
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,080
Jessica, my girl,
look to my house.

362
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,640
Oh, I am right loath to go.

363
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,680
There is some ill a-brewing
towards my rest,

364
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,840
for I did dream of
money bags tonight.

365
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,600
I beseech you, sir, go.

366
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,720
My young master expects
your reproach.

367
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,000
And so do I his.

368
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,160
And they have
conspired together.

369
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,000
I will not say you
shall see a masque,

370
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,560
but if you do, it was not for nothing
that my nose fell a-bleeding

371
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
on Black Monday last at six
o'clock in the morning.

372
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,280
What, are there masques?

373
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,080
Hear you me, Jessica,

374
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,520
clamber not you up to
the casements then,

375
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,320
nor thrust your head
into the public street

376
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,960
to gaze on Christian fools
with varnished faces.

377
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,080
Let not the sound of shallow
foppery enter my sober house.

378
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,360
Oh, by Jacob's staff, I swear I have
no mind of feasting forth tonight.

379
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,840
But I will go.

380
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,280
Go you before, sirrah.
Say I will come.

381
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,320
I will go before, sir.

382
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,320
Mistress, look out the
window for all this.

383
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,000
There will come a Christian boy
will be worth a Jewess' eye.

384
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,560
What says that fool of
Hagar's offspring, ha?

385
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,440
His words were, "Farewell,
mistress." Nothing else.

386
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,360
The fool is kind enough

387
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,560
but a huge feeder.

388
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Snail-slow in profit, and he
sleeps by day more than a tomcat.

389
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,800
Therefore, I part with him.

390
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,040
Well, Jessica, go in. Perhaps
I will return immediately.

391
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,680
Do as I bid you.

392
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,760
Farewell. And if my
fortune be not crost,

393
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,480
I have a father, you
a daughter, lost.

394
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,560
How do I know if I
do choose the right?

395
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,240
The one of them contains
my picture, Prince.

396
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,080
If you choose that,
then I am yours withal.

397
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,600
Some god direct my judgment!

398
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,680
Let me see.

399
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,440
"Who chooseth me must give
and hazard all he hath."

400
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,240
- Hmm..
- Must give? For what?

401
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,760
For lead? Hazard for lead?

402
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,480
This casket, my
friends, threatens.

403
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,840
Men who hazard all do it in
hope of fair advantages.

404
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,600
A golden mind stoops not
to shows of dross, eh?

405
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,400
I'll then nor give nor hazard
aught for lead, ah? Mm-mm.

406
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,040
What says the silver
with her virgin hue?

407
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,080
"Who chooseth me.."

408
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,240
"shall gain as much
as he deserves."

409
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,200
Pause there, Morocco,

410
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,120
and weigh thy value
with an even hand, ha?

411
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,400
I do in birth deserve
her, and in fortunes,

412
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,520
and in graces, and in
qualities of breeding!

413
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,000
What if I stray no
further but choose here?

414
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,920
Hmm..

415
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,800
"Who chooseth me..

416
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,520
"will gain what many men.."

417
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,920
"desire."

418
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,280
- Hmm..
- Huh?

419
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,200
Why, that's the lady!

420
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,880
All of the world desires her!

421
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,920
From the four corners of the earth,
they come to kiss this shrine,

422
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,120
this mortal-breathing saint.

423
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,800
Deliver me the key. Here do I
choose, and thrive as I may.

424
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,560
There, take it, Prince.

425
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,120
And if my form lie
there, I am yours.

426
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,840
Ha!

427
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,440
O hell.

428
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,000
What have we here?

429
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,520
"All that glistens is not gold.

430
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,880
"Often have you heard that told.

431
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,520
"Gilded tombs do worms enfold.

432
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,360
"Fare you well.."

433
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,040
"but your suit is cold."

434
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,680
For all of my fortune,
Shylock, I give thanks.

435
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,240
To best-esteemed acquaintances.

436
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Antonio, good health.

437
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,320
I know the hand. In
faith, it is a fair hand,

438
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,760
and whiter than the paper it writ
on is the fair hand that writ.

439
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,320
Love-news, in faith.

440
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,560
Meet me tonight.

441
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,880
This is the penthouse under which
Lorenzo desired us to make stand?

442
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,920
His hour is almost past.

443
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,440
And it is a marvel he outstays his hour
for lovers always run before the clock.

444
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
That ever holds.

445
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,400
Who rises from a feast with that
keen appetite that he sits down?

446
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,640
Sweet friends, your
patience for my long delay.

447
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,240
Ho! Who's within?

448
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,000
Who are you?

449
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,120
Tell me for more certainty, albeit I
swear that I do know your tongue.

450
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,360
Lorenzo and thy love.

451
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,280
Lorenzo, certain,
and my love indeed,

452
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,960
for who I love so much?

453
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,160
And now who knows but you,
Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

454
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,080
Heaven and thy thoughts are
witness that thou art.

455
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,920
Here! Catch this casket.

456
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,200
No!

457
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,840
It is worth the pains.

458
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,160
I'm glad 'tis night. You do not look on me
for I am much ashamed of my disguise.

459
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,640
But love is blind & lovers cannot see the
pretty follies that themselves commit.

460
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,600
For if they could, Cupid
himself would blush

461
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,200
to see me thus
transformed into a boy.

462
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,480
Descend, for you must
be my torchbearer.

463
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,360
Why, 'tis an office of discovery,
love, and I should be obscured.

464
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,160
So are you, sweet, even in
the lovely garnish of a boy.

465
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,560
But come at once, for the close
night doth play the runaway.

466
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,360
I will gild myself with some more
ducats and be with you straight.

467
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,600
Contend me, but I
love her, heartily.

468
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,040
For she is wise, if
I can judge of her,

469
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,960
and fair, she is, if
that mine eyes be true

470
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,600
and true she is, as she
hath proved herself.

471
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,600
And therefore, like herself,
wise, fair and true,

472
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,080
shall she be placed
in my constant soul.

473
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,520
No!

474
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,800
Who's there?

475
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,880
- Signior Antonio!
- Fie, fie, Gratiano.

476
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,800
'Tis ten o'clock, our
friends all wait for you.

477
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,040
No masque tonight.

478
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,280
The wind has come about,
Bassanio soon will come aboard.

479
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,440
I have sent twenty
out to seek for you.

480
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,240
Jessica!

481
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,720
Jessica!

482
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,600
Jessica!

483
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,120
I will make some
speed of my return.

484
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,440
Hurry not business for my sake, but
stay the very riping of the time.

485
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,880
And for the Jew's bond that he has of
thee, let it not enter your mind of love.

486
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,840
- Leva I remi.
- Rema.

487
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,040
Avanti!

488
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,760
Be merry and employ your
chiefest thoughts to courtship,

489
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,120
such fair displays of love as may
conveniently become you there.

490
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,840
Tira!

491
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,560
Oh.. ehi! Oh.. ehi!

492
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,240
Oh.. ehi! Oh.. ehi!

493
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,520
No!

494
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,400
No!

495
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,440
No, no.

496
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,800
Jessica!

497
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,880
No.

498
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,320
I never heard a
passion so confused,

499
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,040
so strange, outrageous
and so variable

500
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,440
as the dog Jew did
utter in the streets.

501
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,760
"My daughter! O my ducats!
O my daughter!"

502
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,080
The villain Jew with
outcries raised the Duke

503
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,680
who went with him to
search Bassanio's ship.

504
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,640
He came too late, the
ship was under sail.

505
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,960
Let good Antonio look he keep his
day or he shall pay for this.

506
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,280
Marry, well remembered.

507
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,280
I reasoned with a
Frenchman yesterday

508
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,960
who told me, in the narrow seas
that part the French and English

509
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,440
there miscarried a vessel of
our country richly fraught.

510
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,600
I thought upon Antonio when he told me
and wished in silence that it were not his.

511
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,680
Madam! Madam!

512
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,880
Madam!

513
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,800
Oh.. Madam!

514
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,120
Quick! Quick!

515
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,560
I pray you, the Prince of
Aragon hath taken his oath

516
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,960
and comes to his
election presently.

517
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,560
¡Música!

518
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,760
"Who chooses me must give
and hazard all he has."

519
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,600
You shall look fairer
ere I give or hazard.

520
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,160
What says the golden chest?

521
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,360
Ha! Let me see.

522
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,680
"Who chooses me shall gain
what many men desire."

523
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,520
I will not choose
what many men desire

524
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,320
because I will not jump
with common spirits

525
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,400
and rank me with the
barbarous multitude.

526
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,360
"Who chooses me"

527
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,160
"shall get as much
as he deserves."

528
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,480
And well said, too.

529
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,560
I will assume desert.

530
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,160
Give me a key for this

531
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,240
and instantly unlock
my fortunes here.

532
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,840
Too long a pause for that
which you find there.

533
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,200
What's here?

534
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,040
The portrait of a blinking idiot
presenting me a schedule?

535
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,400
Did I deserve no more
than a fool's head?

536
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,760
Is that my prize?

537
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,680
Are my deserts no better?

538
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,240
To offend and judge are distinct
offices and of opposed natures.

539
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,520
With one fool's head

540
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,000
I came to woo.

541
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,920
But I go away with two.

542
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,000
Antonio's ship is wrecked,
gone down with all hands,

543
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,120
all merchandise lost.

544
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,000
Come on up! Come on up.

545
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,440
Who is that there?

546
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,440
- Jew!
- The Jew! Hey!

547
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,160
Take some pleasure with us!

548
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,440
Taste my Christian flesh!

549
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,960
- What news on the Rialto?
- Why, yet it lives there unchecked

550
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,840
that Antonio hath a ship of rich
lading wrecked on the narrow seas,

551
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,120
the Goodwins, I think they call the
place, a very dangerous flat and fatal..

552
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,240
where the carcasses of many
a tall ship lie buried.

553
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
What say you?

554
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,320
I would it might prove
the end of his losses.

555
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,520
How now, Shylock?

556
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,680
What news amongst the merchants?

557
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,520
You knew of my
daughter's flight.

558
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,080
None so well.

559
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,800
None so well as you.

560
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,440
And Shylock for his own part
knew the bird was fledged

561
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,720
and then it is the complexion
of them all to leave the dam.

562
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,040
She be damned for it.

563
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,840
Tell us, do you hear whether Antonio
have had any loss at sea or no?

564
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,600
Let him look to his bond.

565
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,560
He was wont to call me usurer.
Let him look to his bond.

566
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,760
He was wont to lend money
for Christian courtesy.

567
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,000
Let him look to his bond.

568
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,280
Hello, Jew!

569
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,960
I'm sure if he forfeit you'll not take
his flesh. What's that good for?

570
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,240
To bait fish withal.

571
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,520
If it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge.

572
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,800
He hath disgraced me

573
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,120
and hindered me half a million,

574
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,880
laughed at my losses,
mocked at my gains,

575
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,240
scorned my nation,
thwarted my bargains,

576
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,560
cooled my friends, heated mine
enemies, and what's his reason?

577
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,720
I am a Jew!

578
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,400
Hath not a Jew eyes?

579
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,480
Hath not a Jew hands?

580
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,960
Organs, dimensions?

581
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,760
Senses, affections, passions?

582
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,320
Fed with the same food?

583
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,360
Hurt with the same weapons?

584
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,520
Subject to the same diseases?

585
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,240
Healed by the same means?

586
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,160
Warmed and cooled by the same
winter & summer as a Christian is?

587
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,960
If you prick us,
do we not bleed?

588
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,840
If you tickle us,
do we not laugh?

589
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,800
If you poison us, do we not die?

590
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,800
And if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?

591
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,240
If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that.

592
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:01,200
If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge.

593
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
If a Christian wrong a Jew,

594
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,040
what should his sufferance
be by Christian example?

595
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,200
Why, revenge.

596
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,480
The villainy you teach
me I will execute.

597
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,520
And it shall go hard but I
will better the instruction.

598
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,320
Antonio is at his house.
We should speak with him.

599
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,200
How now, Tubal?

600
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,760
What news from Genoa?

601
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,560
- Have you found my daughter?
- I often came where I did hear of her

602
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,880
but cannot find her.

603
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,760
Why..

604
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,040
there, there, there.

605
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,240
A diamond gone.

606
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,440
Cost me two thousand
ducats in Frankfurt.

607
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,400
The curse never fell upon
our nation till now.

608
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,280
I never felt it.

609
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,360
Till now.

610
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,160
I would my daughter
were dead at my foot

611
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,880
and the jewel in her ear.

612
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,480
No news of them?

613
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,280
Loss upon loss.

614
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,120
The thief gone with so much and
so much to find the thief.

615
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,320
And no satisfaction, no revenge,

616
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,440
no luck stirring

617
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,120
but what lights on my shoulders.

618
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,000
No sighs

619
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,360
but of my breathing.

620
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,920
No tears but of my shedding.

621
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,720
Yes, other men have
ill luck, too.

622
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,840
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa.

623
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,680
What?

624
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,400
What, what? lll luck?

625
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,760
There's a ship, wrecked,
coming from Tripolis.

626
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,320
Oh, I thank God.

627
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,280
I thank God.

628
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,800
Oh!

629
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,840
Heard you in Genoa what?

630
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,480
Your daughter spent in Genoa,

631
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,840
as I heard,

632
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,120
one night, four score ducats.

633
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Oh, you stick a dagger in me.

634
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,360
I shall never see my gold again.

635
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,680
Four score ducats!

636
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,720
At a sitting!

637
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,960
Four score ducats!

638
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,280
There came various of Antonio's
creditors in my company to Venice

639
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,480
- that swear he cannot choose but break.
- I am very glad of it.

640
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,640
I'll plague him.

641
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,840
I'll torture him.
I am glad of it.

642
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,080
One of them showed me a ring
he had of your daughter

643
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,960
for a monkey.

644
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,240
How dare her!

645
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,720
Tubal, you torture me.

646
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,560
It was my turquoise.

647
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,600
I had it of Leah, her mother,
when I was a bachelor.

648
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,400
I would not have given it away
for a wilderness of monkeys.

649
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,720
But Antonio is certainly undone.

650
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,120
That is true.

651
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,240
Tubal, go, find me an officer.

652
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,800
Bespeak him a fortnight before.

653
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,640
I will have Antonio's
heart if he forfeit.

654
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,720
Go, go, Tubal - at our
synagogue, good Tubal.

655
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,920
Oh.. ehi!

656
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,880
Madam!

657
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,040
There is alighted at your
gate a young Venetian,

658
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,360
one who comes to signify the
approaching of his lord.

659
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,160
I have not seen so likely
an ambassador of love!

660
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,040
A day in April never came so sweet to
show how costly summer was at hand

661
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,920
as this.. oh! Forerunner
comes before his lord.

662
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,960
No more, I pray you. I'm half afraid you
will say anon he is some kin to you,

663
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,840
you spin such high-day
wit in praising him.

664
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,720
Come. Come, Nerissa,

665
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,600
for I long to see quick Cupid's
post that comes so mannerly.

666
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,240
Bassanio, lord Love,
if your will it be.

667
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,160
There's something tells
me, but it is not love.

668
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,400
I would not lose you.

669
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,560
And yourself knows hate
counsels not in such a quality.

670
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,880
I would detain you here a month
or two before you venture for me.

671
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,560
I could teach you
how to choose right

672
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,600
but then I'd break my oath.

673
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,640
That will I never do.

674
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,400
So may you miss me

675
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,000
and if you do, you make me wish
that sin that I had broke my oath.

676
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,880
Contend me with your eyes

677
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,680
for they have o'erlooked
me and divided me.

678
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,080
One half of me is yours, the other
half yours, mine own, I would say,

679
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,320
but if mine, then yours and so..

680
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,480
all yours.

681
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,080
Let me choose, for as I
am, I live upon the rack.

682
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,800
Upon the rack, Bassanio?

683
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,000
Then confess what treason there
is mingled with your love.

684
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,120
None but that ugly
treason of mistrust

685
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,240
which makes me fear the
enjoying of my love.

686
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,720
Ay but I fear you
speak upon the rack,

687
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,280
when men enforced
do speak anything.

688
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,480
Promise me life

689
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,520
and I'll confess the truth.

690
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,640
Well, then,

691
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,880
confess and live.

692
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,520
Confess and love has been the
very sum of my confession.

693
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,080
But let me to my fortune
and the caskets.

694
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Away, then.

695
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,320
I am locked in one of them.

696
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:04,560
So may the outward shows
be least themselves.

697
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,720
The world is still
deceived with ornament.

698
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,600
In law, what plea so
tainted and corrupt

699
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:20,560
but being seasoned with a gracious
voice obscures the show of evil?

700
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,800
In religion,

701
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,520
what damned error but some
sober brow will bless it

702
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,680
and approve it with a text,

703
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,240
hiding the grossness with fair..
ornament?

704
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,160
Look on beauty

705
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,360
and you shall see

706
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,640
'tis purchased

707
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,400
by the weight.

708
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,320
Therefore, thou gaudy
gold, I will none of you.

709
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,040
Nor none of you, O pale & common
drudge between man and man.

710
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,520
But you, O meagre lead,

711
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,920
which rather threatenest
than dost promise aught,

712
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,560
your paleness moves me more..

713
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,440
than eloquence.

714
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,440
Here choose I.

715
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,040
Joy be the consequence.

716
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,640
O love, be moderate,
allay your ecstasy,

717
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,200
I feel too much your blessing -
make it less for fear I surfeit.

718
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,120
What find I here?

719
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,520
Fair Portia's counterfeit.

720
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,800
Oh, what demi-goddess
comes so near creation?

721
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,640
Move these eyes? Or whether, riding on
the balls of mine, seem they in motion?

722
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,160
But her eyes - how could
he see to do them?

723
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,720
But look how far the
substance of my praise

724
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,000
does wrong this shadow
in underpraising it,

725
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:50,680
so far this shadow doth
limp behind the substance.

726
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,280
Here's the scroll - the continent
and summary of my fortune.

727
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,000
"You that choose not by the view

728
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,920
"Chances fair and chooses true

729
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,960
"Since this fortune falls on you

730
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,400
"Be content and seek no new

731
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,360
"If you be well
pleased with this

732
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,040
"Then hold your fortune
for your bliss"

733
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,240
"Turn you where your lady is"

734
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,640
"And claim her with
a loving kiss"

735
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,000
A gentle scroll!

736
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,480
Fair lady,

737
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,840
by your leave, I come by note

738
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,920
to give.

739
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,560
And to receive.

740
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,920
Like one of two
contending in a prize

741
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,520
That thinks he has done
well in people's eyes

742
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,120
Hearing applause and
universal shout

743
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,040
Giddy in spirit, still
gazing in a doubt

744
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,520
As doubtful whether
what I see be true

745
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,720
Until confirmed,
signed, ratified

746
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,000
by you

747
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,920
You see me, lord Bassanio,
where I stand, such as I am.

748
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,600
Though for myself alone

749
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,840
I would not be ambitious in my
wish to wish myself much better,

750
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,280
yet for you,

751
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,680
I would be treble
twenty times myself.

752
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,360
A thousand times more fair,

753
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,400
ten thousand times more rich,

754
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,880
that only to stand high in your
account, I might in virtues, beauties,

755
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,720
livings, friends,

756
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,760
exceed account.

757
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,680
But the full sum of me

758
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,280
is sum of something
which, to term in gross,

759
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,000
is an unlessoned girl,

760
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,840
unschooled, unpractised.

761
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,000
Happy in this, she is not yet
so old that she may learn.

762
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,440
Happier than this, she is not
bred so dull that she may learn.

763
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,400
Happiest of all,

764
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,520
is that her gentle spirit commits
itself to yours to be directed

765
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,200
as by her governor,

766
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,080
her lord,

767
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,680
her king.

768
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,640
This house, these servants,

769
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,080
and this same myself

770
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,240
are yours,

771
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,280
my lord's.

772
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,600
I give them with this ring,

773
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,000
which when you part from,
lose or give away,

774
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,920
let it presage the
ruin of your love.

775
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,880
And give me vantage
to exclaim on you.

776
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,600
Madam,

777
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,800
you have bereft me of all words.

778
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,480
Only my blood speaks
to you in my veins,

779
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,960
there is such confusion
in my powers.

780
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,800
But when this ring
parts from this finger

781
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,520
then parts life from hence -

782
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,560
O, then be bold to
say Bassanio's dead.

783
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,120
My lord Bassanio,
my gentle lady,

784
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,040
I wish you all the joy
that you can wish

785
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,800
and when your honours mean to
solemnize the bargain of your faith,

786
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,560
I do beseech you even at that
time, I may be married, too.

787
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,600
With all my heart.

788
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,120
If you can get a wife.

789
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,360
I thank you, your lordship,
you have got me one.

790
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,040
My eyes, my lord, can
look as swift as yours.

791
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,400
You saw the mistress,

792
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,360
I beheld the maid.

793
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,560
Is it true, Nerissa?

794
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,320
- Madam, it is!
- Oh!

795
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,920
And do you, Gratiano,
mean good faith?

796
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,120
Yes, faith, my lord.

797
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,800
Our feast shall be much
honoured in your marriage.

798
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:48,040
We'll play with them the first
boy for a thousand ducats.

799
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,680
- What, with stake down?
- No.

800
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,840
We shall never win at that
sport with stake down.

801
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,960
Ho, there! Ho!

802
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,440
But who comes here?

803
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,920
There are some shrewd
contents in yond same paper,

804
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,160
that do steal the colour
from Bassanio's cheek.

805
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,560
Some dear friend dead, else nothing
in the world could turn the constitution

806
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,600
of any constant man.

807
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,160
What, worse and worse!

808
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,800
With leave, Bassanio,

809
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,800
I am half yourself

810
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,400
and I must freely have half of anything
that this same letter brings you.

811
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,040
O sweet Portia,

812
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,520
they are a few of the unpleasantest
words that ever blotted paper.

813
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,560
Gentle lady,

814
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,480
when I did first
impart my love to you,

815
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,920
I freely told you all the
wealth I had ran in my veins -

816
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I was a gentleman and
then I told you true.

817
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,800
And yet, dear lady,

818
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,760
rating myself at nothing,

819
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,680
you shall see how much
I was a braggart.

820
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,240
When I told you my
estate was nothing,

821
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,240
I should have told you I
was worse than nothing,

822
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,800
for, indeed, I have engaged
myself to a dear friend,

823
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,800
who engaged my dear
friend to his mere enemy

824
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,960
to feed my means.

825
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:46,880
Here is a letter, lady. The
paper is the body of my friend

826
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,440
and every word in it a gaping
wound issuing life-blood.

827
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,800
But is it true, Salerio? What, all his
ventures failed? What, not one hit?

828
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,760
From Tripolis, from
Mexico, from England?

829
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,520
Not one, my lord.

830
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,400
Besides it appears that if he had the
present money to discharge the Jew,

831
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,720
he would not take it.

832
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,000
He plies the duke at morning and at night
& doth impeach the freedom of the state

833
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,640
if they deny him justice.

834
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,560
Twenty merchants,
the duke himself

835
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,400
and the magnificoes of greatest
port have all persuaded with him

836
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:24,120
but none can drive him from the envious
plea of forfeiture, of justice, & his bond.

837
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,520
When I was with him,

838
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,600
I have heard him swear to Tubal
and to Cush, his countrymen,

839
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,680
that he would rather
have Antonio's flesh

840
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:40,120
than twenty times the value of
the sum that he did owe him.

841
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,480
And I know, my lord,

842
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,320
if law, authority
and power deny not,

843
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,960
it will go hard
with poor Antonio.

844
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,000
Is it your dear friend
that is thus in trouble?

845
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,040
The dearest friend to me.

846
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,200
What sum owes he the Jew?

847
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,880
For me, three thousand ducats.

848
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,160
No more?

849
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,600
Pay him six thousand
and deface the bond.

850
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,440
Double six thousand
and then treble that

851
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:23,080
before a friend of this description should
lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.

852
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,800
Let me hear the letter
of your friend.

853
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,400
"Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,

854
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,560
"my estate is very low."

855
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,120
"My bond to the Jew is forfeit & since in
paying it, it is impossible I should live,

856
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,600
"all debts are cleared
between you and I,

857
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,400
"if I might but see
you at my death.

858
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,480
"Notwithstanding, use
your pleasure -"

859
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,200
"if love do not persuade you
to come, let not my letter."

860
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,240
O love,

861
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,000
dispatch all business
and be gone!

862
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,040
First..

863
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,840
go with me to church
and call me wife.

864
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,200
Then away to Venice,
to your friend.

865
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,920
For never shall you lie by Portia's
side with an unquiet soul.

866
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,680
You shall have gold to pay the
petty debt twenty times over.

867
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,600
When it is paid, bring
your true friend along.

868
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,040
Meantime, myself and Nerissa
will live as maids and widows.

869
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,800
Come, away,

870
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,400
for you shall hence

871
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,520
upon your wedding day.

872
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,920
Gaoler, look to him,
tell me not of mercy.

873
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,960
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Gaoler, look to him.

874
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,920
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

875
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,880
I'll have my bond. Speak
not against my bond.

876
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,960
I have sworn an oath that
I will have my bond.

877
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,840
You called me dog
before you had a cause.

878
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,560
But since I am a dog,
beware my fangs.

879
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,240
The duke will grant me justice.

880
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,280
I do wonder, you wicked gaolers,

881
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,720
you are so fond to come abroad
with him at his request.

882
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,280
- I pray you, hear me speak!
- I'll have my bond,

883
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,960
I will not hear you speak.

884
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,760
I'll have my bond,
therefore speak no more.

885
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,040
I'll not be made a soft
and dull-eyed fool,

886
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:53,760
to shake their head, relent and sigh
and yield to Christian intercessors.

887
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,800
I'll have no speaking,
follow not.

888
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,880
I will have my bond.

889
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,680
It is the most impenetrable
cur that ever kept with men.

890
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,720
Let him alone.

891
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,200
I'll follow him no more
with bootless prayers.

892
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,320
He seeks my life.

893
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,960
His reason well I know.

894
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,720
I'm sure the duke will never
grant this forfeiture to hold!

895
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,280
The duke cannot deny
the course of law.

896
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,760
For the commodity that strangers have
with us in Venice, if it be denied,

897
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,360
will much impeach the
justice of the state.

898
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,400
Therefore, go.

899
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,400
Oh!

900
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,960
These griefs and losses
have so bated me

901
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,160
that I shall hardly find a pound of
flesh tomorrow for my bloody creditor.

902
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,000
Pray God Bassanio come
to see me pay his debt.

903
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,720
Then I care not.

904
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,960
Madam, if you knew to whom
you show this honour,

905
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,480
how true a gentleman
you send relief,

906
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,400
how dear a lover of
my lord your husband,

907
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,960
I know you would be prouder of the work
than customary kindness would allow you.

908
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,880
I never did repent for doing
good, I shall not now.

909
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,160
For in companions that do converse
and waste the time together

910
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:40,480
there needs must be a like proportion of
lineaments, of manners and of spirit.

911
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:47,640
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
being the bosom lover of my lord,

912
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,040
must needs be like my lord.

913
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,360
If it be so, how little is
the cost I have bestowed

914
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,120
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out of this state of hellish cruelty.

915
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,200
This comes too near the
praising of myself.

916
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,680
Therefore, no more of it.
Hear other things.

917
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,840
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands the
husbandry and manage of my house

918
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,240
until my lord's return.

919
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,680
For my own part, I have towards
heaven breathed a secret vow

920
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,240
to live in prayer and contemplation,
only attended by Nerissa here,

921
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,720
- until my husband and her lord's return.
- Madam, with all my heart,

922
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,760
I shall obey you in
all fair commands.

923
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,720
Fair thoughts and happy
hours attend on you.

924
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,200
Go, speed to Padua, render this into
my cousin's hands, old Bellario.

925
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,760
Go!

926
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,920
Is it not so, cousin Bellario?

927
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,760
See, Jessica.

928
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:09,080
Look how the floor of heaven is thick
inlaid with patterns of bright gold.

929
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,760
Is not the smallest orb that you behold
but in his motion like an angel sings?

930
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,640
Such harmony is in
immortal souls.

931
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,240
But whilst this muddy vesture of
decay doth grossly close it in,

932
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,240
- we cannot hear it.
- Hm.

933
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,880
I am never merry when
I hear sweet music.

934
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,080
The reason is your
spirits are attentive.

935
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,600
The man that hath
no music in himself

936
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,800
nor is not moved with
concord of sweet sounds

937
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,440
is fit for treasons,
stratagems and spoils.

938
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,520
The motions of his spirit
are as dull as night

939
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,280
and his affections are
as dark as Erebus.

940
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,960
Let no such man be trusted.

941
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,040
Mark the music.

942
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,840
We shall see our husbands
before they think of us.

943
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,760
Shall they see us?

944
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,840
They shall, Nerissa,

945
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,520
but in such a habit that they shall think
we are accomplished with what we lack.

946
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,680
I'll hold you any wager, when we
are both accoutred like young men,

947
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,320
I'll prove the prettier
fellow of the two.

948
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,160
Go one and call the
Jew to the court.

949
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,600
Make room and let him
stand before our face.

950
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,080
He is come, my lord.

951
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,880
Shylock, the world thinks,
and I think so, too,

952
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,680
that you but lead'st this fashion of
your malice to the last hour of the act

953
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,480
and then 'tis thought you'll
show your mercy and remorse,

954
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:33,800
more strange than is your
strange apparent cruelty.

955
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,160
What say you, Jew?

956
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,800
We all expect a gentle answer.

957
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:43,920
I have informed your
grace of what I purpose

958
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:51,640
and by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
to have the due and forfeit of my bond.

959
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,160
If you deny it,

960
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:59,480
let the danger light upon your
charter and your city's freedom.

961
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,440
You'll ask me why I rather choose
to have a weight of human flesh

962
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,480
than to receive three
thousand ducats.

963
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,560
I'll not answer that.

964
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,880
But, say, it is my
humour - is it answered?

965
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,520
What if my house be
troubled by a rat

966
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,480
and I am pleased to give ten
thousand ducats to have it killed?

967
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,400
- What, are you answered yet?
- No.

968
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,120
Some men there are
love not a gaping pig,

969
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,360
some that are mad if
they behold a cat

970
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:38,160
and others when the bagpipe sings in
the nose cannot contain their urine.

971
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:42,440
For affection, master
of passion, sways it

972
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,080
to the mood of what
it likes or loathes.

973
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,920
Now for your answer.

974
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,280
As there is no firm reason to be rendered
why he cannot abide a gaping pig,

975
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,520
why he, a harmless,
necessary cat,

976
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,760
why he a woollen bagpipe,

977
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,600
but of force must yield
to such inevitable shame

978
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,080
as to offend himself
being offended,

979
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,200
so can I give no reason,

980
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,960
nor will I not,

981
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:13,520
more than a lodged hate and a
certain loathing I bear Antonio,

982
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,120
that I follow thus this
losing suit against him.

983
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,560
- Are you answered?
- No!

984
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:32,360
This is no answer, you unfeeling man,
to excuse the current of your cruelty.

985
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,760
I am not bound to please
you with my answers.

986
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,360
Do all men kill the
things they do not love?

987
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,080
Hates any man the thing
he would not kill?

988
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,000
Every of fence is not
a hate at first.

989
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,680
You would have a serpent
sting you twice?

990
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,960
I pray you,

991
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,560
think you question with the Jew:

992
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,160
You may as well go
stand upon the beach

993
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:08,840
and bid the main flood
lower its usual height.

994
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,680
You may as well
question with the wolf

995
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,920
why he has made the ewe
bleat for the lamb.

996
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,800
You may as well do
anything most hard

997
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,320
as seek to soften that

998
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,240
than which what's harder,
his Jewish heart.

999
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,520
Therefore I do beseech you, make no
more offers, use no farther means,

1000
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,680
but with all just and plain
conveniency let me have judgment

1001
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,800
and the Jew his will.

1002
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,000
No! No!

1003
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,800
You loaned three
thousand ducats.

1004
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,680
Here is six.

1005
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:21,440
If every ducat in
six thousand ducats

1006
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,040
were in six parts and
every part a ducat

1007
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:31,560
I would not draw them,
I would have my bond.

1008
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,480
How shall you hope for
mercy, giving none?

1009
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,040
What judgment should I
fear, doing no wrong?

1010
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,360
You have among you many
a purchased slave,

1011
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,160
which like your asses and
your dogs and mules,

1012
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,560
you use in abject and in slavish
parts because you bought them.

1013
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,760
Shall I say to you,
let them be free?

1014
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,760
Marry them to your heirs.

1015
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,880
Why sweat they under burdens?

1016
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,640
Let their beds be made
as soft as yours.

1017
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,760
Their palates seasoned
with your food.

1018
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,840
You will answer, "The
slaves are ours."

1019
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,040
So do I answer you.

1020
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:16,000
The pound of flesh
that I demand of him

1021
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,040
is dearly bought.

1022
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,920
'Tis mine.

1023
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,480
'Tis mine!

1024
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,640
'Tis mine.

1025
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,080
And I will have it.

1026
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:39,000
If you deny me, fie
upon your law.

1027
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,400
There is no force in
the decrees of Venice.

1028
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,240
I stand for judgment.

1029
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,440
Answer.

1030
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,280
Shall I have it?

1031
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,320
Silence! Silence!

1032
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:07,160
Silence! Upon my power I
may dismiss this court

1033
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:11,040
unless Bellario, a learned doctor that
I have sent for to determine this,

1034
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,640
- come here today.
- My lord!

1035
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,760
Here stays without a messenger
with letters from the doctor

1036
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,040
new come from Padua.

1037
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,320
Come you from Padua,
from old Bellario?

1038
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,600
From both, my lord.
Bellario greets your grace.

1039
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,880
Why do you whet your
knife so earnestly?

1040
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,800
To cut the forfeiture
from that bankrupt there.

1041
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,680
Can no prayers pierce you?

1042
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,720
No, none that you have
wit enough to make.

1043
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,880
Be you damned, inexecrable dog and
for your life let justice be accused.

1044
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,360
Till you can rail the
seal from off my bond,

1045
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,880
you but offend your
lungs to speak so loud.

1046
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,960
Prepare your wit, good youth, or
it will fall to cureless ruin.

1047
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,160
I stand here for law.

1048
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,880
- I stand for law!
- Silence! Silence!

1049
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,240
This letter does commend a young
and learned doctor to our court.

1050
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,680
- Well, where is he?
- He attendeth here hard by

1051
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,960
to know your answer,
whether you'll admit him.

1052
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,360
Go, give him courteous
conduct to this place.

1053
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:21,920
Meantime, the court shall
hear Bellario's letter.

1054
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,240
"Your grace shall understand that at the
receipt of your letter, I am very sick

1055
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:30,440
"but in the instant your messenger came
there was with me a young doctor of Rome

1056
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,080
"whose name is Balthasar.

1057
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,000
"He comes at my asking
to take my place.

1058
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:38,200
"I beseech you, let his lack
of years be no impediment,

1059
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:41,360
"for I never knew so young a
body with so old a head."

1060
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,040
"I leave him to your
gracious acceptance."

1061
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:50,120
You heard Bellario, what he writes. Oh,
and here, I take it, is the doctor come.

1062
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,000
You are welcome.

1063
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,080
Take your place.

1064
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,440
Are you acquainted with the difference
that holds this present question in the
court?

1065
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,000
I am informed
thoroughly of the case.

1066
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,800
Which is the merchant
here and which the Jew?

1067
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,160
Antonio and old Shylock,
both stand forth.

1068
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:21,360
- Is your name Shylock?
- Shylock is my name.

1069
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,400
Of a strange nature is
the suit you follow,

1070
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:38,840
yet in such rule that the Venetian law
cannot deny you as you do proceed.

1071
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,840
- You stand within his power, do you not?
- Ay, so he says.

1072
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,240
- Do you confess the bond?
- I do.

1073
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,880
Then must the Jew be merciful.

1074
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,120
On what compulsion must I?
Tell me that.

1075
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,480
The quality of mercy
is not strained,

1076
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:05,920
it droppeth as the gentle rain from
heaven upon the place beneath.

1077
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,160
It is twice blessed -

1078
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,440
it blesseth him that gives
and him that takes.

1079
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,440
'Tis mightiest in the mighty.

1080
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:21,200
It becomes the throned monarch
better than his crown.

1081
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,400
His sceptre shows the
force of temporal power,

1082
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:30,240
the attribute to awe & majesty wherein
doth sit the dread and fear of kings.

1083
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,560
But mercy is above
this sceptred sway.

1084
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,360
It is enthroned in
the heart of kings.

1085
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,400
It is an attribute
to God himself

1086
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,040
and earthly power doth
then show likest God's

1087
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,200
when mercy seasons justice.

1088
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,360
Therefore, Jew, though
justice be your plea,

1089
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,840
consider this.

1090
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,880
That in the course of justice,
none of us should see salvation.

1091
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,240
We do pray for mercy

1092
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:19,280
and that same prayer doth teach us
all to render the deeds of mercy.

1093
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:26,000
I have spoke thus much to mitigate
the justice of your plea,

1094
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,920
which if you follow this
strict course of Venice

1095
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
must needs give sentence
against the merchant there.

1096
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,480
My deeds upon my head.

1097
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,240
I crave the law,

1098
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:44,560
the penalty and
forfeit of my bond.

1099
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,080
- Is he not able to discharge the money?
- Yes, here I tender it for him in court,

1100
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,720
yea, twice the sum.

1101
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,960
If that is not enough, I will be
bound to pay it ten times o'er

1102
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,160
on forfeit of my hands,
my head, my heart!

1103
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:02,360
If this is not enough it must appear
that malice bears down on truth.

1104
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:05,120
I beseech you, wrest once
the law to your authority -

1105
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,840
to do a great right, do a little wrong
and curb this cruel devil of his will.

1106
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:13,600
It must not be. There is no power in
Venice can alter a decree established.

1107
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,640
'Twill be recorded
for a precedent

1108
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,880
and many an error of the same
example will rush into the state.

1109
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,920
- It cannot be.
- A Daniel come to judgment.

1110
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,880
Yea, a Daniel.

1111
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,160
O wise young judge,
how I do honour you.

1112
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,000
I pray you, let me
look upon the bond.

1113
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:38,400
Most reverend
doctor, here it is.

1114
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:03,840
Shylock, there is twice
the money offered you.

1115
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,400
An oath, an oath.

1116
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,600
I have an oath in heaven.

1117
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:13,640
Shall I lay perjury
upon my soul?

1118
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,320
No. Not for Venice.

1119
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,560
Why, this bond is forfeit

1120
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:27,200
and lawfully at this time the
Jew may claim a pound of flesh

1121
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:31,080
to be by him cut off nearest
the merchant's heart.

1122
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,480
Be merciful.

1123
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,120
Take twice your money,
bid me tear the bond.

1124
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,600
When it is paid,
according to the terms.

1125
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,160
Most heartily I do
beseech the court

1126
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,200
to give the judgment.

1127
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:13,720
Then thus it is. You must prepare
your bosom for his knife.

1128
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,640
O noble judge,
excellent young man.

1129
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:22,680
For the intent and purpose of the law
has full relation to the penalty

1130
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,120
which here appeareth
due upon the bond.

1131
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:28,600
'Tis very true, O wise
and upright judge.

1132
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:31,560
How much more elder are
you than you look.

1133
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,280
- Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
- Ay, his breast.

1134
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,440
So says the bond, does
it not, noble judge?

1135
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,760
Nearest the heart.

1136
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,600
- Those are the very words.
- It is so.

1137
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,840
Are there balances here
to weigh the flesh?

1138
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,680
I have them here.

1139
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,280
Have by some surgeon,
Shylock, on your charge

1140
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:15,200
to stop his wounds lest
he should bleed to death.

1141
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,640
Is it so nominated in the bond?

1142
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,920
It is not so expressed but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

1143
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,840
I cannot find it.
'Tis not in the bond.

1144
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,840
You, merchant, have
you anything to say?

1145
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,440
But little.

1146
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,280
I am armed and well prepared.

1147
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,680
Give me your hand, Bassanio.

1148
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,640
Fare thee well.

1149
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,320
Grieve not that I am
fallen to this for you.

1150
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,880
For herein doth Fortune show herself
more kind than is her custom.

1151
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:11,480
Commend me to thy
honourable wife.

1152
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,520
Tell her the process
of Antonio's end.

1153
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:22,920
Say how I loved you,
speak me fair in death.

1154
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,800
And when the tale is told,

1155
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,680
bid her be judge whether
Bassanio had not once a love.

1156
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,760
Repent but you that you
shall lose your friend

1157
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,360
and you repent not that
he pays your debt.

1158
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,200
For if the Jew do
cut but deep enough

1159
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:48,600
I'll pay it instantly
with all my heart.

1160
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,960
Antonio, I am married to a wife

1161
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:01,040
which is as dear to
me as life itself.

1162
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:06,200
But life itself, my
wife and all the world

1163
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,120
are not with me esteemed
above your life.

1164
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:17,640
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice
them all, here to this devil

1165
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,080
to deliver you.

1166
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:26,400
I have a wife, whom,
I protest, I love -

1167
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:31,240
I would she were in heaven, so
she could entreat some power

1168
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,960
to change this cursed Jew!

1169
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,600
I have a daughter!

1170
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:40,200
Would that any of the stock
of Barrabas been her husband

1171
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,080
rather than a Christian.

1172
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:47,880
We trifle time. I pray
you, pursue sentence.

1173
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,560
You may proceed.

1174
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:56,680
A pound of that same
merchant's flesh is yours.

1175
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,720
The court awards it and
the law does give it.

1176
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,840
Most rightful judge.

1177
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:05,520
And you must cut this flesh
from off his breast.

1178
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,680
The court awards it and
the law allows it.

1179
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,600
Most learned judge.

1180
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,560
A sentence.

1181
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,240
Come.

1182
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,360
Prepare.

1183
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:56,360
- Tarry a little!
- Aah!

1184
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,720
There is something else.

1185
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,520
This bond does give you
here no drop of blood.

1186
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,800
The words expressly
are a pound of flesh.

1187
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,400
Take then your bond, take
then your pound of flesh,

1188
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:23,680
but in the cutting of it, if you do
shed one drop of Christian blood,

1189
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
your lands and goods are by
the laws of Venice confiscate

1190
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,680
unto the state of Venice.

1191
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,760
O upright judge!

1192
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,960
Mark, Jew. Learned judge!

1193
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:41,040
Is that the law?

1194
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,760
Yourself shall see the act.

1195
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,520
For as you urge on justice,

1196
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:50,960
be assured you shall have
justice more than you desire.

1197
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,000
Well.

1198
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,320
I take the offer, then.

1199
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,200
Pay the bond twice

1200
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,480
and let the Christian go.

1201
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:16,480
- Here is the money.
- Soft. The Jew shall have all justice.

1202
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,200
No haste. He shall have
nothing but the penalty.

1203
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,120
Therefore, prepare you
to cut off the flesh.

1204
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,280
Shed then no blood

1205
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:33,800
nor cut you less nor more
but just a pound of flesh.

1206
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,440
If you take more or
less than a just pound

1207
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:39,160
be it but so much as
makes it light or heavy

1208
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:44,000
in the substance or division of the
twentieth part of one poor scruple,

1209
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:49,240
nay, if the scale do turn but
in the estimation of a hair,

1210
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,480
you die

1211
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:56,120
and all your goods
are confiscate.

1212
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,240
A second Daniel!

1213
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:02,360
Now, infidel, I have
you on the hip!

1214
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,640
Why does the Jew pause?

1215
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,880
Shall I not have
even my principal?

1216
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,920
You shall have nothing but your forfeiture,
to be so taken at your peril, Jew.

1217
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:19,080
Why, then the devil
give him good of it.

1218
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,560
- I'll stay no longer question.
- Tarry, Jew.

1219
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:24,560
The law has yet
another hold on you.

1220
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:27,520
It is enacted in the
laws of Venice,

1221
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,200
if it be proved against an alien
that by direct or indirect attempts

1222
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,280
he seek the life of any citizen,

1223
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:40,160
the party 'gainst which he does contrive
shall seize one half of his goods.

1224
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:45,080
The other half comes to the
privy coffer of the state

1225
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:52,040
and the offender's life lies
in the mercy of the Duke only,

1226
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,360
'gainst all other voice.

1227
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,640
In which predicament,
I say you stand.

1228
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:10,160
Down, therefore,

1229
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:16,120
and beg mercy of the Duke.

1230
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:31,200
Beg that you may have
leave to hang yourself.

1231
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:38,480
That you shall see the difference in
our spirit, I pardon you your life

1232
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,240
before you ask it.

1233
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:45,760
For half your wealth, it is Antonio's, the
other half shall come to the general state.

1234
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:53,760
Nay, take my life and all -

1235
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,800
pardon not that.

1236
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:03,440
You take my house when you take the
prop that doth sustain my house.

1237
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,960
You take my life

1238
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,240
when you take the
means whereby I live.

1239
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,080
What mercy can you
render him, Antonio?

1240
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:19,320
A halter gratis, nothing
else, for God's sake.

1241
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:26,800
So please my lord the
Duke and all the court

1242
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,600
forego the fine of one
half of his goods.

1243
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:38,000
I am content so he will let me
use the other half, in trust,

1244
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,480
relinquish it upon his death

1245
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:47,840
unto the gentleman that
lately stole his daughter.

1246
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,720
One thing provided more,
that, for this favour,

1247
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,840
he shall presently
become a Christian.

1248
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:14,360
He shall do this or else
I do recant the pardon

1249
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,120
I late pronounced here.

1250
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:26,400
Are you contented, Jew?

1251
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,680
What do you say?

1252
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,560
Oh..

1253
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,320
I am contented.

1254
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:44,920
Clerk, prepare a deed of gift.

1255
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,920
I pray you, give me
leave to go from hence.

1256
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,040
I.. I am not well.

1257
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:59,920
I will.. Send a deed after
me and I will sign it.

1258
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,720
Get you gone, then, but do it.

1259
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,840
Court dismissed.

1260
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,840
Most worthy gentleman,

1261
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,200
I and my friend
have by your wisdom

1262
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,320
been this day acquitted of
most grievous penalties,

1263
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:03,760
in lieu whereof, three thousand
ducats, due unto the Jew

1264
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,240
we freely pay your
courteous pains withal.

1265
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:10,120
- Mm.
- And stand indebted, over and above,

1266
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,840
in love and service
to you ever more.

1267
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,440
He is well paid that
is well satisfied

1268
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,520
and I, delivering
you, am satisfied

1269
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,800
and therein do account myself
well paid - fare you well.

1270
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:24,440
Dear sir, of force I must
attempt you further.

1271
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:29,040
Take some remembrance of us,
as a tribute, not as a fee.

1272
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:32,080
Run me two things, I pray you.

1273
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:35,360
Not to deny me and to pardon me.

1274
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:40,520
You press me far,
therefore I will yield.

1275
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:49,920
Give me your gloves. I'll
wear them for your sake.

1276
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,240
And for your love, I'll
take this ring from you.

1277
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:59,280
Do not draw back your
hand, I'll take no more,

1278
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,120
and you, in love, shall
not deny me this.

1279
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:06,560
This ring.. good sir, alas, it is a trifle,
I would not shame myself to give you this.

1280
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:08,960
I will have nothing
else but only this.

1281
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,320
There's more depends on
this than on the value.

1282
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:17,800
The dearest ring in all of Venice will I give
to you, and find it out by proclamation,

1283
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,400
only for this, I
pray you, pardon me.

1284
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:23,840
Oh, I see, sir.

1285
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,640
You are liberal in offers,
you taught me first to beg,

1286
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:31,440
and now methinks you teach me how
a beggar should be answered.

1287
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,280
This ring was given
me by my wife.

1288
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,000
Oh!

1289
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:40,760
And when she put it on she made me
vow that I should neither sell nor give

1290
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,200
nor lose it.

1291
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,920
That 'scuse serves many
men to save their gifts

1292
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,120
and if your wife
be not a madwoman,

1293
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,400
then know her well I
have deserved this ring.

1294
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:55,120
She would not hold out enemy
forever for giving it to me.

1295
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,840
My lord Bassanio, let
him have the ring.

1296
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,640
Let not his deserving
and my love as well

1297
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,600
be valued 'gainst your
wife's commandment.

1298
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:17,480
Enquire the Jew's house out. Give
him this deed and let him sign it.

1299
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:22,520
Ho! My lord Bassanio upon more
advice has sent you here this ring.

1300
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,760
He does entreat your
company at dinner.

1301
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,880
That cannot be.

1302
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,080
His ring I do accept
most thankfully.

1303
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,600
I pray you tell him.

1304
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:41,520
Furthermore, I pray you show my
youth to old Shylock's house.

1305
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,320
That will I do.

1306
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:49,600
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring
which I did make him swear to keep
forever.

1307
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,400
Dear ladies, welcome home.

1308
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,400
We have been praying for
our husbands' welfare,

1309
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:30,920
whose speed we hope the
better for our words.

1310
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:54,040
This night, methinks, is
but the daylight sick.

1311
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,200
It looks a little paler.

1312
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:01,680
'Tis a day such as the day
is when the sun is hid.

1313
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,240
- Ho!
- Peace.

1314
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,600
You're welcome home, my lord.

1315
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:16,120
I thank you, madam. Give
welcome to my friend.

1316
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:19,600
This is the man, this is Antonio
to whom I am so infinitely bound.

1317
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:22,320
You should in all sense
be much bound to him,

1318
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,640
for as I hear he was
much bound for you.

1319
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:27,200
No more than I am
well acquitted of.

1320
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:31,200
Sir, you are welcome
to our house.

1321
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:36,800
It must appear in other ways than words
so I cut short this breathing courtesy.

1322
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:48,160
By yonder moon, I swear
you do me wrong.

1323
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,760
In faith I gave it to
the judge's clerk.

1324
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,160
Would he were gelded that
had it, for my part,

1325
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,520
since you do take it,
love, so much at heart.

1326
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:57,960
A quarrel, ho, already?
What's the matter?

1327
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:02,000
About a hoop of gold, a paltry
ring that she did give me,

1328
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:07,400
whose motto was for all the world
like cutler's poetry upon a knife.

1329
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,320
"Love me and leave me not."

1330
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,120
What talk you of the
motto or the value?

1331
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,680
You swore to me when
I did give it you

1332
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,360
that you would wear it
till your hour of death

1333
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:21,520
and that it should lie
with you in your grave.

1334
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,360
Though not for me yet
for your vehement oaths

1335
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,760
you should have been
respective and have kept it.

1336
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:32,160
- Gave it to a judge's clerk!
- I gave it to a youth,

1337
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:36,920
a kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy, no
higher than thyself, the judge's clerk.

1338
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,040
You were to blame, I
must be plain with you,

1339
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:43,200
to part so slightly with
your wife's first gift.

1340
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:48,600
I gave my love a ring and made
him swear never to part with it.

1341
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:50,760
And here he stands.

1342
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:55,920
I dare be sworn for him,
he would not lose it

1343
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,160
nor pluck it from his finger for all
the wealth that the world masters.

1344
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:06,240
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
and swear I lost the ring defending it.

1345
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,640
- My lord Bassanio gave his ring away.
- Hm?

1346
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:12,200
Unto the judge that begged it
and indeed deserved it, too.

1347
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,680
And then the boy, his clerk, that took
some pain in writing, he begged mine

1348
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:22,600
and neither man nor master would
take aught but the two rings.

1349
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,560
If I could add a lie onto
a fault I would deny it

1350
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:32,440
but you see my finger has not
the ring upon it, it is.. gone.

1351
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:37,880
Even so void is your
false heart of truth.

1352
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:43,720
By heaven, I will ne'er come into
your bed until I see the ring.

1353
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,160
Nor I in yours till
I again see mine.

1354
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:52,680
Sweet Portia, if you did know
to whom I gave the ring,

1355
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,920
if you did know for
whom I gave the ring,

1356
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,400
and would conceive for
what I gave the ring

1357
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:03,160
and how unwillingly I left the ring when
nought would be accepted but the ring,

1358
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:06,800
you would abate the strength
of your displeasure.

1359
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:11,360
If you had known the
virtue of the ring

1360
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,680
or half her worthiness
who did give the ring,

1361
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:20,120
or your own honour
to contain the ring,

1362
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,960
you would not then have
parted with the ring.

1363
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,320
Nerissa teaches me
what to believe.

1364
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,880
I'll die for it but some
woman has that ring.

1365
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,640
No, by honour, madam, by
my soul, no woman had it

1366
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,680
but a civil doctor,

1367
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:38,080
which did refuse three thousand
ducats of me and begged the ring

1368
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:41,200
the which I did refuse him, and
suffered him, displeased, to go away,

1369
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:45,640
even he that had held up the
very life of my dear friend.

1370
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:48,560
What should I say, sweet lady?

1371
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,960
I was enforced to
send it after him.

1372
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,440
Let not that doctor
come near my house.

1373
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:02,800
Since he has got the jewel that I loved and
that which you did swear to keep for me,

1374
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,320
I will become as
liberal as you -

1375
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:10,800
I'll not deny him
anything I have.

1376
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,920
No, not since my body,
nor my husband's bed,

1377
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,040
know him I shall, I
am sure of that.

1378
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:20,680
Portia, forgive me
this enforced wrong

1379
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:26,360
and in the hearing of these many friends, I
swear to you, even by thine own fair eyes,

1380
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:29,600
I never more will break
an oath with thee.

1381
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,760
I once did lend my
body for his wealth.

1382
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:36,880
I dare be bound again, my
soul upon the forfeit,

1383
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,560
that your lord..

1384
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:46,080
will never more break
faith advisedly.

1385
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:51,920
Then you shall be his surety.

1386
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,040
Give him this.

1387
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:59,320
And bid him keep it better

1388
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,640
than the other.

1389
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:08,200
My lord Bassanio, swear
to keep this ring.

1390
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:19,240
By heaven, 'tis the
same I gave the doctor.

1391
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:22,640
I had it of him.
Pardon me, Bassanio,

1392
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:28,560
for, by this ring, the
doctor lay with me.

1393
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:32,480
And pardon me, my
gentle Gratiano,

1394
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,320
for that same scrubbed
boy, the doctor's clerk,

1395
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:39,080
in lieu of this last
night did lie with me.

1396
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:44,640
Why..

1397
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:50,200
This is like the mending
of the highways in summer,

1398
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:53,440
when the ways are fair enough.

1399
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:00,120
What, are we cuckolds ere
we have deserved it?

1400
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,280
Speak not so grossly.

1401
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,320
You are all amazed.

1402
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,480
Bassanio..

1403
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,360
Here is a letter, it comes
from Padua, from old Bellario.

1404
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:23,600
There you shall read that
Portia was the doctor,

1405
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,480
Nerissa there her clerk.

1406
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:31,920
Lorenzo here shall witness
I set forth as soon as you

1407
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,080
and only just now returned.

1408
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,160
Were you the doctor
and I knew you not?

1409
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:54,040
Were you the clerk that
is to make me a cuckold?

1410
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:59,920
Ay, but the clerk that never means
to do it unless he live to be a man.

1411
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:05,240
Sweet doctor,

1412
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,480
you shall be my bedfellow.

1413
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:12,920
When I am absent, then
lie with my wife.

1414
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,360
How now, Lorenzo?

1415
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:25,720
My clerk has some good
comforts too for you.

1416
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:31,760
Ay, there do I give to you and
Jessica from the rich Jew

1417
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:37,400
a special deed of gift after his
death of all he dies possessed of.

1418
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:39,320
Oh!

1419
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:44,520
Fair ladies, you drop manna
in the way of starved people.

1420
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:52,200
It is almost morning

1421
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:58,040
and yet, I am sure you are not
satisfied with these events at full.

1422
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,480
Let us go in.

1423
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:06,920
And I will answer all
things faithfully.

1424
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,920
Well, let it be so.

1425
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,960
The first inter'gatory that my
Nerissa shall be sworn on is

1426
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,240
whether till the next night she
had rather stay or go to bed now,

1427
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:29,240
being two hours today.

1428
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,720
But were the day come,
I should wish it dark

1429
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:34,480
till I were couching
the doctor's clerk.

1430
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:41,800
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

1431
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,900
