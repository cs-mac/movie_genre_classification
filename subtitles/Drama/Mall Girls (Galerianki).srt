1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,679
When he dropped me off,

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,714
I told him not to get mad,
but I don't want to hang out.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,476
Since I don't have a thing
for him, I'm breaking up.

4
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,389
Handsome, intelligent, we'd
blab about stuff, so what?

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,878
I don't have a thing for him.
So I'm breaking up, right?

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,631
Love doesn't exist.

7
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,793
It's better to party
and not get involved.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,591
So I told him "bye."
We had fun, but now it's over.

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,270
I was pissed off.

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,519
I slammed the door.
People looked at me like nuts.

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,319
What did he say?

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,396
Nothing. He took it easy.
He isn't impulsive. Why?

13
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,598
I bet he was pissed off,
just didn't show it.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,670
Maybe.

15
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,309
Fuck it.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,480
MALL GIRLS

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,911
I wanted to dye your hair.

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,236
- Ala, some other time, okay?
- Give it to me.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,551
Give this to your dad.
Tell him not to bother us.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,353
Tell him I baked it for him.

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,353
Maybe he won't tell the
difference.

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,878
Tell him to put
the earphones on.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,431
Tell him I was baking all day.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,272
- Did he notice with perogies?
- No way. He only grouched.

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,752
- Could I get some highlights?
- Yes, you can.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,438
Would I look good
in highlights?

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,233
No, come on.

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,351
Do we have a volunteer?

29
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,596
Milena...Trech.

30
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,351
Not eager to get
into high school, are you?

31
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,951
Yes.

32
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,471
I want to say my lesson.

33
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,920
Fucking bitch, old maid!

34
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,234
No one fucked her lately.
That's not a surprise

35
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,115
with this face no one would.
Ugly as hell.

36
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,277
- Have you seen her shoes?
- Fuck that!

37
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,551
I wish she could get
fucken flared up into space

38
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,711
on the broom that grows
out of her ass.

39
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,273
- Wait.
- What for?

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,112
Why did you do that?

41
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,310
I thought you didn't want to
answer.

42
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,879
How come?

43
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,189
I saw it.

44
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,431
- Are you always staring at me?
- No.

45
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,438
Of course you are.

46
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,111
Maybe she is a lesbian?

47
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,115
Are you coming with us
to Paradiso?

48
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,751
You meet true friends
at the supermarket.

49
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,513
Where are you from?

50
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,760
From Grudziadz, she lives
close to my place.

51
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,549
- How was it there?
- As usual.

52
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,231
Does everyone dress
like this?

53
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,398
- No, only those in my group.
- What group?

54
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
- I can't say.
- Some fucking sect, right?

55
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,108
That's a real shit.

56
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,915
- What phone do you have?
- Ordinary.

57
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,919
- Show it to me.
- Why?

58
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,511
Just show it to me.

59
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,270
No fucking way, I haven't seen
anything like it before.

60
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,194
What a crap. Seriously.
Weird.

61
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,793
Weird as hell.

62
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,429
- If I had to use it
I'd go and screw myself. - Let's roll.

63
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,114
Merci for the help.
Julka, are you coming?

64
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,988
Pick me up tomorrow,
okay?

65
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,355
Get me some cool jeans
and I'll blow you.

66
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,677
You're fucking crazy, girl.

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,277
Is your car here?

68
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,795
Yeah, so what?

69
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,111
We can go now, if you want.

70
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,753
Come!

71
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,758
Maybe I'll clean
the window today.

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,954
I don't know, maybe
if I feel like it.

73
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,434
Dad...

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,791
Will you buy me a cell phone?

75
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,471
You've got one from
your uncle.

76
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,591
I know but...

77
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,432
It's broken,
and I can't text anyone.

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,672
Dad...

79
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Will you buy me new pants?

80
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,430
I'm glad you're asking your
daddy

81
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,759
he has been fulfilling my
wishes for 15 years.

82
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,397
He's a prop of our family.
Your wish is his command.

83
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,716
No ham, or tomato
for those sandwiches?

84
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,790
No.

85
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,199
Come here! Don't sit there
by yourself!

86
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,594
Why do you need the phone?
Do you call anyone?

87
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,836
Yes, my friends.

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,199
I haven't seen even one, we've
been here for 6 months.

89
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,591
She's never had friends.

90
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,391
Smile, come on...

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,515
Behave - Mis...behave.

92
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,513
Where have you been?

93
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,871
I asked you a question!
Can you answer it?

94
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,319
I've been awake all night...
Where have you been?

95
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,273
I'll kill you! Do you hear me?

96
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,352
Where have you been?

97
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,750
- Answer my question?!
- At my friend's...

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,877
All night long!?

99
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,635
I'm sorry...

100
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,115
You can move out
if you want to!

101
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,994
I'll kill you this second!
Do you understand?

102
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,828
I'll kill you!
You little shit!

103
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,311
Do you understand?!

104
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,314
Good morning.

105
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,831
Dariush Sova...

106
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,991
Show me what he bought you?

107
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,711
Come on, show us
what Sova bought you.

108
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,428
But you have one like that.

109
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,519
He said that this one
matches my hair better.

110
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,678
Next time tell him
what you'd like.

111
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,357
Or he'll bring you another
shit with a butterfly on it.

112
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,791
Are you fucking crazy?!

113
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,311
- Hey, Hole, can I copy Math?
- No you can't!

114
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,150
- Ala, can I copy from you?
- She has it, but not for you.

115
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,669
No.

116
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,151
Come one, Ala!

117
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,237
You want to hang out with
us, you must be up to scratch.

118
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,033
If the girl is pretty
and attractive,

119
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,989
she has to pimp and
use her assets, right?

120
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,793
You have to get a sponsor.

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,037
Don't think that a guy pays me
some lousy 100 zloty for sex,

122
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,391
he pays me
a lot more, 200 or 300,

123
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,838
Takes me to restaurants,
bars... shopping,

124
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,548
This is a different life.
This is high-life.

125
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,110
Hey!

126
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,954
This is my friend...
Ala.

127
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,591
Don't you have some beer?

128
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,354
Work it blondie! Work it!

129
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,191
What a fucking story!
Fuck!

130
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,991
I was tongue-jacking
with this dude,

131
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,592
and this teddy bear from
Arcadia is calling, right?

132
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,514
And he wanted
to meet to fuck,

133
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,951
but he heard the music,
so he hung up. Fuck.

134
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,189
This one isn't too bad either,
right? Have some... beer

135
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,591
so you can chill out.

136
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,272
I have to call him,
so he... doesn't think...

137
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,149
that I'm blowing him off.
Jesus,

138
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,436
the radio in his car
is pretty cool,

139
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,591
better than in demo cars.
...Sony or Kenwood...

140
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,388
- You shouldn't call...
- Why?

141
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,829
Call him.

142
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,276
I have to, so he doesn't think
that I'm blowing him off.

143
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,239
Fuck! He can't just hang up
on me like that.

144
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,875
You can't hang up on Milenka.

145
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,951
- It's pointless to call him now.
- Why?

146
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,319
- Call him...
- I can't see those fucking numbers!

147
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,433
Give it to me! You pussy!

148
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,991
- Open up! Are you nuts?
- Has she taken it?

149
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,960
- Where is Kaya?
- I'm here.

150
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,715
Just give her the beer,
so she can chill out.

151
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,629
- It's her first time here.
- So what?

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,149
Just drink!

153
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,234
If you want to hook up with
someone you have to chill out!

154
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,310
Ala!

155
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,114
- Call mom!
- Let me smell your breath!

156
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,951
Damn it!

157
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,628
What have you... Oh, God.

158
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,554
Okay, easy.
Calm down.

159
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,873
Wipe it off.

160
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,233
Lay down...

161
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,831
I'll cover you.

162
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,031
- Daddy?
- What?

163
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,031
Am I pretty?

164
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,596
Of course, you're pretty...
...very pretty.

165
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,234
Sleep now.

166
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,116
I'm not...

167
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,958
Yes, you are.

168
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,471
If I were...

169
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,951
this boy

170
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,671
I met today

171
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,118
would be kissing with me

172
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,390
Milena said...

173
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,948
that I need a boyfriend...
or I'm a looser.

174
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,071
Just sleep, silly.

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,876
Sleep.

176
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,951
Feelings.

177
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,549
This is Sampler FM.
It's 7:45 am.

178
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,076
I want to share the view
with you,

179
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,748
Forget what violence joins
with home,

180
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,195
Don't tell me low spirits
are enemies of ideals,

181
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,795
Feelings, I inhale
their every detail,

182
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,310
We have things to love
and to believe,

183
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,550
Show me the truth
don't sniff to survive,

184
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,314
I want to know your dreams
and thoughts,

185
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,074
It's better not to know
if gains are fake,

186
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,635
I want the future
and security,

187
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,388
If that's love, I'm sure
I want it,

188
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,119
Come I'll show you colors
of my world,

189
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,073
Wind will take us above
the city and clouds,

190
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,235
Just a second!

191
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,511
I'll show you the window
even there's no light,

192
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,195
I'm with you now,
our truth like Pegasus,

193
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,552
Forgive me, I'm not perfect,
but I'll never let you go.

194
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,955
Hi, Ala.

195
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,756
Ala!

196
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,679
Do you have my cell?

197
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,637
- Thanks... you know.
- Ala!

198
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,753
Sit down.

199
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,118
You know... that you lower
the average of the school.

200
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,118
Did you pick someone up
yesterday?

201
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,233
- I've completely lost it...
- No.

202
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,317
In my whole career, I've
never had 13 students

203
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,395
not qualified
for the next grade.

204
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,995
Tough luck.

205
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,188
You'll write the test
of the last chance.

206
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,869
I came up with 100 questions.

207
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,796
25 will be on the test.

208
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,269
Here you go.

209
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,791
So...

210
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,273
Do you think you can do it?

211
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,790
There is one thing about
the prom...

212
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,151
end of your school,

213
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,633
just so there's no concerns
with the outfits for it

214
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,032
we've decided
at the teachers' meeting

215
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,228
to be a costume party.

216
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,233
What costumes should we wear?
Bananas' ones?

217
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,831
Did you kiss that kiddo?

218
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,871
How?
I don't even talk to him.

219
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,633
Fuck off from Milena,
or I'll fuck you up!

220
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,632
- What do you want?
- I'm fucking warning you!

221
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,035
Yacek++!

222
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,394
- You better fuck off!
- Fucking bitch!

223
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,240
- Yacek++!
- I'll kill you, whore!

224
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,748
Yacek++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++!

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,389
What are you doing?!
Are you nuts?!

226
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,711
Leave me alone!
Don't touch me!

227
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,549
It's almost harassment, right?

228
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,879
It's my fault. I swear.
I started it.

229
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,191
My mother found
a new fuckboy.

230
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,715
I wonder for how long?

231
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,713
She is good at that,
really she is.

232
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,078
There is a good thing
about him.

233
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,840
He got a lot with
a camping site,

234
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,071
and I have freedom.

235
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,031
We're going to the last floor.

236
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,078
Now, drink it fast.
It's not going to burn.

237
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,117
We used to compete in car
races. I mean, Darek did.

238
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,073
Sometimes I'd be his pilot,
and we'd always win.

239
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,314
Why don't you do it
anymore?

240
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,590
He is gone.

241
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,511
He died.

242
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,749
Come.

243
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,635
And you... Would you die
with me?

244
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,072
But for real, he moved out
to this cunt, Evelina,

245
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,550
and he hasn't even
called me once.

246
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,789
In this world, I only
loved him.

247
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,069
Darek is my brother,
older, right?

248
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,831
He moved out,
no wonder.

249
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,117
In this house you'd survive
because you had to.

250
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,309
Why didn't he take me
with him?

251
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,155
I could take care of him,
or something.

252
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,478
He fell for her tits
and her father's car.

253
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,836
Guys are like that.

254
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,675
This Saturday they're coming
for dinner for the first time.

255
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,316
My mother and Marchiniak
guy have invited them.

256
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,160
- Are you happy?
- Are you nuts?

257
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,994
It makes me sick when
I think of him.

258
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,991
Do you make them yourself?

259
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,518
Do you want one?
I can make one for you.

260
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,474
They aren't my style.

261
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,600
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

262
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,435
- What?
- Can I finish it later?

263
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,279
- What?
- I have to see Milena.

264
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,955
No.

265
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,113
- Mommy...
- Don't mommy me.

266
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,830
Do you think I enjoy talking
to your antipathetic teacher?

267
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,669
It wasn't nice.
I didn't feel like it at all.

268
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,559
Don't worry, they won't give
you guys any hard times.

269
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,315
PE teacher backed you up.

270
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,360
- I'm leaving!
- Come here!

271
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,630
Look!
If you don't know how to do it,

272
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,916
don't do it.

273
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,475
I didn't ask for it.

274
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,514
Don't say that,
or I'll slap you!

275
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,871
Please don't
provoke me.

276
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,595
Come on! Do it!

277
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,792
This is Sampler FM, greetings
to all who believe in dreams.

278
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,469
You said I should change,
I don't know how,

279
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,830
For years I've been
a prisoner of myself,

280
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,509
Who to believe, what
to call trust?

281
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,154
What are honor, respect,
and truth above the law?

282
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,630
Our Babel Tower,
Himalayas of our problems,

283
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
Hypocrisy won't let us live
without the system,

284
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,995
Welcome to the puppet theater,
elite sits in the first row,

285
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,271
The know-how we have
but in others hands

286
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,554
How did you do on the test?

287
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,194
Same here.
Freaking nightmare.

288
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,158
If I don't pass, I'll fucken
kill myself.

289
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,515
And that's how
it's going to be.

290
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,670
I picked it myself,
as you told me to...

291
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,159
Come to the loo, I think
I got period from this crap.

292
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,635
Hi.

293
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,200
I don't talk to liars
and con artists.

294
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,234
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't.

295
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,758
Why? Were you busy
with someone else?

296
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,550
No.

297
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,837
Were you with Mihal,
you faithless bitch?!

298
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,713
Yes, with Mihal.

299
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,351
If you want to hang out
with kids, go ahead!

300
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,149
But you could at least call
or text me, or whatever!

301
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,832
But I forgot...

302
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,834
You have a crap phone not
a cell phone!

303
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,517
Show it to me!

304
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,712
Look!
The newest fashion!

305
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,350
Here you go ladies and gents!
Beautiful!

306
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,674
- What the fuck is this?
- A phone.

307
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,515
What a piece of shit!

308
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,190
Yeah, take good care of him!
That's all you deserve!

309
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,314
I'm sorry.

310
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,551
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

311
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,279
Let's go.

312
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,955
You hate when I cry.
Bad tear.

313
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,430
Can you smell it?

314
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,999
No.

315
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,437
- I like it.
- Smells like piss.

316
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,114
Or maybe a dead cat?

317
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,677
There is nothing dead in here.
For sure.

318
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,071
Okay.
I'm leaving.

319
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,119
Maybe someone throws
their trash in here.

320
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,159
I'm ticklish.

321
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,432
And how about this?

322
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,638
- Stop it! Are you ticklish?
- No, I'm not.

323
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,393
Yeah right!

324
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,472
No, I'm not.

325
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,355
I have... the results
of the worst students.

326
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,637
I don't know...

327
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,720
Should I read it aloud, or...?

328
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,230
...or just give it to you?

329
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,758
I'll throw away...

330
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,994
those papers which
embarrass us all.

331
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,116
Everyone passed.

332
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,716
Ala...!
Can I use your phone?

333
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,154
Ding-dong.

334
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,511
Promotion of higher prices.

335
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,193
I can't get out here
in the middle of the street.

336
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,432
You got the gift?

337
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,950
So now, fuck off
because I'm late.

338
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,471
But it was okay,
wasn't it?

339
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,199
Milena!

340
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,112
You cocksucking worthless
asshole! You can blow it yourself!

341
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,749
No girl is going to blow
such a jerk!

342
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,552
Milena! Wait!

343
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,118
Leave me alone!

344
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,838
Go ahead!
Now you can tell everyone!

345
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,759
168 cm.

346
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,308
49 kg.

347
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,756
Girls,
take your clothes off.

348
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,912
Madam...

349
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,357
- Yes?
- Can you, please, check it out?

350
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,989
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

351
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,074
Wait.

352
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,716
Okay, easy.

353
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,948
Are you expecting your period?

354
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,989
When was the last time
you had it?

355
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,790
This month... or maybe
the one before.

356
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,154
Maybe 2 or 3 months ago...

357
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,076
Put your shoes on, and have
a seat. Girls, please, leave.

358
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,433
Go please.

359
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,870
Go on, quickly.

360
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,908
Are you sexually active?

361
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,273
Were you quiet when you
were sleeping with him?

362
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,751
Easy, okay.

363
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,189
Listen, have you told anyone
that maybe you're pregnant?

364
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,111
This is impossible.
I washed out everything.

365
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,710
You have to see
a gynecologist.

366
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,752
Have you ever been to
a gynecologist?

367
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,076
No, madam.

368
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,194
Who is this boy?
Are you a couple?

369
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,559
No.

370
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,878
But you know who is it,
right?

371
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,278
Did you have more
than one partner?

372
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,828
What's his name then?

373
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,519
I don't know.

374
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,912
What? Are they saying
anything?

375
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,278
Me and my husband,
we work 2 shifts,

376
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,631
and we have 4 kids.

377
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,272
I just...

378
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,151
I can't take this anymore...

379
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,230
This is the address...

380
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,074
of the juvenile
mother's center.

381
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,750
I've called them,
and there is one vacancy.

382
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,838
But... you have to...
cover some costs.

383
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,273
How much?

384
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,353
- You had to fuck around?
- Stop it! - I'm not pregnant!

385
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,195
- You bitch!
- Not in front of people!

386
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,079
Bitch!

387
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,075
- Jesus Christ!
- Julia!

388
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,077
Do you want to screw a bitch
from the hood?

389
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,031
I've seen better...
Weekend pussies.

390
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,596
- A real good fuck for the tough ones.
- This is better...

391
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,874
What's up Ala?
Do you want to watch?

392
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,069
You're screwed.

393
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,593
What's going to
happen to Julia?

394
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,837
I don't know.
She put poison inside.

395
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,832
What do you mean "poison?"

396
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,879
Is it funny to you?

397
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,312
Freak said that she is
just a bitch like Milena.

398
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,909
What does it mean?

399
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,153
You don't understand Milena,
she is too mature for you.

400
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,113
Rather too made up.

401
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,112
Could you do it in life
by yourself?!

402
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,754
Is this why you're hanging out
with her?

403
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,311
Yeah right, she is really...

404
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,749
doing it.

405
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,876
- She cares about me.
- And I don't?

406
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,115
How do I know?

407
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,518
- What do you want me to do?
- Try harder!

408
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,870
Do you always listen to Freak?

409
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,957
Shopping by yourselves?

410
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,959
Just looking. Maybe we'll find
something cool.

411
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,357
What are you doing
tonight? It's Friday.

412
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,236
We'll see.

413
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,028
Hey, wait chicks!

414
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,113
Me and my buddy
are throwing a house party,

415
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,873
maybe you want to come?

416
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,315
Maybe...

417
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,157
Give me your number,
I'll call you. Okay?

418
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,592
- Yeah, you can call.
- Okay.

419
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,557
- 888 290 132.
- I'll give you a buzz.

420
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,272
- But this wasn't your number.
- Did you see his phone?!

421
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,437
I can't give my number
to a guy like that.

422
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,319
So he can drive us
in an old banger?

423
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,552
You can tell if the guy
is loaded by his phone.

424
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,834
Beside, look at the shoes
and the watch,

425
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,720
if they're expensive
at least it's a start, right?

426
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,719
A phone isn't just a belt,
or some socks.

427
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,878
Remember, you might need to start
some serious business girl!

428
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,917
I can set her up with
my brother's friend, Zbyszek.

429
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,510
- Do I know him?
- No.

430
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,031
He is loaded, nice car...

431
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,398
Maybe he can buy her
the phone, if he likes her.

432
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,832
Give me the light.

433
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,229
Have you done it before?

434
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,876
And with Mihal?

435
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,873
It can hurt at first, but then
it can be nice.

436
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,636
It didn't hurt me at all,
I had an orgasm right away.

437
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,872
I always do.

438
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,239
You can buy a lubricant
at the drugstore,

439
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,636
so he can get in better.

440
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,357
Just don't say that you're
a virgin. He can chicken out.

441
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,559
Guys are like that.

442
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,991
Not so cool...
...even cowardly.

443
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,238
They'd rather use someone else
to do the reconnaissance,

444
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,039
the dirty job.

445
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,311
These are the times
we have to live in.

446
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,557
She's dancing. Her dress is
whirling by bits of existence.

447
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,515
People who don't give
a fuck for a hit song...

448
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,274
Take off your jacket.
Wait a second, okay?

449
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,630
It will hit suddenly,
we live like that, so drop it,

450
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,831
I sit, too much rush
around me

451
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,993
- Am I disturbing you?
- No.

452
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,638
- Are your parents home?
- No.

453
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,632
Dad is gone.

454
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,716
Where is he?

455
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,751
Do you want something
to drink?

456
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,874
No, thanks.

457
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,676
Do you want to sleep with me?

458
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,398
Ala, no.

459
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,189
You've got me wrong.

460
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,149
It can't be like that...

461
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,554
Is it because of those
magazines?

462
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,511
You can do it now.

463
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,719
No... Ala.

464
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,590
Do you know
where the Alternative is?

465
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,159
- The pub.
- No.

466
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,073
The corner of  Kolberg's
and Strushia, get it?

467
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,351
I described you, so you'll
recognize each other.

468
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,434
Anyway, it's not usually
crowded, so...

469
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,308
Drink some booze,
so you can relax.

470
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,396
If you like him, maybe
it will be fucking great.

471
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,398
You should have a condom.

472
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,039
Do you have it?

473
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,190
If you get pregnant
like that idiot Julia,

474
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,351
it will suck big time,
right?

475
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,788
Fuck. I don't have it.
If he doesn't, don't do anything

476
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,268
It's too risky.

477
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,119
The last thing you need
is a baby.

478
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,357
Let's meet in our place.
If you want, I want it too.

479
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,271
Take it off, you look
like a kid!

480
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,595
To conquer the world
you only have one chance,

481
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,440
I feel I got wings; I'm flying
above the ground

482
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,069
You can't lock me
in the cage of consciousness

483
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,840
You can't lock me
in the cage of consciousness

484
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,031
Above the walls where
you can't see the ground,

485
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,595
Desires and dreams
make one flying carpet

486
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,115
Wind grasps my
everyday problems,

487
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,193
Today I feel like god,
I fulfill every wish,

488
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,312
My heart absorbs
each second, each breath,

489
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,471
Don 't tell me, what future
awaits us tomorrow,

490
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,951
I rather forget there is
no stress, no barriers,

491
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,668
Instead of living at full
speed for problems, career,

492
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,395
I don 't want this distress,
leave this place now,

493
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,870
Come I'll show you the world
that you'd love,

494
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,071
I don 't want to live
if you're to take it away,

495
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,471
My imagination tells me
everything inside us flows,

496
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,399
Like love, dreams,
and thoughts,

497
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,029
One more time believe
and unleash this instinct,

498
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,589
To be, to live, and exist
for happiness,

499
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,871
You and we that's people
with the past,

500
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,555
Love, dreams, feelings,
and thoughts,

501
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,995
One more time believe
and unleash this instinct,

502
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,674
To be, to live, and exist
for happiness,

503
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,315
You and we that's people
with the past.

504
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,839
Are you Ala?

505
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,997
Hi.
My name is Zbyshek.

506
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,112
Your hands are cold.

507
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,751
I always have cold hands.

508
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,155
That's not good.

509
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,390
Give them to me.

510
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,911
Is it better?

511
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,909
Do you want to order anything?

512
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,951
You're not going to answer it?

513
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,678
Answer it!

514
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,631
This is where I live.

515
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,078
On the 1st floor.

516
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,394
In case of fire,
I'm first to be saved.

517
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,311
What's going on?!

518
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,870
So, is it the date
with Kuzepa, or Freak?

519
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,391
Not with you, for sure!

520
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,758
- What's this?
- Just leave it!

521
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,311
Just leave it!

522
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,430
I can't fucking believe it!

523
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,154
Cool.

524
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,677
If you're waiting for Ala...

525
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,429
I can tell you something...
She isn't coming.

526
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,871
Because she is with a man.

527
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,431
- Real man, by the way?
- Back off from her!

528
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,116
They went for dinner...

529
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,034
and later they're going
to his place.

530
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,237
Ala, please leave.

531
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,872
Please, go.

532
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,473
Are you my mom's
new boyfriend?

533
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,630
Will you buy me a phone?

534
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,235
Ala...

535
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,716
Ala...

536
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,873
Can you do it for me?

537
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,793
- Can I go now?
- Yes.

538
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,075
I'm going to my boyfriend's.

539
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,873
Okay.

540
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,233
Did it hurt?

541
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,758
Did you have to blow it first,
or did he put it right in?

542
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,359
No, it didn't hurt.

543
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,238
Where did you do it?
House or the car?

544
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,310
House.

545
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,152
Sophisticated. Did he
buy you the phone?

546
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,796
Not right away.
She isn't some Angelina Jolie.

547
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,553
- He bought it. Yeah?
- Show it then.

548
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,072
I don't have it with me.

549
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,756
Why, the fuck, are we
helping you then?

550
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,237
I want Motorola K1, and he
gave me a cheap one.

551
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,834
You can get it for 1 zloty.

552
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,714
Yeah right! She fucks
with us, as usual!

553
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,951
I know him,
he wouldn't buy her a phone.

554
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,872
He has no money.
He's cheap as hell.

555
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,758
Maybe for you.

556
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,350
Why, the fuck, did you
set her up with him?

557
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,318
Back off, alright?

558
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,835
Are we going to Paradiso
tonight?

559
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,434
I've told you about
my mom's fuckboy, right?

560
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,751
He thinks he's
my fucking daddy.

561
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,635
If I don't get into high school
he'll kick me out.

562
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,314
We'll go on Saturday, okay?

563
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,152
Where are you going?
Dad wanted to talk to you.

564
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,919
I'm busy now.

565
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,556
Go to your dad, he's
waiting for you.

566
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,313
Not now.

567
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,716
If you don't talk to him,
I don't have to either.

568
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,637
Go!

569
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,271
- What if I don't?
- Why are you yelling?

570
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,514
I told her that you need
to talk to her.

571
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,598
Okay. What about?

572
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,950
Well...

573
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,271
pretty soon you'll have
to pick a high school.

574
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,755
I thought...

575
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,594
Maybe, I could help you.

576
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,436
How do you know
which school is good,

577
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,398
you know nothing
about life.

578
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,755
Stop it!

579
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,516
I know something
after all kiddo.

580
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,633
Mommy, isn't it true that he
has no idea?

581
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,678
What about?

582
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,677
Okay, you can go now.
We'll talk later.

583
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,395
What was she talking about?

584
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,358
Hi.

585
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,192
Have we met?

586
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,072
No, we haven't, so what?

587
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,710
Did you get a hard on?

588
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,832
Ala? Is it you?

589
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,639
Ala...

590
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,918
Ala!

591
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,593
Ala!

592
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,590
Ala!

593
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,870
Do you think sex can be fun?

594
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,319
I think so...

595
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,312
Maybe...

596
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,031
Have you ever enjoyed it?

597
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,876
Maybe... I don't remember.

598
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,669
You know, I was wondering...

599
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,951
if you do it with someone
you like...

600
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,198
is it different?

601
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,392
Is it nice then?

602
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,991
Who do you have in mind?

603
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,355
No one.

604
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,951
I was just wondering.

605
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,790
Ala... Let's move
in together.

606
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,193
We can care less about guys,
we could be self-sufficient.

607
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,351
We'll come up with something.

608
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,591
I think, we can do it.

609
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,833
Move over.

610
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,794
Fuck!
We have different tests.

611
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,513
What am I going to do now?
We're screwed.

612
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,475
We should have known that.
Fuck. I'm dead.

613
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,871
Give me your test.

614
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,548
Mihal...

615
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,991
Can we meet later?

616
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,558
I don't have time.

617
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,830
For the last time, please.

618
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,830
Ordinary - Extraordinary.

619
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,078
No, show me the other one,
it was the best...

620
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,198
The one where she fell,
it was great!

621
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,472
- Wait...
- It was a good one.

622
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,599
- She didn't realize.
- No, not this one, It's awful.

623
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,952
- The one in class was the best.
- The other one.

624
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,231
- With her.
- Missy is here.

625
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,676
I'm sorry.

626
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,638
Kissy, kissy, little blow
or maybe a hand job!

627
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,592
Fuck off, okay!

628
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,354
- It was our place.
- I had no idea they'll be here.

629
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,030
- What was in those videos?
- Nothing, really.

630
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,075
What do you have in yours?

631
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,471
When did you do it?

632
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,471
Going away gift.

633
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,353
Is this how you're going
to please a girl?

634
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,717
What was that supposed to be?
2 seconds?

635
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,672
- 2 seconds man!
- Real champ!

636
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,719
Ala tried to fuck Mihal
but his dick got soft!

637
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,674
Something got soft?

638
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,036
Come! Let's not stand
here like idiots!

639
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,630
Couldn't you do anything?

640
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,870
You weren't supposed to tell.

641
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,749
I told Kaya.
It's not my fault she loves to blab.

642
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,116
You aren't going to get mad
at me over some guy?

643
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,314
We're pissing on them, right?

644
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,115
Did you forget?

645
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,035
That's the one.

646
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,076
- What does it have?
- The best stuff.

647
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,038
- Like what?
- Like... It's very functional,

648
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,993
comfortable,
it has the newest functions.

649
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,636
The soft touch
type back cover.

650
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,878
Touch screen
you could use as a mirror...

651
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,949
What else?

652
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,953
It cooks, cleans, makes
wicker baskets.

653
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,789
You can listen to the radio
which is built in.

654
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,311
You can listen to mp3 and
download music.

655
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,997
You can browse the Internet
like at home.

656
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,391
It suits you.

657
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,949
Thank you.

658
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,793
Yes!

659
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,475
We have the same score.
We'll clean toilets together.

660
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,314
Cool.

661
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,316
Ala...

662
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,312
- Girls, girls...
- Where is Mihal?

663
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,591
Hi mom! I'm not going
to high school.

664
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,197
- Are you crying?
- Sit down.

665
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,671
What's happened?

666
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,994
Your friend Mihal...
Freak called.

667
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,588
promise that you're not
going to cry.

668
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,351
Mihal jumped...

669
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,268
Mihal committed suicide.

670
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,239
He was so in love
with you, Ala.

671
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,029
Do you think this was
the reason?

672
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,029
It will be fair
if you're the one to leave.

673
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,315
Falling like 12 floors down,

674
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,711
You know this feeling
of a broken heart,

675
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,229
Today's homes epic only
scream and hatred,

676
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,436
People are taught
to live to kill,

677
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,795
I want to live to dream,
I'm ashamed for the world,

678
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,952
Tax declarations
mean more than we,

679
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,838
No one is guilty,
or maybe we,

680
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,434
Profits carry us away,
we fly like moths,

681
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,796
Who's betrayed me,
I feel this disgust?

682
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,355
Like I'm strapped to a chair,

683
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,358
Who lost it, was it I,
you, or someone else?

684
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,437
How to count souls
killed in mind?

685
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,830
Believe me, I'm ashamed
for this time and place,

686
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,508
For people's values 'coz
this world lost its heart,

687
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,991
Hanging on a suspender
hundred meters above the gap,

688
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,475
Is it the finish or the start?
Please stop this bog,

689
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,870
Wealth, that's not
a pocket full of money,

690
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,315
Only our true identity
and tired hands...

691
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,078
Calm down.

692
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,752
It doesn't make sense that he
loved me so much.

693
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,871
Come on, don't cry.

694
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,359
Drink it.

695
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,831
Look! Everything here is old.

696
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,792
Even the Paradiso it's not
original, trust me.

697
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,038
Mihal made wings for you
thinking he was Romeo.

698
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,551
Pathetic, huh?

699
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,554
Ala, please, don't cry.

700
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,953
How do you know
he made the wings?

701
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,239
I wanted to protect you,
for your own good,

702
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,397
and because of love for you.

703
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,195
I didn't want you to get
involved with immature guys.

704
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,154
I wanted you to
have a high-life.

705
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,114
You told him about Zbyshek?

706
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,990
Did you go to him?

707
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,795
I wanted you for myself.

708
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,472
I'm so unhappy,
let's die together.

709
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,589
Okay, so let's die... Now,
you don't want to anymore?

710
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,031
Stop overdramatizing, okay!

711
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,758
You don't know what's going to
happen tomorrow!

712
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,912
I helped you, now you can
make it on your own!

713
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,634
What are you doing!
Fuck! Stop it!

714
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,872
Are you crazy,
you stupid bitch?

715
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,948
Let me go!

716
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,159
Let me go!

717
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,716

Cast

726
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,798
Years the bitches wanted
to look like Cher,

727
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,678
And dudes used
for their balls hair gel,

728
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,115
They're gone, is it luck?
I think, no,

729
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,589
I don't want to think of it,
if it arouses anger,

730
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,035
Go 4 lines up change
years into hip-hop,

731
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,555
Add social insurance
and the mortgage,

732
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,756
The glow of this era of those
covered in gold,

733
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,480
It's important for bitches
to spread the legs,

734
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,114
Judge for yourself, You see
I like to ridicule,

735
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,073
I'm tough on myself to make
my son proud,

736
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,879
It's fucken useless to go
on the front pages,

737
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,071
I don 't give a fuck for TV,
that's too smart for them,

738
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,435
If you seeing progress,
crap has blessed you,

739
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,989
This kind of fame and dough
stick up your ass,

740
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,430
No borders, balance,
only latex and plastic,

741
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,670
And the fucking boorishness
of our generation,

742
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,990
Who are you, tell me
the truth?

743
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,634
Is your heart, with the dough
inside the condom?

744
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,916
Where is the sense
in fashion for bitches?

745
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,429
Shut your face, it's the end
of destruction,

746
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,710
Who are you, tell me
the truth?

747
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,155
Is your heart, with the dough
inside the condom?

748
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,629
Where is the sense
in fashion for bitches?

749
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,559
Shut your face it's the end
of destruction...

750
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,711
You want to hang out with us,
you must be up to scratch.

751
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,111
If the girl is pretty
and attractive,

752
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,314
she has to pimp and
use her assets, right?

753
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,155
You have to get a sponsor.

754
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,994
Don't think that a guy pays me
some lousy 100 zloty for sex,

755
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,635
he pays me
a lot more, 200 or 300,

756
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,555
Takes me to restaurants,
bars, joints... shopping,

757
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,751
This is a different life.
This is high-life.

758
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,431
Remember those girls they
were sweat like honey,

759
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,068
Today they are keen
on the ride and fuck,

760
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,629
Plastic world full
of plastic Barbies,

761
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,070
Popculture of kids feeds
with plastic crap,

762
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,356
Remember those girls'
perms big as Afro,

763
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,114
Electro, Funk, Boogie, and Rap
with heart and passion,

764
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,390
Today they stand at attention
when there's no sniff,

765
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,716
Do you dream about
freedom sometimes?

766
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,155
My opinion is far from
the pattern,

767
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,629
People run the fuck out
from the conclusions,

768
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,149
In ignorance or understanding?
Not my business,

769
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,675
If you want be like them,
say nothing, it's easy,

770
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,195
Save me this crap
or you'll die

771
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,629
Of the fucking anorexia
or appetite in amphetamine,

772
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,035
Living in plastic cinema
of pop-plastic media,

773
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,470
Rubber showdown flows
for the viewers' profits,

774
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,995
Poor subscriber, you,
and profits from ads,

775
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,469
For this plastic and 2 zloty
they'd put you in Hell,

776
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,995
To be trendy is extra, why do
you brace up and exert?

777
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,118
Silicone instead of brain,
spinach from ass on your face.

778
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,800
Subtitles: Arigon

779
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,110
I can't get out here
in the middle of the street.

780
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,118
There're streetcars.
You'll manage.

781
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,868
Get out!
The lights are going to change.

782
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,511
But it was okay, wasn't it?

783
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,830
