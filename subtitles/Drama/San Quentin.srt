1
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,721
58078!

2
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:22,391
Here he comes.

3
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,228
I wonder who they're gonna
knock off today.

4
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,895
Harrison, 35923.

5
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,635
Conklin, 52425.

6
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,141
It's for you, Bill.

7
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,042
The captain wants to see you
on the porch.

8
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,378
Gilman, 38216.

9
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:45,781
I know what this means.
Two weeks in solitary.

10
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,986
And all I said was the captain of the yard
had stinkweed for a family tree.

11
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:53,919
So long, boys.

12
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:57,828
What's all this stuff
about the captain's porch?

13
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,131
Sounds like a tea party to me.

14
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,728
Listen, fish. You'll learn.

15
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,774
Stay away from that porch.

16
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,608
- 50878, Hastings.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:14,406
Privileges suspended till further notice.

18
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,980
52425, Conklin.

19
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,386
- Conklin!
- Yes, sir.

20
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,025
Ten days' solitary.

21
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,187
- What's that?
- Twenty days in solitary.

22
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:31,222
- I thought you said 10 days, sir.
- I said 30. Do you hear that?

23
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,329
Keep your mouth shut.

24
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,100
He's liable to keep paying you back
until you're there the rest of your life.

25
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:39,869
Druggin, the warden wants to see you
right away.

26
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,808
All right. Take charge.

27
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,348
- Druggin gave Bill 30 days.
- For what?

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,850
Some day I'm gonna kill that guy.

29
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,349
Bill didn't do anything. He's deaf.

30
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:57,551
He didn't hear him
and he didn't hear him yesterday.

31
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,594
Stick him in solitary.

32
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:03,829
Put us all in the cooler!
Beat our brains out, Druggin!

33
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,595
Take a bath in our blood.
It'll make you sleep better, you...

34
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,159
- Shut up, you.
- I won't shut up.

35
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:11,207
I'll tell that guy what I think of him.
I'll kill that...

36
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,032
- Druggin will get his...
- All right!

37
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:15,440
Hang on!

38
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,539
- Druggin will get this.
- Stand back, there!

39
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,174
Line up!

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,884
Get their numbers!

41
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,113
You guys'll be back
on the porch tomorrow.

42
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,959
- Wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Druggin.

43
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,357
I've just been notified that
Captain Jameson will be here Thursday.

44
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,490
- He'll be the new captain of the yard.
- You mean I'm out?

45
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,865
No. You'll return to your old post.
Operations Lieutenant.

46
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:42,063
It was understood
that you were only temporary, Captain.

47
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,766
Yeah, but I thought if I handled
the job all right I could keep it.

48
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:47,401
If you'd handled it all right,
Jameson wouldn't be coming in.

49
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,672
Well, that's a fine reward
for 10 years' service.

50
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:52,340
You're not the man for the job, Druggin.
You've proved that.

51
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:55,407
- What do you mean I'm not...
- Now wait a minute.

52
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,316
You're as good as any officer I've known

53
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:59,753
on handling the general routine
of a prison.

54
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,851
But you can't handle these convicts.

55
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,416
You don't understand them.
You don't know men.

56
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,893
A while ago, it was small riots.

57
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,055
Now it's open rebellion
one time after another.

58
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:10,793
The public's demanding that it be stopped
and they're right.

59
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:14,359
They're on the prison board's neck,
and the board's on mine.

60
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:15,802
That's why Jameson's coming in.

61
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:18,306
Who is this great man-handler Jameson?

62
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:21,366
He's one of the best training officers
in the United States Army.

63
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:23,639
He's on special leave to work with us

64
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:26,375
and I expect you
to give him your fullest cooperation.

65
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,473
That's all.

66
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,245
Well, you better tell him
to look to his spurs.

67
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,253
Some of these guys around here
might steal them.

68
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,017
Losing out to a tin soldier. I must...

69
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,007
Nope. You can't rib me
about this prison routine.

70
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,744
It's training men and I like the job.

71
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:04,446
What's the difference if it's behind
stone walls or an army camp?

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,421
- What's the difference? - Wait
till you're locked behind those walls.

73
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,685
You'll wish you were back
on an army post.

74
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,785
Yeah. It's too bad, Steve.
I certainly hate to think of you

75
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,831
molding away up there for two years
so far from the world.

76
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,661
Away from all this!

77
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,296
It's your last night out.
You better make the most of it.

78
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,304
Yeah. I've been giving that
a lot of thought, too.

79
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:08,305
- Now, there's something for tired eyes.
- And ears.

80
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:09,804
Look out, Steve,

81
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,280
training one woman is worse
than a whole company of citizen recruits.

82
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,543
I know.

83
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,110
Yeah, but look at all the fun you have
training them.

84
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,119
Hi, beautiful! Now, don't go away.

85
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:02,687
- Hello, Sergeant, where's the war?
- Haven't you read the papers?

86
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,791
We're fighting the Indians
'cause they won't take the country back.

87
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,462
- Really, Sergeant?
- And don't call me sergeant.

88
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,336
Well, I won't
if you promise to tell me what you are.

89
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:15,776
- Don't you know what two bars mean?
- Sure. Twice as many drunks as one bar.

90
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:18,775
Waiter!

91
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,781
Have you got a pencil
and a piece of paper, please?

92
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:28,418
It's about time for reveille, isn't it?

93
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,322
It's more like taps for Steve.

94
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:34,152
- What's your name, gorgeous?
- May.

95
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,788
Oh, no. May what?

96
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,333
Do you mean to tell me
you missed it on the poster outside?

97
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,028
It's De Villiers.

98
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,037
De... Can you spell that?

99
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,506
- K-E-N-N-E-D-Y.
- Oh, I get it.

100
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,834
French with an Irish accent, huh?

101
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,676
- How long have you been here?
- I just got in today from Texas.

102
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:56,013
Where are you headed?
The Presidio or Manila or Shanghai?

103
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,315
Well, if it was Shanghai,
would it break your heart?

104
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,788
No. But you could send me
a postcard of the geisha girls.

105
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,090
- They're in Japan.
- I know.

106
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,096
But if they knew you were in China,
they'd swim over.

107
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,928
Say, I think you and I
are gonna get along all right.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,331
Pardon me.

109
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,502
Excuse me.

110
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,212
We're not intruding, are we?

111
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,770
No. Yes. Sit down.

112
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,342
Joe!

113
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,782
Hello, Sis.

114
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:33,048
- Say, listen, Sis, have you got any money?
- Yeah, a little.

115
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,248
What's the matter, Joe? In trouble?

116
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,984
Do you only think I come to you
when I'm in trouble?

117
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,253
No, it's good news this time.
I got a job up in Seattle

118
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,454
- if I can make it looking halfway decent.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

119
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,123
- What kind of a job, Joe?
- Well, I haven't got time to tell you now.

120
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,360
- Will you get me the money?
- Yeah, wait a minute.

121
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,425
- And, Sis, hurry up.
- Okay.

122
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,667
- Table, sir?
- No, never mind.

123
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,681
He just came in the back entrance.

124
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,912
This is all I can spare, darling.
I wish it were more.

125
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:05,977
Oh, thanks, Sis. You're a pal.

126
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,080
- So long, kid. I'll write you.
- Okay.

127
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,817
Look out, Sis!

128
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,418
- Okay, Red, we got you.
- Joe, don't!

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,999
Somebody got shot.

130
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,228
There is nothing to be excited about.

131
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:22,862
- Let me through here.
- Let him through.

132
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:24,132
Joe, what's this mean?

133
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,074
It means, girlie, that your friend here
tried to stick up a restaurant.

134
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,509
That rap in jail last year
didn't teach you anything, did it?

135
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,774
- What's he doing here with you?
- She's okay, Chief.

136
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:34,816
I heard the whole thing
from out in the alley.

137
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,853
He gave her a line about a job in Seattle
and then made a touch.

138
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,353
Tough on kids like you.

139
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:41,049
Come on, Kennedy.

140
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,156
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,854
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,827
Don't take it too tough, kid.
Maybe they'll go easy on him.

143
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,267
No, they won't. Not this time.

144
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,801
- Oh, May!
- That's my cue!

145
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,979
Well, Jameson, there's your new army.

146
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,293
Looks like a man-sized job.

147
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,591
Well, what they need is the self-respect

148
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:23,063
of belonging
to a properly disciplined group.

149
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:26,124
Now, many of those men are here
just because they had bad breaks.

150
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:27,669
They're not born criminals,

151
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,570
and we don't want
to turn them into criminals.

152
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,732
Well, if the army'll help them any,
I'm all for it.

153
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:35,106
- When do I start?
- You started.

154
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:39,443
Come on. Now that you've seen them,
we'll let them have a look at you.

155
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,891
Blow the whistle and fall them in.

156
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:25,958
Fall in!

157
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:27,052
Fall in.

158
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,976
- Pipe the new captain of the yard.
- New captain of the yard?

159
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,169
There goes the army.

160
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:45,179
Click your heels, boys.
There goes the tin soldier.

161
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,946
Oh, Druggin, I want you to meet
the new captain of the yard.

162
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,610
Captain Jameson,
this is Lieutenant Druggin.

163
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,519
- He's been acting captain.
- Lieutenant, I'm glad to know you.

164
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,557
How do you do, sir?

165
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,854
Come on now and meet the boys.

166
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,660
Hey, son, put that bench over here for me,
will you, please?

167
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,830
All right, Captain.

168
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:14,207
Boys, this is Captain Jameson,
the new captain of the yard.

169
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,710
Hooray!

170
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,445
Hello, boys.

171
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:21,109
I'm not much on making speeches.
I don't believe in them.

172
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:22,844
I don't think
you want to hear them anyway.

173
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:25,853
I figure actions
count a lot more than words.

174
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:28,149
Now, all I ask for is order and discipline.

175
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,751
If anyone feels like getting funny,
I'll guarantee I'll get the last laugh.

176
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,459
Hey, you. Come here.

177
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,728
Who? Me?

178
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,704
Yes, you! Number seven, row three,
with the broken beak. Come on up.

179
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,741
- He gets solitary for that.
- He gets what I give him.

180
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,410
You heard me, I said come up here.

181
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:55,439
Can you tie that?

182
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,611
He must have eyes in the back of his head.

183
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,785
- So you're a crooner, huh?
- Yeah, I'm a crooner.

184
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:09,330
Well, that's fine. Let's hear you croon.

185
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:12,196
Go on. Sing nice and loud
so all your pals can hear you.

186
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,463
Go on. Get up there and sing!

187
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,415
I got it up too low.

188
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,928
All right, Lieutenant. Start your line.

189
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,021
Come on.

190
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,098
Get back up there!

191
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:44,923
This way.

192
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:50,054
Hello, Gus. Got my room ready for me?

193
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,327
Well, if it isn't 'Sailor Boy' Hansen.

194
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,869
I'm sorry, but they put a guest
in your room for the weekend.

195
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:56,700
You can have it
as soon as he leaves though.

196
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,433
Weekend? What do you mean, weekend?

197
00:15:58,507 --> 00:15:59,940
- Ten years.
- Come on.

198
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,476
Hoffman, you've been doing fine.

199
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,101
I'm gonna take you
out of the machine shop.

200
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,907
What do you want,
the road gang or the laundry?

201
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,413
The road gang, sir.

202
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:08,507
All right. Report for duty at the office
in the morning.

203
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,347
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

204
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,284
- That's all.
- Let's go.

205
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:15,150
Outside.

206
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,091
Boy, what wouldn't I give
for a good dose of hay fever

207
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,061
or even to get a sniff
at the backfire of an old flivver.

208
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,600
- How are you, Sailor Boy?
- How do I look?

209
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:35,699
Well, Hansen, you kind of like it up here,
don't you?

210
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,406
It's the State's idea, Captain. Not mine.

211
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,176
Yeah. Well, looks like
you'll be here for quite a while.

212
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,548
Get your receipt at the office.

213
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:53,283
Well, now that you've had
a good look at my face, how do you like it?

214
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,762
I don't like it. I've seen it before.

215
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:58,925
- Oh, yeah? Where?
- Forget it. Maybe I will, too.

216
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:04,868
Well, Kennedy, you've been pretty busy
for a fellow your age, haven't you?

217
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,373
Well, I been around.

218
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,104
Yeah, well, you won't be getting around
so much now.

219
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:12,341
You know, if you're smart,
you'll turn your sentence to advantage.

220
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:14,439
Maybe you'll learn a trade.

221
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:15,813
Supposing I don't wanna?

222
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,749
You'll learn one anyway and like it.

223
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,014
Come on.

224
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,935
- Got any folks on the outside, Kennedy?
- Yeah, a sister.

225
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,630
- She got any dough?
- Nope.

226
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:38,002
That's too bad.

227
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:40,564
You need it to buy the luxuries
you can have around here.

228
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,372
- Yeah? What luxuries?
- Oh, tobacco and chocolate.

229
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,744
And believe me, you get to wanting them
around this college.

230
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,681
- Pretty nice campus, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's big.

231
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:55,121
Well, it may look big to you now.
Wait till you been here for a stretch.

232
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,751
You feel like you're in a telephone booth
with four other guys and no telephone.

233
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,419
- Hiya, Sailor Boy.
- Hello, kid.

234
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,327
I just heard you got back.
I been looking for you.

235
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:05,366
- How's all that Spring Street gang?
- Oh, they're swell.

236
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:08,232
Pete's doing a six month stretch
for the county and Duffy,

237
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:12,171
Duffy's running book at a new joint.
It's great. And Louis, you remember Louis?

238
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,903
- The guy with the gunboats for the feet?
- Sure.

239
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,144
Well, he got himself a job on the dock,

240
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,442
tripped over a hawser
and fell into the drink.

241
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,846
He's still standing on the bottom

242
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,441
waiting for someone
to tell him to come up.

243
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,181
- Did you see Casey?
- Forget them slobs!

244
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,723
What about the dames?
Say, did you see Gladys?

245
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,783
- Did she get my letter?
- No, I didn't see her.

246
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,762
You're a fine pal, not to look her up.

247
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:38,456
I heard she had moved.
That's the trouble with you, Mickey.

248
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,934
You're driving yourself stir crazy
thinking about that dame.

249
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,971
Forget her.
She'll be so old when you got out of here,

250
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,233
you won't even know her
from your own grandmother.

251
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,775
- It's kind of tough on you guys.
- Yeah.

252
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:51,301
- You'll soon learn, fish. - Oh, not
me. I'll be out of here like a shot.

253
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,406
I got pals on the outside
that can pull wires.

254
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,384
Honest, kid?

255
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:00,853
- Think you can do something for me?
- I'll see what I can do when I get out.

256
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:02,322
Gee, thanks.

257
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,224
You know, I really got here on a bum rap.

258
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,353
- 58...
- Say...

259
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,991
We got a fresh fish over there,
number 53834.

260
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,728
- You wanna do your stuff?
- Sure.

261
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,930
- Okay. Wait till I get back there,
will you? - All right.

262
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,201
I'll never sit in a cell and go stir crazy.

263
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,641
Too many people want me in circulation.

264
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:26,203
- 53834!
- That's you, Red.

265
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,748
Hey, that's me. What's up?

266
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:32,320
Get your stuff from your cell.
You're going back to San Francisco.

267
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,912
- Gee, they sprung you.
- A pardon!

268
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,050
- Can you beat that? He wasn't kidding.
- I'll say I wasn't!

269
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:41,493
- Well, so long. It's nice to
have known you. - So long.

270
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,004
Hey, turkey, open up.

271
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,640
Where do you think you're going?

272
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,975
I gotta get my stuff out of my cell.
I've been pardoned. Open it up, will you?

273
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:01,447
Go on, you fat head. Get back in the yard.
They've been ribbing you.

274
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,984
If you got a pardon, I got $1 million.

275
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,988
Let him have his stuff!

276
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,957
Let him have his clothes!
He's got a pardon!

277
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,826
What's the matter, Red?
Forget something?

278
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,298
You said it.

279
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:30,211
Here, come on. What's the idea?

280
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,337
Break this. Come on.

281
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:34,075
Why, you crazy fish,
you can't do that to me.

282
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,744
Come on, here, straighten up.
You know it's against the rules to fight.

283
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,310
- What've you got to say for yourself?
- Nothing.

284
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,856
You must like solitary confinement

285
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:43,915
'cause that's where you're gonna begin
this stretch.

286
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,983
- Take him away.
- Come on.

287
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:48,456
You only came in yesterday.

288
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,623
You're trying to show us
how tough you are already, eh?

289
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,133
- Shut up and give me the works.
- All right. You asked for it.

290
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,135
We'll let the captain of the yard
give you the answer.

291
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:56,795
Come on with me.

292
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,972
Now take it easy, I can walk.

293
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,443
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- Kennedy, he came in yesterday,

294
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,949
he started a fight with his cellmate.

295
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,211
How do you know he started it?

296
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,344
I know everything
that goes on in this prison, Captain.

297
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,321
Kennedy started blowing off
about the big shots he knew

298
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,254
and how they're gonna have him
out of here in no time.

299
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,417
All right. So what?

300
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,460
So the boys pulled a gag on him
and he couldn't take it.

301
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,689
He got sore and he started a fight.
I know the type.

302
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:24,027
The way to handle them is to break them
right in the beginning.

303
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,896
Show them where to head in
before they got started.

304
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:28,968
My advice to you
is to give this guy solitary for a month.

305
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,028
When I want your advice, I'll ask for it.

306
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,869
That's all, Druggin.

307
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,875
Stand up straight.

308
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:43,615
One of those tough guys that can
hand it out, but can't take it, huh?

309
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:46,984
I can do both,
but I won't take anything from them lugs.

310
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,285
You're getting off to a bad start, Kennedy.

311
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,724
Five years in the reform school,
a year in the county jail,

312
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:54,023
you come in here
for assault with a deadly weapon.

313
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,564
You're asking for
solitary right off the bat.

314
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:57,791
You left out one thing.

315
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:00,164
I kicked a guy in the face once
because he was a cop.

316
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,703
Oh, yeah? A tinhorn hoodlum, huh?

317
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:07,664
Let me tell you something, Kennedy.
You got a lot to learn.

318
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,109
Too bad you weren't in the army.

319
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,137
It might've done you a lot of good.

320
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,647
Learn how to got along with the crowd,

321
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:17,082
have some respect for others,
it might've made you a lot happier.

322
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,517
All right, guard.

323
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,484
Well, it's your first offense.

324
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,787
Privileges suspended for a month.
Solitary, four days.

325
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,589
That's it, Siberia.

326
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,825
Oh, and, Kennedy,

327
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,434
you might give that army idea
a lot of thought.

328
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,027
Do you a lot of good.

329
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:52,546
- One?
- Please.

330
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,883
This way.

331
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,460
Thank you.

332
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,131
What you got on here that's good?

333
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,167
Everything. May I recommend the lobster?

334
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,998
- Or the sweetbreads à la...
- Never mind.

335
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,384
Hello. I was just going in to see you.

336
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,787
Hello, yourself.
Too bad you missed the floor show.

337
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:30,825
- We had some new routines.
- That's all right.

338
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:33,087
You're the important one.
You're the one I want to see.

339
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,356
Well, why the store clothes?
Have you left the service?

340
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,058
No, not exactly,
but I've got sort of an outside assignment.

341
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,725
Oh, can't talk about it, huh?

342
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:42,531
Yeah, something like that.
Well, that's the way it's worked out.

343
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,004
- Say, can I make a suggestion?
- Sure. Go ahead.

344
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,564
Let's drop by and get something to eat
before you go home.

345
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:51,100
Well, I wouldn't mind going home and
shaking up a pan of ham and eggs myself,

346
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,976
that is, if you like home cooking.

347
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:55,175
I don't wanna hear anybody knock it.

348
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,344
Say, I got a nice yellow job outside. Taxi!

349
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:11,462
It doesn't look
as if you get much home cooking.

350
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,024
Well, they don't let you carry
your own cook in the army.

351
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:16,627
- Want some more coffee?
- All right. Thanks.

352
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,299
I don't mind staying awake all night.

353
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,621
- You worry about him a lot, don't you?
- Yeah.

354
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:43,687
You saw him arrested.
They sent him to prison.

355
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,731
Well, I'll tell you, May,

356
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:49,292
it's not gonna do any good
worrying about it.

357
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,601
Yeah, I know, but I can't help it.

358
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:54,665
He's in for 10 years,
and I know what it'll do to him.

359
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,608
It'll break him. His spirit, everything.

360
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:58,543
I saw what the reform school did for him.

361
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:01,741
He was just a roughneck kid before that,
like any of the rest.

362
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:04,785
Prison will finish the job
of making him a criminal.

363
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:07,083
On the other hand,
it might do him a lot of good.

364
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:09,385
Oh, no, it won't.
Not what they're doing to him.

365
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:12,324
He's been up there a month,
and they've thrown him into solitary cells

366
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:15,056
on bread and water,
and taken his privileges away from him.

367
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,860
I can't even see him. I've tried to.
I've been up there.

368
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,664
Guards and officers,
they should be called animal trainers.

369
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,906
You haven't got much use
for those guards, have you?

370
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:28,306
I hate the very thought of them.

371
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,138
Yeah.

372
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,765
Sit right over there.

373
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:05,641
Kennedy!

374
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,283
Hello, Sis.

375
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,664
I've been here every Sunday
for the past month,

376
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:28,066
but they wouldn't let me see you.

377
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:30,536
Joe, what did they put you
in the dungeon for?

378
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:33,802
- What did you do? - Nothing.
The guy that's running the joint.

379
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,672
It's his big idea
to show you how tough he is,

380
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:37,939
before you've even had a chance
to turn around.

381
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,449
But you must have done something.
You must have broken some rule.

382
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,679
Well, I had a fight, but nobody told me
it was against the rules.

383
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:46,983
But you don't have to worry about that.

384
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:48,682
- Did you bring the dough?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:52,352
- Are you sure it's all right, Joe?
- Sure, it's all right.

386
00:26:56,898 --> 00:26:58,695
Give me that money.

387
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,962
I'll have to report
this to the office, lady.

388
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,098
It's against the rules
to give prisoners money.

389
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:09,401
I thought you said it was all right.

390
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,872
Well, if a guy wants some good food
and a smoke once in a while.

391
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:15,415
These turkeys think
you can live on memories.

392
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,120
There's a Miss Kennedy in there.

393
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,919
Tried to sneak this cash to her brother.
You want his number?

394
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:27,553
Yeah. And tell the dame
I want to see her on her way out.

395
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,227
Kennedy.

396
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,471
So long, kid.

397
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,520
The lieutenant
wants to speak to you, miss.

398
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,955
All right.

399
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,358
This is Miss Kennedy, Lieutenant.

400
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,558
What's the idea
of passing money to a prisoner?

401
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,362
I didn't know it was against the rules.

402
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,369
Come on, sister,
I'm reporting you to the captain.

403
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,338
Your sightseeing days in this pen are over.

404
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:25,152
Sit down.

405
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,189
The captain will be right over
from the yard.

406
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,367
- May.
- I don't understand.

407
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,761
Well, I guess you two
don't need an introduction.

408
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,394
What's this all about, Lieutenant?

409
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,837
She was caught passing money
to Red Kennedy, her brother.

410
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:48,876
According to the book of rules,
that's a serious offense.

411
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:51,173
Okay. I'll handle this myself.

412
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,214
And I'll handle Kennedy.

413
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:59,319
Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,317
Well, I was going to until you told me
what you thought about prison guards.

415
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:05,621
Well, you didn't need to lie to me.

416
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:08,628
Don't get me wrong, May,
I didn't lie to you.

417
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:11,164
I wanted to wait until
I had some good news about your brother

418
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:12,631
before I told you anything else.

419
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,066
Good news,
you've got a beautiful sense of humor.

420
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,003
Privileges suspended,
thrown into a dungeon, for what?

421
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:19,937
Because it might make a man out of him.

422
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,203
Make him tough and bitter
and hopeless and ashamed.

423
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:25,007
Now you wait a minute. You listen to me.

424
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,243
I've handled men all my life.

425
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,115
I ought to know something about them.

426
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,485
I think Red's got a lot of stuff in him.

427
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:38,185
But I wanna bring it out in my way.
That's why I'm here.

428
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:39,892
It's my job.

429
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:55,239
Suspend Kennedy's privileges for a month.

430
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,301
- Is that all?
- No. Change his cell.

431
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,005
He shouldn't have been
with those second-timers

432
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,173
- in the first place.
- Where will I put him, in the cooler?

433
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,444
Put him where he belongs,
with the first offenders.

434
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:04,951
That's all.

435
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,797
Captain of the yard! Inspection!

436
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,308
- Whose is that lower bunk?
- Mine, sir.

437
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,246
What's the matter? Don't you know
how to fold your blankets properly?

438
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:40,844
No, sir, I just got here yesterday.

439
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,247
You been here long enough.
Why don't you show him?

440
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:44,586
Yes, sir.

441
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,896
- Oh, Captain.
- Yes, Rogers?

442
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:56,596
Your soul, Captain.

443
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,536
- Has it been saved?
- Yes.

444
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,074
I understand, fella. Take it easy.

445
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:06,343
Dopey shouldn't be in prison, Captain.

446
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:09,815
When the board meets,
I'm gonna have him transferred.

447
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,364
Well, Simpson. Writing again, huh?

448
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,834
- How's the story coming?
- Fine, Captain. I'm almost finished.

449
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,494
Here, read this.

450
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,602
Well, I'll wait till after it's published.

451
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:35,375
You know, I never could understand
how a man with your brains

452
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:36,933
ever got into a place like this.

453
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:39,502
Well, I couldn't live on rejection slips.

454
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:42,674
I didn't start getting checks
till I got in here.

455
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:46,482
- Maybe the address impressed them.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:56,794
- Who are you?
- Dorgan, Captain.

457
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,123
Oh, yes, Dorgan.

458
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,861
I'm a writer, too.

459
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:02,666
Oh, I think I remember now.

460
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:04,796
It was writing other people's names
on checks, wasn't it?

461
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,032
Correct, Captain.

462
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:09,406
Trouble was I retired so long,
I got out of practice.

463
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:15,713
Well, how do you like
your new cell, Kennedy?

464
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:17,216
It's all right.

465
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:20,618
I'd like it better if I could take a walk
or go to a ball game

466
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,383
or even do some work.

467
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,288
Well, your privileges
will be restored tomorrow.

468
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,657
There'll be a machine waiting for you
in one of the shops.

469
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:29,663
It's the first time
I ever heard work called a privilege.

470
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:32,291
Well, maybe you'll think differently
after tomorrow.

471
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,359
There are other jobs in here,
a lot easier to take.

472
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:37,233
You just toe the line, stick to the rules

473
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:41,401
and, before you know it,
they'll be knocking time off your sentence.

474
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:48,075
Jameson's a swell guy.
Simpson ought to put him in his story.

475
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,811
Yeah, he's just another copper to me.

476
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:12,535
- You know how to run this machine?
- Sure.

477
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,901
- We're old friends.
- All right. Go to it.

478
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,016
Not sore, are you?

479
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,817
No, I just lost my temper
at that punk joke.

480
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,348
You can fight. I like
a guy that fights hard.

481
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:34,988
Yeah, I can fight.

482
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,058
Takes nerve to fight your way
out of a tough spot.

483
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:42,159
- What do you mean, tough spot?
- This one.

484
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:44,431
Not me.

485
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:48,007
I'm gonna work my way out of this shop.

486
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,476
Yeah? Then what?

487
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:55,576
- I don't know. Do you?
- Sure I know. I'll tell you.

488
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:05,693
They tell me you tried to go over the wall
the last time you were in here,

489
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,125
but you couldn't make it.

490
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,060
They were waiting for you at the top,
weren't they?

491
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,324
Yeah.

492
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,663
But I've been thinking.
A wall is bad business.

493
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:18,330
Here they are.
All four of them and we're on the inside.

494
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:22,304
- There's no way to go around them.
- Or over them or under them.

495
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,677
- Give me the lowdown.
- The road gang, Red.

496
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,216
When you're on the road gang,
you're on the outside of those walls.

497
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:32,912
All you got to do is to thumb a passing car

498
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,146
and ride away.

499
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:38,283
How do you make the road gang?
I thought it was a privilege.

500
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,384
By keeping the nose clean.

501
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:43,396
Boys, have your souls been saved?

502
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:46,896
Brothers, I bring you a message
of eternal salvation.

503
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:48,492
If you will...

504
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,995
There you are.

505
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:57,433
You godless men!
Hellfire shall be your lot.

506
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,246
Your souls shall burn till Judgment Day!

507
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:11,848
Break it up! Break it up! Sit down there!

508
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:13,894
Now, let this man alone.

509
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,096
Come on, Red.
Are you gonna finish this game or not?

510
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,964
- Hiya, Sailor.
- Hi, kid.

511
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,502
Well, if it ain't Red.

512
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,835
How's all your influential friends?
Still pulling wires for you?

513
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:28,375
Nix on that stuff, Red,
you know where a fight lands you.

514
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:30,933
- What's going on here?
- Oh, nothing.

515
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:34,379
Come on, Red. Let's finish the game.
What do you say?

516
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,268
Hey, Hank. Hank!

517
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:01,631
Get back. Get back there!

518
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,836
- Look out!
- Look out!

519
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,003
Stop!

520
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,544
Stop! Don't trifle with me.
You see what the guard got?

521
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:18,482
Stand back, all of you, and listen!

522
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,724
You scoffed
when I wanted to bring you salvation.

523
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,126
Don't shoot.

524
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:23,720
You laughed when I told you to repent.

525
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:25,732
- Choose now, ye blasphemers.
- Come on, break it up.

526
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,258
...whether ye shall repent and be saved,
for I am the instrument of Providence.

527
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:31,305
Woe be unto you
if you do not see the light,

528
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,067
for I'll wipe you from
the face of the earth.

529
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,234
- Put down that gun, Rogers.
- Stay where you are!

530
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:43,314
Stand back. Stand back.
Stand back or I'll...

531
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:45,215
Come on, Rogers, put down that gun.

532
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,982
How are the boys gonna repent
if you don't give them a chance?

533
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:49,454
Pull yourself together, fella.

534
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,458
You haven't got anything to fear from me.
You know that, don't you?

535
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:53,857
Sure, Captain.

536
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:56,192
You're the only one
that's never laughed at my message.

537
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:59,290
But you let these men scoff at me
when I would show them the way of truth.

538
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,200
They beat me and spat upon me
and you did nothing to stop them.

539
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,364
You, too, are one with them, Captain!
Stand back!

540
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,236
Take it easy, Rogers.

541
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,100
The boys'll all listen to you
if you only give them a chance.

542
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:13,146
But you've gotta take it easy.

543
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:15,879
Lay off!

544
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:18,278
Lay off! Take him away!

545
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:19,717
Where to, the dungeon, Captain?

546
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:21,812
No, to the hospital.
That man is mentally sick.

547
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,687
Recall me. I'll bring them salvation!

548
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:28,193
Boy, that was a close one.

549
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:30,924
- That took plenty of nerve.
- It sure did.

550
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,661
I don't know.
Anybody could have done what he did.

551
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:36,561
Yeah, but nobody did.

552
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,000
58648.

553
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:45,739
Burnett, 49863.

554
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:49,715
- Kennedy, 53834.
- Yeah?

555
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,274
Report to the porch.

556
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:53,315
Richardson, 52...

557
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,548
53834, Kennedy.

558
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:57,783
The names and numbers I called,
get up on the porch

559
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,416
to report for road gang duty
in the morning.

560
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,461
- Why didn't I get it?
- What's the idea?

561
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,020
All right! Shut up! Get back in line!

562
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:06,394
Captain of the yard's orders.

563
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,899
- How do you rate it?
- Maybe they changed the rules.

564
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:16,766
What kind of a raw deal is this?

565
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,675
I've been rating that road gang
for six weeks

566
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:19,872
and I'm still cleaning out.

567
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:22,472
That guy, Jameson, pulling
some of that military stuff.

568
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,142
- He can't get away with it.
- Oh, no?

569
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,279
"Oh, no," is right. Not if you guys got
the nerve to brace him. I'm gonna.

570
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,987
- Lieutenant.
- Get back there.

571
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,458
Ain't you forgot a few numbers?

572
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:35,586
I've been rating the road gang
since way back.

573
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:36,925
- Check!
- Me, too.

574
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:38,260
What's the idea?

575
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,129
Captain's orders.
I got nothing to do with it.

576
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,634
What's he doing, boys?
Trying to gyp us out of our rights?

577
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,568
- Captain's orders. Break it up.
- Oh, come on...

578
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:46,804
Break it up!

579
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:53,206
All right, go on.

580
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,579
How do you like that for a raw deal?

581
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:59,278
So it's come to you gotta be a fink
to make the fresh air squad.

582
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:01,753
Only the fresh fish get
the good jobs in this pen.

583
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:03,221
We earn them and they get them.

584
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,884
That captain's so crooked,
he ought to be wearing a number.

585
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,329
If you play straight, you can suck
jute dust in your lungs for life.

586
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:11,929
I'll show him.

587
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,862
If I don't go to work on that road gang,
I don't go to work anywhere else.

588
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,369
Well, I'm staying right here in this yard

589
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,463
until that tinhorn captain
gets wise to himself.

590
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,008
- Me, too.
- I'm with you, Muggsy.

591
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:24,374
- Same here.
- Let's strike.

592
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:25,467
- Sure.
- Yeah.

593
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,343
The captain's cheating us
out of our privileges.

594
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,643
Let's show him, no work.

595
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:30,240
Now, remember, we strike.

596
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:32,677
We don't go to work
when that whistle blows.

597
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:34,243
Nix, dummy up.

598
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,751
- Why don't you play the deuce?
- Gangway.

599
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:39,952
Break it up.

600
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,400
Remember, no work!

601
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:55,366
Come on, break up.

602
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:59,146
Come on, break it up. Come on.

603
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:01,946
Break it up. Come on.

604
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,614
What's the matter? Can't you hear
that whistle? Go back to work.

605
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:08,086
- There ain't gonna be no work.
- Oh, no?

606
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,487
No, none of us goes to work.

607
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,959
We'll see about that.

608
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:15,618
You yellow monkey.

609
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,536
The men won't go back to work, sir.

610
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:29,803
- Why not?
- I don't know.

611
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:31,708
It's the answer to
your new road gang orders, Captain.

612
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,747
- The men won't clear the yard, Captain.
- They'll clear...

613
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:35,873
- You're not going in the yard?
- Yes, I'm going in the yard.

614
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,884
That's a swell bid for your own finish.
They'll kill you.

615
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:39,385
No, I don't think so.

616
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:10,541
Quiet, all of you!

617
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,247
All right. What's this all about?

618
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,810
You know what it's about, Captain.

619
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,823
You're trying to double-cross us
on the good jobs.

620
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,019
Quiet!

621
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:24,389
Quiet!

622
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:27,425
You heard that whistle.
Back to your jobs, all of you.

623
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,731
Nothing doing. We won't go back to work!

624
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:41,012
All right, then don't. Back to your cells.
Till you decide to obey orders, no chow.

625
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:45,410
Quiet!

626
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,349
I want this yard cleared in two minutes.
That's it. Lock up.

627
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:09,003
Come on.

628
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:55,888
Better turn out the lights.

629
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,866
Hello, Bay City Press.
Let me talk to Slim Mackey.

630
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,438
Hello, Slim. Sharpen up your pencil.
I got a story for you.

631
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,492
Regardless of your plans,
we can't tolerate conditions

632
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:37,962
that get this kind of headlines
in the papers.

633
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:42,626
So that's the reason you countermanded
my road gang assignments.

634
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:44,400
Afraid of the headlines, huh?

635
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:48,100
No. We did it because it's obvious
this plan won't work.

636
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,104
How do you know it won't work?

637
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:52,841
You checked my first order
before it goes into effect.

638
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,005
But this riot.

639
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,311
That riot was over
at 7:00 the following morning.

640
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,647
The men had breakfast
and went back to work.

641
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,778
Now, you brought me here to get results.

642
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,080
I came out of the army
where we do get results.

643
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:09,086
However, if they prove unsatisfactory,
I'll admit that I've failed.

644
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,164
It's not that, Captain.
We know your ability and your record.

645
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,330
But this extreme measure
of taking earned privileges from the men

646
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,098
is hard even for us to accept.

647
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,864
Mr. Barrett, there are two types of men
in this prison.

648
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,902
Now, the first group, no matter what
you do for them, they'll never reform.

649
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,507
They're habitual criminals. They've
spent most of their lives in prison.

650
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,018
They're very clever at earning credits
to get themselves the softest jobs.

651
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,781
They ask to go on the road gangs
primarily with the hope of escape.

652
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:42,125
Now the second group are definitely
trying to reform. They're sincere.

653
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,454
And they deserve rewards.

654
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,658
And if I stay on here,
I'm gonna see to it that they get them.

655
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:51,066
Gentlemen, I'm convinced
that Jameson is right.

656
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:53,203
And, if you'll allow me
to give him a free hand,

657
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,901
I'm sure that he'll give you the results
you want.

658
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:03,244
All right, Jameson. Go ahead.
But we must have order and discipline.

659
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:05,684
All right, you'll get it.

660
00:45:12,357 --> 00:45:14,689
I'd like to speak
to Captain Jameson, please.

661
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:17,853
We don't allow ladies in the yard.
I'll have to call his office.

662
00:45:17,996 --> 00:45:21,261
- What's the name?
- Just tell him a lady wants to see him.

663
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:27,802
Tell Captain Jameson
a lady would like to see him.

664
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:33,942
Eyes front, there.

665
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:50,025
- A lady here to see me?
- Yes, sir. She's right over there.

666
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:57,633
- You wanted to see me?
- Why, yes, Steve, I...

667
00:45:57,702 --> 00:45:59,169
Now, wait a minute.

668
00:45:59,404 --> 00:46:03,272
Before you start taking any swings at me,
you go and talk to that brother of yours.

669
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:05,809
He's been behaving himself, May.
He's getting along fine.

670
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:08,903
I did talk to him, Steve. Just now.
That's why I'm here.

671
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:12,216
Ho told me how you saved his life
and the others'

672
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:14,343
by taking that gun away from a madman.

673
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:15,919
I wanted to thank you.

674
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:19,118
Well, I'm afraid I wasn't thinking
of anybody but myself just then.

675
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,657
No, it was swell.

676
00:46:20,725 --> 00:46:23,285
I want to apologize for everything
I said to you.

677
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:26,728
Oh, I was afraid for Joe,
but he says you've been grand to him.

678
00:46:26,898 --> 00:46:28,388
Well, he's earned it lately.

679
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:30,559
He's been taking a different attitude
on things.

680
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:34,100
I know it. He never wanted
to be square with people before.

681
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,875
He's got a lot of stuff in him, May.
Don't you worry about him.

682
00:46:37,943 --> 00:46:39,672
Well, I won't from now on.

683
00:46:44,115 --> 00:46:46,413
Well, now that the war's over,

684
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:48,452
do you think it's safe
to go to San Francisco?

685
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,182
Oh, I think it might be safe
to come over tonight

686
00:46:51,256 --> 00:46:53,622
and try some more home cooking.

687
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:57,425
- I'm practically there.
- Okay, I'll see you.

688
00:47:00,498 --> 00:47:04,491
Don't be surprised if that con Red Kennedy
ends up with my job tomorrow.

689
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:16,644
What are you looking so gloomy about?

690
00:47:16,715 --> 00:47:20,207
Gee, Sailor. It ain't doing me any good
having you here in stir.

691
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:23,049
I'll believe you,
but only because I ain't got time to argue.

692
00:47:23,121 --> 00:47:25,112
Now get a load of this and get it straight.

693
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,983
I got a chance of getting on the road gang.

694
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:31,626
That's tough, dearie.
What was you doing, fighting again?

695
00:47:31,696 --> 00:47:33,220
No. What do you mean, tough?

696
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:35,357
I've been working for it
ever since I got in here.

697
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:38,630
Hey, have you still got
that old bus of yours?

698
00:47:38,703 --> 00:47:42,139
Sure, but it'll be just a bunch
of spare parts by the time you get out.

699
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:44,869
Yeah? That's where you're wrong. Listen.

700
00:47:46,711 --> 00:47:49,578
The road gang is working
on the inland highway

701
00:47:49,648 --> 00:47:52,515
about two miles west
of where Route 28 crosses it.

702
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:54,175
If I make it, I'll let you know.

703
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:57,282
Now all you gotta do
is to drive by there every morning

704
00:47:57,355 --> 00:47:58,686
like you was going to work.

705
00:47:58,757 --> 00:48:01,351
You know, so the guards will
get to know you. And then...

706
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:03,519
I'm sure it'll be good news for you
this time.

707
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:05,256
- I'll let you know.
- Thanks.

708
00:48:07,065 --> 00:48:10,523
And then keep your eye peeled
for a signal from me. That's all.

709
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:13,466
There's the complete road gang list.
Start tomorrow morning.

710
00:48:13,538 --> 00:48:16,701
- Parole board okayed your plans, eh?
- Yeah, they okayed them.

711
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:19,005
Long chance to take
after those fireworks, Captain.

712
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:21,978
What if it don't work? They'll stop
the rest of your plans, won't they?

713
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:23,412
They'll probably fire me.

714
00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:26,006
Aren't you a little concerned
about what's going to happen to me?

715
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:27,551
And about what's going
to happen to me, too.

716
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:28,881
If a real riot breaks out in this place,

717
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:31,421
I got as good a chance as you
of getting a knife in the ribs.

718
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:34,014
Yeah. Well, we'll have to see
that doesn't happen.

719
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:36,222
Change that list of cards
over from the machine shop

720
00:48:36,294 --> 00:48:38,524
to the road assignment file. That's all.

721
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,222
Yes, sir.

722
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,233
Hey, you drop that?

723
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:54,373
Well, pick it up.
You know better than to dirty up the yard.

724
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:57,876
- What do you got?
- Sailor Boy's planning a road gang break.

725
00:48:57,949 --> 00:49:01,407
- He isn't even on a road gang.
- Well, I don't know. I heard him talking.

726
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:04,019
Wait a minute. I didn't dismiss you yet.

727
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:07,949
You've been a pretty good con.
How'd you like to go on a road gang?

728
00:49:08,026 --> 00:49:10,961
- Might be able to do yourself
a lot of good. - Yes, sir.

729
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:13,054
Well, get up on the porch.

730
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:53,261
- Keep moving, boys.
- Okay. Take it away.

731
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:55,969
Hey, pop!

732
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,110
- Give us a drink of water, will you?
- Tired, son?

733
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:03,511
This road work is tough on a beginner.

734
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:05,378
Well, anything's better
than that big house.

735
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:09,910
You're right, kid. Take it from an old man
that's put 24 years of his life in stir.

736
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:12,513
If you've got time to do,
do it the easy way.

737
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,615
Do it the hard way and they'll break you.

738
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:17,490
Do your time and make a fresh start.

739
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:29,301
You know,
anybody'd ever told me a year ago

740
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,501
that I'd enjoy digging out
the side of a mountain,

741
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:33,100
I'd have said they was crazy.

742
00:50:33,178 --> 00:50:36,079
That's the trouble with you, Red.
You're fresh air daffy.

743
00:50:36,147 --> 00:50:40,083
I don't suppose you'd like to make a break
and be on the outside away from them.

744
00:50:40,151 --> 00:50:43,177
And spend the rest of my life hiding out?
What good would it do you?

745
00:50:43,254 --> 00:50:47,213
You'd find out what good it'd do you
if we could kiss this outfit goodbye.

746
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:50,523
- Oh, like that, eh?
- Sure.

747
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:53,423
Look.

748
00:51:00,138 --> 00:51:03,266
When I give her the high sign,
she'll be all set on the next time through.

749
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:04,603
I need a guy like you, Red,

750
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:07,236
a guy that knows
how to handle himself in a tight spot.

751
00:51:07,312 --> 00:51:09,303
And believe me,
the going's liable to get tough.

752
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,543
- You want to break with me, kid?
- Not me, Sailor.

753
00:51:12,884 --> 00:51:14,579
- Yellow?
- Yeah.

754
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:17,483
Just as yellow as I was
when I took a sock at you.

755
00:51:17,555 --> 00:51:19,819
All right, all right.
I thought I'd do you a favor.

756
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:22,587
I thought maybe you'd like to be out
with a dame one of these nights

757
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,629
instead of listening to 60 cons
snoring in the bunkhouse.

758
00:51:25,697 --> 00:51:28,928
My term isn't as long as yours, Sailor.
I'm working it out.

759
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,868
A couple of years of behaving myself
and I'll be out on the right side.

760
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:46,209
All right, boys.

761
00:51:47,852 --> 00:51:49,615
How do you like the road gang, Red?

762
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:51,848
That pick and shovel business
will put you in shape.

763
00:51:51,923 --> 00:51:54,585
It's all right when you get used to it,
only I ain't used to it.

764
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:58,652
Well, if it ain't my old pal, Red!
How did you make the road gang, fella?

765
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,062
You had plenty of trouble
when you first come in.

766
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,828
Why, Red's a friend of the governor's.
Ain't you, pal?

767
00:52:03,902 --> 00:52:05,301
You remember, fellas,

768
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,305
Red's got all them big-shot friends
on the outside.

769
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:12,866
Button it up, you guys, I'm tired.

770
00:52:12,944 --> 00:52:15,708
Red's got a better in than the governor.

771
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,474
He's got a good-looking sister.

772
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,519
Hey, listen.
You can crack all you want to about me,

773
00:52:23,588 --> 00:52:26,489
- but lay off my sister, you hear?
- Take your mitts off of me.

774
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:27,854
I didn't mean anything.

775
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:29,917
That is, no more
than the whole prison knows.

776
00:52:29,994 --> 00:52:31,154
Yeah? What does the whole prison know?

777
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:32,958
You think Captain Jameson's swell to you

778
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:34,328
because he thinks you're a great guy?

779
00:52:34,399 --> 00:52:35,627
How do I know what he thinks?

780
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,634
He's treating you pretty swell
just the same!

781
00:52:37,702 --> 00:52:39,499
- And he's calling on your sister!
- Why, you...

782
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,970
All right, Red. Let's cut it out.

783
00:52:42,974 --> 00:52:44,236
What's going on here?

784
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:47,244
Why... Why nothing, mister.
We was just clowning.

785
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:49,838
Well, cut out the clowning.

786
00:52:49,914 --> 00:52:51,040
You crazy fool.

787
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:53,481
That won't get you any place
but back in the icebox.

788
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:57,510
I'll make that guy eat those words
if I have to spend a year in solitary.

789
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:06,895
- Hey, Sailor.
- Yeah?

790
00:53:10,868 --> 00:53:13,632
That guy on the level
with that crack about my sister?

791
00:53:13,705 --> 00:53:16,196
He's right.
It's been all over the prison for weeks.

792
00:53:16,274 --> 00:53:18,435
It's a wonder you didn't get wise sooner.

793
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:21,603
It was all too phony,
you being treated with kid gloves.

794
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,677
- Jameson, huh?
- Yeah.

795
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:29,812
He's been seeing her in the prison, too,
every time she comes to visit you.

796
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:31,247
Yeah?

797
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:35,585
I'll have to give these guys
something else to talk about.

798
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:39,596
Some day Jameson will go across the bay
and he won't come back.

799
00:53:44,202 --> 00:53:47,660
- When do we break, Sailor?
- Now you're talking, Red.

800
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:03,650
- Hello. How are things going?
- Okay. We're up to schedule.

801
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:05,348
The Highway Commission's
gonna look you over

802
00:54:05,423 --> 00:54:08,517
in about an hour or so.
Keep this gang hopping.

803
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,053
Come on! Get going.

804
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:02,244
What're you doing here, Sailor?
Somebody paying off for you, too?

805
00:55:02,313 --> 00:55:03,746
Easy, Red.

806
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:06,443
I don't get you, Lieutenant.

807
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:08,413
You will.

808
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:15,017
It won't be long now, kid.
She's due any minute.

809
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:23,528
Here she comes now.

810
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,342
- What do we do, make a run for it?
- No.

811
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:35,335
Move on, lady.

812
00:55:37,315 --> 00:55:40,409
- You can't stop here.
- I can't help it. I got a flat.

813
00:55:40,485 --> 00:55:43,511
- Give me a hand with it, will you?
- Sure, lady. Sure.

814
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:47,251
And which one of these cons
will I give my gun to hold for me?

815
00:55:47,325 --> 00:55:48,587
Ain't I dumb?

816
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,184
Well, I tell you what.
Let a couple of your boys do it.

817
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:53,059
I'll take the wheel barrow. Follow me.

818
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:55,895
- It's not according to regulations, lady.
- Neither is a flat tire.

819
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:59,368
Come on. You wouldn't have a girl spend
the night out here alone, would you?

820
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:02,065
All right. I guess we can fix you up.

821
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:06,133
Hey! You two. Over here and change tires.

822
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,270
- Sure, we'll do it.
- Make it snappy.

823
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:10,871
Thanks, Captain. This is swell of you.

824
00:56:10,948 --> 00:56:13,416
If I was late again tonight,
it would have cost me my job.

825
00:56:13,484 --> 00:56:16,419
That's all right.
Just switch off your motor.

826
00:56:18,956 --> 00:56:20,947
I'll take the key, lady.

827
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:26,492
- Where are the tools?
- Over there.

828
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:29,727
Unlock the tire and the tools,
will you, Captain?

829
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:54,786
- Thanks. This is swell of you.
- That's all right, lady.

830
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:58,260
- How long will this camp be here?
- Till this road's finished.

831
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:01,321
- Well, do they get paid for this?
- Sure they get paid for it.

832
00:57:01,399 --> 00:57:03,230
They pay for their own food,
clothing and tobacco.

833
00:57:03,301 --> 00:57:05,166
The rest is credited to their account
at the prison.

834
00:57:05,236 --> 00:57:06,760
They get it when they go free.

835
00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:08,896
Do all the prisoners get a chance
to make this road gang?

836
00:57:08,973 --> 00:57:12,932
No. Only the short-termers
and those that rate it with good behavior.

837
00:57:33,497 --> 00:57:37,661
- Now can I give the boys anything?
- No charge, lady. This one's on the State.

838
00:57:38,002 --> 00:57:40,527
- What's going on here?
- Please, don't bawl him out, mister.

839
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:42,470
He let these two boys
change a flat tire for me.

840
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,939
It was swell of him. I couldn't have...

841
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:45,839
Stick 'em up, Druggin!
Get behind the wheel, Red.

842
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,434
- Turn around!
- Help!

843
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:51,804
Come on, Red!
Get in the track and move it, will you?

844
00:57:58,122 --> 00:58:00,147
Stop shooting.
They've got Druggin in that car.

845
00:58:00,224 --> 00:58:03,421
Okay. Get back there. Get back there.
Come on, get back there!

846
00:58:03,494 --> 00:58:04,825
Stay back.

847
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:18,073
Ain't this swell?

848
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:20,042
- Now, listen, Sailor.
- Yeah, keep him covered.

849
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:22,841
I've been waiting for years
to get my hands on you, you mug.

850
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:25,711
Don't do that, Sailor. Listen.
I'm the one that got you the chance!

851
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:28,217
- I got you on the road gang.
- Well, ain't that swell?

852
00:58:28,286 --> 00:58:30,584
- Now, ain't you glad you did it?
- Listen, I'm your friend!

853
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:34,284
- Yeah, a pal.
- No, don't! Don't, Sailor!

854
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:37,293
Don't do that, Sailor! Sailor! No!

855
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:41,124
- Where are the clothes?
- Right at your feet.

856
00:58:41,198 --> 00:58:43,996
Oh, yeah. Here you are, Red.

857
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:45,996
A break in the road gang.

858
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,230
- Who were they?
- We don't know yet.

859
00:58:47,305 --> 00:58:48,932
We haven't got the count.
They're headed east.

860
00:58:49,006 --> 00:58:52,339
A heavy touring car.
License number 2X8193.

861
00:58:58,516 --> 00:58:59,642
Call the Sheriff's office.

862
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:00,843
Two men escaped from the road gang!

863
00:59:00,918 --> 00:59:03,216
Notify all departments.
Big touring car, 2X8193.

864
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:05,084
And I'll be in the warden's office.

865
00:59:05,156 --> 00:59:06,248
Sheriff's office.

866
00:59:10,428 --> 00:59:13,693
Come on, Red! Step on it.
They're picking up on us.

867
00:59:24,308 --> 00:59:26,833
Try to get their gas tank or a tire.

868
00:59:42,593 --> 00:59:45,824
- How much gas did you put in?
- It was a full tank.

869
00:59:46,163 --> 00:59:47,528
The gauge shows empty.

870
00:59:47,598 --> 00:59:49,225
Calling all cars.

871
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,962
Two men escaped
from State Penitentiary road gang.

872
00:59:52,036 --> 00:59:53,731
Headed east in touring car.

873
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:08,876
- Here comes a car. Let's grab it.
- Okay. Hang on.

874
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,781
Leave your motor running.
Come on, get outside.

875
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:16,224
You, too, sister. Hurry it up!

876
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:19,387
Ditch the car up the road.
We'll see you later.

877
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:36,904
Come on, Red. Knock on it, will you?

878
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:24,654
Beat this train, Red, and we're all set.

879
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,465
Sailor? Sailor?

880
01:02:27,725 --> 01:02:29,090
This one's dead, Sheriff.

881
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:37,263
But how did Hansen get on the road gang?

882
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:41,600
I don't know and there's not much chance
of finding out now with Druggin dead.

883
01:02:44,441 --> 01:02:45,499
Yes?

884
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:49,369
- It's for you, Jameson.
- Oh, thanks.

885
01:02:50,548 --> 01:02:51,742
Hello?

886
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:58,278
Thank you.

887
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:02,855
Well, they found the car wrecked
and Hansen's dead.

888
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:05,361
- What about Kennedy?
- He got away.

889
01:03:05,896 --> 01:03:08,660
And you asked the parole board
to judge your plans by results.

890
01:03:08,732 --> 01:03:12,395
You haven't got much chance now, Steve.
It'll be proof your judgment's wrong.

891
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:14,198
Yeah, but Hansen's break
proves something else.

892
01:03:14,271 --> 01:03:16,739
It proved I was right about
keeping that other crowd off the list.

893
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:19,071
Maybe, but they'll still hold Kennedy
against you.

894
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:21,703
And he was gonna be
your shining example.

895
01:03:21,779 --> 01:03:24,339
You know, it's a funny thing.
I can't figure that out.

896
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,213
Now, if this happened yesterday,
he wouldn't have made that break

897
01:03:27,284 --> 01:03:29,411
even if somebody
left the gates open for him.

898
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:32,080
I don't know, Steve.
When a man's on the level,

899
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:34,647
he doesn't repay kindness
by sticking a knife in your back.

900
01:03:34,725 --> 01:03:36,625
I'm afraid, for once you guessed wrong.

901
01:03:36,694 --> 01:03:38,059
Well, I can settle that question.

902
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:40,096
- How?
- I'm going out and find him.

903
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:02,349
What's the idea waking me up...

904
01:04:04,722 --> 01:04:05,814
Red?

905
01:04:06,757 --> 01:04:08,657
- What are you doing here?
- Give me some.38s.

906
01:04:08,726 --> 01:04:11,456
You crazy? Coming to town!
Cops will be looking all over for you.

907
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:12,961
- You better get out of here.
- I will.

908
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:16,056
But I gotta plug a guy first.
Will you get me a box of slugs?

909
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:17,225
Sure.

910
01:04:17,935 --> 01:04:20,335
<i>Further bulletins
from the Press Radio Association</i>

911
01:04:20,404 --> 01:04:23,237
<i>concerning the escaped convict
will be announced as received.</i>

912
01:04:23,307 --> 01:04:26,572
<i>I will repeat the description
of Red Kennedy, who is still at large.</i>

913
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:29,010
<i>Twenty-five years old, 5'10"...</i>

914
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:45,725
- That's him?
- No. Too stocky. Kennedy's thin.

915
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:03,813
Steve, have you found out
anything about him?

916
01:05:04,715 --> 01:05:07,275
- You haven't seen him, have you?
- No.

917
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:12,186
I don't know where he is. I'm nearly crazy.

918
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:15,692
- What happened? What made him do it?
- I don't know.

919
01:05:15,759 --> 01:05:17,920
- You're sure he hasn't been here?
- No, Steve.

920
01:05:17,995 --> 01:05:19,758
Oh, I'd do anything to straighten this out.

921
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:23,095
If I could only find him and talk to him.
He must be mad.

922
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:24,566
When I talked to him he was happy.

923
01:05:24,635 --> 01:05:26,034
He was going straight and he meant it.

924
01:05:26,103 --> 01:05:28,162
They'll get him now
and he won't have another chance.

925
01:05:28,238 --> 01:05:30,798
- What reason did he have?
- I don't know. I can't figure it out.

926
01:05:30,874 --> 01:05:32,136
- I'll tell you, copper.
- Joe!

927
01:05:32,209 --> 01:05:33,574
Shut up! You been giving me favors

928
01:05:33,644 --> 01:05:35,111
so you could kick her around in the gutter.

929
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:37,170
Thought you had her in a swell spot
with me locked up.

930
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:39,215
Thought it was safe for you to come here.

931
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:40,875
Well, here's your second payoff.

932
01:05:40,951 --> 01:05:42,441
- Joe, don't!
- You keep out of it.

933
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:44,009
That's a lie, Red.

934
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:45,885
You're talking out of your head.
Give me that gun!

935
01:05:45,956 --> 01:05:47,947
Yeah, and all the slugs with it.

936
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:51,688
Joe! Don't! You can't!
Please, listen to me.

937
01:05:51,762 --> 01:05:54,492
We're in love!
We've been in love ever since we met.

938
01:05:54,565 --> 01:05:56,590
You've got to believe me.

939
01:05:56,867 --> 01:05:59,563
- Steve, you're hurt!
- No, I'm all right.

940
01:06:00,504 --> 01:06:02,836
Can't you understand?
He tried to help you.

941
01:06:02,906 --> 01:06:04,134
He did everything he could.

942
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,176
He even risked his job
trying to make a man out of you

943
01:06:06,243 --> 01:06:08,006
and you pay him back by trying to kill him.

944
01:06:08,078 --> 01:06:10,308
Sailor told you all these lies, huh?

945
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,473
- Or Druggin?
- Yeah.

946
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:15,444
Well, Red, I gave you credit
for having more sense than that.

947
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,544
Taking the word of a lot of rats
against your sister.

948
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:19,589
Did it ever occur to you
that Druggin framed this break

949
01:06:19,656 --> 01:06:22,489
to ruin my chances
of doing anything at the prison?

950
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,288
- Coppers?
- Wait a minute. Let us handle this.

951
01:06:24,361 --> 01:06:26,329
Come on, Joe. Quick, in here.

952
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:31,530
- Steve, you are hurt.
- No, I'm all right.

953
01:06:42,412 --> 01:06:44,107
- What is it, boys?
- We heard some shots.

954
01:06:44,181 --> 01:06:46,547
We're on special patrol
to look for Kennedy, a con that broke...

955
01:06:46,617 --> 01:06:48,915
That's what I'm here for, too.
But there weren't any shots.

956
01:06:48,986 --> 01:06:50,920
It must've been a backfire in the alley
or something.

957
01:06:50,988 --> 01:06:54,116
Kennedy's not here.
I'll be responsible for this end of it.

958
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:55,715
And I want him a lot more than you.

959
01:06:55,793 --> 01:06:58,421
I'm Jameson, captain of the yards,
San Quentin.

960
01:06:58,495 --> 01:07:00,292
All right, Captain.

961
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,828
- What'll we do?
- I want to talk to Red.

962
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:22,581
Well, May, he's on his own.

963
01:07:33,297 --> 01:07:34,423
Halt!

964
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:04,121
- Hey, give me a lift, will you?
- Sure. Bet you your life.

965
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:05,855
- Jump in.
- Thanks.

966
01:08:11,835 --> 01:08:15,999
- It's pretty lonesome walking at
night, eh? - Yeah, pretty lonesome.

967
01:08:16,907 --> 01:08:18,465
My car broke down.

968
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:20,100
Where you go?

969
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:24,180
Drop me at San Quentin crossroads.

970
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:27,846
Sure. That's a long walk.

971
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:30,245
Yeah.

972
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:36,482
- You look pretty tired, huh?
- Yeah.

973
01:08:37,561 --> 01:08:40,496
Why don't you stay in your car
till morning?

974
01:08:41,164 --> 01:08:43,291
Got to get where I'm going.

975
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:44,457
Oh.

976
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:07,013
Halt! Who's there?

977
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:10,193
- Who is it?
- Kennedy!

978
01:09:16,366 --> 01:09:17,924
Get the doctor.

979
01:09:20,237 --> 01:09:23,001
It's no use. I don't need him.

980
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:26,401
Tell...

981
01:09:26,843 --> 01:09:30,006
Tell Jameson I come back.

982
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:32,940
Tell...

983
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:35,942
Tell the cons to play ball with him.

984
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:38,479
He's...

985
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:41,748
He's a swell...
