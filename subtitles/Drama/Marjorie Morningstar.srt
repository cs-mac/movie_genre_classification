1
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:06,978
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr.
Morgenstern's apartment.

2
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,480
Is he expecting you?

3
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:11,149
He's my nephew on
his wife's side.

4
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,413
The people who live here,
must be very tired.

5
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:27,832
They sit down when
they ride an elevator?

6
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:28,958
Eighteen.

7
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,547
Eighteen - D.

8
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:36,049
Thank you, young man.

9
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:03,326
<i>Arnold, what are you doing?
We'll be late for temple.</i>

10
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:04,869
<i>Come on, here.
Straighten your tie.</i>

11
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:09,874
<i>Straighten my tie, polish my shoes,
brush my coat. Rose, please, let me alone.</i>

12
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,794
<i>Oh, you stop complaining. What's the matter with you?</i>

13
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,338
<i>Look, the few dollars
I don't care about.</i>

14
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:19,217
<i>But why can't we have just a nice quiet
bar mitzvah with just the family?</i>

15
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,512
<i>Arnold, your son is 13
only once in his life.</i>

16
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:26,349
<i>Alright, but an ordinary bar
mitzvah isn't good enough.</i>

17
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,185
<i>No. Rose Morgenstern has
to have a confirmation</i>

18
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,688
<i>with hundreds of people
I never saw before.</i>

19
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,108
<i>Ever since we've moved from the Bronx,
I don't know what's come of me.</i>

20
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,578
Uncle Samson!
Come in, come in.

21
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:47,704
Hello Arnold.

22
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:53,126
Welcome to the new home.
How are you Uncle?

23
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:57,422
Thank God as you see me. Health
is everything, the rest is mud.

24
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,259
Have some grapes, Uncle.

25
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,887
Thank you, I'm
having some grapes.

26
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,766
It's a beautiful place.
Beautiful, Arnold.

27
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:13,897
I always told your papa, of all the boys,
you would be the one we'd all be proud of.

28
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,733
- Uncle?
- Hello, Rose!

29
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,903
Where have you been keeping yourself?
Are you working?

30
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:22,030
It's a slow season
for night watchmen.

31
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,907
Never mind, Uncle. I'll
find you something.

32
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:27,785
So don't worry. As long as I've got
good relatives, I'll always eat.

33
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,829
Always, Uncle.

34
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,874
Family. That's the important thing.

35
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,710
A man has a family, he's
a multi-millionaire.

36
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:36,794
Is that you Uncle Samson.

37
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,922
The Bar Mitzvah boy!

38
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:40,340
Hello, Uncle Samson!

39
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:43,426
Seth I brought you this,
just for the occasion.

40
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:48,306
It's a Tabas. Now that
you are 13 years old and

41
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:52,268
a man in the eyes of God.
You can pray in it.

42
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,730
Grow up to the Lord.

43
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,233
To marriage, and to good deeds.

44
00:04:58,316 --> 00:04:59,817
Thank you, Uncle Samson.

45
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,570
No, no, no. You are
no longer a boy.

46
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:04,864
We shake hands, like men.

47
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:09,577
Arnold, that double-breasted blue suit.
That would look good on Uncle.

48
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:10,453
Sure.

49
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:13,289
What's the matter with this suit you gave me last year?
It's fine.

50
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:16,960
Come, Uncle Samson. I've already
had it let out for you.

51
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:19,128
- Where's Marjorie?
- Dressing.

52
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,964
Arnold, wait till you see her
new outfit, it's stunning.

53
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,510
What, another new outfit? That's
what I keep telling you, Rose.

54
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,845
I do a little magic
with a fountain pen...

55
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,889
Oh stop, you know you love it.

56
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:34,477
Marjorie!

57
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:40,191
Oh, Marjorie, for heaven's sake,
aren't you dressed yet?

58
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,818
I'm sorry Mother, I overslept.

59
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:45,613
Well it's no wonder, considering
what time you got in last night.

60
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:46,948
Who were you with?

61
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:48,533
Oh, Sandy!

62
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:51,077
Ah!
That's nice.

63
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:53,955
- Where did you go?
- We went to the theater.

64
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,625
Theater? Who are you today?
Lady Macbeth,

65
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,710
or Scarlet O'Hara?

66
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:04,716
- What time did you come home?
- Mother, it wasn't that late.

67
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:08,010
If it were anybody else except
a lovely boy like,

68
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:10,430
Sandy Lamm, believe me your father
would hear about this.

69
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:13,558
You think Sandy's just great don't you?

70
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,019
From a mothers
viewpoint, he's a catch.

71
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,188
It isn't every boy whose father
owns a big department store.

72
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:25,361
- I know, but, do you like him?
- He's a little young for me.

73
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:29,741
Did something happen between
you last night?

74
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:32,785
Oh Mother, one doesn't discuss
those things with people.

75
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,038
I'm not people, I'm your Mother.

76
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,000
What's come over you lately?
You act so... so, oh, I don't know.

77
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,169
I'm 13. I'm growing up.

78
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,588
So you feel you should do
things that grown ups do, huh?

79
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:45,548
Is that wrong?

80
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:48,926
It depends upon how you
want to grow up.

81
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,971
What did happen last night?

82
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:56,017
He wanted to make love to me.

83
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:59,145
He didn't.

84
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,572
- What do I do about it?
- About what, darling?

85
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:16,579
Oh, about the way I feel sometimes.

86
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:20,708
Take those feelings.
Put them in the bank.

87
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,879
Save them for the man who will appreciate
and love you for them after you marry him.

88
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:27,090
What if I never meet him?

89
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:28,841
I met your father.

90
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,512
Maybe I'll never be in love.

91
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:36,057
Maybe I'm just not the type
of person that falls in love.

92
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:38,351
Listen to the old lady of 18.

93
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:41,354
Were you in love with Papa,
when you married him?

94
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:45,942
When I met your father, I, I was
in love with Rudolph Valentino.

95
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,154
Now, hurry up and get dressed,
before your brother is 14.

96
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:59,414
Perfect! The best fit I
ever had in the family.

97
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:02,500
Either you're getting bigger,
Arnold, or I'm getting smaller.

98
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:06,254
I told you, I already had it let out for
you. Wear it in good health, Uncle.

99
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:07,839
Marjorie!

100
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:08,923
She'll be ready in a second.

101
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,801
I'm all ready, Papa.
Oh, Uncle Samson.

102
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:12,885
Marjorie!

103
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,013
See, our Marjorie is
becoming something. A lady.

104
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:18,683
A few years ago, you
sat on my knee.

105
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:21,185
Now you look like a
regular movie star.

106
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,729
Where's my candy bar?

107
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,188
Always a candy bar.

108
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:26,482
No candy bars, no
Uncle Samson, right?

109
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:27,233
Right Uncle!

110
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,568
I didn't bring one.

111
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,405
What you want now darling, the Uncle
can't bring you in the pocket.

112
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:33,948
My goodness!
Come on! Let's go.

113
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:35,575
Come, Samson!

114
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:41,289
- Is my hat on ok, Mom?
- Yes honey, it looks fine.

115
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,166
I told you white would
look good with this suit.

116
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,586
Hurry up, we're going to be late.

117
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:57,114
<i>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.</i>

118
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,745
O happy dagger, this is thy sheath.

119
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:09,126
There rust, and let me die.

120
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:13,756
Splendid, splendid, very good indeed.

121
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:17,009
Now, we'll do the Friar Laurence
scene in a few minutes.

122
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:22,056
You were tremendous,
absolutely tremendous.

123
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,349
But did you think it
really went alright?

124
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:24,851
I mean, are you sure?

125
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:28,479
Well, of course I'm sure!
Oh, honey, you're a great actress.

126
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,607
You know, one day I'm going to be
paying money to see you on Broadway!

127
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,777
And I can say, "I was the first
one that ever encouraged her".

128
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:36,904
Me, Marsha Zelenko!

129
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,407
Hey, what's eating you anyway?

130
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:40,575
Nothing.

131
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:44,871
Come on honey, this is Marsha,
the girl with X-ray eyes, spill it!

132
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:47,540
Well, I don't know, Marsha.

133
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,209
It's kind of a lot of things.

134
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:54,171
I mean sometimes, I think that I can act.
You know?

135
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:58,301
And other times, I don't feel
that I have any talent at all,

136
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:01,721
and the best thing to do is to just
get married to Sandy Lamm...

137
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,890
Oh! Forget Sandy Lamm...

138
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:07,226
Well, Lamm's is alright, but have
you ever shopped at Macy's?

139
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:09,395
Hey, what do you
see in him anyway?

140
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:13,149
- Well, Sandy's very sweet.
- Are you going away this summer?

141
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,485
Well, Mother is planning on all
of us going away with the Lamms.

142
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:17,570
Don't go!

143
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:18,779
Why not?

144
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:21,616
Because you've got to see
what life is really like.

145
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:25,870
Look, I got a job as a swimming
instructor at a camp for little girls.

146
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,581
Right across from a camp with big boys.

147
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:32,460
Marjorie! How would you like
to be Dramatic Counselor?

148
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:39,258
- Well, I don't know Marsha.
- What am I going to do with you?

149
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,844
Honestly, you're sitting on oil
land and you don't know it.

150
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:45,973
Look by the time you're 21, you're going
to be beating off Sandy Lamms with a club.

151
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:50,144
<i>Alright now, everyone ready
on stage right away.</i>

152
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:52,313
Sandy Lamm!

153
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:57,652
- Oh, Marjorie...
- Sandy, please!

154
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,909
- What is that now?
- Arnold, go to sleep.

155
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:08,788
- But the bell.
- Sandy is leaning on it.

156
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:12,875
- Marjorie...
- Sandy, please.

157
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,794
What's wrong with you anyway?

158
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:19,006
- What are you frigid or something?
- It's wrong to go on like this.

159
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:23,427
It's not wrong. It's a
biological necessity.

160
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:26,389
Sandy, You know it's getting
awfully late, and I think...

161
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,015
Marjorie, wait a minute.

162
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:37,066
Hasn't he got a home?

163
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:43,364
- It's 2 O'clock in the morning already.
- Arnold, stop worrying.

164
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,618
I don't know. Every time she
goes out it's the same thing.

165
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,662
What do they do out
there in the hallway?

166
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:52,331
Look, Marjorie can
take care of herself.

167
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:53,499
Is that so?

168
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,835
Last week she told
me all about sex.

169
00:12:56,544 --> 00:13:01,716
Studied it in Hygiene, she said. Hmm!
Knows the whole business like a doctor.

170
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:08,347
She talked about chromosomes, tubes and
eggs. The male this and the female that.

171
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:10,266
I tell you the truth,
I was embarrassed.

172
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:12,727
What is he doing out there?

173
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:16,230
Right now, he's probably
asking her to marry him.

174
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:19,650
Oh, it's beautiful.
But Sandy, really...

175
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:22,403
It doesn't have to be next
month, or next year even.

176
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,323
Gosh, it cost a fortune.

177
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:30,286
Well it sometimes helps to have a
department store in the family.

178
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:31,620
Go ahead, put it on.

179
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:34,874
I can't.

180
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,751
It only means we're engaged.

181
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,002
But...

182
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,380
I don't know if I want to be engaged.

183
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,841
Well for Pete's sake,
what do you want?

184
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,843
I'd like to know where I stand Marjorie.

185
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,803
We've been going together for 6 months.

186
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:50,556
Let me think it over.

187
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,641
What's there to think over?

188
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,477
We're in love aren't we?

189
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,103
Huh?

190
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,440
I'll just have to think about it, that's all.

191
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,443
Ok, Sandy?

192
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:04,153
Good night.

193
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:23,089
Where's the ring?
Let me see the ring.

194
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,591
What...? How did you know?

195
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:29,011
Sandy's mother called me and told me.
Such a lovely woman.

196
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:31,138
What a summer we're all
gonna have together.

197
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,100
Two families of the
engaged couple.

198
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:37,144
Mother. It's all
happening so fast.

199
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,563
Everybody is rushing me.

200
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:41,649
Well, I'm not rushing you.

201
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,152
I do not even know if I'm
in love with Sandy.

202
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:48,948
And you'll have plenty of time to make up
your mind. You'll be with him all summer.

203
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:53,869
That's just it. I don't
think I should be with him.

204
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,039
- I should be alone.
- Alone?

205
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:00,209
What, what is this?
Where would you go?

206
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,544
Oh! I...

207
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,755
I could take a job.

208
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,883
A job! What kind of a job!

209
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:10,719
Dramatic Counselor at a girls camp.

210
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:15,891
Where is all this coming from?
That Marsha Zelenko!

211
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:19,145
What difference does
that make, Mother?

212
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:23,524
I have to do some thinking, before
I suddenly find myself married.

213
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,401
Settled down with children.

214
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:29,780
And what is so terrible about that?
Some day you're gonna have to do it.

215
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:36,370
Mama, I've gotta go away.
Please help me!

216
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,414
Please!

217
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:46,881
Well... if that's what you want.

218
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,677
Good night.

219
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,441
What's the matter, Rose.
You look worried.

220
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,361
There's something to worry about.

221
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:10,905
What?

222
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,199
Marjorie.

223
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,724
Don't forget. I'll meet you
tonight, after the kids are in bed.

224
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:41,769
Shhht!

225
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:00,204
- Marsha...
- Hmmm?

226
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,414
- No. I can do it.
- What?

227
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,793
I just don't feel right about it.

228
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:11,006
Look, I've been sneaking across that
lake every night for the past 3 weeks.

229
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:13,634
Look at me. I'm as fat
and as sassy as ever.

230
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:16,971
But it's against the rules.
Supposing Clambert caught us?

231
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,764
What would we do then?

232
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,476
Look, how are we ever going
to meet anybody here.

233
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:26,272
Why right across the lake at South
Wind, there's a thousand guys.

234
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,440
Oh!

235
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:30,776
Look at this.

236
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,569
What have we here?

237
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:35,572
Bunny costumes. How sweet.

238
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,242
All right girls,
we all ready?

239
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,994
Yes, Miss Morgenstern.

240
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:24,163
Head toward that cove. We'll beach the
canoe and change these horrible duds.

241
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:26,999
You told me this was only a 10 minute trip.

242
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,542
I'm freezing.

243
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:31,086
Oh my honey bunch. You're
actually having beginners luck.

244
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,380
The lake's warm.

245
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,557
Voila!

246
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:45,225
South Wind.

247
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:50,981
Oh! It's fabulous!

248
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:52,649
Not a sound now.

249
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,026
Why?

250
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,278
They don't like non-paying guests.

251
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:57,905
Do you want to get arrested?

252
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,448
- Arrested!?
- Shh!

253
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:17,840
Now then, remember, if we run into Mr.
Greech, just

254
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:20,052
walk right by as though
you're a paying guest.

255
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:22,304
- There's thousands of them.
- Who's Mr. Greech?

256
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:25,516
Satan. In white knickers
and a two foot flashlight.

257
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:26,558
He's the owner.

258
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:31,021
He's been known to chop up a strange
canoe with his bare hands and burn it.

259
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,440
Now hurry up and let's
change our clothes.

260
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,485
Come on, I've got a date
with one of the musicians.

261
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:40,489
Ok, sugarbun.

262
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:41,240
We're safe now.

263
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:47,413
Marjorie, you're about to see show business.
Real show business.

264
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:07,182
Hold it!

265
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,310
Karen, ah...

266
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:13,522
You're throwing everything
around like a burlesque queen.

267
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,399
That's Noel Airman.

268
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:17,776
Oh!

269
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:19,278
It isn't this.

270
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:25,284
Alright, wise guys...

271
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:26,952
It's this.

272
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,629
You see what I mean?
Be a Cat!

273
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:40,215
Now with Bob, with you
it's just the opposite.

274
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:41,633
<i>Let me show you what I mean. Do you mind?</i>

275
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,051
<i>No, of course not.</i>

276
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:44,678
He's terribly handsome.

277
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:48,015
Careful honey, he effects young girls
the way whiskey hits an Indian.

278
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,559
You make him sound dangerous.

279
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:53,729
Noel Airman is the enemy of every
mother in greater New York.

280
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,313
Come on.

281
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,148
I wanna try the light cues too.

282
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,773
Oh sure.

283
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:57,900
Kill 5 and 6.

284
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:00,777
And boys don't rush with me. Take it easy, huh?

285
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:22,859
Yes!

286
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,403
You're a good girl.

287
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,031
- Musicians, you can wrap it up.
- Noel, I take it you're right. You're always right.

288
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:31,201
- Hi ya Marge!
- Hi Carlos!

289
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:34,663
This is my friend Marjorie.
A siren, from across the lake.

290
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:37,124
Hi ya kid. Care to join us for a drink?

291
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,750
Oh, no thank you.

292
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,712
- May I stay here and watch?
- Why sure, be my guest.

293
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,256
Well, you're on your own now kid.
Live it up.

294
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:47,425
But remember, meet me back at the
canoe at 12 O'clock sharp, Ok?

295
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:47,801
Ok.

296
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:52,264
- Hey! What about my job?
- I'm promoting it honey, you know that.,

297
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:53,890
I'd never let you down.

298
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:55,892
- <i>Wally, you back there?</i>
- <i>Yeah Noel.</i>

299
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,561
<i>Ok, keep the red.</i>

300
00:22:57,936 --> 00:22:59,271
<i>Bring up the ambers.</i>

301
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:02,107
Alright, dim down the lavenders.

302
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,400
Bring up number 4.

303
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:07,362
<i>Wally, number 4!
What are you doing?</i>

304
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,781
Good.
Quiet back there!

305
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:18,206
Who are you?

306
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,959
Mr. Airman, I'm terribly sorry.

307
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:22,919
Please forgive me.

308
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:25,297
Are you a guest? I don't allow
guests in here during rehearsal.

309
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,465
No.

310
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:29,217
My name is Morjorie Morgenstern.

311
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:32,763
I'm Dramatic Counselor at
Camp Tamarack.

312
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,181
Ahh...

313
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:36,600
A colleague!

314
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,605
Well, you are entitled to all
the courtesies of the profession.

315
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:43,732
Please sit down.

316
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:45,901
Thank you.

317
00:23:59,623 --> 00:24:01,333
What are you doing to yourself?

318
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,710
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Wally!

319
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,712
Get the first aid. We got a casualty.

320
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:07,214
<i>Coming up, Noel.</i>

321
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,924
I can't imagine why I did that.

322
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,425
Well, you're gonna live.

323
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,221
What show are you doing at
Camp Tamarack this week?

324
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:16,473
"Uncle Wiggly".

325
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,643
Strong meat, huh?

326
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:21,645
Dr. Rocket, reporting
to surgery.

327
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:23,355
Marjorie, this? Wally.

328
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,441
Wally knows about medicine as
doctoring his own bad sketches.

329
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:28,193
Here, fix up her hand, Wally.

330
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,737
And hold it a while, will ya,
so I can get through.

331
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,239
Sure, Noel.

332
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,992
Don't worry, Marjorie,
I never lost a patient.

333
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,078
It's really nothing.

334
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:42,124
Hold still.

335
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:48,755
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:50,841
For what?

337
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:54,094
I don't know.

338
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:57,472
I've always prided myself
on brittle dialogue.

339
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:00,642
All I can think of to say right now is...

340
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:03,520
you're the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

341
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:21,830
What a beautiful song.

342
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:25,375
It's from Princess Jones. A
show he's writing for Broadway.

343
00:25:58,492 --> 00:25:59,785
Great isn't he?

344
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:02,829
There's no such person
for heaven's sakes.

345
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:05,081
What else does he do?

346
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:10,003
Well, lets see, he knows opera and history,
literature, philosophy, speaks foreign

347
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:14,382
languages, writes songs with his left hand.
He's the greatest dancer living.

348
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:17,511
And I'm his assistant.

349
00:26:58,844 --> 00:26:59,845
Bravo!

350
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:03,932
Well, back to the salt mines, let's go.

351
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:08,979
Oh, it must be wonderful
to be a part of the theater.

352
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:11,565
And to work so closely
to a man like that.

353
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:12,899
Well, it has its moments.

354
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:15,360
Say, would you like to sit
in for this run through?

355
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:19,197
Oh my gosh, it's 12 o'clock.
I've gotta run.

356
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,074
Wait a minute, drop a glass
slipper of something.

357
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:24,828
- Goodbye, Wally. Thanks for the Coke.
- Sure.

358
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,791
- It was brilliant.
- Thank you.

359
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,544
Charlie, make it a
double, will you please?

360
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:33,879
Sure, Mr. Airman.

361
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,673
You must get tired of hearing
me play Princess Jones.

362
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:38,091
It's good music.

363
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,554
How many years you been
coming up here, Charlie?

364
00:27:42,888 --> 00:27:44,306
It's my fifth summer.

365
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,475
Why do you keep coming back?

366
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:51,438
In town I'm a waiter.
Here, I'm the head bartender.

367
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:54,566
Well, you got a pretty good excuse.
What's mine?

368
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:57,611
You? You're Mr. "South Wind".

369
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,992
Well, I'm making a little
promise to myself.

370
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:06,536
Don't expect me back next year.

371
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:10,248
Ha! You said that
last year, Mr. Airman.

372
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:16,713
Marsha!

373
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:23,720
Marsha!

374
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:26,598
Marsha...

375
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:32,312
I thought as much.
Camp Tamarack eh?

376
00:28:32,437 --> 00:28:34,773
- Please, Mr. Greech!
- Come on!

377
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,150
Don't do you any
good whining, Miss.

378
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:39,653
I'm putting an end to
this, once and for all.

379
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:42,572
Even if I have to bring Klabber
her, with his pajamas on.

380
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:43,782
Please Mr. Greech!

381
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:45,200
If you just listen.

382
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:47,911
Busting into this place.
It's private property.

383
00:28:48,078 --> 00:28:49,621
What's all this?

384
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,374
I caught her red-handed,
Noel, another trespasser.

385
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:56,086
Aw, come on, Max. Turn off the
two-way wrist radio will you?

386
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:58,463
You'll give the young lady a bruise,
as well as a lawsuit.

387
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:01,091
- Lawsuit?
- She happens to be my guest.

388
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:05,178
There are people paying 50 bucks a day here.
Now look, Noel.

389
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,306
Let's not go inviting armies of little
girls over here, free of charge.

390
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:13,603
Greech, this little army of one was over
here to audition for a job on the staff.

391
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:14,396
Staff?

392
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,773
I'm up to my belly button in staff.

393
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:17,774
Half of Greenwich village...

394
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,944
You can always cut down
by one, any time you say.

395
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:22,445
<i>Who?</i>

396
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:23,780
Me.

397
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,657
Now wait a minute, Noel.

398
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:29,369
It isn't as bad as that. If you need her...

399
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:33,164
- then, you need her.
- Thanks Max.

400
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,583
You're a true patron of the arts.

401
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:40,922
- Mr. Airman...
- Ah, think nothing of it.

402
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:43,258
It's the very least I could do for a colleague.

403
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:45,593
Well, where's the enemy vessel?

404
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:48,096
- Oh, down there.
- Come on.

405
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,852
Mr. Airman, I'm terribly grateful and terribly embarrassed.

406
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:55,061
What?

407
00:29:55,478 --> 00:29:57,147
I mean, I am a trespasser.

408
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:59,816
Well, look, if you're worried about
my little white lie, forget it.

409
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:02,652
Greech gets away with murder.
And I do need help.

410
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:04,863
Oh, I wouldn't think of holding you to...

411
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,448
What's this, a sense of honor?

412
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:08,074
You wanna learn
theater, don't you?

413
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,870
You mean, you are
offering me a job?

414
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:13,580
I can't believe it.

415
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,290
Well, you won't be playing
Pygmalion of course.

416
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:16,249
Of course.

417
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,710
I suggest you think it over and let
me know at the end of the week.

418
00:30:19,461 --> 00:30:22,839
- Mr. Airman, I can't thank you enough.
- Nonsense. Come on, I'll give you a hand.

419
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:23,673
Oh!

420
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:28,428
Oh! I forgot Marsha.

421
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:31,806
I have to wait,
for my friend Marsha.

422
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:36,853
- Not Marsha Zeleko!
- Yes, went off with your piano player.

423
00:30:37,812 --> 00:30:40,523
I can't understand
what's keeping her.

424
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,442
You can't?

425
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:50,116
Wow! Well, I'll leave you to your vigil.
Good Night, Miss Morningstar.

426
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:52,869
Oh, the name is Morgenstern.

427
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:55,997
Yes I know.

428
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,628
Morningstar!

429
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:06,424
Marjorie Morningstar!

430
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:31,324
Oh gosh, he's so
wonderful isn't he?

431
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,036
You know what I think?
I think you gotta a case on him.

432
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:37,455
Oh, that's ridiculous.

433
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,042
Come on! Come on! Get in there!

434
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,963
<i>Girls.</i>

435
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:49,634
Now listen!

436
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:52,470
I am paying them to work around here.
Not to watch rehearsals.

437
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:53,303
Yes sir.

438
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:55,306
If want to see the
show, buy a ticket.

439
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:59,018
Everyone is sneaking
around, using up my paint.

440
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:03,148
Loveable Maxwell Greech,
Patron of Art.

441
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:05,150
- Did you say art?
- Aha!

442
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:10,696
Noel Airman, in "South Wind Follies".

443
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:13,032
No mention of Wally
Wronkin, the famous author!

444
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:16,369
And not a word about
Marjorie Morningstar.

445
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:19,497
Well, you'd better make tracks my boy,
before Greech catches you out here.

446
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,001
Marjorie as a personal favor, would
you please not call me "my boy"?

447
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:24,586
I'm sorry, Wally!

448
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:25,628
That's better.

449
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:28,298
Oh, I happen to be the
bearer of glad tidings.

450
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:31,968
There's a dance tonight. Why don't you
let me take you out of all this squalor.

451
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,097
Wally, I think by night fall, I'm going
to be much more interested in bed.

452
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:38,266
We can discuss that too.

453
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,601
Oh, Wally.

454
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,644
Marge, why won't you come with me?

455
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,149
You can't imagine, what capital you're
accumulating in heaven, by being nice to me.

456
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,150
Occasionally!

457
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:50,570
Wally I do like...

458
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,041
Uncle Samson!

459
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,752
Marjorie! How are you?

460
00:33:05,835 --> 00:33:07,795
- I'm fine.
- Big surprise, No?

461
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:11,841
Your Papa says to me, He says, "Samson,
you look tired. Take a vacation".

462
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:15,053
I said, "A vacation I've
had all of my life."

463
00:33:15,136 --> 00:33:18,556
What I need, is a job.
So your Papa fixed it.

464
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:22,101
You're working here?

465
00:33:22,393 --> 00:33:26,814
Yes, in the kitchen. For a change,
I work days, and I sleep nights.

466
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,944
Your Mama, didn't tell you?

467
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:32,737
Not a word.

468
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:36,241
So the uncle has to keep an eye on the baby, so what?

469
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:38,076
You think I'd spoil your fun?

470
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,914
You have a good time, Darling. What
do I know, I'm busy in the kitchen.

471
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:47,627
Oh, Uncle Samson. Forget about it.
You'd think Mom, was guarding Fort Knox.

472
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:53,007
Well, Marjorie. To a mother it's
more important than Fort Knox.

473
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,552
- I'll see you later.
- Ok.

474
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:17,407
Hold it!

475
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:21,452
You can't do that bit again. They'll
be shouting the punchlines at you.

476
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,871
Ok, Chief. I got a million of 'em.

477
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:25,623
How about the hotel bit?

478
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:26,332
Try it.

479
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:29,544
Good, give me a girl to work with. A nice warm body?

480
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,340
Ok. Marjorie, get up there.

481
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:35,842
Go on.

482
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:44,809
Chief, I can't work with them,
when they're all bundled up.

483
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:00,491
Alright, let's go. Come on.

484
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:05,705
<i>Oh, here we are at the hotel at last!</i>

485
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:13,713
Hello?

486
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:15,131
Do I want what?

487
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:16,215
Ice water?

488
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:20,136
Does he have a wrong number.

489
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:26,392
I'm sorry, Marjorie. You're out.

490
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:29,187
<i>Uh, Karen. Take over.</i>

491
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:31,105
Tough luck kiddo.

492
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:34,692
Mr. Airman, please give
me another chance.

493
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:36,861
I can do it right. I know I can.

494
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,072
Go on back there and wait for me.
I wanna talk to you.

495
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,114
Go on.

496
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,033
Alright, let's go.

497
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,660
You were a little rough on the kid, weren't you?

498
00:35:44,952 --> 00:35:45,953
Was I?

499
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:48,373
She's been hanging around for
weeks, waiting for this chance,

500
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,999
You could have let her
down a little easier.

501
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,377
Wally, get ready for your cue, will you?

502
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:12,563
Now, look. The reason I took you out of
that skit is because it just wasn't funny.

503
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:15,108
You're much too young and wholesome.

504
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,151
It just wasn't right with you doing it.

505
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:20,238
What am I supposed to
be doing here then?

506
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,115
When you gave me this job,

507
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:25,743
you told me, that I was going to
be able to learn the theater.

508
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:29,705
All I've done since I've been
here is sweep floors, and

509
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,499
and paint scenery.

510
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:33,459
I've been here a month,

511
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,504
you don't even know I alive.

512
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:38,256
Oh no, Marjorie. That's
where you're wrong.

513
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:41,592
I've noticed you, from the
first minute you came.

514
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:46,180
You don't belong here, Marjorie.

515
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:48,224
Why don't you go home?

516
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,600
Go home?

517
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:52,270
Why?

518
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:55,690
Because if you stay, you can get
into a whole lot of trouble.

519
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,277
What kind of trouble?

520
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,621
That kind of trouble.

521
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:13,541
Noel!

522
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,087
Noel, Paul wants to know if that
skit's alright for tonight.

523
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:22,383
Wally, you wanted more time to
your writing. Well you got it.

524
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:24,427
What do you mean?

525
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,346
I'm breaking in Marjorie to
work with me back stage.

526
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,140
Marjorie?

527
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,933
If she wants the job.

528
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:33,186
Look, Noel. I don't really
need a replacement.

529
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:35,480
I can do the lights, and
the props and write too.

530
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,023
I want the job.

531
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,650
Call a break, Wally.
Everybody back in an hour..

532
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:45,615
Would you care to have lunch with me?

533
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:48,868
I'd love to.

534
00:37:58,085 --> 00:38:01,047
Wally, you've got work to do.

535
00:38:27,448 --> 00:38:28,950
- Marjorie!
- Huh?

536
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,035
- How did you do it?
- Do what?

537
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:33,079
Harpoon Moby Dick?

538
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:36,165
- Oh, Marsha, for Pete's sake!
- What's your secret?

539
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,293
Spare no details, and don't
worry about shocking me.

540
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:41,546
What's going on
between you and Noel?

541
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:43,214
Nothing's going on.

542
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,425
You know, I believe you?

543
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:49,470
Oh, Marsha, I've gotta get this
stuff ready for the fiesta.

544
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,598
Would you mind if I give you one tiny piece of advice?

545
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,141
Promise not to sock me?

546
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:55,685
Alright, what is it?

547
00:38:55,851 --> 00:38:58,729
Just this. If he ever
does get you cornered in

548
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,399
that rustic little love
nest of his one evening...

549
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:05,861
Don't bite and scratch too hard.
He's not used to such struggling.

550
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:08,406
Oh Marsha, that mind of yours.

551
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:11,492
Don't look so cross-eyed. It's
not a fate worse than death.

552
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:16,205
Listen. You take a poll of your
graduating class 10 years from now,

553
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:20,418
and just see how many of 'em clinched the
deal without giving away a few free samples.

554
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:24,130
There you go. Reacting
like a firecracker again.

555
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:28,718
- Well, pay no attention to me.
- I'm gradually learning not to.

556
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,803
You stick to your ideals sweetheart.

557
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:33,931
Lord knows mine have gotten
me exactly nowhere.

558
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:39,352
But... we'll compare notes, when we're old
and Grey and see who came nearer the mark.

559
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:40,896
- OK?
- OK!

560
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:04,045
A little more coffee, Doctor?

561
00:40:04,086 --> 00:40:06,881
Hmmm? No thanks, Samson.
I've had enough.

562
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:10,176
My Uncle is watching.

563
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:12,345
Samson won't mind, he likes me.

564
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,264
Please, Noel, not here.

565
00:40:16,182 --> 00:40:18,351
Come to my cabin tonight,
we'll have dinner together.

566
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,899
Your niece is a very pretty girl, Samson.

567
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:28,486
Better keep an eye on her. She'll grow up fast around here.

568
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:30,696
No matter what job I get, Doctor...

569
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:32,948
I'm always a night watchman.

570
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:41,207
Who is it?

571
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:42,833
- The waiter.
- Come in.

572
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,129
Would you chill the champagne, please?

573
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:48,214
Yes sir.

574
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:56,972
Well, Uncle Samson? I see
they promoted you to waiter.

575
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,225
Just for tonight.

576
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:02,478
And uh, just for me?

577
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:04,271
You are special.

578
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,702
The forks go on the left.

579
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,748
Excuse me.

580
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:30,172
When should I bring the dinner?

581
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:33,050
I have the feeling
you'll know when.

582
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,928
I'm not very experienced at this.

583
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:37,555
Oh, you're doing all right.

584
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:39,348
Thank you.

585
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:40,766
Thank you.

586
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:43,269
It's a pleasure to serve
such a gentleman.

587
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:45,938
Shall I open the champagne?

588
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:48,232
Not unless you want a drink.

589
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:51,444
Oh, Mr. Greech has a sign
in the kitchen, that

590
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:53,821
the help shouldn't
drink on the premises.

591
00:41:58,242 --> 00:41:59,994
I won't tell, if you won't.

592
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:07,585
- To your health.
- To your health.

593
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:16,260
Tell me Uncle Samson, how long
have you had this occupation?

594
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:18,846
This is the first time
it's been necessary.

595
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:23,099
Tell me, Mr. Airman, since
this is new for me.

596
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,019
What am I supposed to do now?

597
00:42:25,227 --> 00:42:27,938
Right about now, you should
be loading your shotgun.

598
00:42:29,523 --> 00:42:32,526
You know? You can be
a very nice fella.

599
00:42:33,194 --> 00:42:35,029
Nice fellas don't have much fun.

600
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:39,950
This fun. It's so important to you?

601
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:42,036
Very.

602
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:43,704
But for how long?

603
00:42:45,414 --> 00:42:47,583
Sometimes it lasts
the whole summer.

604
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:52,463
Some people want it to
last a whole lifetime.

605
00:42:55,216 --> 00:42:58,427
For me, a summer feels
like a lifetime.

606
00:43:00,012 --> 00:43:03,015
Then you've picked the wrong
person to have supper with.

607
00:43:05,935 --> 00:43:09,355
Maybe my guest won't show up. It's happened before, you know.

608
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:13,025
She'll be here. She's in love.

609
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,947
It's a pity you can't be.

610
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:20,115
Good night, Mr. Airman.

611
00:43:20,616 --> 00:43:22,117
Louie, will bring the dinner.

612
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:40,553
Come in.

613
00:43:45,808 --> 00:43:49,895
Well, here I am.

614
00:43:53,315 --> 00:43:55,568
Oh! Champagne!

615
00:43:56,402 --> 00:43:58,612
That, that's very nice.

616
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:06,704
Oh, that's a beautiful view.

617
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:10,958
This is really a lovely cabin.

618
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:14,712
I like it.

619
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:18,215
Can I take your coat?

620
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:23,387
No, it... No, ah, it is a little chilly.

621
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:28,726
Maybe you better call a cop.

622
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:30,853
A cop?

623
00:44:31,228 --> 00:44:32,104
What for?

624
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:35,524
Impairing the morals of a minor
would be the charge, no doubt.

625
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,610
Oh, cut it out.

626
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,661
No Marjorie, no really. This
was a mistake. I'm sorry.

627
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:51,749
I have no time for another
Shirley in my life.

628
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:53,500
Shirley?

629
00:44:53,584 --> 00:44:55,336
Yes, Shirley.

630
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:58,505
It's a trade name for the
respectable middle-class

631
00:44:58,547 --> 00:45:00,299
girl who likes to
play at being worldly.

632
00:45:01,508 --> 00:45:03,427
And that's your label for me?

633
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:06,180
Darling it's monogrammed
all over you,

634
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:08,974
the way parents sew caps
initials on a child.

635
00:45:09,183 --> 00:45:12,102
"Hands off", "Decent
girl", "Object matrimony".

636
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:15,272
I'm not saying your wrong,
and I'm right, Oh no.

637
00:45:15,522 --> 00:45:18,734
All I'm saying is that I haven't got a
chance without the little wedding ring.

638
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:22,363
And since I have no intention of
marrying you, or anyone like you,

639
00:45:23,238 --> 00:45:25,950
Well then, I haven't got a chance.

640
00:45:26,575 --> 00:45:29,620
You think I'm just a stupid
kid with a crush on you.

641
00:45:30,454 --> 00:45:31,288
Aren't you?

642
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:35,125
What if it's true?
You won't get me to do anything wrong.

643
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:40,547
Naturally not. Surely only hugs and
paws on the rigidly graduated scale.

644
00:45:40,756 --> 00:45:43,759
Now look, Marjorie. I'm being
perfectly honest with you.

645
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:47,972
I just want no part of it.
It's not for me.

646
00:45:52,476 --> 00:45:53,560
<i>Marjorie!</i>

647
00:45:58,732 --> 00:46:00,025
Leave me alone.

648
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:01,360
I haven't quite finished.

649
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:03,946
Well you have as far
as I'm concerned.

650
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:04,989
Now, you listen to me.

651
00:46:05,698 --> 00:46:07,824
When I called you Shirley,
it wasn't to insult you,

652
00:46:07,825 --> 00:46:09,743
it was to tell
you, that I know you.

653
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:11,996
I know everything about you.

654
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,747
I've gone out with
hundreds of Shirley's.

655
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:15,958
Oh, a different dress,
a different body,

656
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:21,380
But with that one unchanging look.
The look of Shirley.

657
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:24,299
You know an awful lot, don't you?

658
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:28,137
Enough to tell you that you're going
marry some young doctor.

659
00:46:28,595 --> 00:46:32,516
And with your Mother's blessing, help
him develop a practice in New Rochelle.

660
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:34,643
I am glad, that you've
got it all figured out.

661
00:46:35,102 --> 00:46:37,604
It was figured out
before I came along.

662
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:40,858
Marjorie, we're an
error in matchmaking,

663
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:45,904
you're on a course chartered by 5,000 years
of Moses, and his ten commandments.

664
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:47,906
I'm a renegade.

665
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:50,909
Why are you telling me all of this?

666
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,078
What are you trying to prove?

667
00:46:54,872 --> 00:46:59,710
If you don't want anything to do with me,
then forget about me. Get somebody else.

668
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:02,212
I don't want anybody else.

669
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:15,309
Oh, Noel!

670
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:18,103
I don't understand you,

671
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:20,689
me, anything.

672
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:37,372
<i>Hasta las fiestas!
Senors, Senoritas.</i>

673
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:41,752
<i>Now commencing in our
vast outdoor amphitheater.</i>

674
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:43,879
<i>The most glorious summer
event of the season.</i>

675
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:46,548
<i>It's fiesta time at South Wind.</i>

676
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:47,591
<i>Fiesta!</i>

677
00:48:01,396 --> 00:48:09,396
- Are you a guest?
- Yes.

678
00:49:25,898 --> 00:49:30,319
Cigarettes, beer, all
wrong up, isn't she?

679
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:34,615
Well, we may as well face it.
Mom. I've gone to the dogs.

680
00:49:35,657 --> 00:49:37,159
How long will you be staying?

681
00:49:37,201 --> 00:49:40,996
Well, we have to be a Seth's camp at 6.
We promised to have dinner with him.

682
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,206
Oh!

683
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:51,423
Marjorie, I don't blame you.
He's so handsome.

684
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:54,509
- Who?
- Who? Noel Airman!

685
00:49:56,053 --> 00:49:59,765
- How did you know?
- I've been here two hours, haven't I?

686
00:50:00,057 --> 00:50:03,560
Why don't you call him over.
We'd like to meet him.

687
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:05,437
Alright.

688
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:06,772
Noel!

689
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,150
Noel, I'd like you to meet my Mother
and Father, Mr. and Mrs. Morgenstern.

690
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:11,568
How are you Mrs. Morgenstern?

691
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,028
How do you do. Mr. Morgenstern.

692
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,906
I know how busy you are, but won't you sit down with us?

693
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:18,367
The Fiesta can wait until I've had a drink.

694
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:20,661
Bob, may I?

695
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:28,001
- Are you from New York, Mr. Airman?
- Well, Greenwich Village at the moment.

696
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:30,045
- Oh! Greenwich Village!
- Yeah.

697
00:50:30,545 --> 00:50:32,756
Do you put on shows in the winter also?

698
00:50:32,923 --> 00:50:34,925
I'm a songwriter, Mrs. Morgenstern.

699
00:50:35,092 --> 00:50:38,428
Oh, a songwriter. Well... what
have you written?

700
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,306
Noel's writing a Broadway show.
Princess Jones.

701
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:45,060
- You should hear it. It's fabulous.
- Ah, a hit show or something?

702
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:46,645
I only have one act.

703
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:48,981
How do you spell
your name again?

704
00:50:50,565 --> 00:50:55,570
- A-I-R-M-A-N.
- Oh, A-I-R-M-A-N, I know a judge Ehrman,

705
00:50:55,654 --> 00:50:58,657
but he spells it, E-H-R-M-A-N.

706
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,742
He's my father.

707
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:03,870
Judge Ehrman is your father?

708
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:05,122
Really?

709
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:08,041
For heaven's sake, why
didn't you say so.

710
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,335
Well you've been so
busy asking questions.

711
00:51:10,585 --> 00:51:12,045
Arnold, did you hear that?

712
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,672
Judge Ehrman's son.

713
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:15,132
<i>A fine man.</i>

714
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:18,426
I'm afraid a great deal of
my father's charm depends

715
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:21,054
on which political district
you happen to live in.

716
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:24,349
We have a great many
acquaintances in common.

717
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:28,437
Why, I know your mother
quite well, from the UGA,

718
00:51:28,603 --> 00:51:30,689
And don't you have a
sister, Monica, whose

719
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:32,941
married to the Snow Maiden
dry cleaning people?

720
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,359
That's my sister.

721
00:51:34,651 --> 00:51:36,987
Noel, don't you think we ought to
be getting back to the Fiesta?

722
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,488
Come to think of it,
your mother spoke to me

723
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,449
once about having a
son that wrote songs.

724
00:51:40,991 --> 00:51:44,578
But I should think with a judge for
a father, you would be in law.

725
00:51:45,037 --> 00:51:47,956
Well you see, Mrs. Morgenstern,
I flunked out of Law School

726
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:50,625
with the lowest grades in the
history of Cornell University.

727
00:51:51,877 --> 00:51:53,420
You sound proud of it.

728
00:51:53,503 --> 00:51:56,757
Well... it is some sort
of a record isn't it?

729
00:51:57,382 --> 00:52:00,927
Ah... tell me, how long have
you been working on this play?

730
00:52:01,345 --> 00:52:02,554
3 or 4 years.

731
00:52:03,013 --> 00:52:07,517
Well, I guess a writer has to
wait for inspiration, doesn't he?

732
00:52:07,642 --> 00:52:09,644
I work in spurts, Mrs. Morgenstern,

733
00:52:09,686 --> 00:52:12,189
sometimes I am more
productive than other times.

734
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,732
Mother, what is all this?

735
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:17,152
Forgive me for asking,
Mr. Airman, but how old now?

736
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:18,987
33.

737
00:52:19,321 --> 00:52:23,325
These days, a man who is
33, isn't old.

738
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:26,328
Not like you, when you
got started, huh Arnold?

739
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:29,164
Ah! The way this man worked!

740
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:31,540
But that was business, but
I guess you don't have

741
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,543
much of a head for business
do you, Mr. Airman?

742
00:52:33,794 --> 00:52:36,338
You're perfectly right, Mrs.
Morganstern, I don't.

743
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,091
Not everyone has to be a
business man, Mother.

744
00:52:39,174 --> 00:52:41,551
No, of course not.

745
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:43,929
Still, a man has to be something.

746
00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:49,017
Social Director in a camp,
must be very interesting, but,

747
00:52:49,142 --> 00:52:52,187
I always thought that
work was more for a boy.

748
00:52:52,646 --> 00:52:55,649
Maybe I'm Peter Pan,
Mrs. Morgenstern.

749
00:52:55,857 --> 00:52:58,944
Peter Pan was a fairy tale, Mr. Airman.

750
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,530
Life is real.

751
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:04,699
I think I prefer life my way, Mrs.
Morgenstern.

752
00:53:05,158 --> 00:53:09,162
Well, I really have a lot to do. I hope
you'll excuse me, it's been nice meeting you.

753
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:15,627
- Oh, Mother. How could you?
- Hmm?

754
00:53:25,011 --> 00:53:26,012
Noel!

755
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:31,726
I'm sorry about
the inquisition.

756
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:34,438
Marjorie, don't go
apologizing for your mother.

757
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:36,064
She's got me pegged.

758
00:53:36,398 --> 00:53:39,484
- She behaved horribly.
- Not at all.

759
00:53:40,277 --> 00:53:42,946
It's just that mama would
feel better if I wore a

760
00:53:42,988 --> 00:53:45,449
Grey flannel suit and
made 20 thousand a year.

761
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:47,909
Those are my mother's ideas.

762
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:50,996
I love you exactly the
way that you are.

763
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:56,501
Marjorie... you are your mother.

764
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:12,267
And now amigos, the climax
of our grand fiesta.

765
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:16,521
The world's greatest Torero, will meet
the world's most ferocious bull.

766
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:24,446
And here he is Manolito Manolito,
the greatest Matador in all Mexico.

767
00:55:11,535 --> 00:55:12,536
<i>Ole!</i>

768
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:15,914
<i>Ole!</i>

769
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,417
<i>Ole!</i>

770
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:22,212
<i>Ole!</i>

771
00:55:25,048 --> 00:55:26,049
<i>Ole!</i>

772
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:39,312
<i>Ole!</i>

773
00:55:42,065 --> 00:55:43,066
<i>Ole!</i>

774
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:53,318
<i>Ole!</i>

775
00:58:00,537 --> 00:58:02,539
Arnold, what's the
matter with him?

776
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:03,456
Nothing.

777
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:05,542
Nothing. He's
clowning, that's all.

778
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:10,338
Come, Rose!

779
00:58:10,463 --> 00:58:11,756
I'll get the car.

780
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:23,369
- Wally!
- Tis I, Princess.

781
00:59:24,037 --> 00:59:28,500
A wicked witch has put me in this
form of a bespectacled toad.

782
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:34,923
One kiss, and I spring erect a handsome
Social Director, in a black sweater.

783
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:39,344
Wally, getting yourself drunk isn't
go to make you a Social Director.

784
00:59:39,385 --> 00:59:40,762
I am not drunk.

785
00:59:41,554 --> 00:59:43,014
I am a man with problems.

786
00:59:43,306 --> 00:59:44,599
Serious problems.

787
00:59:46,017 --> 00:59:47,101
You too?

788
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,312
It's terrible, isn't it?

789
00:59:49,562 --> 00:59:50,563
What?

790
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,733
Wishing for something you can't have.

791
01:00:02,283 --> 01:00:03,785
Thank you, Margie.

792
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:06,621
I'll always remember that kiss.

793
01:00:08,331 --> 01:00:11,084
That was the first and last, Wally.

794
01:00:11,459 --> 01:00:15,255
Maybe it won't be the last.
Maybe it'll happen again.

795
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,714
Maybe.

796
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,883
Sometime, when there are
colored lanterns again.

797
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:22,762
Noel Airman, doesn't need
colored lanterns, does he?

798
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:24,180
Alright now.

799
01:00:24,556 --> 01:00:28,560
Looks colored lanterns,
talks colored lanterns.

800
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,689
Maybe that's all he is, a
mass of colored lanterns.

801
01:00:32,856 --> 01:00:34,691
You know you've really had 3 or 4 too many.

802
01:00:34,774 --> 01:00:38,278
Let me tell you something,
Miss Morninglory...

803
01:00:39,237 --> 01:00:41,948
you'll come to me when I'm
a successful playwright.

804
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,244
You'll come begging for a job from
Wally Wronkin, famous author.

805
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:51,332
Do you know something?
I'll give you the part.

806
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:57,672
I'll give it to you with gratitude
for your one generous kiss.

807
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,842
Under the colored lanterns.

808
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,624
- Marjorie!
- Uncle Samson!

809
01:01:32,749 --> 01:01:35,668
I never knew what a beautiful
niece I had until today.

810
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:36,419
Oh, Thank you.

811
01:01:36,502 --> 01:01:39,464
- Come dance once with the Uncle.
- I'd love to.

812
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,221
Oh, Uncle Samson, you
waltz beautifully.

813
01:01:47,388 --> 01:01:49,265
We should do this more often.

814
01:01:50,183 --> 01:01:54,687
What we should do in
life, and what we do...

815
01:01:56,397 --> 01:02:02,403
Marjorie... you know? At my age,
give me some kitchen work.

816
01:02:03,488 --> 01:02:06,032
- It's easier.
- Are you all right?

817
01:02:06,074 --> 01:02:12,163
I'm fine, I'm fine. I
just need a minutes rest.

818
01:02:12,288 --> 01:02:14,290
I'm going to take
you to your room.

819
01:02:14,415 --> 01:02:15,416
I'm alright.

820
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:17,543
I'll sit a little on the steps,

821
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,379
I'll get a little fresh air.

822
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:20,630
I'll be alright.

823
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,302
- I think I'll sit here a minute.
- Alright.

824
01:02:28,304 --> 01:02:30,807
- I'll get you a glass of water.
- No, no, no.

825
01:02:31,307 --> 01:02:32,809
Stay here with me.

826
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:36,437
I feel better already.

827
01:02:36,771 --> 01:02:37,772
Do you?

828
01:02:39,315 --> 01:02:42,568
What was the matter Marjorie, when
you came in upstairs tonight?

829
01:02:42,902 --> 01:02:44,028
You looked so sad.

830
01:02:45,947 --> 01:02:47,281
It was nothing.

831
01:02:48,574 --> 01:02:51,369
You know, Marjorie tonight,
for the first time.

832
01:02:52,412 --> 01:02:54,831
I realized you're not a
little girl any more.

833
01:02:55,373 --> 01:02:57,542
I wish my folks would realize that.

834
01:02:57,667 --> 01:02:58,751
<i>Samson...</i>

835
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:04,090
- Are you alright?
- Oh, yes I'm fine, I'm fine.

836
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:05,508
I had a big day.

837
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:07,093
I'm a little tired.

838
01:03:07,135 --> 01:03:09,137
- Sure.
- I'll put you to bed.

839
01:03:09,595 --> 01:03:12,598
What am I, a baby? Don't
talk to me like your mama.

840
01:03:13,558 --> 01:03:15,184
I'll do it by myself.

841
01:03:17,562 --> 01:03:19,355
- Good night darling.
- Good night Uncle Samson.

842
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:20,565
Good Night, Noel.

843
01:03:20,648 --> 01:03:21,649
Good night, Samson.

844
01:03:27,613 --> 01:03:29,615
Well, did your parents
convince you?

845
01:03:31,826 --> 01:03:33,619
They want me to take a trip out west.

846
01:03:34,746 --> 01:03:37,749
Yellowstone Park, and the Grand Canyon.

847
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:42,336
I could have sworn, that deep
down, your mother saw hope in me.

848
01:03:45,673 --> 01:03:48,926
I guess I can't buck your family
and your ancient God of vengeance.

849
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:54,849
I don't see how God could possibly be concerned
with a pitiful little summer romance.

850
01:03:58,603 --> 01:04:00,104
Do you think I should go?

851
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:02,940
Do you care at all?

852
01:04:13,534 --> 01:04:15,036
That doesn't solve anything,

853
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,915
Marjorie, what words are you trying to
ring out of me, that I'll marry you?

854
01:04:19,582 --> 01:04:21,084
If it has to happen, it will.

855
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:23,169
If you wanna be clever,
don't be clever.

856
01:04:24,337 --> 01:04:25,338
I'm not trying to be clever.

857
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:28,341
Alright then, go out west.
Do what your mother says.

858
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:31,761
Every American should
see the Grand Canyon.

859
01:04:32,386 --> 01:04:35,598
Why?
Why did I ever meet you?

860
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:38,684
You could be lying when
you say you love me.

861
01:04:39,185 --> 01:04:41,104
I'll probably never know.

862
01:04:42,355 --> 01:04:46,484
But I love you so much!
It's all been a fog, all summer.

863
01:04:53,032 --> 01:04:58,663
Marjorie, darling. The reason you're
so crazily in love, is that I am too.

864
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:02,625
This happens to everyone once
in lifetime, and it's happened to us.

865
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:07,922
Oh, Noel.

866
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:09,882
I love you!

867
01:05:10,383 --> 01:05:12,135
I don't care about anything else.

868
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,888
My whole life will go by, and nothing will change it.

869
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,891
I love you.

870
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,312
Marjorie!

871
01:05:23,521 --> 01:05:25,523
Marjorie, don't go.

872
01:05:26,399 --> 01:05:27,900
Don't go.

873
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:32,446
I can't refuse you anything.

874
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:37,076
Come with me.

875
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,762
Uncle Samson!

876
01:05:57,013 --> 01:05:58,306
Uncle Samson!

877
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:01,017
<i>It's Marjorie!</i>

878
01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:03,978
It must have been his
heart, Marjorie.

879
01:06:04,604 --> 01:06:05,605
He's gone.

880
01:06:06,814 --> 01:06:07,815
No!!

881
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:10,526
Uncle Samson!

882
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:11,944
Come back!

883
01:06:13,446 --> 01:06:14,447
Come back!

884
01:06:15,823 --> 01:06:17,992
Uncle, please!

885
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:21,787
- Marjorie...
- Go away!

886
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,457
Please go away.

887
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,751
Uncle!

888
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,002
Uncle.

889
01:06:31,547 --> 01:06:34,133
A terrible shock. You have
to do something, Noel!

890
01:06:34,217 --> 01:06:38,221
- Change the activities for tomorrow.
- You do it. I'm leaving tonight.

891
01:07:06,249 --> 01:07:07,833
Well, Sugarbun, we made it.

892
01:07:08,084 --> 01:07:10,336
With this and a man,
I can get myself a husband.

893
01:07:11,879 --> 01:07:15,299
- Oh, there they are. I'll see you.
- Ok.

894
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:18,678
Doesn't she look wonderful?

895
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:19,762
- Oh, Darling.
- Hello, Marjorie.

896
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:22,515
- How you doing?
- Oh, Papa.

897
01:07:22,556 --> 01:07:24,934
- The ceremony was just wonderful.
- My daughter,

898
01:07:24,976 --> 01:07:26,811
the first college graduate in the family.

899
01:07:26,936 --> 01:07:28,813
How does it feel to be
out of school, Marjorie?

900
01:07:28,854 --> 01:07:32,358
Oh, just great. Now I've gotta
go out and face the cruel world.

901
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:36,279
Well, if you're really serious about a
job, you could come to work in my office.

902
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:37,863
I could use another girl.

903
01:07:38,072 --> 01:07:40,825
Thank you, Papa, but I hope
to join Actors Equity.

904
01:07:41,075 --> 01:07:43,327
You mean you're really gone
look for an acting job?

905
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:44,662
I'm gonna get one.

906
01:07:45,454 --> 01:07:47,498
Well that's a crazy way
to make a living, but

907
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,500
at least you'll be out
in the open air a lot.

908
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:52,128
- Hello everybody.
- Hello, Doctor.

909
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:55,673
Dr. Harris, so nice to see you.
Marjorie, it's the Doctor.

910
01:07:56,507 --> 01:07:58,134
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

911
01:07:58,551 --> 01:08:00,928
- How's your mother.
- Oh, fine. She's fine.

912
01:08:01,012 --> 01:08:02,470
Thank you so much
for coming, David.

913
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:04,473
Well, I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

914
01:08:20,156 --> 01:08:22,742
You don't know how my aching
feet appreciate this.

915
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:24,368
Any luck?

916
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:25,953
I have a speaking part.

917
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,163
Would you like to hear it?

918
01:08:27,288 --> 01:08:28,289
Yes, shoot.

919
01:08:28,456 --> 01:08:30,458
Wait a minute, I have
to get in the mood.

920
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,837
Grandpa, Grandpa! Hawthorne's
back from the war.

921
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:38,466
My won't it be nice to have a
man around the house again.

922
01:08:39,508 --> 01:08:41,719
- That's all?
- My debut.

923
01:08:50,353 --> 01:08:51,395
So don't forget,

924
01:08:51,437 --> 01:08:52,438
Five o'clock sharp.

925
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,356
Shall I dress?

926
01:08:53,397 --> 01:08:56,067
No, this is just one of those
cocktail parties for a doctor.

927
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:57,568
Meet me in the hospital lobby.

928
01:08:57,651 --> 01:08:58,652
I'll be there.

929
01:08:59,904 --> 01:09:02,031
- Five o'clock.
- She you later.

930
01:09:02,073 --> 01:09:03,324
- Bye.
- Bye, Bye.

931
01:09:04,533 --> 01:09:06,952
Miss Morgenstern, there's a
gentleman waiting to see you.

932
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:08,204
Oh! Where?

933
01:09:09,205 --> 01:09:10,206
Thank you.

934
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,794
Got a minute for a long lost friend?

935
01:09:15,211 --> 01:09:19,006
- Oh! Well look at you.
- Do you like the costume?

936
01:09:19,131 --> 01:09:22,134
It's standard Madison avenue,
junior executive type.

937
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:24,136
Executive?

938
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:28,391
20,000 a year, plus expenses.
Not the car, that belongs to.

939
01:09:28,474 --> 01:09:30,893
Rothmoore Sims and Otis
Advertising.

940
01:09:31,185 --> 01:09:33,187
And so do I, body and soul.

941
01:09:33,562 --> 01:09:35,731
Look, hop in and I'll
give you the whole rags

942
01:09:35,773 --> 01:09:37,858
to riches story over
cocktails at the Plaza.

943
01:09:38,234 --> 01:09:40,236
Oh, Noel. I can't.

944
01:09:40,403 --> 01:09:41,821
I have to dress for a date.

945
01:09:42,113 --> 01:09:45,116
He'll love you just as you
are, unless he's insane.

946
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:47,660
Noel, I really can't.

947
01:09:47,701 --> 01:09:52,206
Marjorie, there are powerful cosmic
forces at work, don't you fight this.

948
01:09:52,957 --> 01:09:54,625
Please Marjorie.
Just fifteen minutes.

949
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:57,711
Look, I'll keep my watch on the table.
Come one, come on.

950
01:10:09,932 --> 01:10:12,851
Drink up. Here's death to
the old, Noel, that seedy

951
01:10:12,852 --> 01:10:16,105
tramp, and long life to the
man in the Grey flannel suit.

952
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:17,314
Cheers.

953
01:10:19,483 --> 01:10:21,110
Well, Marjorie you've broken me.

954
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,863
I'm saddled, bridled,
bitted and tamed.

955
01:10:23,988 --> 01:10:26,490
Children ride me in
Central Park for a dime.

956
01:10:26,949 --> 01:10:29,743
I assure you, I never had any
intention of breaking you.

957
01:10:30,035 --> 01:10:31,829
Darling, use your lovely noodle.

958
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,291
Why am I clapped and harnessed
9 to 5, chained to a desk?

959
01:10:35,749 --> 01:10:37,042
Alright, why?

960
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:39,670
Because I want you to know
me as a solid citizen.

961
01:10:40,171 --> 01:10:41,672
Because of you.

962
01:10:42,047 --> 01:10:44,967
And I'm doing alright to. They're
crazy about me at the agency.

963
01:10:45,176 --> 01:10:47,178
Rothmoore is grooming
me for Vice-President.

964
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,723
Honest. Tell your mother
to put that in her pipe.

965
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:53,893
I think that's marvelous.

966
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:58,981
But, what about Princess Jones?

967
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:01,484
Oh! The theater, that
was all part of my

968
01:11:01,525 --> 01:11:03,986
adolescence. I'll leave
that to kids like, Wally.

969
01:11:04,236 --> 01:11:07,072
Here, here, take off those gloves.
I wanna see your pretty hands.

970
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:09,074
Ah, you silly fool. Why?

971
01:11:09,116 --> 01:11:12,119
Now go on, take 'em off.
I wanna see your hands.

972
01:11:12,203 --> 01:11:15,206
I've never known such an imbecile.
There.

973
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:19,293
- Pretty enough?
- Beautiful.

974
01:11:20,252 --> 01:11:21,212
No rings.

975
01:11:21,795 --> 01:11:24,798
I take it Dr. Kildare
isn't making good time.

976
01:11:26,091 --> 01:11:28,093
The heck he isn't.

977
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:31,639
Noel, I don't want to keep him waiting.
I have to run.

978
01:11:31,889 --> 01:11:33,390
Just one more dance.

979
01:11:34,308 --> 01:11:34,807
Noel!

980
01:11:34,808 --> 01:11:36,644
Please Marjorie, I may
never see you again,

981
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:39,188
you'll marry Dr. Kildare
and it'll be impossible.

982
01:11:40,356 --> 01:11:42,066
I do have this date...

983
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:02,336
Yes, I... I arranged to have them play it.

984
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:16,767
I really must go.

985
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:19,853
- I'll drop you at the hospital.
- No. I can get a cab.

986
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:21,605
Thank you.

987
01:12:22,064 --> 01:12:23,065
Good bye.

988
01:12:24,108 --> 01:12:25,651
You're still, Marjorie.

989
01:12:26,652 --> 01:12:27,945
And I'm relieved.

990
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:31,657
It does me good to know that last
summer I wasn't in a state over.

991
01:12:32,658 --> 01:12:33,659
Just another girl.

992
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,330
That's really what I am.
Just another girl.

993
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:42,918
I won't forget you.

994
01:12:47,131 --> 01:12:48,757
Goodbye, Noel.

995
01:13:07,276 --> 01:13:11,280
<i>Calling Dr. Marshall!
Calling Dr. Marshall!</i>

996
01:13:11,405 --> 01:13:13,407
- David!
- Marjorie!

997
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:16,160
The parties just about over.

998
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:21,749
I'm terribly sorry. I ran into an old friend, and the time just flew.

999
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:25,669
Marjorie, let me ask you a
weird question.

1000
01:13:27,254 --> 01:13:29,173
Was it Noel Airman?

1001
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:31,175
I didn't plan it, David.

1002
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:35,137
- I'd have hung up if he phoned.
- It's all right, Marjorie, I understand.

1003
01:13:36,263 --> 01:13:40,059
I guess I always figured he was bound
to show up sooner or later.

1004
01:13:44,104 --> 01:13:47,107
- I'm sorry.
- Can I take you home?

1005
01:13:47,816 --> 01:13:49,401
I can get a cab.

1006
01:13:52,488 --> 01:13:54,490
Goodbye, Marjorie.

1007
01:13:57,201 --> 01:13:58,869
Goodbye, David.

1008
01:14:08,087 --> 01:14:09,088
Hello?

1009
01:14:09,171 --> 01:14:10,172
<i>This</i> is...

1010
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:11,548
<i>Shirley.</i>

1011
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,134
Marjorie.

1012
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:18,806
I thought you'd like to know
I'm back in circulation.

1013
01:14:19,682 --> 01:14:22,059
Darling, let's go out and do the town.
I'll come and get you.

1014
01:14:22,518 --> 01:14:24,103
<i>No, don't be insane.</i>

1015
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:26,814
Well why not, we'll have hamburgers,
and we'll ride back at 4th

1016
01:14:26,855 --> 01:14:29,274
and the Ferry and then you can
come up here and fight me off.

1017
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:31,944
Not a chance.

1018
01:14:32,236 --> 01:14:34,237
Do you realize...

1019
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:37,449
you have actually called me for a date?

1020
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:40,786
I told you. You are ruining my life.

1021
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:43,163
I wonder if you're doing it deliberately.

1022
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:44,748
I am in love with you.

1023
01:14:45,457 --> 01:14:47,292
I'm in love with you, too.

1024
01:14:47,418 --> 01:14:49,420
<i>One of us must crack.</i>

1025
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:53,632
Not me. Good night,
Noel, Darling.

1026
01:14:56,385 --> 01:14:58,220
So he's turned up again?

1027
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:01,807
Mother. You'd better get used to him.

1028
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:04,852
Because he's going to
be your son in law.

1029
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:08,814
You really think so?

1030
01:15:08,897 --> 01:15:11,900
Oh! I... I know it.
I just know it.

1031
01:15:12,693 --> 01:15:14,695
Oh, Mother, I love him so much.

1032
01:15:15,696 --> 01:15:20,200
Well, as long as he's going to be in
the family. Ask him up to the house.

1033
01:15:20,284 --> 01:15:21,785
Yes, Mother, dear.

1034
01:15:22,035 --> 01:15:23,871
Invite him to Passover dinner.

1035
01:15:24,496 --> 01:15:28,791
Oh, not Passover, Mother.
Noel isn't very religious.

1036
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:31,795
He doesn't believe in those things?

1037
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:35,007
He do not believe in those things?

1038
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:41,096
You're going to get married. How are
you going to raise your children?

1039
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,187
Alright, Mother. I'll invite him.

1040
01:15:51,064 --> 01:15:56,403
This is the poor bread, which our
fathers ate in the land of Egypt.

1041
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:01,825
Let all who are hungry,
come and eat with us.

1042
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:08,373
Whosoever is needy, let him come and
celebrate the Passover with us.

1043
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,711
This cup, in the center of the table.

1044
01:16:14,421 --> 01:16:15,839
Is the cup of Elijah.

1045
01:16:16,632 --> 01:16:17,883
Our missing guests.

1046
01:16:19,802 --> 01:16:24,097
And this chair, was Uncle Samson's

1047
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:37,486
Noel, I'm sorry you
were so bored.

1048
01:16:39,154 --> 01:16:43,742
Ah! No Marjorie, I wasn't bored. I was disturbed.

1049
01:16:44,785 --> 01:16:45,953
Deeply.

1050
01:16:47,412 --> 01:16:50,457
I couldn't help thinking of all
the things I've missed in life.

1051
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:54,211
Family. Your kind of family.

1052
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:55,879
Faith.

1053
01:16:56,171 --> 01:16:57,172
Tradition.

1054
01:16:58,173 --> 01:17:01,426
All the things I've been
ridiculing all the time.

1055
01:17:02,636 --> 01:17:05,013
That's why I couldn't take it anymore.

1056
01:17:16,358 --> 01:17:19,695
I love you very much,
Marjorie Morgenstern.

1057
01:17:47,598 --> 01:17:52,477
- Marjorie! Gee, it's great to see you!
- Great first act, congratulations.

1058
01:17:52,519 --> 01:17:54,771
Wally, this is terribly exciting.

1059
01:17:54,813 --> 01:17:56,315
Congratulations, Mr. Wronklin.

1060
01:17:56,565 --> 01:17:58,567
I'm just thrilled for you.

1061
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:00,652
Holy smoke, everyone in the world is here tonight.

1062
01:18:01,445 --> 01:18:04,448
- Where's Noel?
- Oh, he went to get some cigarettes.

1063
01:18:04,573 --> 01:18:08,035
I'm so nervous. I had a date when I came
in, but I don't know where she went.

1064
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:09,578
Oh, there she is.

1065
01:18:09,745 --> 01:18:11,747
- Oh, she's darling.
- She's unconscious.

1066
01:18:12,372 --> 01:18:14,833
I don't know how she finds
her way around the streets.

1067
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:16,460
The only thing I like about her,

1068
01:18:16,585 --> 01:18:18,086
Her name's, Marjorie.

1069
01:18:19,463 --> 01:18:20,464
<i>Hi!</i>

1070
01:18:22,132 --> 01:18:22,925
Thank you!

1071
01:18:22,966 --> 01:18:25,344
Hi ya, Wally, It looks like you
are suffering through a hit.

1072
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:26,303
You really think so, Noel?

1073
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:28,138
My laugh meter registered
100, you're in kid.

1074
01:18:28,263 --> 01:18:30,307
I hope you feel that way
after the last act.

1075
01:18:31,099 --> 01:18:33,602
Oh, are you coming to the
party after the show?

1076
01:18:33,685 --> 01:18:38,273
Ah, not me, Wally. I am strictly a 9 to 5
man, you'll be up till dawn taking bows.

1077
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:40,233
OK! Thank you for coming.

1078
01:18:52,412 --> 01:18:54,873
Well, little Wally has a hit.

1079
01:18:55,624 --> 01:18:59,628
I couldn't be happier. I
just couldn't be happier.

1080
01:18:59,962 --> 01:19:03,465
I, I feel like the old maestro watching
his old protege make good.

1081
01:19:03,507 --> 01:19:10,097
I'm glad Noel. I thought that
maybe you'd feel funny.

1082
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:14,476
Nonsense, Wally's doing what he wants
to do, I'm doing what I want to do.

1083
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,354
Come here. I wanna show you my hit.

1084
01:19:17,604 --> 01:19:20,232
You see that sign up there
towering over Broadway,

1085
01:19:20,273 --> 01:19:22,776
proclaiming the
virtues of ice cubes?

1086
01:19:23,902 --> 01:19:26,780
Written, produced, and
directed by Noel Airman.

1087
01:19:26,905 --> 01:19:29,116
The Shakespeare of advertising.

1088
01:19:29,658 --> 01:19:34,413
Oh, these young fellas like Wally, they...
they write ok, but they don't have the...

1089
01:19:34,454 --> 01:19:37,457
je Ne sais quoi, for
doing advertising copy.

1090
01:19:37,499 --> 01:19:40,002
That takes real creative ability.

1091
01:19:41,169 --> 01:19:43,422
Madam... Dear Madam,

1092
01:19:43,672 --> 01:19:46,091
Have you seen the new
Deluxe Arctic refrigerators?

1093
01:19:46,133 --> 01:19:50,554
Especially compartmented for foul
vegetables, old socks, used razor blades...

1094
01:19:50,637 --> 01:19:54,641
Shrunken human heads, hamburgers, beef
burgers, fish burgers. Burger burgers.

1095
01:19:56,268 --> 01:20:02,315
Oh, who am I kidding?
Wally Wronkin's got a hit.

1096
01:20:02,524 --> 01:20:05,318
A kid I picked up, a boy. He's got a hit!

1097
01:20:05,652 --> 01:20:09,281
Noel, darling, you can do
anything that Wally can do...

1098
01:20:09,406 --> 01:20:10,490
You can do it better!

1099
01:20:10,574 --> 01:20:14,161
With one difference. He always finishes
what he starts. I'm never able to.

1100
01:20:14,494 --> 01:20:18,290
I seem to have a fatal lack of
central organizing energy.

1101
01:20:18,707 --> 01:20:21,293
You're the most talented
man, I've ever met.

1102
01:20:21,543 --> 01:20:24,504
Oh, Marjorie, people have been telling
me that for the last 15 years.

1103
01:20:24,588 --> 01:20:26,923
When does the airplane get off the ground?
Where is it going?

1104
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:27,674
Noel.

1105
01:20:27,716 --> 01:20:31,219
No, no, give it up. Give it up,
Marjorie, I'm no good.

1106
01:20:31,344 --> 01:20:33,346
I'm never going to
amount to anything.

1107
01:20:33,764 --> 01:20:35,390
I'm all surface.

1108
01:20:35,891 --> 01:20:38,769
Everything that I have, goes
up in charm and conversation.

1109
01:20:39,102 --> 01:20:40,187
And I know it!

1110
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,065
Why can't I do anything about it?

1111
01:20:43,982 --> 01:20:47,694
Sam Rothmoore isn't paying you
for charm and conversation.

1112
01:20:47,903 --> 01:20:50,530
You said he was grooming
you for his job.

1113
01:20:51,364 --> 01:20:52,491
Is it what I want?

1114
01:20:52,908 --> 01:20:54,409
Well then, quit.

1115
01:20:54,785 --> 01:20:56,328
Do something you like.

1116
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:58,830
Anything you do,
you'll do brilliantly.

1117
01:20:58,997 --> 01:21:01,500
I can't go back to my
play, I'm sour on it.

1118
01:21:03,877 --> 01:21:07,422
I don't care what you do, Noel. As
long as you don't stop loving me.

1119
01:21:14,096 --> 01:21:19,601
Ah, darling. You haven't the faintest
idea, how much good you do me.

1120
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:22,979
You're like adrenaline. Do you know what?

1121
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:27,025
I'm going back to the office
right now and work. I'm going to

1122
01:21:27,067 --> 01:21:30,529
cook up the most beautiful brochure
Sam Rothmoore has ever seen.

1123
01:21:30,862 --> 01:21:32,697
- Come on, I'll put you in a cab.
- Alright.

1124
01:21:34,908 --> 01:21:35,700
Do you mind?

1125
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:36,451
No.

1126
01:21:36,618 --> 01:21:38,120
Good night, Darling.

1127
01:21:38,328 --> 01:21:40,330
Goodnight, I'll call you tomorrow.

1128
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,543
Mr. Airman, please.

1129
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,507
Have you any idea where he is?

1130
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:37,137
No, I've tried there, too.

1131
01:22:38,305 --> 01:22:39,556
Yes thank you.

1132
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:57,115
Oh, excuse me, I'm looking for Mr.
Airman's apartment.

1133
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:01,411
Oh! This is it. Come on in.

1134
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:10,921
I was expecting the boy with the groceries.
Are you Marjorie?

1135
01:23:11,046 --> 01:23:13,048
- Yes.
- He's taking a shower.

1136
01:23:15,008 --> 01:23:17,135
Hey, your friend Marjorie is here.

1137
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:17,969
<i>What?</i>

1138
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:20,055
I said, Marjorie is here.

1139
01:23:20,347 --> 01:23:22,849
<i>Fine. Give her some coffee,
I'll be right out.</i>

1140
01:23:23,475 --> 01:23:26,394
Oh, I'm Imogene Norman,
I'll be gone in a jiffy.

1141
01:23:26,519 --> 01:23:29,147
Here, help yourself to coffee,
it's just hotting up.

1142
01:23:31,566 --> 01:23:34,861
Oh, now don't start throwing
things at him, when he comes out.

1143
01:23:35,487 --> 01:23:40,075
<i>You see, I landed in New York
without 5 dollars to my name.</i>

1144
01:23:40,283 --> 01:23:41,660
<i>Boy, was I broke.</i>

1145
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,163
So, Noel let me park here all week.

1146
01:23:45,622 --> 01:23:49,626
Well, I know it sounds peculiar,
but you just have to believe it.

1147
01:23:50,835 --> 01:23:55,257
He staying upstairs on the 4th
floor with a sculptor friend.

1148
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:58,301
He comes down here to shower,
because all his things are here.

1149
01:23:59,052 --> 01:24:03,556
I'm glad you told me, I was about
to stab him with a bread knife.

1150
01:24:04,182 --> 01:24:05,517
You're awfully pretty.

1151
01:24:05,725 --> 01:24:06,726
Well thanks.

1152
01:24:07,936 --> 01:24:10,355
But you're one girl that
has nothing to fear.

1153
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:12,232
Are you a model?

1154
01:24:12,524 --> 01:24:16,820
Well, I'm really more a singer, but
modeling pays the bills you might say.

1155
01:24:18,113 --> 01:24:20,740
Hey! Have you drowned, I'm off.

1156
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:26,830
Hi.

1157
01:24:28,456 --> 01:24:30,583
Have any trouble finding your way here?

1158
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:39,092
- Well, bye. Nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

1159
01:24:39,718 --> 01:24:42,887
Oh, I've already explained to Marjorie
that you're sleeping upstairs,

1160
01:24:42,929 --> 01:24:44,931
so she won't be breaking any
crockery over your head.

1161
01:24:45,515 --> 01:24:47,934
Besides, I've got my
reputation to think about.

1162
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:52,772
Well, arriverderci,
as we say in Texas.

1163
01:24:54,941 --> 01:24:56,359
Can I offer you a drink?

1164
01:24:57,569 --> 01:25:00,280
I think you'd do better
with some eggs or cereal.

1165
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:07,329
Marjorie, cereal is what's poisoning America
and causing the rise in mental disorders.

1166
01:25:16,087 --> 01:25:20,300
It's better.
I'm really falling apart, Marjorie.

1167
01:25:21,676 --> 01:25:23,887
I guess that's why I
didn't call you all week.

1168
01:25:24,387 --> 01:25:25,680
I was so worried, Noel.

1169
01:25:26,264 --> 01:25:27,557
I thought you might be sick.

1170
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:29,142
I was sick.

1171
01:25:30,018 --> 01:25:31,394
Sick as I've ever been.

1172
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:34,898
Sick of trying to figure out who I am.

1173
01:25:36,024 --> 01:25:38,026
Why I'm here, and what it's all about.

1174
01:25:39,736 --> 01:25:43,656
Don't you think you should answer
the phone? It might be your office.

1175
01:25:43,782 --> 01:25:45,158
You answer it.

1176
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:47,202
Tell them I quit.

1177
01:25:47,911 --> 01:25:53,291
Tell them there's no power left on earth
that could turn me into a docile commuter.

1178
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:00,924
Oh oh, that look.

1179
01:26:00,965 --> 01:26:04,969
That black-eyed look. Oh, Marjorie!

1180
01:26:11,017 --> 01:26:16,022
Do you know the question I've been
asking myself for the last three days?

1181
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,234
Who am I?

1182
01:26:19,776 --> 01:26:21,486
You're the man I love.

1183
01:26:23,696 --> 01:26:24,697
I know.

1184
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:30,703
Darling, you're unspeakably pretty
and bright and you have talent.

1185
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:35,667
You really do. You keep trying and you're
gonna have your name up on those lights on

1186
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:38,461
44th Street, blinking away.

1187
01:26:41,214 --> 01:26:42,841
Darling.

1188
01:26:43,967 --> 01:26:44,968
What is it?

1189
01:26:48,012 --> 01:26:49,013
Marjorie.

1190
01:26:49,722 --> 01:26:54,227
I've searched my soul truthfully
and honestly for the first time.

1191
01:26:54,978 --> 01:26:56,229
I asked myself.

1192
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:00,108
"Do you want to Marry Marjorie?
You're in love with her."

1193
01:27:01,818 --> 01:27:03,278
The answer is no.

1194
01:27:03,987 --> 01:27:05,238
Not on her terms.

1195
01:27:06,114 --> 01:27:09,200
Then, I asked myself, "Is it money
you want?" The answer is no!

1196
01:27:09,492 --> 01:27:11,493
No, not on Rothmore's terms!

1197
01:27:11,494 --> 01:27:13,496
Well, is there some other
woman that you want then?

1198
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,999
Miss America, Miss Universe? No.

1199
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:20,378
No, no, no. There's no
other girl I ever met

1200
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:23,673
who even comes close to you.

1201
01:27:26,092 --> 01:27:27,093
But, Marjorie.

1202
01:27:28,303 --> 01:27:29,762
Love of my life.

1203
01:27:30,763 --> 01:27:31,764
We're through.

1204
01:27:32,974 --> 01:27:34,809
You... you can't mean that.

1205
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:37,604
You're tired.

1206
01:27:39,272 --> 01:27:40,273
Yes.

1207
01:27:40,899 --> 01:27:42,400
Yes, I'm tired.

1208
01:27:43,818 --> 01:27:47,614
I'm tired of playing the
horse to your rider.

1209
01:27:47,655 --> 01:27:51,784
And, believe me Marjorie, whether you know
it or not, you've ridden me mercilessly.

1210
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,038
Well, I'm throwing you. I'm running off.

1211
01:27:55,872 --> 01:27:58,333
Who are you running away from, Noel?

1212
01:28:03,254 --> 01:28:06,341
Don't you understand?

1213
01:28:06,382 --> 01:28:10,220
I ache with pleasure right
now just touching you.

1214
01:28:12,347 --> 01:28:14,599
That's what's damn near destroyed me.

1215
01:28:14,891 --> 01:28:17,894
I've been playing the game
by your asinine rules!

1216
01:28:18,061 --> 01:28:20,063
Being faithful to you.

1217
01:28:21,147 --> 01:28:23,483
Can you imagine what
that means to me not to

1218
01:28:23,525 --> 01:28:25,735
touch you and yet not
to touch another girl?

1219
01:28:26,611 --> 01:28:29,531
Believe me, if Imogene hadn't come
along and broken the spell...

1220
01:28:29,572 --> 01:28:30,573
Imogene?

1221
01:28:33,201 --> 01:28:34,244
What's the matter?

1222
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,625
Good Lord, don't tell me you
believed Imogene. What...

1223
01:28:42,001 --> 01:28:43,253
I did.

1224
01:28:44,462 --> 01:28:45,338
I did.

1225
01:28:46,172 --> 01:28:49,342
Oh, Marjorie, I thought you
were pretending to ignore it.

1226
01:28:50,051 --> 01:28:53,763
How could you possibly
bel... Imogene and I...

1227
01:28:54,138 --> 01:28:57,392
I'm in love with you!
That's why I believed her.

1228
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:01,896
Get out of my way, you rotten tramp!

1229
01:29:26,421 --> 01:29:29,006
- Good morning, Mr. Wronkin.
- Hello. Did Mr. Michelson show up yet?

1230
01:29:29,007 --> 01:29:30,758
- He's inside.
- Thank you.

1231
01:29:34,846 --> 01:29:37,849
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning, Wally. Oh, by the way...

1232
01:29:38,516 --> 01:29:40,184
How do you like the change in Act III?

1233
01:29:40,226 --> 01:29:41,894
I'm sorry, Paul, I don't like it.

1234
01:29:41,978 --> 01:29:43,605
It captures the mood in my opinion.

1235
01:29:43,813 --> 01:29:45,773
Try capturing it my way, huh?

1236
01:29:45,857 --> 01:29:47,859
Ok, just as you say.

1237
01:29:50,945 --> 01:29:52,822
Marjorie Morningstar!

1238
01:29:53,156 --> 01:29:54,657
What are you doing here?

1239
01:29:54,782 --> 01:29:56,993
I came to read for the part of the sister.

1240
01:29:57,285 --> 01:29:58,786
Well, sure. Come over here.

1241
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:01,789
Oh, no. I'm just part of a group, Wally.
I'll wait my turn.

1242
01:30:01,831 --> 01:30:03,833
I'll be with you in a minute, folks. C'mon.

1243
01:30:04,626 --> 01:30:06,628
You look like the orphan in a storm.

1244
01:30:07,003 --> 01:30:11,883
Wally, I read your play and I
know all the sister's lines.

1245
01:30:12,258 --> 01:30:13,635
I feel the part.

1246
01:30:14,469 --> 01:30:16,679
I don't want any special treatment.

1247
01:30:16,971 --> 01:30:18,348
I just wanna read.

1248
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:20,016
You look enchanting.

1249
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,601
What have you been up to?

1250
01:30:21,851 --> 01:30:23,061
Oh, the usual.

1251
01:30:23,227 --> 01:30:26,481
Pounding the pavement. I
did an off Broadway show.

1252
01:30:27,106 --> 01:30:29,400
Well, I haven't set off any rockets yet.

1253
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:31,861
Well...

1254
01:30:33,112 --> 01:30:35,657
it's all come true
hasn't it, Wally?

1255
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,991
What?

1256
01:30:38,034 --> 01:30:40,078
You're the successful playwright, and...

1257
01:30:40,495 --> 01:30:42,497
I've come to you, just as you said.

1258
01:30:42,997 --> 01:30:44,999
Only, I don't want any favors.

1259
01:30:46,376 --> 01:30:49,045
Marjorie, you don't have to read for me.

1260
01:30:49,379 --> 01:30:50,546
Oh, but I want to.

1261
01:30:50,963 --> 01:30:53,966
I want to prove to you
that I am an actress.

1262
01:30:54,801 --> 01:30:57,345
Or maybe I just want to prove it to myself.

1263
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:59,472
The part is yours.

1264
01:31:01,265 --> 01:31:02,517
Just like that?

1265
01:31:02,558 --> 01:31:03,685
Just like that.

1266
01:31:04,227 --> 01:31:07,605
Report for rehearsal Monday morning.
I'll notify the producer.

1267
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:11,192
Oh, by the way, why don't
you prowl around out front?

1268
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:14,696
There's a friend of yours here.
Doing pretty well for herself, too.

1269
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:16,739
Sugar bun! Oh!

1270
01:31:16,781 --> 01:31:19,492
- Oh, Marsha!
- Oh, Darling!

1271
01:31:19,659 --> 01:31:22,745
Oh, your a sprig of lilac,
just as ravishing as ever.

1272
01:31:23,538 --> 01:31:24,914
Same old Marsha.

1273
01:31:24,997 --> 01:31:26,082
What are you doing here?

1274
01:31:26,165 --> 01:31:28,167
I'm here with my boyfriend.
He's got money in this opera.

1275
01:31:28,251 --> 01:31:29,043
Come on. Meet him.

1276
01:31:29,752 --> 01:31:31,421
Lou, Honey. Lou.

1277
01:31:31,713 --> 01:31:34,132
I want you to meet my
oldest and dearest friend.

1278
01:31:34,173 --> 01:31:35,883
<i>Marjorie Morningstar,
Lou Michelson.</i>

1279
01:31:35,967 --> 01:31:39,387
How are you, Marjorie?
I've certainly heard a lot about you.

1280
01:31:39,429 --> 01:31:40,429
<i>Thank you!</i>

1281
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:42,765
<i>Oh, and this is Lou's lawyer,
Phil Berman.</i>

1282
01:31:42,974 --> 01:31:44,475
Well how do you do,
Miss Morningstar?

1283
01:31:44,767 --> 01:31:46,144
Ah, are you in our show?

1284
01:31:46,602 --> 01:31:50,773
- Well, just barely. One scene.
- Oh! This kid's really got it.

1285
01:31:50,857 --> 01:31:52,859
She's gonna set Broadway on fire!

1286
01:31:52,942 --> 01:31:54,944
The blaze is hardly noticeable.

1287
01:31:55,069 --> 01:31:56,571
Well, you must be excited.

1288
01:31:56,696 --> 01:31:57,947
Oh, I'm on cloud seven.

1289
01:31:58,030 --> 01:32:00,742
Will you girls excuse us? We've
got business at the box office.

1290
01:32:00,825 --> 01:32:02,243
- Sure.
- Come on, Phil.

1291
01:32:02,326 --> 01:32:04,746
- It was certainly nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

1292
01:32:06,164 --> 01:32:08,957
Lou's a darling. He's no
boy of course, but he's

1293
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:11,586
very sweet and he insists
on buying me things.

1294
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:13,504
You look just great.

1295
01:32:13,546 --> 01:32:15,548
Well, I've done the best
I can with the old hulk.

1296
01:32:17,008 --> 01:32:21,220
Is it all over between
you and Noel? for good.

1297
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:25,016
Well, I can't say that you
haven't got the right idea.

1298
01:32:25,099 --> 01:32:26,850
Lou's a little older
than Wally of course,

1299
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:28,603
but I guess it boils
down to the same thing.

1300
01:32:29,061 --> 01:32:30,271
If you can't have what you want

1301
01:32:30,313 --> 01:32:32,231
you take the next best.

1302
01:32:32,815 --> 01:32:36,611
- There's nothing between Wally and me.
- Same old record, huh?

1303
01:32:36,778 --> 01:32:40,364
Marsha, I got this part,
because Wally thinks I can play it.

1304
01:32:40,448 --> 01:32:42,033
Sure, sure, baby, I'm with you.

1305
01:32:42,116 --> 01:32:43,618
Doesn't matter how the
trolley get's started,

1306
01:32:43,743 --> 01:32:45,161
as long as it takes you
where you're going.

1307
01:32:45,286 --> 01:32:48,289
I see my master waving.
Honey, come to my wedding.

1308
01:32:49,373 --> 01:32:51,375
That's right. Lou and I
are going to get married.

1309
01:32:51,542 --> 01:32:54,170
I fought the good fight, but now
I want some of those things,

1310
01:32:54,212 --> 01:32:55,838
a trusty checkbook can buy.

1311
01:32:55,922 --> 01:32:57,215
Goodbye, Honey.

1312
01:32:57,882 --> 01:32:59,383
Goodbye, Marsha.

1313
01:33:06,766 --> 01:33:09,143
For crying out loud, Wally,
who is she?

1314
01:33:09,185 --> 01:33:12,313
Her name is Marjorie Morningstar,
and I want her to play the part.

1315
01:33:12,563 --> 01:33:14,564
She's nobody, she'll hurt the play.

1316
01:33:14,565 --> 01:33:17,151
<i>Look, Paul. She won't hurt
it, she won't help it.</i>

1317
01:33:17,276 --> 01:33:19,362
<i>There are thousands like her on Broadway.</i>

1318
01:33:19,445 --> 01:33:22,281
<i>All she needs is a taste of the
fruit, and then it's over.</i>

1319
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:24,158
<i>I want her to have that taste.</i>

1320
01:33:24,367 --> 01:33:27,370
Kid, we can't start doing favors.
This is business.

1321
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:30,540
Look, Paul, we're hung up
on that percentage right?

1322
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:32,416
Alright. I'll give in on that point.

1323
01:33:32,667 --> 01:33:34,293
<i>Well, that's different.</i>

1324
01:33:34,502 --> 01:33:35,461
<i>That's business,</i>

1325
01:33:35,753 --> 01:33:36,587
<i>She's got it.</i>

1326
01:33:38,673 --> 01:33:40,883
- Thank you, Wally.
- Marjorie...

1327
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:42,844
Thank you, very much.

1328
01:33:46,472 --> 01:33:48,474
There's your second kiss, darling.

1329
01:33:48,724 --> 01:33:53,020
For whatever it's worth. I want you
to have the best of everything.

1330
01:33:53,271 --> 01:33:54,272
Always.

1331
01:33:55,273 --> 01:33:57,942
So why don't you get the
best actress for the part.

1332
01:33:58,609 --> 01:34:00,069
That's business.

1333
01:34:04,657 --> 01:34:06,701
May I give you some champagne?

1334
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:09,120
Pardon me a moment.

1335
01:34:09,203 --> 01:34:11,831
- Marjorie, darling.
- Mrs. Zelenko.

1336
01:34:11,956 --> 01:34:16,002
Isn't it thrilling? Marsha and Lou leave
for Europe, right after the wedding.

1337
01:34:16,544 --> 01:34:19,297
Excuse me a moment. Someone's just
come in, that I want you to meet.

1338
01:34:20,923 --> 01:34:22,508
Marjorie!

1339
01:34:23,259 --> 01:34:24,802
- David!
- Hello.

1340
01:34:24,886 --> 01:34:27,429
- I am so glad to see you.
- I'm glad to see you,

1341
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:29,432
- how have you been?
- Just fine.

1342
01:34:29,473 --> 01:34:32,268
- You look wonderful.
- David!

1343
01:34:32,935 --> 01:34:34,937
I'd like you to come see
the lovely wedding cake.

1344
01:34:34,979 --> 01:34:36,981
In a minute. I want
you to meet someone.

1345
01:34:38,858 --> 01:34:41,527
This is Marjorie Morningstar.
My wife, Helen.

1346
01:34:42,904 --> 01:34:43,988
How do you do?

1347
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:47,283
You're as pretty as
David told me you were.

1348
01:34:47,742 --> 01:34:48,576
Thank you.

1349
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:51,829
- Would you excuse us a moment?
- Of course.

1350
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:57,168
<i>Marjorie!</i>

1351
01:34:58,419 --> 01:35:00,671
I want you to meet Philip Berman.
Lou's attorney.

1352
01:35:00,796 --> 01:35:02,506
We've met. How do you do, Mr.
Berman.

1353
01:35:02,548 --> 01:35:03,840
How are you, Marjorie?

1354
01:35:03,841 --> 01:35:06,260
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll run in
and see how Marsha's getting along.

1355
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:09,096
Take care of her, Phillip.
She's Marsha's oldest friend.

1356
01:35:09,472 --> 01:35:10,473
I will, Tanya.

1357
01:35:11,307 --> 01:35:12,516
Would you like a drink?

1358
01:35:12,683 --> 01:35:13,684
Thank you, I'd love one.

1359
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:15,061
May we have some?

1360
01:35:15,186 --> 01:35:16,187
Thank you.

1361
01:35:18,731 --> 01:35:21,567
This is a pleasant surprise.

1362
01:35:21,776 --> 01:35:24,153
I dropped by rehearsal
last week, I had a shock.

1363
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:26,030
You weren't in the show.

1364
01:35:26,447 --> 01:35:28,240
I gave up the part.

1365
01:35:28,616 --> 01:35:29,617
Oh?

1366
01:35:29,992 --> 01:35:31,994
Is it for the reason I think?

1367
01:35:33,204 --> 01:35:34,914
Now I'm pounding the pavement again.

1368
01:35:35,331 --> 01:35:36,874
I was probably crazy.

1369
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:40,002
Marjorie, please.
Marsha wants to see you.

1370
01:35:40,086 --> 01:35:41,587
- Oh, excuse me.
- Of course.

1371
01:35:41,796 --> 01:35:43,965
Bridal nerves, I guess.
She's got a bad case of it.

1372
01:35:44,006 --> 01:35:46,217
Please talk to her, she's asking for you.
Right in there.

1373
01:35:46,425 --> 01:35:50,012
Marjorie, just a few more minutes.
Do I look nervous?

1374
01:35:50,221 --> 01:35:52,348
- Mama, how's Marsha?
- Wonderful. Wonderful, Lou.

1375
01:35:52,431 --> 01:35:54,684
- We're just going to her.
- Please take good care of it.

1376
01:35:56,102 --> 01:35:58,104
- Hello, Lou.
- Hi, Phil.

1377
01:35:58,187 --> 01:35:59,981
- Bridal nerves?
- Not me.

1378
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:05,444
- Marsha, darling.
- I just want to talk to Marjorie, Mama.

1379
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:08,364
Marsha dear, please
pull yourself together.

1380
01:36:08,406 --> 01:36:09,782
Mama, leave me alone.

1381
01:36:24,422 --> 01:36:26,632
27 bucks, shot.

1382
01:36:28,175 --> 01:36:31,012
Well now Morningstar,
how do you feel?

1383
01:36:31,178 --> 01:36:32,179
Nervous?

1384
01:36:32,388 --> 01:36:34,932
I'm not. Calmest bride you ever saw.

1385
01:36:36,767 --> 01:36:40,146
Well, sit down for heaven's sake,
don't stand there looking at me.

1386
01:36:43,691 --> 01:36:49,864
Well, time for one more cigarette.
My last as a free girl.

1387
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:54,493
The next one I smoke, I'll
be Mrs. Lou Michelson.

1388
01:36:55,953 --> 01:36:59,957
Why is it I wonder, I was destined never
to have anything I ever really wanted?

1389
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:04,003
Oh, Marsha look. When the time comes
for me to take the fatal plunge,

1390
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:06,964
I'll probably have an attack
of nerves twice as bad.

1391
01:37:07,131 --> 01:37:09,508
Doesn't seem to me like I
ever wanted very much.

1392
01:37:10,718 --> 01:37:15,056
A friend, a job, and a fella.

1393
01:37:15,806 --> 01:37:18,642
Oh, darling, I'm so alone.

1394
01:37:18,768 --> 01:37:21,228
I'm so absolutely alone.

1395
01:37:21,437 --> 01:37:23,856
Now I'll be alone forever.

1396
01:37:24,315 --> 01:37:26,067
Till the day I die.

1397
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:30,571
You are the last girl in the world, I ever
thought would get maidenly hysterics.

1398
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:33,991
What's the matter with me, I'm
not supposed to have feelings?

1399
01:37:34,241 --> 01:37:36,202
I'm some sort of lizard or something?

1400
01:37:36,243 --> 01:37:39,038
Marsha, for heaven's sakes.
It's perfectly natural.

1401
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:42,124
Oh sure, natural for everyone
except for Marsha Zelenko.

1402
01:37:43,626 --> 01:37:46,544
Marjorie, have you any
idea how infuriating it

1403
01:37:46,545 --> 01:37:49,548
is for me to think of you
giving up Noel Airman?

1404
01:37:49,799 --> 01:37:51,801
Where did you get the will power?

1405
01:37:52,218 --> 01:37:54,512
What runs in your veins anyway, ammonia?

1406
01:37:55,346 --> 01:37:58,140
Look, you're madly in love with this man,

1407
01:37:58,182 --> 01:38:00,726
and he loves you the way he's
never loved any other girl.

1408
01:38:01,018 --> 01:38:05,022
Do you know what I would give for
one hour of such a love affair?

1409
01:38:05,272 --> 01:38:06,273
<i>My eyes!</i>

1410
01:38:08,234 --> 01:38:11,403
I know what you must think about
my marrying Lou Michaels.

1411
01:38:12,196 --> 01:38:13,781
Lou's a fine man.

1412
01:38:13,864 --> 01:38:15,865
I could get down on my
hands and knees and

1413
01:38:15,866 --> 01:38:17,910
kiss his hands for being
willing to take over.

1414
01:38:18,244 --> 01:38:21,247
And be good to me, and give my
family the things they want.

1415
01:38:23,415 --> 01:38:26,252
I haven't got a Noel Airman
in love with me.

1416
01:38:26,836 --> 01:38:30,089
If I had, I would follow
him around like a dog.

1417
01:38:30,798 --> 01:38:32,800
Oh, Marjorie, you fool.

1418
01:38:33,259 --> 01:38:35,553
You've got the whole
world's gold at your feet.

1419
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:38,806
Youth and good looks
and a wonderful lover.

1420
01:38:39,849 --> 01:38:42,977
And you toss it aside,
like so much garbage.

1421
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:47,189
<i>Marsha, for heaven's sake!</i>

1422
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:51,402
Oh! Oh! Sugar bun, go out there
and hold them at bay, would you?

1423
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:55,739
- Sure.
- Baby, forget everything I said.

1424
01:38:57,241 --> 01:38:59,910
I can't tell you why I've always loved you.

1425
01:39:00,327 --> 01:39:05,875
Or why I fuss over you so. But you'll
be alright. No matter what you do.

1426
01:39:06,333 --> 01:39:10,296
You're God's favorite.
Marjorie Morningstar.

1427
01:39:15,176 --> 01:39:17,178
Now. Run along, run along.

1428
01:39:23,976 --> 01:39:25,853
27 bucks.

1429
01:39:57,801 --> 01:40:02,306
Hello. I had a hunch you might be here.

1430
01:40:02,389 --> 01:40:04,725
That's why I'm braving this madhouse.

1431
01:40:05,643 --> 01:40:07,102
How are you, Noel?

1432
01:40:07,186 --> 01:40:10,189
Never better. You want a light?

1433
01:40:15,236 --> 01:40:18,572
I've still got the shakes. I
had the fever in Mexico.

1434
01:40:19,406 --> 01:40:21,033
I guess I look pretty awful.

1435
01:40:21,075 --> 01:40:23,077
I've seen you looking better.

1436
01:40:23,244 --> 01:40:26,247
Well, I'll return the compliment,
by saying, you've bloomed.

1437
01:40:27,331 --> 01:40:29,833
You're a woman, that's what.

1438
01:40:30,167 --> 01:40:32,378
A lovely beautiful woman.

1439
01:40:34,129 --> 01:40:35,339
Thank you.

1440
01:40:35,464 --> 01:40:37,633
Well, here's to sweet reunion.

1441
01:40:37,716 --> 01:40:40,719
Or maybe I should drink to Princess Jones.
It's almost finished, you know.

1442
01:40:41,262 --> 01:40:42,263
Oh, I didn't know.

1443
01:40:42,304 --> 01:40:46,225
Oh yes, it's great. Terrific.
Three producers interested.

1444
01:40:47,017 --> 01:40:49,019
If it's ever produced, I'll send you a check.

1445
01:40:49,395 --> 01:40:50,521
A check?

1446
01:40:51,188 --> 01:40:53,190
It's half yours, you know.

1447
01:40:53,774 --> 01:40:56,235
Everything about it is you.

1448
01:40:56,402 --> 01:40:58,487
The music is permeated by you.

1449
01:40:59,947 --> 01:41:02,658
I'm glad you're working so hard.

1450
01:41:05,244 --> 01:41:07,913
Marjorie, I thought about you incessantly.

1451
01:41:08,372 --> 01:41:09,790
Day and night.

1452
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,502
I need you, Marjorie.

1453
01:41:15,004 --> 01:41:17,214
I need you.

1454
01:41:44,867 --> 01:41:47,870
My friends, we are assembled
here in the presence of God...

1455
01:41:48,579 --> 01:41:50,831
to join this man and this
woman in marriage,

1456
01:41:51,749 --> 01:41:56,295
let us therefore remember that God has
established and sanctified marriage,

1457
01:41:56,587 --> 01:41:59,214
for the welfare and
happiness of mankind.

1458
01:41:59,548 --> 01:42:02,092
Do you Louis, take this
woman to be your wife,

1459
01:42:02,301 --> 01:42:05,512
<i>and will you pledge your trough
to her with all love and honor?</i>

1460
01:42:05,929 --> 01:42:07,431
<i>I do.</i>

1461
01:42:08,015 --> 01:42:10,351
<i>Do you, Marsha, take this
man to be your husband?</i>

1462
01:42:10,434 --> 01:42:13,520
<i>And will you pledge your trough
to him, in all love and honor?</i>

1463
01:42:13,687 --> 01:42:14,188
<i>I do.</i>

1464
01:42:14,355 --> 01:42:16,357
<i>The ring, please.</i>

1465
01:42:18,817 --> 01:42:21,194
<i>By the authority committed
unto me as a judge,</i>

1466
01:42:21,195 --> 01:42:24,573
<i>I declare Louis and Marsha,
are now husband and wife.</i>

1467
01:42:24,698 --> 01:42:28,702
<i>According to the ordinance of God, and
the law of the state of New York.</i>

1468
01:43:28,804 --> 01:43:30,180
This is the finale.

1469
01:43:30,305 --> 01:43:34,935
No dialog. Just a boy and girl under
white lights, on a naked stage.

1470
01:43:38,814 --> 01:43:41,358
Their dance sums up the theme of the show.

1471
01:43:41,733 --> 01:43:44,236
Man's eternal quest for beauty.

1472
01:44:04,381 --> 01:44:07,384
Magnificent, Noel!
Absolutely Magnificent.

1473
01:44:07,426 --> 01:44:10,429
Oh! Lou, darling, at last you're going
to be backing a show I can be proud of.

1474
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:13,182
Well, what do you say boys. Are
we gonna get our feet wet?

1475
01:44:13,474 --> 01:44:15,476
It's only money, Lou. Whatever you decide.

1476
01:44:15,642 --> 01:44:16,435
Likewise.

1477
01:44:16,477 --> 01:44:21,064
Let's ask a pro. Do you mind if we
consult with Wally, here, Noel?

1478
01:44:21,315 --> 01:44:22,441
Shall I leave the room?

1479
01:44:22,483 --> 01:44:25,736
I like it. It's you, Noel.
You've got my 8.30 for a ticket.

1480
01:44:26,069 --> 01:44:29,072
Yeah, but's it's gonna cost me
ant the boys here, a lot more.

1481
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:32,493
Now what do you honestly think of
it's commercial chances, Wally?

1482
01:44:32,868 --> 01:44:33,660
Lou!

1483
01:44:33,702 --> 01:44:35,662
No, no. Let him talk.

1484
01:44:35,787 --> 01:44:39,583
What me and my partners would like to know
is could this be another popular show?

1485
01:44:39,917 --> 01:44:41,543
Like the ones you do, Wally.

1486
01:44:41,752 --> 01:44:43,212
I mean, cash on the barrel head.

1487
01:44:43,337 --> 01:44:46,340
Lou, you are not in the
Fulton fish market.

1488
01:44:48,342 --> 01:44:50,010
Give it to me straight, Wally.

1489
01:44:50,552 --> 01:44:53,639
The only criticism, I can
offer is perhaps the ending.

1490
01:44:53,764 --> 01:44:57,267
I know it's terribly honest, Noel,
but it's a little tough to take.

1491
01:44:57,309 --> 01:44:59,102
I think Wally hit right on the button.

1492
01:44:59,269 --> 01:45:03,273
You got a great show here kid,
but cut out all that hogwash.

1493
01:45:03,315 --> 01:45:06,359
Make that last scene, a
plain honest love scene.

1494
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,903
With a nice clinch at the end.

1495
01:45:08,111 --> 01:45:10,113
Like Wally ends his shows.

1496
01:45:10,322 --> 01:45:13,324
What you'd like to see at the
finish, is a straight love scene.

1497
01:45:13,325 --> 01:45:16,620
Boy get's girl. They ride
off into the sunset.

1498
01:45:17,079 --> 01:45:18,080
Is that it?

1499
01:45:18,539 --> 01:45:20,249
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

1500
01:45:20,374 --> 01:45:24,461
And the rest of the show makes you and your
lawyer, and your associates, very happy?

1501
01:45:24,628 --> 01:45:26,630
It's got a big chance, Noel.

1502
01:45:26,672 --> 01:45:29,675
Personally, I would be happier if
there were a few more jokes in it,

1503
01:45:29,716 --> 01:45:32,469
But you know me, I only
like, what the people like.

1504
01:45:32,761 --> 01:45:35,013
What's more important, is what Noel likes.

1505
01:45:35,347 --> 01:45:37,724
He should end it, the way
he believes it should end.

1506
01:45:38,016 --> 01:45:40,352
Oh, you boys belong to the same union, huh?

1507
01:45:41,103 --> 01:45:43,230
Ok, Noel. Do what you like, we're in.

1508
01:45:43,981 --> 01:45:45,566
And I have your consent to go ahead?

1509
01:45:45,816 --> 01:45:48,652
Oh, you've got more than that.
You've got our money.

1510
01:45:52,406 --> 01:45:56,952
Oh, I see, and that's why you think
you have the right to judge me.

1511
01:45:58,704 --> 01:46:01,290
Who do you think you are?

1512
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:04,126
What are you people doing
in the theater anyway?

1513
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:07,671
So you can put on a tuxedo
and come to opening night?

1514
01:46:07,921 --> 01:46:11,508
How dare you put me on trial like this. Have
you ever created anything in your lives?

1515
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:12,134
Noel!

1516
01:46:12,175 --> 01:46:15,596
You. How do you make all that
money you're patronizing me with?

1517
01:46:15,721 --> 01:46:16,847
And what do you peddle?

1518
01:46:17,431 --> 01:46:19,474
When was the last time that a girl
made love to you and meant it?

1519
01:46:19,516 --> 01:46:20,559
Shut up Noel.

1520
01:46:21,018 --> 01:46:24,104
You, counselor. You look
reasonably intelligent,

1521
01:46:24,313 --> 01:46:26,773
Tell me, how do you get yourself
to work for these people?

1522
01:46:26,857 --> 01:46:29,276
Sit in the same room,
breathe the same air??

1523
01:46:29,526 --> 01:46:33,739
Oh! I don't condemn you. No, I envy you!

1524
01:46:33,905 --> 01:46:36,742
Tell me how you do it, cause
I'd like to do it too.

1525
01:46:37,034 --> 01:46:40,287
You've got it made. You've got it made.
You've all got it made!

1526
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:42,956
Success, oozes from all of you.

1527
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,751
It covers you like a
coat of heavy grease.

1528
01:46:45,876 --> 01:46:47,586
It's disgusting.

1529
01:46:53,467 --> 01:46:59,431
No wait a minute. Don't walk out on me.
I'm sorry.

1530
01:46:59,723 --> 01:47:03,435
Michelson, let me do my show.
Everything I've lived for...

1531
01:47:04,978 --> 01:47:07,856
I've hoped for, I've poured into this show.

1532
01:47:07,898 --> 01:47:11,735
It can't fail. I promise
you, the show won't fail.

1533
01:47:20,077 --> 01:47:21,995
The guy is a screwball.

1534
01:47:22,287 --> 01:47:25,791
I didn't understand anything
tonight, except he doesn't like us.

1535
01:47:25,874 --> 01:47:28,001
The trouble with you
guys, is that you don't

1536
01:47:28,043 --> 01:47:30,003
know genius, when it
hits you in the head.

1537
01:47:30,087 --> 01:47:31,880
- Thanks, Lou,
- Sure.

1538
01:47:32,172 --> 01:47:34,174
There's a lot of good stuff in this show.

1539
01:47:34,424 --> 01:47:36,426
You guys wanna pull out, I'll go it alone.

1540
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:38,095
Who's pulling out?
We're businessmen.

1541
01:47:38,178 --> 01:47:39,471
We're not touchy.

1542
01:47:41,014 --> 01:47:42,808
I hope he has a hit.

1543
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,559
He can't lose.

1544
01:47:44,893 --> 01:47:46,019
He's got Marjorie.

1545
01:47:46,436 --> 01:47:48,480
Well, welcome to the club.

1546
01:48:05,163 --> 01:48:06,164
Oh, Papa!

1547
01:48:07,499 --> 01:48:09,000
Hello, Darling.

1548
01:48:09,459 --> 01:48:12,587
Look, they're still ice
skating in the park.

1549
01:48:13,213 --> 01:48:15,716
I was just standing here, watching them.

1550
01:48:16,299 --> 01:48:20,303
I... I used to bring here your
mother down here from the Bronx.

1551
01:48:21,054 --> 01:48:26,059
- Its, it's a beautiful park.
- Are you alright, Papa?

1552
01:48:27,185 --> 01:48:29,020
I'm fine, darling.

1553
01:48:29,187 --> 01:48:32,524
You're not worried about business?

1554
01:48:32,733 --> 01:48:38,572
Business. It's up, it's down. What
fun would it be if it never changed?

1555
01:48:39,656 --> 01:48:44,661
You know, I used to be pretty
good on ice skates myself.

1556
01:48:45,412 --> 01:48:48,999
Yeah. I just can't picture
you doing figure eights.

1557
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:55,130
Well, fifteen, twenty years.
It's a long time.

1558
01:48:56,006 --> 01:48:59,009
I was just about his age.

1559
01:48:59,718 --> 01:49:01,219
Whose?

1560
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:09,470
Noel's. He, he has fine qualities.
He has a lot of fine qualities.

1561
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:14,024
And if that's it. That's it.
He'll be our son.

1562
01:49:14,191 --> 01:49:16,193
- But, Papa.
- And you can have the wedding anytime.

1563
01:49:16,610 --> 01:49:20,614
Right now. Next month.
A catered wedding.

1564
01:49:20,906 --> 01:49:22,908
From Lowenstein.

1565
01:49:23,116 --> 01:49:24,868
With a white dress.

1566
01:49:27,204 --> 01:49:29,414
You do not understand, Papa.

1567
01:49:32,834 --> 01:49:37,464
What would we live on? Noel
has no income, not yet.

1568
01:49:39,174 --> 01:49:41,384
He could live here, can't he?

1569
01:49:41,593 --> 01:49:44,387
I mean, who needs all this room?

1570
01:49:45,931 --> 01:49:48,934
I don't think that would work.

1571
01:49:49,851 --> 01:49:51,770
This won't work either.

1572
01:49:52,354 --> 01:49:53,563
I'm not blind.

1573
01:49:53,730 --> 01:49:56,107
You've changed. He's changing you.

1574
01:49:56,775 --> 01:49:58,568
I haven't changed.

1575
01:49:59,277 --> 01:50:00,320
I haven't.

1576
01:50:01,655 --> 01:50:05,283
Maybe what I'm doing is wrong.
I don't know.

1577
01:50:05,534 --> 01:50:07,327
I'm in love.

1578
01:50:18,588 --> 01:50:19,589
Maybe.

1579
01:50:21,633 --> 01:50:24,010
Maybe I should have spent
more time with you.

1580
01:50:25,512 --> 01:50:26,888
I have been neglectful.

1581
01:50:29,474 --> 01:50:33,311
Noel and I are going to be married.
Just as soon as his show is finished.

1582
01:50:34,646 --> 01:50:36,189
Will that make you happy?

1583
01:50:36,565 --> 01:50:38,984
I want anything that
makes you happy.

1584
01:50:39,234 --> 01:50:41,695
You're always giving me things, Papa.

1585
01:50:43,196 --> 01:50:45,031
What have I ever given you?

1586
01:50:46,533 --> 01:50:48,535
Someone to love.

1587
01:50:53,707 --> 01:50:55,709
Good night my Darling.

1588
01:51:26,865 --> 01:51:29,743
What did you think?
Wasn't it beautiful?

1589
01:51:30,076 --> 01:51:32,412
Sex! You know, I've never
seen sex like that.

1590
01:51:32,495 --> 01:51:36,750
And those costumes the girls wore. I
could have sold him the peppers at cost.

1591
01:51:36,875 --> 01:51:38,376
Sugar bun!

1592
01:51:38,585 --> 01:51:40,086
Oh, Marsha.

1593
01:51:40,587 --> 01:51:44,799
Oh darling! What a triumph.
It was absolutely stupendous.

1594
01:51:45,133 --> 01:51:49,220
- Marsha, did you really like it?
- Like it? Darling, I was overwhelmed.

1595
01:51:49,888 --> 01:51:51,806
Look, why don't you join us?
Noel is coming

1596
01:51:51,848 --> 01:51:53,934
over to the house later
with some of the cast.

1597
01:51:54,059 --> 01:51:56,061
And we're gonna sit
up for the reviews.

1598
01:51:56,353 --> 01:51:57,311
Ok, Lou?

1599
01:51:57,312 --> 01:52:00,148
You run along with them.
I'll wait up for the paper.

1600
01:52:10,617 --> 01:52:12,118
Well, Well?

1601
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:19,918
Say something.

1602
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:21,628
We were crucified.

1603
01:52:21,711 --> 01:52:22,837
No!

1604
01:52:24,923 --> 01:52:27,008
I told him to change the ending.

1605
01:52:28,176 --> 01:52:31,179
Oh! Those critics, what do they know?

1606
01:52:31,221 --> 01:52:32,305
I tell you, it'll run a year.

1607
01:52:32,347 --> 01:52:34,849
- Where's Noel.
- I left him, backstage.

1608
01:52:35,934 --> 01:52:38,853
- Did he read these?
- <i>Every word.</i>

1609
01:52:49,197 --> 01:52:50,198
Noel?

1610
01:52:54,995 --> 01:52:55,996
Noel?

1611
01:53:09,134 --> 01:53:10,093
Noel?

1612
01:53:46,546 --> 01:53:48,256
<i>Marjorie, darling.</i>

1613
01:53:49,382 --> 01:53:51,217
I have come to take you home.

1614
01:53:52,385 --> 01:53:55,263
Papa, he's gone.

1615
01:54:03,938 --> 01:54:05,690
Come home, Marjorie.

1616
01:54:06,441 --> 01:54:08,151
I'm not going home.

1617
01:54:08,568 --> 01:54:09,903
I going to Noel.

1618
01:54:10,445 --> 01:54:11,654
Where is he?

1619
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,865
I don't know.

1620
01:54:15,075 --> 01:54:17,535
He said, I mustn't look for him.

1621
01:54:17,869 --> 01:54:19,871
I should forget him.

1622
01:54:20,747 --> 01:54:22,165
Maybe.

1623
01:54:22,916 --> 01:54:24,793
Maybe it's better this way.

1624
01:54:25,043 --> 01:54:27,003
You don't understand.

1625
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:29,798
Noel's been hurt. Terribly.

1626
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:33,635
He's ashamed. Ashamed to face me, a failure.

1627
01:54:34,094 --> 01:54:38,306
- Don't you see. Don't you see that?
- Yes, darling. I see.

1628
01:54:39,516 --> 01:54:42,352
Wherever he is. I
have to help him.

1629
01:54:42,435 --> 01:54:43,895
But what's the use?

1630
01:54:43,937 --> 01:54:45,355
He needs me.

1631
01:54:45,438 --> 01:54:46,648
I have to find him.

1632
01:54:47,023 --> 01:54:50,819
<i>I have to find him,
don't you understand?</i>

1633
01:55:15,802 --> 01:55:17,595
Thank you very much, Sir.

1634
01:55:17,762 --> 01:55:20,265
- Oh, good afternoon, Miss Morgenstern.
- Good afternoon.

1635
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:21,808
- Any calls?
- No. Miss?

1636
01:55:21,891 --> 01:55:23,893
- No letters?
- No, Miss.

1637
01:55:23,977 --> 01:55:26,271
Oh, there's a gentleman
waiting to see you.

1638
01:55:27,605 --> 01:55:30,316
- Where is he?
- In the foyer.

1639
01:55:39,492 --> 01:55:40,577
Noel.

1640
01:55:42,453 --> 01:55:43,746
Disappointed?

1641
01:55:43,997 --> 01:55:50,003
Oh, Wally! You don't know what
it means to see a friendly face.

1642
01:55:50,086 --> 01:55:53,882
Welcome to London. Scene of the
newest and greatest Wronkin triumph.

1643
01:55:54,924 --> 01:55:57,177
Seats available for all performances.

1644
01:55:57,468 --> 01:55:59,595
How on earth did you ever find me here?

1645
01:55:59,596 --> 01:56:01,514
How does a pigeon find it's roost?

1646
01:56:01,848 --> 01:56:04,642
Put me within 50 miles of you, and
all the bloodhound comes out.

1647
01:56:08,813 --> 01:56:10,523
I wish I had some of that bloodhound in me.

1648
01:56:11,733 --> 01:56:14,819
I take it you're searching
for the elusive Mr. Airman?

1649
01:56:15,361 --> 01:56:16,487
Where have you looked?

1650
01:56:17,363 --> 01:56:18,865
Where haven't I looked?

1651
01:56:19,574 --> 01:56:21,910
Vienna, Paris, Zurich.

1652
01:56:22,493 --> 01:56:24,162
I know he came to London.

1653
01:56:24,621 --> 01:56:26,039
But I don't know where.

1654
01:56:26,414 --> 01:56:29,417
Has it ever occurred to you that
maybe he doesn't want to be found?

1655
01:56:29,876 --> 01:56:31,377
I know that.

1656
01:56:31,753 --> 01:56:33,630
Why are you so persistent?

1657
01:56:34,505 --> 01:56:37,091
You don't have to ask me that, Wally!

1658
01:56:37,675 --> 01:56:39,469
So you find him. Then what?

1659
01:56:39,969 --> 01:56:41,888
Some more of the same,
all over again?

1660
01:56:43,264 --> 01:56:45,892
Marjorie, people in love aren't
always good for each other.

1661
01:56:47,602 --> 01:56:49,896
There isn't anything you can tell
me, I don't already know.

1662
01:56:50,772 --> 01:56:54,275
Don't you think I've wished a hundred
times that I'd never met Noel Airman?

1663
01:56:54,317 --> 01:56:56,277
Oh, stop talking like
you've invented something.

1664
01:56:56,319 --> 01:56:58,613
There's a Noel Airman in every girls life.

1665
01:56:58,947 --> 01:57:00,740
Most of them are
luckier than you.

1666
01:57:00,782 --> 01:57:03,576
They manage to get over
him by the first summer.

1667
01:57:05,078 --> 01:57:06,329
Look who's Talking.

1668
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:09,666
How many summers have I
been carrying around the

1669
01:57:09,707 --> 01:57:12,043
memory of a girl under
some colored lanterns?

1670
01:57:16,798 --> 01:57:18,841
If only it'd been you, Wally.

1671
01:57:19,842 --> 01:57:22,136
How simple it all would have been.

1672
01:57:22,971 --> 01:57:25,974
Well, nothing ever
comes easy for me.

1673
01:57:27,558 --> 01:57:29,435
We're alike, aren't we?

1674
01:57:29,727 --> 01:57:31,354
So very much alike.

1675
01:57:35,692 --> 01:57:39,028
Marjorie... Noel is at South Wind.

1676
01:57:40,613 --> 01:57:42,615
South Wind?

1677
01:57:42,657 --> 01:57:43,616
How do you know?

1678
01:57:43,741 --> 01:57:45,326
I loaned him the money to get there.

1679
01:57:47,412 --> 01:57:48,371
Oh, Wally!

1680
01:57:48,413 --> 01:57:50,415
Don't go to him. Let him alone.

1681
01:57:50,623 --> 01:57:51,958
He needs help!

1682
01:57:52,041 --> 01:57:53,042
Not yours.

1683
01:57:53,167 --> 01:57:55,878
Maybe you can take one more swing
around the merry go round,

1684
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,755
but Noel can't. It'll destroy him.

1685
01:57:58,172 --> 01:57:59,674
What are you saying?

1686
01:57:59,841 --> 01:58:01,592
Noel has to find himself.

1687
01:58:01,634 --> 01:58:03,636
He do not belong at South Wind.

1688
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:06,472
Marjorie, don't you see,
Noel doesnt belong there.

1689
01:58:06,514 --> 01:58:09,726
He can't rise any higher.
You made him think he could.

1690
01:58:09,892 --> 01:58:11,811
He tried to and almost
broke his heart trying.

1691
01:58:12,854 --> 01:58:14,147
I like Noel, too.

1692
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,357
Without him, I don't know where I'd be today.

1693
01:58:16,774 --> 01:58:18,651
That's why I want to see him happy.

1694
01:58:19,569 --> 01:58:22,154
- But I'll make him happy.
- He's happy without you.

1695
01:58:22,155 --> 01:58:25,158
South Wind is the only place
on earth, where he's somebody.

1696
01:58:25,450 --> 01:58:26,868
Where he's important.

1697
01:58:27,618 --> 01:58:29,912
If you love him, stay away from him.

1698
01:58:30,455 --> 01:58:31,914
I won't listen to you.

1699
01:58:32,832 --> 01:58:34,834
Alright, go to him.

1700
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:37,920
I've waited for you to grow up.

1701
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:41,215
I thought you had.

1702
01:58:42,091 --> 01:58:43,801
Goodbye, Marjorie.

1703
01:58:43,885 --> 01:58:51,885
I will always love you.

1704
02:00:41,502 --> 02:00:44,505
<i>Isn't that Noel Airman, simply marvelous?</i>

1705
02:00:45,923 --> 02:00:47,175
I wish you wouldn't look at him that way.

1706
02:00:47,258 --> 02:00:50,261
How can I help it, when
I'm seeing real genius?

1707
02:01:36,098 --> 02:01:37,600
Marjorie!

1708
02:01:38,142 --> 02:01:41,145
- Marjorie Morningstar!
- Hello, Mr. Greech.

1709
02:01:41,354 --> 02:01:43,105
Good to see you again.

1710
02:01:44,482 --> 02:01:47,944
Say, You've really grown up, haven't you?

1711
02:01:50,821 --> 02:01:51,822
Yes.

1712
02:01:53,741 --> 02:02:01,741
I think I have.
