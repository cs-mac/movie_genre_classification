1
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,725
<i>I was born</i>
<i>in 1962 at Coral Gables Hospital,</i>

2
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,812
<i>located on the University</i>
<i>of Miami campus.</i>

3
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,940
<i>My parents like to brag</i>
<i>that their baby was so smart</i>

4
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,736
<i>that she was already in college</i>
<i>the day she was born.</i>

5
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,907
<i>I was given the name Cozy after</i>
<i>my father's favorite Jazz drummer-</i>

6
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,909
<i>Cozy Cole.</i>

7
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,453
<i>My mother left us when I was 10.</i>

8
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:22,124
<i>My father always liked to say</i>
<i>that she ran away to join the circus.</i>

9
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,504
<i>I like to think of her there in</i>
<i>a sequined cape flying through the air</i>

10
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,590
<i>without a single net to catch her fall.</i>

11
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,093
<i>Dad was never a religious man,</i>

12
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,426
<i>but after Mom left,</i>
<i>he decided to raise me Catholic.</i>

13
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,182
<i>On Sundays, I went to mass,</i>

14
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:42,978
<i>and on the first Wednesday of every
month, I was sent to confession.</i>

15
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:47,108
<i>Since I could never bring myself</i>
<i>to confess any of my real sins,</i>

16
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,858
<i>I kept four made-up sins</i>
<i>that I used over and over again.</i>

17
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,824
<i>Though Bobby and I</i>
<i>had never touched,</i>

18
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,827
<i>he wrote me poems</i>
<i>all through high school.</i>

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,664
<i>Later, I accepted his proposal</i>
<i>for marriage.</i>

20
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:07,997
<i>I knew Bobby loved me and figured someday
I'd probably grow to love him too.</i>

21
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,258
<i>We purchased our new home</i>
<i>through a city auction.</i>

22
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,971
<i>The previous owner had murdered her husband
and buried him inside the shower wall.</i>

23
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,182
<i>Bobby said</i>
<i>aside from being affordable,</i>

24
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,933
<i>the house was also</i>
<i>a good conversation piece.</i>

25
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,277
<i>I often thought about this woman and
wondered what made her act so violently.</i>

26
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,196
<i>I guess it wasn't any one big thing,</i>

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,447
<i>but a lot of little things that just grew</i>
<i>deeper and deeper under her skin.</i>

28
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,500
Freeze! Police!

29
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:47,997
<i>Most tourists visit the Miami area
for its beaches on the east coast,</i>

30
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,377
<i>but if you ever mistakenly got on the
Palmetto Expressway and headed west,</i>

31
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>you'd run right into</i>
<i>the Florida Everglades,</i>

32
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:01,343
<i>an area that Indians</i>
<i>like to call "the River of Grass."</i>

33
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,638
<i>People used to think this area</i>
<i>was uninhabitable</i>

34
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,474
<i>but more and more</i>
<i>it's becoming civilized,</i>

35
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,518
<i>and they say that within two years</i>

36
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,435
<i>there will be a shopping center</i>
<i>every 15 miles.</i>

37
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,954
Thanks.

38
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:01,862
<i>I've heard it said that the mother-child</i>
<i>bond begins at birth.</i>

39
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,530
<i>For me, this Never occurred.</i>

40
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,368
<i>And on some days,</i>
<i>I'd sit at my window for hours</i>

41
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:13,873
<i>just waiting for a nice couple in a big station
wagon to come and take these kids away.</i>

42
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,460
<i>Too much daydreaming left me blue.</i>

43
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,421
<i>So while Bobby worked day and night,</i>

44
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:23,755
<i>I stayed home and tried</i>
<i>to make the best of my time.</i>

45
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,494
This guy's sitting at the bar
like a dead fish not talking to anyone,

46
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,414
when this redhead comes up
and takes a seat next to him.

47
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,416
They strike up a conversation.

48
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,419
Eventually,
the conversation turns to sex.

49
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:02,089
She says, "Great. I like kinky sex too.
Let's go to my place."

50
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,172
So they go to her place.

51
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,677
He goes in the bathroom.

52
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,471
She takes off all of her clothes
and gets under the covers.

53
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,559
After a couple of minutes, he comes out of
the bathroom. He's straightening his tie.

54
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,519
He says- She says,
"Hey, where you going?"

55
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,936
He says, "I'm through.
I already shit in your purse."

56
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,026
Freeze! Police!

57
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,810
Well, that's the best one I know.

58
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,978
If that doesn't help,
I can only offer more booze.

59
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:08,530
<i>It's funny how</i>
<i>a single day could drag and drag</i>

60
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:12,114
<i>while entire years</i>
<i>just flip by in a flash.</i>

61
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,164
<i>Once I calculated</i>
<i>how many hours old I was</i>

62
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,501
<i>and then estimated how many</i>
<i>more hours there were to go.</i>

63
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,086
<i>On another day,</i>

64
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,757
<i>I made a list of every person</i>
<i>I had ever known.</i>

65
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,218
<i>I wondered if any of these people</i>
<i>knew each other</i>

66
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,888
<i>and if there was any chance</i>
<i>that they were all together now</i>

67
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,308
<i>having a party or swimming in a pool.</i>

68
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:42,313
<i>Then I wondered if there was any other
person on this planet as lonely as me.</i>

69
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:47,814
<i>As it turned out, there was,</i>
<i>and he was living just a county away.</i>

70
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,860
8:00, Lee.

71
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,358
First thing this morning, right,
my dad's out on a run.

72
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,153
So I'm just, like,
hanging out, having a cigarette,

73
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,323
and I notice something on the end
of the road there, you know.

74
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,533
I couldn't really make out what it was.

75
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,662
From here, it looked like a gun.

76
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,873
So we go over to check it out.

77
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,920
Sure enough there it is- a fucking gun
laying right at the edge of the street.

78
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,840
What, like a real gun?
Yes, like a very real gun.

79
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:17,844
I got it hidden in the back there
in some boxes. It makes me nervous.

80
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,513
Well, what kind of gun?

81
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,641
I don't know.
It's black with a brown handle.

82
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,726
Do you know anything about guns?

83
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,229
Doug,
you coming to work today?

84
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,148
Look, you gonna be around later?
I'll bring it on by.

85
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,025
Julie giving you the night out?

86
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,695
Working a little late.
You gonna be around or-

87
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,154
Yeah, I'm around.

88
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,488
Shoot up the neighborhood.
Sure, Dougie.

89
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,552
You sick or something?

90
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,429
Hi, Dad.

91
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,557
Oh, you smell like a bottle of gin.

92
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,308
I'm doing a little undercover work,

93
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:10,647
and just so happens this guy I'm
tailing likes to spend his life in a bar.

94
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,276
<i>There seems to be</i>
<i>no telling which way a life will go.</i>

95
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:19,406
<i>In his younger days, my father played drums
in after-hours clubs all around Miami.</i>

96
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,825
<i>A few times he even played New York.</i>

97
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,244
<i>But when my mother</i>
<i>became pregnant with me,</i>

98
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:29,458
<i>he gave it all up and settled into a
steady job as a crime scene detective.</i>

99
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,002
<i>He said that the law was a straight line</i>

100
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:37,002
<i>and that no man could stand firmly</i>
<i>with a foot on each side.</i>

101
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,945
Yeah. Ned Bishop.
Fucking guy shot my fish.

102
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,530
I asked the guy for a net.

103
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,450
Next thing, he's firing
his fucking UZI into the water.

104
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,286
Blew a hole like this
right through my fish.

105
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,079
Who goes fishing without a net?

106
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,957
Men, I'd like you to meet my wife.

107
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,959
- This is Mary.
- Hello.

108
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,756
I hate to bust up the little party
you gentlemen have going here,

109
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,801
but I came to see you, Ryder.

110
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,553
So rather than have you drag
yourself out in the daylight,

111
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,056
I figured I'd grab you here tonight.

112
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,889
So if you don't mind.

113
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,718
An officer doesn't just lose his gun

114
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,346
any more than
he just looses his hand.

115
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,849
His weapon
is an extension of his body.

116
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,725
Now I may be a little
idealistic here, Ryder,

117
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,688
but I'd like to think that an officer,
if he did lose his gun-

118
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,316
an officer, that is, who's been in the
department for some 30-odd years-

119
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,237
that he might, just might
have a small sliver of recall

120
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,737
as to the where and the when.

121
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,285
I'm putting you on
a week's suspension, Ryder.

122
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,872
A detective from the internal affairs will
be assigned to investigate the situation.

123
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,455
I think I can find my own gun.

124
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,909
Man, I could shoot my way
right out of here.

125
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,620
Come on, Lee, they're not
exactly holding you hostage.

126
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,246
No kidding.

127
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,666
My grandmother keeps running in and
out of here with her tape measure.

128
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,250
She's gonna give you the boot?

129
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,257
I've been in this room my whole life.

130
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,552
Yeah, and you've hated it
your whole life.

131
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,430
You know, you're gonna be 30
in a few months.

132
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,183
Maybe, you know,
you should go out of here.

133
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,435
Do a little traveling, see the world.

134
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,354
Maybe even join the service.

135
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,649
The service?
Fuck the service, man.

136
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,527
I hate flying.
I hate camping. I hate jumping.

137
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,363
They don't make you fly.

138
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,449
Oh, yeah? You ever heard
of anybody driving off to war?

139
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,953
See the world.

140
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,497
I don't see you
seeing the world, Dougie.

141
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,960
I see you working at your father's shop
till you drop dead from the fumes.

142
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,464
Well, maybe that's the sad truth.

143
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,692
Look, now you got me all depressed.
I'm gonna go.

144
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,532
See you later.

145
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,085
Hey, I forgot the gun.

146
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,175
You know, I don't even know
what I should do with this thing.

147
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,347
I mean, I can't keep it at the apartment.
Guns just flip Julie out.

148
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,433
Julie.

149
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,435
Why don't you go out there
and sell it to my mom?

150
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,187
Come on. Seriously.

151
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,692
I don't know, you could sell it in one
of those bars out in Broward County.

152
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,360
Broward?

153
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,320
I can't go to Broward.

154
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,154
I'm out of my element in Broward.

155
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,872
I'll see you later.

156
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,804
Hey, Lee.

157
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,807
Maybe you want to try selling it?

158
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,733
8:00, Lee.

159
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,069
Get the fuck out of here!

160
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,270
Morning, Cozy.

161
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,147
Hey, J.C.

162
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:32,278
Looks like you're dropping a new pup
every time the wind changes direction.

163
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,988
How's Shelley doing?

164
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,784
She's good. Been seeing some boy
from over at the junior college.

165
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,911
<i>You see them everywhere you look.</i>

166
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,914
<i>And I don't know why</i>
<i>I never thought of it before,</i>

167
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,416
<i>but one day I just started wondering-</i>

168
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,961
<i>where are all</i>
<i>those highways heading?</i>

169
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,131
That new captain, he just
doesn't understand your dad.

170
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,843
They got off on the wrong foot when Ortiz told
him he couldn't bring animals into the, uh-

171
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,719
into the office anymore.

172
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:02,308
<i>Most people don't stop to consider that four
out of five murder victims are pet owners.</i>

173
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:06,980
Your dad can't seem to manage leaving
the scene without those animals.

174
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,108
Ortiz gets on board
and lays down the "no pets" law.

175
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:16,108
Your dad took it real hard and things
haven't been going smoothly since.

176
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,617
Hey, looks like they're
gonna finish the highway yet.

177
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:24,122
Pretty looking with all the, uh,
tar all new and sparkly like that.

178
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,375
I better get these babies
home before they burn up.

179
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,585
Good enough.

180
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,255
You be careful driving now.

181
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,448
I don't know how you manage
working all night and sleeping all day.

182
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:08,833
I have a horrible time
sleeping during the day.

183
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,669
Well, after 30 years or so,
you get use to it.

184
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,089
Well, I'd never get used to it.

185
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,345
Not that I wouldn't enjoy
a little catnap.

186
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,069
<i>They say that</i>
<i>the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.</i>

187
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,738
<i>I found this puzzling</i>
<i>and couldn't stop wondering-</i>

188
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,033
<i>are our lives all mapped out for us?</i>

189
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,912
<i>Would my daughter grow up</i>
<i>only to wear my shoes?</i>

190
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,666
<i>Did my mother's life</i>
<i>create my destiny,</i>

191
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,293
<i>or does one thing just trigger another?</i>

192
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,211
What's with the locks?

193
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,675
Hey, what's with the locks?

194
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,850
Grandma, all my stuff's in there!

195
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,068
Grandma, open the fucking door!

196
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:16,307
Uh, you driving that blue
Malibu out there? Why?

197
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,019
Well, you almost just ran me
over a minute ago. That was you?

198
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,605
Yeah.

199
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,366
So can I buy you a drink,

200
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,327
seeing as how I almost
ran you over and everything?

201
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,955
Okay. Yeah.

202
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,288
What are you drinking?
How about a beer?

203
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,636
I'm Lee. I'm sorry about tonight.

204
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,138
Cozy.
What?

205
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,100
I'm Cozy.

206
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,143
Yeah, it's nice in here.

207
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,229
No, I mean that's my name.

208
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,022
It is not.

209
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,692
Your mother give you that name?

210
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,775
Cozy. It's a funny name.

211
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:20,079
You meeting somebody
here tonight, Cozy?

212
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,873
No, I just had the urge to get out.

213
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,751
Yeah. I had the urge to drink.

214
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,173
So, it's fate.

215
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,527
So what were you doing
out in that pasture anyway?

216
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:54,111
Just taking a little shortcut.

217
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:58,618
Not afraid of some old bull
chasing after you?

218
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:02,371
No. The cow in that pasture
died during the last rain.

219
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,123
Oh.

220
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,126
Yeah, I guess cows
aren't really built for swimming.

221
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:11,126
No, it didn't drown.
It got struck by lightning.

222
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,301
That would be a bad way to go.

223
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,218
Well, I could think of worse ways.

224
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,598
Really?

225
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,812
You're not from around here,
are you?

226
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,648
Nope.

227
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm from Dade.

228
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,529
Actually, I was from Dade.

229
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,866
I'm kind of in limbo right now.

230
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,994
Limbo. That sounds nice.

231
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,676
This I found...

232
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,260
in a waiting room.

233
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,346
It's good luck.

234
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,183
Mom.

235
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,977
That's fucking George.

236
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:12,191
That's a picture of my pride and joy.

237
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,567
And this...

238
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,361
that's all that's left of my white Nova.

239
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,243
Are you trying to impress me?

240
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:26,330
Is it working? Well,
what else you got?

241
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,714
Mom?

242
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:38,634
But we already have mom here.

243
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,913
Hey, Cozy?
Yeah, I got to get going.

244
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,582
Hey, you feel like going for a swim?

245
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,917
I got a friend with a pool.
He lets me use it whenever I want.

246
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:15,129
No, I can't. I got to go home.
Come on. It's Friday night.

247
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,922
I'd drive you back home afterwards.

248
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,425
Or back to that cow pasture
you crawled out of.

249
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:23,508
I just can't. Come on. Not
even for half an hour?

250
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,743
That's good.

251
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,033
Nobody broke in here.

252
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,703
She got dressed up and went out.

253
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,538
You two have a fight?

254
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,456
Yeah, I guess.

255
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,084
More like an argument really.

256
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,587
She take a suitcase?

257
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,798
No, she didn't take her suitcase.

258
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,223
What's the gun for?

259
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,100
Belongs to a friend of mine.

260
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,561
You kill anybody with it?

261
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,980
No.

262
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,940
I killed my dog.

263
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,859
You shot your dog?

264
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,737
No, he got run over.

265
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,156
And you were driving?

266
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:52,161
No, but I'm the one who let him out.

267
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,217
Oh, shit!

268
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,232
Shit! Fuck!

269
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,025
Goddamn it!

270
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:08,153
I can't believe it. Shit!

271
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,334
Do you think we killed him?

272
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,173
Cozy.

273
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,845
We should just get out of here.

274
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,890
Hit the road,
maybe go up north somewhere.

275
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:40,019
Just lay low till things blow over.

276
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,080
<i>Did you ever wonder</i>
<i>what it would be like</i>

277
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:44,333
<i>to be held up</i>
<i>in some motel somewhere,</i>

278
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,419
<i>seeing your life played out on TV,</i>

279
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:51,503
<i>knowing that the whole world</i>
<i>was looking for you?</i>

280
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:14,066
You know, this place
is pretty creepy looking in the daylight.

281
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:24,289
You don't by chance carry around
a toothbrush with you, do you?

282
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,666
Oh, shit!

283
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,293
There's a palmetto bug in there!
Don't let him come out!

284
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,504
Well, give me something to smash it with.
Well, hold on.

285
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,007
Shit! We don't even
have our shoes.

286
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,219
Here!

287
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,973
Ahh!
Did you get him?

288
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,851
Give me another Bible.
Here! Here!

289
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:44,852
Shoot it!

290
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,816
I think I peed in my pants.

291
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,359
Is it dead yet?

292
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:56,859
I don't know. I shot the shit
out of the tiles though.

293
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,750
Okay, okay. I'll be right out.

294
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:16,672
They ought to give
my grandmother a job here.

295
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,260
If you're staying, it's 20 more dollars.

296
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,608
Uh-

297
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:41,033
Uh, the thing is, uh- is 16 good?

298
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,619
No, 20 is good.

299
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,433
Bitch.

300
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,849
Let's get out of here.

301
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,946
<i>Lee and I had crossed</i>
<i>that straight line</i>

302
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,823
<i>that Dad called the law,</i>

303
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,991
<i>and I could feel the butterflies</i>
<i>in my stomach</i>

304
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,328
<i>as I tumbled deeper</i>
<i>into a life of crime.</i>

305
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,415
<i>After all, murder was thicker</i>
<i>than marriage,</i>

306
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:20,498
<i>and Lee and I were now bound</i>
<i>by the life we took.</i>

307
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,589
<i>Being a wanted man</i>
<i>made Lee restless,</i>

308
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:29,594
<i>and he swore he'd never sleep soundly
until we were well out of Florida.</i>

309
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,431
<i>So he stole</i>
<i>his mother's record collection</i>

310
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,684
<i>figuring even if we only got</i>
<i>a dollar a record,</i>

311
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,936
<i>we would still have enough money</i>
<i>to fill the tank</i>

312
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:42,186
<i>and make Miami a mere speck</i>
<i>in our rearview mirror.</i>

313
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,392
It was just like
I told the officer last night.

314
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,144
I heard some voices and some rustlin'.

315
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,688
I got my light. I came out back.

316
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,482
I saw her sitting right over there,

317
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:26,026
pointing a gun right at me.

318
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,820
It was as if she
was there waiting for me.

319
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:34,238
Did you get a look at the person
she was with? No, sir, I didn't.

320
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,246
I'm driving.

321
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,984
He's waitin'.

322
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,694
Couple minutes go by.

323
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,071
So she finally walks up,
and the guy's all dressed.

324
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,739
She goes, "Hey, where you goin'?"

325
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,849
"I already shit in your purse."
I've heard it.

326
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:59,100
Oh, shit on you. Hey, man.

327
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:06,914
You got some really nice-
This is real nice stuff here.

328
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,965
You know, but basically,
I only deal in jazz, you know, so, uh-

329
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,467
You ought to hang on to that stuff.

330
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:17,262
Hey, arrest that guy. He walked out
in the middle of my sentence.

331
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,147
Yeah? Which joke were you tellin'?

332
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,564
Aw, youth today, man. Nothing's sacred.
Startin' to realize that.

333
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,106
Blue Note.

334
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,774
Yeah, right here.

335
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,027
Ryder.

336
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,948
Okay, we're on our way.

337
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,533
Come on.
Okay.

338
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,501
What if I'd been at home?

339
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,754
Has he ever
gotten physical with you?

340
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,380
Or his mother?

341
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:56,384
Oh, he's never taken a strike at me,
but the language-

342
00:43:56,468 --> 00:44:00,388
The language he uses is just awful.

343
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,223
That doesn't count.

344
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,392
Well, it should.

345
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,731
You dust this?
No, it's clean.

346
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,443
Anyway, to-
to make a long story short,

347
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,654
by 6:00 we're all eatin'
this barbecued goat,

348
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:18,156
drinkin' beer and so forth.

349
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,993
Things are goin' along nicely,
and Clark, he's being really low-key,

350
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:24,204
which is a nice change of pace
for Clark.

351
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,998
You familiar with any
of his high school teachers?

352
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,501
Specifically a Mr. Humphrey.

353
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,835
Tall black man?

354
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:35,548
High school? He's almost 30
years old, for Christ's sake.

355
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:39,719
You know, you don't seem
too surprised by all of this.

356
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:42,597
Isn't this strange behavior
for your son?

357
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:46,393
Well, he took my heels.
That was a bit strange.

358
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,895
Oh, he's all mixed up.

359
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,650
So all night long as, uh,
people finish eating,

360
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:57,946
they're stacking their plates
of leftovers out near the truck.

361
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,449
The odd thing is, the dog never seems
to be the slightest bit interested.

362
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,911
He just stays under the truck
ignoring the food.

363
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,790
Now, it's not the nature of a dog
to ignore food like that.

364
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:12,711
Well, before long, Garret realizes
the dog isn't under the truck.

365
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:15,922
J.C., is this really
the short version of the story?

366
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,882
You get what I'm saying to you?

367
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,759
That was no goddamn goat
we barbecued.

368
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,677
That was Garret's dog.

369
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,470
Clark, he's a- He's a fuckin' sicko.

370
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,561
Some people say
it's like a disease, you know?

371
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:33,981
Once you start,
you can't stop till you're all filled up.

372
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,443
Spider's pretty much filled up.

373
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,779
He's got this... cobra that starts

374
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,948
way up on his shoulder.

375
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:45,948
Kind of drapes down
and covers his entire chest.

376
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,994
Used to be a tattoo of his wife.

377
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,500
But if you look real close you can see

378
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:56,334
how the cobra's head
was once the wife's face.

379
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,216
See, he used the original eyes.

380
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,634
The wife's eyes
are now the cobra's eyes.

381
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:09,848
Spider always said his wife
was half snake anyway.

382
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,393
I told you already.
He'll be back in a little while.

383
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:55,146
He'll come to your office
and pay you then, all right?

384
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,524
Well, I hope so.

385
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,686
<i>Lee hadn't slept well in two nights</i>

386
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,105
<i>on account of</i>
<i>we were still in Dade County</i>

387
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:41,276
<i>in the very neighborhood</i>
<i>where we had shot a man dead.</i>

388
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,822
<i>Since my purse and photo ID had</i>
<i>been left at the scene of the crime,</i>

389
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,199
<i>Lee said</i>
<i>I should hang back at the motel</i>

390
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,785
<i>and remain out of sight.</i>

391
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,121
<i>Anyways,</i>
<i>I didn't know much about holdups</i>

392
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:58,204
<i>and Lee didn't want me</i>
<i>gettin' in the way of his crime spree.</i>

393
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,275
Hey!

394
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,987
You know you breakin' the law, man,
comin' in here with your shoes off?

395
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:10,490
There's a dress code in Dade County.

396
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:16,240
Go ahead and get what the hell
you want and get the hell out of here.

397
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,619
11.60, sir.

398
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,589
11.60, sir.

399
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:14,595
What's the matter with you?
You understand English? 1 1.60.

400
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,263
Don't move. Get back. Get back!

401
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,899
- Sucker. - Hey, man, you gotta
pay. Come back here. Hey!

402
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:31,150
You owe me money!
Bring my fuckin' money back here!

403
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:03,436
We used to go to
River Ranch's campgrounds

404
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,897
two weekends out of every month.

405
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,151
Those two weekends
could get really crazy.

406
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,734
My mom could get pretty crazy.

407
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:17,075
You know, she could out-drink
just about anybody, man or woman,

408
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,325
regardless of body weight.

409
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,249
I remember this one time my dad
came crashing into the camper.

410
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,710
My mom hated anybody
quitting a party,

411
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,754
and I could hear her outside yellin',

412
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:33,841
"Jimmy, this is the devil. I want
you to come out and play with me."

413
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,344
And my dad yelled out,
"And this is God,

414
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:40,348
and if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna strike you dead."

415
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,518
Well, that left just Carl and my mom.

416
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,687
Carl ran the campgrounds.

417
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,942
Anyways, the party broke up
kind of early the next morning

418
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:54,362
when my dad threw all our junk
in the camper.

419
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,529
I was still up in my bed.

420
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:03,162
Just then he just slammed the camper
door and hopped in his truck,

421
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:06,374
and- and drove off.

422
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:09,544
I rode the whole way home
in the back of the camper,

423
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,794
not even knowing
my mom wasn't with us.

424
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,810
The spent bullet is marked.

425
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:29,480
McGwire's the one that found the flaw
in Jimmy's gun in the first place.

426
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,023
He coined it "the crapper,"

427
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,985
and he's certain that the bullet
fired at Humphrey

428
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:37,818
is the same bullet
that came from Ryder's gun.

429
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,456
The way I see things,

430
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,417
you used to have two problems-

431
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,503
a missing daughter
and a missing gun.

432
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,381
The way it looks now,

433
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,131
they're really the same problem.

434
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:36,797
Do you think there's some girl
standing in a motel room far away

435
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,381
lookin' at a picture
and thinking about me?

436
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,554
I doubt it.

437
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,894
She finds men to marry her.

438
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,190
Recently she's been
in a bit of a slump,

439
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,817
but she'll bounce back.

440
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,652
My real father married her twice.

441
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,908
Their second honeymoon,

442
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,325
we all went to stay down
on Key Biscayne.

443
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:11,499
They just started
goin' at it in the same old way,

444
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,582
yellin' their heads off.

445
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:20,007
So right out of the blue,
my dad just gets up off the couch,

446
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,468
walks out the door,

447
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,387
keeps on walkin'

448
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,096
right into the ocean.

449
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,184
Still had his clothes on.

450
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,812
Probably still
had his drink in his hand.

451
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,778
Anyway, the point is, about a half
a minute after they buried my dad,

452
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,695
my mom made the fuckin' mortician.

453
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,702
What a fuckin' creepy guy he was.

454
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,704
Leopold.

455
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,540
A fuckin' creepy mortician.

456
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,958
Very creepy living with that guy.

457
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,873
11:00. Twenty more dollars.

458
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,945
Hey, roachy.

459
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:10,010
<i>It's funny how a person could</i>
<i>leave everything she knew behind</i>

460
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:13,594
<i>and still wind up</i>
<i>in such a familiar place.</i>

461
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:37,371
<i>I stood near the water,</i>
<i>thinking about different things</i>

462
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:39,415
<i>and sometimes catching</i>
<i>a glimpse of my life,</i>

463
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:43,210
<i>as if I was thumbing</i>
<i>through an old photo album.</i>

464
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:47,840
<i>I saw my dad being young</i>
<i>and playing jazz in our Florida room</i>

465
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:52,052
<i>while my mom laid naked</i>
<i>on the cold terrazzo floor.</i>

466
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,722
<i>I saw Bobby</i>
<i>in his black-and-white uniform,</i>

467
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,183
<i>and I could almost smell</i>
<i>that restaurant stench</i>

468
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,394
<i>that had become</i>
<i>so much a part of him.</i>

469
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:04,231
<i>And I saw Lee in his blue car</i>
<i>nearly runnin' me down,</i>

470
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:08,482
<i>looking so much like a guy</i>
<i>on his way to somewhere.</i>

471
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,776
Come on, Jimmy,
let me take you home.

472
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,111
Nah, this'll do fine.

473
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,696
Everybody's leaving.

474
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,280
Anyway, you don't wanna
start drinkin' now.

475
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,620
What's she doin' with this guy?

476
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:03,832
I think the thing to do is go ahead
and put an APB out on these kids.

477
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,918
She's no kid.

478
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,166
New York City?
Yeah.

479
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,968
I'd like a refund, please.
Cash refund.

480
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:17,732
They're a little old.
I never used 'em.

481
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,234
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

482
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,625
Come on, come on, come on.
What- What is up?

483
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:19,792
We're gettin' out of here. You
look like you just saw a ghost.

484
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,174
Aren't we gettin' on the bus?

485
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:24,134
That place was filled
with fuckin' deadbeats.

486
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:26,553
I don't see anything.
You weren't in there.

487
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:29,848
What about New York?
We can drive to New York.

488
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:33,060
Damn it! I hate buses.
I can't even get on a fuckin' bus.

489
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,560
Well, what were we
doin' at a bus station?

490
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,698
Shit.

491
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:35,455
You got any money? Me? No,
I don't have any money.

492
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,624
I don't have the fuckin' toll.

493
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,710
We need a quarter.

494
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,386
What the fuck we gonna do?

495
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,225
Cozy, come on.
Run it.

496
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:56,977
We can't run it.
Go!

497
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,981
Shit.

498
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:11,570
You have to pull over there
to the side for me, please.

499
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:54,615
May I see your license
and registration? Yes.

500
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:05,041
Just your license and registration,
not your wallet.

501
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,720
Lee Ray Harold, North Miami?

502
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:15,555
That's you?
Yep.

503
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,358
Lee, this is your car?

504
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,610
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

505
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,988
All right, I'm going
to ask both of you to sit right here

506
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,988
till I come back, okay?

507
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,832
Lee, we're through. Just be still.
Everything's okay.

508
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,084
What is okay?
Where's the gun?

509
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,919
What are you gonna do with it?
Nothing.

510
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:49,089
Lee, he's calling on his radio.
He's gonna find out.

511
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,174
- Cozy, where the fuck is the gun?
- You can't shoot a cop.

512
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:53,260
I'm not gonna shoot the
fuckin'- Let me drive.

513
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,178
Jesus, Cozy, will you cool it?
Let me drive!

514
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:59,512
We didn't kill anybody.
He wasn't even fuckin' hurt.

515
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,604
Lee, do you have money with you?
Um-

516
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:10,027
You do know this is a toll road?
Yeah.

517
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:15,610
Florida Highway Patrol doesn't tread
lightly on toll-gate crashers.

518
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:18,160
You still at this
North Miami address?

519
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,537
Yeah.
Okay.

520
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,540
Tell you what I'm gonna ask you to do.

521
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,043
I want you to turn your car
completely around

522
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:30,005
and head on back home
to North Miami.

523
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,716
And the next time you think
you wanna take a ride on a toll road,

524
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,469
you make sure you have money
in your pocket

525
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,637
and a cool head on your shoulders.

526
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:39,222
You hear me?
Yeah.

527
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:41,266
Okay.

528
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,018
You take care now.

529
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,354
<i>Suddenly, I wasn't sure of anything.</i>

530
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,148
<i>I wasn't on the lam after all.</i>

531
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:32,609
<i>I wasn't layin' low or ducking cops,</i>

532
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:36,029
<i>and if I was, no one cared.</i>

533
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:38,448
<i>We hadn't killed anybody.</i>

534
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:43,829
<i>I couldn't even be sure we had really killed
the palmetto bug back in the motel room.</i>

535
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:48,125
<i>So if we weren't killers,</i>
<i>we weren't anything.</i>

536
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:51,211
Cozy, I'm sorry.

537
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:58,214
I was gonna tell you
as soon as we got out of Florida.

538
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:07,537
You know my friend Doug and his girlfriend
Julia, they have this apartment.

539
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:13,455
It's not too big, but the rent's
pretty cheap. We could stay with them.

540
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:18,295
I could get a job.
Maybe get two jobs for a while.

541
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,050
Get some money comin' in.

542
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,891
Couple months,
we could get an apartment.

543
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,563
Maybe in the same complex.

544
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,782
