1
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,588
Uncuff him.

2
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,136
Back through there.

3
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,599
No, no, no, leave that.
Back through.

4
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,686
Come on. Come on.

5
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:26,938
Arms up.

6
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,779
Fine.

7
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,043
In there, get your kit off.
Come out when you're ready.

8
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,438
Arms up.

9
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,027
Kit's clear.

10
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,362
Feet.

11
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,455
Down.

12
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,341
Get up, son.

13
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,013
Get dressed.

14
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,394
Oi.

15
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,738
Single cell,
high risk.

16
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,994
Step through.

17
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,173
Upstairs.

18
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,217
Prisoner home!

19
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,605
Wait.

20
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,487
Through you come.

21
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,950
And wait.

22
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,591
All right. Move it.

23
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:22,029
One on, now, 111.

24
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,739
Through you go.

25
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,244
Wait.

26
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,919
Keep it moving, fella.

27
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,715
Keep it moving.

28
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,307
Over here.

29
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,936
Face the wall.

30
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,486
In you get.

31
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,409
Ah!

32
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,980
Feeding.

33
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,402
Feeding, fella.

34
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,755
Bruv.

35
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,424
Flame, double bubble, yeah?

36
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,224
Sorry, brother.
Ain't got one spare.

37
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,119
Move along.
Move along.

38
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,666
Come on, move.

39
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,003
Quick as you can.
Come on, move it.

40
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,172
Come on.

41
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,591
Come on, guys,
stop wasting time.

42
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,195
Jog, mate.

43
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,243
102, Jago.

44
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,745
Any time.

45
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,038
- Yeah?
- Cell, fella.

46
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,665
- Fucking 111, you fucking cunt.
- Move it.

47
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,340
Cheers, Jago.

48
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,140
Safe yeah, Jago.

49
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,185
What's wrong with this kanga, bruv?
He's over-watching us.

50
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,312
I know, I can feel
his eyes in the back of my head.

51
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,551
Stupid fucking
junkie slut she was.

52
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,011
Stepped up,
done right by her.

53
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,888
Fair play,
offing that geezer.

54
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,853
Still, don't make you
nothing in here.

55
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,940
You conduct yourself usual
like an ordinary con.

56
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,733
No more performing,
no dramas.

57
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:01,697
Right? Get on yard
with the rest of them.

58
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,371
The yard.

59
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,053
Bruv, bust me a light
please, you got a lighter?

60
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,559
Back on.

61
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,979
In you go.

62
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,837
Brother.

63
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,507
That flame, yeah?

64
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,488
Shit.

65
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,034
Oh, fuck's sake.
Don't fucking die on me.

66
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,202
Fuck.

67
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,467
You must wait till I'm ready.

68
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,427
Miss, no, no...
Nasty bang to the head, miss.

69
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,470
He needs you.

70
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,055
Right, I'm gonna go now,
everything's sweet.

71
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,348
- Everything's cushy.
- Son?

72
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,974
Guv, it was an accident.
I swear.

73
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,309
- Stay there.
- Look, he walked...

74
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,102
I mean it, son,
don't fucking move.

75
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,149
Bang up!

76
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,068
Get in your cells now!

77
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,739
In your fucking cells.
Come on! Move!

78
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,243
It's another kick off.

79
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,020
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Ready, Mr. Haynes.

80
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,271
Sorry, Mr. Haynes.

81
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,572
- Baby oil.
- Get the sand.

82
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,326
Entry team. D wing.

83
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,546
- Here you go, lads.
- Cheers, mate.

84
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,006
Come on then. Yes.

85
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,758
Yes.

86
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,225
Weapons down,
stand against the back wall.

87
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,063
School him.

88
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,148
- Yes!
- Go on!

89
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,571
- Pin him against the wall!
- Come on then, piggy.

90
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,407
- Yeah, come on, you fucking pig!
- Hold his legs.

91
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,325
Hold his fucking legs!

92
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,077
Hey, calm down!

93
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,621
- Hold him steady!
- Too fucking greasy, the cunt!

94
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,039
Get hold of him!

95
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,792
You fucking...

96
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,630
You fucking come
any closer, mate,

97
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,800
I'll fucking skewer
this pig like a fucking hog roast.

98
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,177
Now, fuck off.

99
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,596
Drop that fucking thing
and fuck off now.

100
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,930
Sharpish!

101
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,223
That's fucking right.

102
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,892
You don't want
to do that, son.

103
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,269
- Shut up, Clive.
- Who's talking to you, cunt?

104
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,107
I tell you what I do want,
guv, you listening?

105
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,692
A helicopter,

106
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,321
two packs of burn and some
chocolate digestives, please.

107
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,870
It was a fucking
accident, guv.

108
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,705
I swear to you.

109
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,540
- All right.
- You believe me, don't you?

110
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,292
Yeah.

111
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,378
Fuck off.

112
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,596
In you go, lads.

113
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,309
Fuck you!
You fucking cunts.

114
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,061
Take it easy, son.

115
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,313
Oh, for fuck's sake.

116
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,856
I fucking knew it.

117
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,316
- Scum you lot are, fucking scum.
- Easy, son.

118
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,484
Fuck off,
you little cunt.

119
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,902
Take it easy.

120
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,240
Come on. Come on,
you little fucking...

121
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,909
- This ain't fucking gentle, boys, is it?
- Shut it!

122
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,995
Come on,
you little fucking...

123
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,455
Move!

124
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,998
Steady, steady, steady.

125
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,417
Yeah, come on,
you little cunt!

126
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,548
You're telling me, you catch a girl
sleeping with your friend, yeah?

127
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,757
Who you going to
be more vexed with?

128
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,884
- Your friend or your girl?
- But I expect that more from a chick.

129
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,511
I expect that.
You know what I mean? But the boy...

130
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,263
Nah, I ain't touching her.

131
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,472
Come on.

132
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,766
Easy, easy.

133
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,226
Right, wait.

134
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,478
Fuck's sake, why ain't
you lot banged up in your cells, eh?

135
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,605
- Easy, easy.
- Keep his head down.

136
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,775
Fuck.

137
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:02,117
Easy, boys, easy. We don't want
anyone to get hurt now, do we?

138
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,453
- Baton.
- No fucking way!

139
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,583
Ah!

140
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,003
Why don't we all
go back to our cells?

141
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,429
Hurry up.

142
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,264
Ow!

143
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,185
You fucking looking at?

144
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,563
He made a mistake, Des.

145
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,900
Des.

146
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,568
A mistake.

147
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,074
Out.

148
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,328
If I go, he's fucked.

149
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,915
My responsibility to you

150
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,584
as a non-operational member of staff,
Mr. Baumer,

151
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,586
is to get you away
from this incident.

152
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,924
And if you don't comply
this second you can surrender your keys.

153
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,388
No!

154
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,527
I'm going to
ask you to please let go of Officer...

155
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,782
Johnson.

156
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,991
No!

157
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,118
He hurts me, Don.
He's fucking gotta...

158
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,286
Oi!

159
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,837
We can do this.

160
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,800
It's okay.

161
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,137
Yeah?

162
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,894
Stay back. Stay back.

163
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,813
I've seen all of you,
I'm a witness.

164
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,231
It's fine.

165
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,819
You all right?

166
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,278
Okay, come on.

167
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,870
Give your name
and number in here.

168
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,375
Love. C-9-4-8-7-W-B.

169
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,920
This way. Foxtrot, Sierra,
Quebec, 14. Come in, over?

170
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,257
- Cuffs, please.
- Quebec 14, sir.

171
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,843
Request Governor Cardew
to segregation. Over.

172
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,344
Received, Quebec 14.

173
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,387
14 out.

174
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,472
Foxtrot Sierra
standing by.

175
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,395
Thank you.

176
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,218
Everything's under
control, Christine.

177
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,887
There's been an incident
involving Mr. Love

178
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,847
which has placed
him at extremely high degree of risk,

179
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,433
which is why I brought it to
your immediate attention.

180
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,226
I propose that
he begins treatment

181
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,937
for his violence as soon as possible,
in my... In my group.

182
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,481
He's assaulted
two of my officers

183
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,816
shortly after knocking
another victim unconscious.

184
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,319
You will not be rewarding him
with any kind of group.

185
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,404
- He wants to engage.
- He's a control problem.

186
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,655
He can be reached.

187
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,325
Gentlemen, I think
you'd better come with me.

188
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,997
So, who is he?

189
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,665
Eric Love.

190
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,542
He's starred up, ma'am.

191
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,668
Nineteen.

192
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,213
Transferred from
Durham Yo this morning.

193
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,756
And you were aware of this?

194
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,675
It came to my attention, yes.

195
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,428
I realize I'm new in post

196
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,138
but you didn't think
to tell me about a young offender

197
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,890
transferred two
years premature?

198
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,059
It was on my agenda.

199
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,604
You mentioned risk.
What risk?

200
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,855
Staff.

201
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,607
Sorry?

202
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,988
The Governor
wants to see you.

203
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,995
If you comply with the regime,

204
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,706
I'm prepared to offer you
a place back on the wing.

205
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,626
And a special kind of therapy

206
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,838
with Mr. Baumer,
with whom you co-operated upstairs.

207
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,798
But one more incident of any kind

208
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,050
that comes to my attention,
you'll be straight back down here.

209
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,763
Just one problem.

210
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,141
And you're going to
tell me what that is?

211
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,308
I'm just saying.

212
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,520
Say this therapy goes well

213
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,189
and it changes my life
and I rehabilitate.

214
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,735
And then you lay it on for the next geezer
and it works for him, and the next.

215
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,237
And everything's
sweet, yeah?

216
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,240
Crime rates start to come
down, police have got less people to nick.

217
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,200
Courts got less
people to convict.

218
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,370
Pretty soon,
you're out of a job.

219
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,546
Do you mind?

220
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,756
I said do you mind,
you fucking...

221
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,841
Right. Get...

222
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,676
Oh, what a fucking pussy.

223
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,970
- Oh, just take him back.
- Come on.

224
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,263
Fucking ungrateful cunts.

225
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,348
I pay your fucking
mortgages and all, you know.

226
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,683
Get out.

227
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,644
Well, it doesn't appear
Mr. Love is too ready

228
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,605
for therapeutic
intervention, does it?

229
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,856
No, no, no, no, no.

230
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,944
I think we should go with
your initial instinct, Christine

231
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,115
and give Eric Love the one chance
that Oliver thinks he needs.

232
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,202
But as you say,
any non-compliance

233
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,495
and he's off the group
and back down here.

234
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,569
Erm, Mr. Love.

235
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,071
Never talk to me again.

236
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,074
It's one phone call,
clean head shot outside the gate.

237
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,034
All right?

238
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,539
Fucking do one!

239
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,528
He went in
yesterday, bruv.

240
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,737
No, he didn't.

241
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,781
Do you think
we don't check?

242
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,116
And don't call me bruv.

243
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,450
Look, I swear to you, Nev.

244
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,868
Get your people now.

245
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,830
Yeah, but I ain't
got no tech, bruv.

246
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,083
- Hello.
- What's up, T?

247
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,753
Yeah, yeah I'm all right, babe.
But listen, where's the fucking gwap?

248
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,504
- I put it in.
- Don't fucking lie to me, babe,

249
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,173
- because I'm in a spot here...
- I put it in yest...

250
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,217
All right,
miss one again, hurt you.

251
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,104
Hey, Jinsy,
how you doing? You well?

252
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:22,867
Hello, Selfy.

253
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,581
You done something
to your hair? It's nice.

254
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,042
What you done,
you had a haircut?

255
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,211
Just a bit of gel,
mate, yeah.

256
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,630
Oh, it's nice.
It's nice.

257
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,475
Next.

258
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,148
- All right?
- Yeah. Done it.

259
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:55,942
Good.

260
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,611
Fucking monkey.

261
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,664
Your youngster,
what I've heard.

262
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,583
No offense to family

263
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,670
but the kid's
causing unnecessary

264
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,505
to the good order
and discipline of this jail.

265
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,135
And lock downs,
as you well know, cost me money.

266
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,053
Slap?

267
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,598
Stop being a psychopath
for a second, please.

268
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,394
No. You exercise
the gray matter, Neville.

269
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,980
You mentor him.

270
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,524
You stick him on a path

271
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,235
and you dedicate yourself
for a period of time.

272
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,320
Save me a lot
of aggravation.

273
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,158
Least of all,

274
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,870
having to murder the cunt
if sanity do not prevail.

275
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,748
Get Selfy take you down there.

276
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,052
Oi, Jim!

277
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,139
Fucking hell.

278
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,892
Yeah, see you later.

279
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,232
I'm gonna tell
you something, all right?

280
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,236
This here is not no
young offenders turn out, all right?

281
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,532
They will fucking dangle you,
the kangas.

282
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,784
They'll make it
look like suicide.

283
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,079
Right?

284
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,375
Now, me,
I can never leave.

285
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,044
Top someone in jail,
they do not like it.

286
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,799
But you, just do what
they want you to do.

287
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,301
Play their fucking game
and then bounce.

288
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,886
I ain't going
to no fucking...

289
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,388
Yes, you fucking are, cunt!

290
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,598
Don't you ever fucking
answer back to me again.

291
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,892
You will do what
you're fucking told.

292
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,729
You'll do what
the man was offering

293
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,982
and you will fucking behave.

294
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,402
Yeah.

295
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,821
Tomorrow you'll be
back up on the wing.

296
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,447
Selfy will take care of it.

297
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,825
Come to see you,
you know?

298
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,330
Start of your sentence,
the one you're doing now.

299
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,838
5 years old I was
sat on your knee,

300
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,133
listen to you and mum
slag each other off.

301
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,886
Eat your food.

302
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,289
Come on, Love. Let me get you out
of this shithole and back to your wing, eh.

303
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,755
Go on.

304
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,964
Oh.

305
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,437
Go up the stairs.

306
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,552
Flame.

307
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,889
Double bubble.

308
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,464
All of you better stop
whatever the fuck you're doing!

309
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,341
Who's been in my fucking cell?

310
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,885
Oi, answer me!

311
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,804
Who's been in
my fucking cell?

312
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:43,849
I will fuck you up.
Who's been in my fucking cell? Oi!

313
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,060
Who was in my
fucking cell?

314
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,438
Answer me, now!
Who the fuck was in my cell?

315
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,071
Ah.

316
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,635
Start free flow.

317
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,185
Thanks, guv.

318
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,104
All right,
it's time for class.

319
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,198
- Dunk him.
- Yeah.

320
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,449
Hard.

321
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,702
It don't come back to me.

322
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,078
No. No.

323
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,096
All right, tip-top.

324
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,515
Spoke to him, he knows
he's to mind himself.

325
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,309
Don't mug me off.

326
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,979
Listen to what the teacher
has to say, all right?

327
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,147
All right.

328
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,986
Welcome.

329
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,878
What's going on?

330
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,801
Was here when
you done your thing, man.

331
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,681
Burstow.

332
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,519
Love.

333
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,021
Yeah, we know that.

334
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,358
Eh, this guy...

335
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,319
He clamped down
on that fucking kanga.

336
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,696
Yo, where you located?

337
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:04,406
D1.

338
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,700
D2 above you, ain't we?

339
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,744
Should've gnawed 'em off.

340
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,996
Nah, blood.
Kid's regulating the play.

341
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,873
They ain't been
trained for that shit.

342
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,709
Hey, kangas dish
you out any damage?

343
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,002
Nah.

344
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,130
Just so you know,
it's no smoking in the group.

345
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,137
We'll have a break,
you can smoke by the window.

346
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,931
But we're all ready
to start now.

347
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,228
So if you just put it out,
we can begin.

348
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,649
As you been told
by the gentleman.

349
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,069
- You making a monkey out of me?
- Can you leave, please?

350
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,239
- Beg your pardon?
- You can't just walk in like that.

351
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,325
You'll get your
snout back after.

352
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,870
Problem is you got
to come down on him full throttle,

353
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,039
else it won't register. Right?

354
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,417
Now listen what
the gentleman has to say.

355
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,920
All right,
off you go then.

356
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,214
You stay here.

357
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,268
Who was that?

358
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,645
Neville Love.

359
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,189
Love. As in...

360
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,025
Yeah.

361
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,361
Jesus Christ!

362
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,529
He's only trying
to help, ain't he?

363
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,906
Nah, it's mad, blood.

364
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,160
Come in here, try tell a man what
to do in front of everyone.

365
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,912
Listen to me you,
you fucking cunty bollocks.

366
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:34,997
Forde!

367
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,166
Listen, you keep fucking
looking at me like I'm some sort of cunt,

368
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,834
Mr. Love had
his initial assessment.

369
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,210
- He's done extremely well.
- I'll fucking pen you.

370
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,171
I would be grateful
if you could escort him back to the wing.

371
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,297
He fucking threatened me.

372
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,050
Can I have my pen back,
please, Mr. Love?

373
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,512
- Thank you.
- Where are you, fella?

374
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,680
D1.

375
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,140
All right, come on,
let's go.

376
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,391
Thanks very much.

377
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,574
You two are on
his wing, right?

378
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,077
Would you do me a favor
and just keep a little eye on him?

379
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,912
I mean, he's only a kid.

380
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,666
Where were we?

381
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,442
D-Wing
association, unlock!

382
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,904
Oh, sorry, love.

383
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,287
10.

384
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,249
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

385
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,792
- What you stopping for?
- Yo.

386
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,918
Huh?

387
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,217
What do you reckon?

388
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,885
Do your thing, man.

389
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,595
Fucking shit!

390
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,312
Cunt. Fucker!

391
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,356
Fuck off.

392
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,156
You pussyhole.

393
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,577
- Yo, yo, come here, come here, come here.
- No, no.

394
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,412
- Fucking asshole.
- Listen, listen.

395
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,997
You can fuck
people up, yeah.

396
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,957
Fucking defend yourself.
But it don't make no sense

397
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,293
catching another fucking
case now, does it?

398
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,128
Now relax.

399
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:48,797
Fuck.

400
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,226
What?

401
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,188
Think you got some do-do
in your hair, bruv.

402
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,689
Ah.

403
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:51,026
Hey, how come you helped?

404
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,862
- Said to look out for you, on the wing.
- Who?

405
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,530
- OI.
- OI?

406
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,367
He's half a kanga.

407
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,080
What, you boys
back him do you?

408
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,416
Yeah,
OI's different, man. He works alone.

409
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,336
Don't never press the alarm.
Puts his body on the line.

410
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,129
And he don't get paid.

411
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,341
How many kangas
you know like that?

412
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:17,928
Yo, blood.

413
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,681
Make sure you come
back to it, yeah.

414
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,891
It's beneficial.

415
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,019
You should have
seen me before.

416
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,898
Yeah, I'll, er,
think about it.

417
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,526
Later.

418
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,363
Bang up, D-Wing!

419
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,505
You going up and down
the landing for?

420
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,841
Hmm? What's that about?

421
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,010
You need anything,
you come see me.

422
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,136
No, no, it weren't
like that.

423
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,887
What the fuck
was it like, then?

424
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,181
Huh?

425
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,850
Well, you told me to go
in the fucking group, didn't you?

426
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,810
Yeah, I told you to go
in the fucking group.

427
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,145
Fucking learn, boy.

428
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,897
To slow down and get out,
but not to fraternize.

429
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,316
What?

430
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,775
You know what I mean.

431
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,944
I think you fucking do.

432
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,447
Huh?

433
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,047
You didn't give him
a clump, did you?

434
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,925
No, fucking didn't.

435
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,183
Hmm.

436
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,517
You're jealous, mate.

437
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,894
Oh, fuck off.

438
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,523
He's making links,
without you, with some serious geezers,

439
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,359
and now you want to
go and fuck it up,

440
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,194
because you fucking are, mate.

441
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,077
Who the fuck you think
you are? Huh? Huh?

442
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:13,794
Good boy.

443
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,299
There you go.

444
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,653
Selfy's got a stomach bug.

445
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,946
Oh.

446
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,493
Like the old days.

447
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,330
Got to keep the show
on the road, Dennis.

448
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,403
Ah.

449
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,031
You look nice.

450
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,658
- Really?
- Nah.

451
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,786
Where you from?

452
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,996
Oxfordshire.

453
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,790
Ooh. What you doing here?

454
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,168
Well, I was going to ask if you would
like to walk to group with me.

455
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,753
No, I mean this shithole.

456
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,547
Well, I feel at home here.

457
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,426
So this is where
you open up to me and build trust, is it?

458
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,763
Yeah.

459
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:38,355
Look, I was, em, sent away
when I was very young to boarding school

460
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,732
and when I got
out the other end,

461
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,443
I found it really
hard to manage in the outside world.

462
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:44,653
Posh boy.

463
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,321
Not really.

464
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,864
Well, you don't get paid.

465
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,659
I had some family money
after my granny died.

466
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,245
So this is sort of like
a hobby for you, then?

467
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,957
No. No, I need to be here.

468
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,295
I got sent away when
I was young like you,

469
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:04,923
I was put into care.

470
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:11,388
Then, when I was 10,
I done a pedo in. Hmm.

471
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,641
Sloshed him.

472
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,938
Boiled water, sugar, boom.

473
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,944
Kiddy fiddlers,
man, strange.

474
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:32,367
They want you to reassure them that
what they're doing is normal.

475
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,078
Like they want you, the victim,

476
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,081
to let them off the hook.

477
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,085
They want to open up to you,

478
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,629
build your trust.

479
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,802
Now, the geezer's face,
I won't never forget.

480
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,016
Melted, in his hands.

481
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,352
I think maybe you've got the wrong
idea. Could I just come in and...

482
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,563
So you can start
touching me up and all?

483
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,607
No, you fucking wrong one.

484
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,278
How many fucking sugars do you take?
You fucking nonce cunt.

485
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,326
Why should I give
a shit about you?

486
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,286
'Cause I'm starred up, mate,
and very fucking violent

487
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,621
and you want to make
a name for yourself,

488
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,122
don't you, and your
fucking little group.

489
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,498
I don't give a shit if
you're in my group or not.

490
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,626
- Then why you fucking stood there, then?
- I don't fucking know.

491
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,419
- Have a think, then, dickhead.
- I don't want to think.

492
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,421
Right now, I want
to fucking hurt you.

493
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:35,889
Yeah?

494
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,436
Good.

495
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,481
Now we're getting somewhere.

496
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,483
Let's go.

497
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,405
- Morning, guv.
- Morning.

498
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,575
Good.

499
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,748
Come on, laugh.

500
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,188
Hi, everyone,
sorry I'm late.

501
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,078
Hey, why you run
last time?

502
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,873
Hey, he didn't run.

503
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,584
He chose to hold it down
instead of becoming violent

504
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,586
and took himself
back to the wing.

505
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,463
Whatever, man.

506
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,799
- He ran.
- No.

507
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,551
He made a choice.

508
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,637
So why you sticking
it on me for?

509
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,141
Because you're pressurizing him and I
don't want him to kick off.

510
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,351
You're defending him.

511
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,728
And what's wrong with that?

512
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,480
So why you getting involved?

513
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,236
Why not leave it to
his fucking dad?

514
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,988
Fuck you, you little
mangy cunt!

515
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,824
- Ryan, that was... That was wrong.
- Take it easy, man.

516
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,495
Take it easy.
Hey, hey, take it easy man, chill.

517
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,664
Chill, yeah?
You're doing the right thing.

518
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,332
He knows.

519
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,251
Fucking this
guy don't give a fuck.

520
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,003
You're mugging him
off by telling him.

521
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,255
And you're doing what
by telling me, blood?

522
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,466
- What you saying, blood?
- What the fuck you standing up?

523
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,009
I'm saying what
I'm saying, ain't I?

524
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,177
Des was offering support.

525
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,303
I don't give a fuck what
he was saying about.

526
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,429
And you shamed him
without meaning to.

527
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,930
Yeah, but he's shaming me
and you ain't got shit

528
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,432
to say about that,
have you, you stupid prick.

529
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,517
- That's enough.
- Listen. Me?

530
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,603
It's fucking him who's
on his fucking period, bruv.

531
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,938
Stepping in. Mugging man off
like I was a fucking bag head

532
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,732
scratching for dog-ends
on the fucking yard.

533
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,276
When that ain't what this
group is meant to be about now, is it for?

534
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,153
I'm standing up 'cause
I'm standing up. What?

535
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,613
I'm standing up now, what?

536
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,490
- The fuck you standing up for?
- Come make me sit down.

537
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,783
- Come make me sit down.
- Fall back, man.

538
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,327
Come. Hey, come here.
Blood, I'm standing up.

539
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,453
Bruv, ain't shit
going down, man.

540
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,455
'Cause you would have lumped Des and he
would have shanked you,

541
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,458
and that would have finished
the fucking group altogether, you cunt.

542
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,835
So relax.

543
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,778
Talking to me, bruv?

544
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,696
- Enjoy your smoke, man.
- Now we say?

545
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,031
Enjoy your smoke, man.

546
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,326
- You still talking to me, bruv?
- Why don't you enjoy your smoke.

547
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,745
- Fam, you still talking to me?
- Enjoy your smoke.

548
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,514
I ain't never had
a problem with him, you know.

549
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,771
You got a topic?

550
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,314
Hmm?

551
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:15,275
For the group discussion.

552
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,111
No, I'm just listening,
ain't I?

553
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,948
- Fair enough.
- Hmm.

554
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:38,006
It can take a session or two to get used to it.

555
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,260
Erm, okay,
so who's got a topic?

556
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,516
- Serious?
- Nah, mate.

557
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:51,936
- Take it easy, yeah?
- Cool.

558
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:14,751
Don't fucking touch me.

559
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,836
Look, I told you,
you get the rest when you do him.

560
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,047
- He's gone and done you.
- Yeah, I fucking did what you told me.

561
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,258
- This guy's crazy.
- Just give it to me.

562
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,968
- When you do him.
- All right.

563
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,452
And how about your
little Warren and Charmaine?

564
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,162
Yeah,
doing well, a big boy.

565
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,455
- Getting a big boy.
- Yeah.

566
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,873
And what about Char...

567
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,169
- Can I help you, young man?
- Nah, sweet.

568
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,592
Hey, is he about?

569
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,052
In a meeting.

570
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,099
Eric, right?

571
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,977
Come in.

572
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,565
Thanks.

573
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,067
It's all right.

574
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,074
Come to talk to you.
Man to man.

575
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,868
So we don't get on
each other's fucking tits no more.

576
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,578
Which is a good thing.

577
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,545
All right.

578
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,922
Talk.

579
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,594
You just order me about
and tell me to do stuff.

580
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,930
You don't give a fuck
about how I feel.

581
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,359
Well, that's it.

582
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,780
Fuck off, "That's it".
What else is going on?

583
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:12,452
Come on, you come here
to fucking talk to me, tell me, what is it?

584
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,915
Someone giving you
a fucking hard time?

585
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,420
Someone fucking
threatening you?

586
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,715
Tell me the truth.
What the fuck is going on?

587
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,385
Nev, I think he's just trying
to tell you something and he's...

588
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,480
It's fucking prison,
ain't it?

589
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,442
As someone whose nan who come off the
fucking boat, Barbados, yeah.

590
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,027
Don't like Africans.

591
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:31,280
Think they can look
at me with all their fucking tribal scars,

592
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,825
- mad accents and shit?
- I'm a fucking African.

593
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:34,992
Yeah?

594
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,870
But you ain't got
no scars and you talk South, you cunt.

595
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,956
- They got their fraud.
- I'll give you that.

596
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,750
Being honest, don't like
fucking black people.

597
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,294
All in. They just
prey on each other.

598
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,004
Don't let no one advance.

599
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:50,675
Now you see your, your Indians, your
Bangladesh, your Vietnamese,

600
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,678
your fucking Pakistani,
Koreans, North, South,

601
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,429
whatever the fuck they
want to call themselves,

602
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,390
now you see them, motherfuckers,
they stick together.

603
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,558
Slavery done it.

604
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,518
It was you
African nig-nogs that traded us

605
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,145
to the white cunts to
start though, weren't it?

606
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,938
Yeah, well,
I don't like yids.

607
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,232
- I'm a yid.
- Fuck off.

608
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,109
- I'm half Jewish.
- Which side?

609
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,485
- My father's.
- Don't count.

610
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,778
You're off track
with the Jews, bro.

611
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,196
Check it.
They arrived at the bottom,

612
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:13,406
but finished at the top.

613
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,116
One generation,
wherever they are.

614
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,325
I still ain't
having them.

615
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,952
Well, you're a black cunt.

616
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,040
If I'm a yid cunt,
you're a black cunt, he's a white cunt.

617
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,333
We're all a bunch of cunts
if you think about it.

618
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,459
Yo, slow down,
old man.

619
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,378
You white cunts,
you ain't all that compared to us.

620
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,338
- How?
- The chicks.

621
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,007
We got the bigger knobs.

622
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,469
Yeah, you lot don't go down on birds
though, do you? What fucking good's that?

623
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,138
I make you wrong there, bruvva.

624
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,556
Against the religion, acki.

625
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,517
No, no, no.
Listen, back door, I ain't troubling that.

626
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:43,936
Oral pleasure, permissible.

627
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,356
Bruv, you ain't
sucking pussy.

628
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,820
You ain't fucking.
That right, OI?

629
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,323
Yeah, if I had
a pussy to suck.

630
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:56,574
And if that pussy
was attached to a woman

631
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,952
with whom I had a loving
and trusting relationship,

632
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,787
I would consider myself
very fortunate.

633
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,164
Ty, you missing out, blood.

634
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,458
I'm telling you,
it's a part of life.

635
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,714
Maybe push the boat,
when I land, ain't it?

636
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,885
I ain't saying for definite.
I ain't saying either way.

637
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,261
How long you got?

638
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,101
13 years.

639
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:27,480
Fucking no rush then.

640
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:29,941
Plenty of time to think.

641
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,989
Still, you'll be getting
balls deep before me son, so...

642
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,866
Full report, please.

643
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,655
Yo.

644
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,884
Jab.
In the bottom.

645
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,177
Double jab.

646
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,349
Two, up two. Up two.

647
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,986
Hey, you don't expect me
to lift that, do you?

648
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:33,814
Nice.

649
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,948
Yo, fuck them, man.
I'll hold your ankles for you, let's go.

650
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:47,286
- Let's go, man.
- Nah, it's all right. Fuck it. Sweet.

651
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,372
Allow him, Hass,
he wants to train like a bacon.

652
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:55,169
Said you want to train like a bacon,
a fucking nonce.

653
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,837
It's up to you.

654
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,180
Big right.

655
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,141
4.

656
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,894
Left, right, uppercut,
straight right.

657
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,232
Double jab.

658
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,483
Cover that chin.

659
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:19,944
2.

660
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,821
4.

661
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,697
Hook, hook.

662
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,325
Drop your right
and I'll tag you.

663
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,119
Body, body.

664
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,329
Uppercut, uppercut.

665
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,292
What, you think
you're Ali, bruv?

666
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,710
Calm yourself down.

667
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,087
4.

668
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:39,839
Double jab.

669
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,841
Arms up.
Ain't gonna tell you again.

670
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,176
Jab hook, big right.

671
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,595
Ahhh!

672
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,721
Oi!

673
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,015
You fucking
seriously having that?

674
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:54,770
4.

675
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,022
2. 6.

676
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,735
6!

677
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:03,696
10!

678
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,323
Uppercut.

679
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,701
Time. Who's next?

680
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,017
Cunt.

681
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,316
Fucker.
Fucking cunt.

682
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:10,429
Who fucking sent you?

683
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,397
You have to stop eating.

684
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,399
I eat because
I'm depressed, right.

685
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,901
You're depressed, what about me, huh?

686
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,861
What do you think
it's like for me?

687
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:27,571
Mum, I'm the one
in fucking prison.

688
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,115
Sorry, Mum.

689
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,202
Mum, look I don't want
to fucking argue about it.

690
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:36,288
Mum, listen...

691
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,207
Look, I just want to
ask how you are...

692
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:42,836
Fuck!

693
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,181
Ahhh!

694
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,060
Fucking pussy hole.

695
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,354
Fucking want someone
doing, Jago, do them your fucking self.

696
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,565
- I ain't got that kind of clout. Please.
- Who was it then, Jago?

697
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:05,317
- Who's the fucking man?
- Please, please, please.

698
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,485
Was it that
fucking old cunt

699
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,070
at the top of the stairs
with the fucking hair, him?

700
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,446
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about...

701
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,990
Lose your fucking
lip then, Jago cunt.

702
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,575
It's him, chill, chill.

703
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,493
That's him, yeah? Yeah?

704
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,610
Oh! Fucking get the...

705
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:49,361
Get the fuck down.

706
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,405
You...
Fuck me, you an' all?

707
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,365
Oi, I fucked him up,
you know.

708
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,284
- I cut him fucking good, mate.
- Who?

709
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,871
That fucking fat black bastard in the fucking
canteen, you fucking know who.

710
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,205
- You cut him?
- Yeah.

711
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,874
You fucking stuck him
on me, mate.

712
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

713
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:06,045
- Drop it. Drop it!
- Huh?

714
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,755
Drop it!

715
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:12,134
Jags...
Jags, up here now.

716
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:16,513
Well, let go of him then.

717
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:19,308
Behave.
Get up, get up, go on.

718
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,985
- Yeah, there he is your fucking...
- Stay there!

719
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,655
You saying
I put you on him?

720
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,783
Is that how it is?

721
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,202
Using my name?

722
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:44,541
He's not some punk.
He's Eric Love, Neville's own.

723
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,421
Transfer or your life.

724
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,007
Either way, you won't
be here tomorrow.

725
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,761
You're getting
blood on my floor. Now fuck off.

726
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,223
All right.

727
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,560
Leave us, please.

728
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,272
Don't agitate me.

729
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,440
Dennis.

730
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,109
He'll be fine.

731
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:20,202
Neville.

732
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:27,501
Sit down then.

733
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,882
Am I right about you, Eric?

734
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:38,804
Starred up means
you're a leader.

735
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:45,644
Why you attack people
for the principle, instead of losing pride.

736
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,815
And no leaders,
where would we be?

737
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,318
Back to the fucking
Stone Age, that's where.

738
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,155
Scratching our recta
without no toilet paper.

739
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,490
Cunts.

740
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:00,909
So...

741
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,203
Issues, Eric.

742
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:09,334
Bring 'em here
and we can resolve any matters arising.

743
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,296
Know you can
take care of yourself,

744
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:16,592
but it sometimes
helps to have friends with influence.

745
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:21,555
Something you will learn.
You with me?

746
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:25,184
And no more silliness,
I want a nice quiet wing.

747
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,271
You can go.

748
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,527
You remind me of myself,
when I was your age.

749
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,016
All right.

750
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,602
What's going on?

751
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:10,938
I'm sorry?

752
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,816
You have to help him,
you know.

753
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,944
You have to teach him the answers,
the things he's supposed to say,

754
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:19,404
you know, like the
"Think Right" program.

755
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,574
You know,
help him get out.

756
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:26,036
You know,
like the, fucking,

757
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,621
"What would you do
if you were in a bar

758
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,164
"and a fella comes up
and starts talking to your bird?

759
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,166
"What you gonna do?
Oh, I'm gonna tell him politely

760
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:34,711
"that I'm with her, you know, rather than
glass the cunt." You know what I mean?

761
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,964
- Exactly. That bollocks.
- Okay.

762
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,174
That's not what
my group is about.

763
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,135
Your son and I
are on a journey together and we will...

764
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,512
No, he needs to behave.

765
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,723
Okay, he's suffered
enormous emotional trauma and abuse.

766
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,225
- Oh, I never touched him.
- Well, you weren't there.

767
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,936
I didn't... Okay,
that's enough, all right.

768
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,190
Fucking finish.

769
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,153
'Cause in case you haven't
fucking fully appreciated,

770
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,950
I am his fucking parent

771
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,786
and I am fucking here now.

772
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,541
You think you can fucking
fix him up, huh?

773
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:16,295
What, you got a fucking couple of fucking
nice little letters after your name.

774
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,463
Well I've got
fucking numbers.

775
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,425
So's he.

776
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:26,096
Do you have a family?
Have you got family?

777
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,056
You got someone
you go home to at night?

778
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,683
No?

779
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,060
Or would you rather
be doing fucking bang up?

780
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,229
Closed in with
all the rest of us?

781
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:37,024
You sick fucking
no-life, saddo cunt.

782
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:46,658
Maybe you don't feel comfortable accepting
help from other people?

783
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,953
Hmm?

784
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:54,249
I know I don't.
Makes me wonder what's in it for them.

785
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,084
Laying yourself open.

786
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,377
Vulnerable, ain't it?

787
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,837
- So why you do it then?
- What?

788
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:01,006
Lend me the fucking
shampoo, you mug.

789
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:04,676
'Cause you had some
fucking shit in your hair.

790
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,512
I said you had some
fucking shit in your hair

791
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,181
so I give you some
fucking shampoo.

792
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,517
Ain't put my hands on you,
ain't disrespected your mum.

793
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,645
And, right about now,
the more I fucking flow,

794
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,397
and flow, and flow,
and fucking flow,

795
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,691
the more I know you
ain't gonna do fuck all.

796
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,234
Pussy.

797
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:23,028
Stay with it.

798
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,531
Stay with it, that's it.

799
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:32,746
- I feel like a cunt.
- Good.

800
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,289
- Good?
- Yes, good.

801
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,541
I feel like a cunt
every day.

802
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,463
Stay with it,

803
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:43,840
breathe with it.

804
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,053
Breathe with it.

805
01:11:58,523 --> 01:11:59,982
Done well.

806
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:01,858
Yeah,
it was good.

807
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,610
Straight.

808
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,028
Yeah, it was all right.

809
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,280
He's smiling,
look at him, he's smiling, he's smiling.

810
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:08,740
He knows he's done well, go on.

811
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:09,908
Yeah...

812
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,203
Anger management,
control.

813
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,111
Everything all right?

814
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,781
Fine.

815
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:08,967
Sweet.

816
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:24,608
Who's that then?

817
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,485
My mum.

818
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:28,987
Why?

819
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,156
No, I'm just saying.

820
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,158
Nice photo, ain't it?

821
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,369
- How's yours?
- Hmm?

822
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,539
Your mum, must be a bit
worried about you?

823
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:40,999
No, I ain't got one.

824
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,338
Bang up!

825
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,346
Thanks.

826
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,555
For what, blood?

827
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,224
For the tea, ain't it?

828
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,777
Come on, mate,
it's not the crown jewels.

829
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,294
What you do in that group?

830
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:10,755
Talk, ain't it?

831
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:13,175
- Talk?
- Yeah.

832
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:16,261
And sometimes it can go.

833
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,389
Sounds loops.

834
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:21,600
It is.

835
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,235
- Okay, so, what's the topic?
- Jail.

836
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,322
- Okay.
- Yeah, like what effects it has on you

837
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:37,240
and how it fucks
with your head.

838
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:40,368
- Good topic.
- You want jail, yeah, go fucking Morocco.

839
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,288
Ain't got peeps,
money, you're fucked.

840
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:46,041
- American jails, worse. Don't care.
- Why's that?

841
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,418
They shag each other
out there, ain't it?

842
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,795
Bruv, I'd rather
have no servery...

843
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,063
Welcome.

844
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:27,666
Fuck me!

845
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,126
What's your fucking problem?
I'm fucking here cause of you, ain't I?

846
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:32,254
- Well, sit down then.
- Don't fucking embarrass me, all right?

847
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,798
Don't fucking embarrass me
in front of everyone.

848
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,886
You want a fucking straightener?
Come on.

849
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:41,554
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Fucking have it.

850
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,431
- Mr. Love.
- Fucking have it then.

851
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,891
Don't fucking start
with me, all right?

852
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:48,311
With your poncey fucking voice
and you think you're fucking better than me.

853
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,313
Don't fucking start with me.

854
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,650
Look, just sit down
and shut up, yeah.

855
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,821
Fuck your class.

856
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:02,701
You fucking,
bunch of fucks!

857
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:06,579
Get me off
this fucking wing!

858
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,749
Off the wing, now!

859
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,376
Bang me the fuck up!

860
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,211
All right,
all right, fella.

861
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,547
Fucking wankers.

862
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:23,722
Get me off
this fucking wing!

863
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:28,184
Open the fucking gate!

864
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:30,061
Open the fucking gate now!

865
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:33,565
Open the fucking gate!
Bang me up right fucking now!

866
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,400
Open it!

867
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:38,653
Open the fucking gate,
get me behind my cell, now.

868
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,780
Think positive.

869
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:43,992
- Rise above it.
- Ryan.

870
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,118
I'm helping him.

871
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,245
It's the wrong kind of help right now.
If you just back off.

872
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:50,290
Yeah, you don't ever bite,
Ryan, do you?

873
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,751
Fucking everything
sorted, is it?

874
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,419
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah?

875
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,254
- 100%.
- All times?

876
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,756
Like I said.

877
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,050
Yeah, well maybe you
ain't fucking true to yourself then,

878
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,509
to the fucking group
and all.

879
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:03,178
- Just watch your mouth.
- Watch me mouth?

880
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,805
Go fuck your mum
in her asshole, how's that sound to you?

881
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,557
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Yeah, there we go.

882
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,517
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, you little prick?

883
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:10,685
Take that back or I will
fuck you up right now.

884
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,271
What, do you think I'm one of them
little fucking pricks on the wing?

885
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:14,689
- Fucking 100%.
- Carry on smiling.

886
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:15,940
You're gonna see
what's gonna happen.

887
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,192
- Sit down.
- Fucking prick.

888
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:18,693
You think you can just
fucking talk how you want.

889
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,528
You can talk whatever the fuck
you want about my mum.

890
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,072
Like a fucking
dead person, I am.

891
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,740
I don't fucking
feel anything.

892
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,408
Nah, this is bullshit, man.

893
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,869
No one don't say nothing
about no one's mum.

894
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,829
You've been fucking warned.

895
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,664
And you too.

896
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:32,957
Hmm.

897
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,223
Suck your mum.

898
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:50,892
I will bury you!

899
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,813
I want him!
I fucking want him!

900
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,159
I will bury you, cunt!

901
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,456
Step inside the fucking ring,
you pussy!

902
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,834
Look, look Ty.
Lads, boys...

903
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:18,128
Listen, cause I ain't
got fuck all going on with my mum,

904
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:20,505
don't give me the right
to start slating yours, yeah.

905
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,215
I'm sorry.

906
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,342
Okay?

907
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,345
Ryan, don't leave me
hanging like a cunt, come on.

908
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:29,973
Yeah, look, sweet.

909
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,143
See, done, yeah?

910
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,441
Mr. Baumer, would you care to tell me
exactly what is going on in here?

911
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:40,650
I'm in the middle
of a session.

912
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:43,069
- You have a vulnerable Yo in here.
- And?

913
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:45,572
We agreed one incident
and he would have to leave.

914
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:47,782
- But he didn't do anything.
- You need to do it,

915
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,534
and you need to do it now.

916
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,793
You're going to have to go back to
the wing, just for this session, mate.

917
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:00,378
- Bullshit.
- Why?

918
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,257
It was agreed,
one incident and he has to come off.

919
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,592
Yeah, but it's all right.

920
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,553
Relax boys, fucking hell.

921
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,723
- Sweet, Ryan, yeah?
- Yeah.

922
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:12,807
- OI.
- Well done, yeah.

923
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:14,017
- Cool, thanks man.
- I'll come and see you...

924
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:15,268
I'll come and see you later.

925
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,644
- Okay.
- I don't think so.

926
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,355
- What?
- A break is a break.

927
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:21,816
He's lucky not to be
back on segregation,

928
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,611
which I recall formed part
of our original agreement.

929
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,740
Why are you so scared
of something that might actually work?

930
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,991
You need to calm it down.

931
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,409
He's building trust.

932
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:34,746
Okay, he's taking stuff on.
It is working.

933
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,874
I mean, seriously,
what are we doing here,

934
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:40,376
if not trying to help
prisoners like Eric fucking Love?

935
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,921
What is it you
don't understand? He is a young offender.

936
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,672
I don't give a fuck,
I want him!

937
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,175
You, you need to get
a hold of yourself, Mr. Baumer,

938
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,385
because you are
far too involved.

939
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,384
Sorry about Love.

940
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:34,889
Of course, we did everything we could
to accommodate him in your group.

941
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,141
But with someone
like that, well...

942
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:42,981
However hard we try,
sometimes there's just no hope, is there?

943
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,859
Warehouse him.

944
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,363
Protect the public
that way,

945
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:54,075
make sure he stays inside
for the rest of his life...

946
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:15,615
Fucking no better than
a fucking grass, you're not.

947
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,285
Fucking running your gums
in the fucking group.

948
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,329
Slinging your
tampon around,

949
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:24,457
until half the fucking
jail come on top. Embarrassing.

950
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:28,294
Bummer, Baumer, whatever his fucking
name is, better man than you, mate.

951
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:31,839
See that group makes you
feel part of something, like you is someone.

952
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:35,426
Fucking come here,
I thought sweet, big man's nick.

953
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:37,970
I thought nice one,
someone to look up to.

954
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,555
Fucking bollocks,
joking ain't you?

955
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,765
- Nev.
- Eh?

956
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:44,185
Fucking walking around,
fucking giving it the large'un,

957
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,687
intimidating people.

958
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,189
Yet you can't even sit
on your own fucking ass

959
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,024
for 5 fucking seconds.

960
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:52,026
What's that about, eh?

961
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:55,988
Fucking embarrassing,
that's what that is, fucking pathetic.

962
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:59,117
Tell you what you are mate,
a fucking prison poof.

963
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,706
I'm sorry, I didn't...

964
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,207
Here, what you doing?

965
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,375
What's it fucking
look like I'm doing?

966
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:10,169
No don't, mate, no, no,
what about all the work you've been doing,

967
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:13,131
all the stuff, all the changes you've
been going through in class.

968
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,550
Group.

969
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,176
It's a fucking group,
not a class.

970
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,222
You're a fucking man now,
aren't you?

971
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,807
You're a fucking man,
ain't you...

972
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,934
All right, we can
fucking do this.

973
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:27,895
Come on then,
let's fucking have it, let's have it.

974
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,654
Ain't fucking...

975
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,964
All right...
I fucking...

976
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:56,758
I give up.

977
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:59,343
You fucking got me.

978
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,095
- You let me win.
- I didn't fucking let you win.

979
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,639
Yes, you fucking did,
you mug, you let me fucking win.

980
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,183
I didn't fucking
let you win.

981
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:06,726
Yes, you did,
you mugged me right off, you cunt.

982
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:07,769
I didn't.

983
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,897
You've been fucking training.
Fucking hell.

984
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,566
Fucking fuck all,
that's what you are, mate.

985
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,235
That's right.
Oi, I'm talking to you, cunt.

986
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,113
Walking away as per usual.
Look at you.

987
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,490
Turn round.

988
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:21,824
Can't, can you?

989
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:23,826
Can't fucking face me,
can you?

990
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:26,579
Cause you're not
a fucking man. More like a fucking fraggle.

991
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:30,416
Come on then, round two,
let's do it proper now. Come on. No?

992
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,752
Don't fucking want it,
do you?

993
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:35,129
'Cause you know you'll
get fucking filled in, that's why.

994
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:37,673
I've got fucking 19 years
of this for you, cunt.

995
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,133
- Young man.
- Just fucking say the words

996
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:41,677
- and I'll come straight at you, cunt. Hey?
- No, no.

997
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:44,806
Remember what I told you.
In my cell, conversation we had?

998
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:45,973
Boy, boy...

999
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,225
Shut up, Neville!

1000
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,395
Now there is a way through this. I
know, because you are like me.

1001
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,606
- Like you.
- Potential is what you possess, Eric.

1002
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,441
Fuck off you, little fuck!

1003
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,656
Look what you
made me do now, yeah? Fucking well done.

1004
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,741
I'm down here
for fucking years, mate.

1005
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:06,786
Make sure you fucking come
and hit me fucking hard, boys.

1006
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,955
Somebody get
his fucking inhaler.

1007
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,459
Boy.

1008
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,213
- Get behind your door!
- Move!

1009
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,009
Fucking queer hands
off me, cunt.

1010
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,553
Step aside!

1011
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:27,098
Eric, easy!

1012
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,892
Take it easy, boy!

1013
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:31,102
Don't fucking kill him!

1014
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,979
Fucking... Fucking...

1015
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:37,942
Fucking milk-fed cunts.

1016
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,486
Fucking back
to your lube now, you fucking queer.

1017
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:43,155
Least I've had a shag.
Fucking virgin.

1018
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,784
Saw a pussy, wouldn't know whether to
fuck it or slide it a saucer of milk.

1019
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:49,453
Fuck off,
you fucking bender!

1020
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,289
At least I'll be
out of here one day

1021
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:54,166
fucking ironing out
one clitoris after the other, cunt.

1022
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:58,379
Don't care, mate.
I like a nice tight hairy little asshole.

1023
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,216
Give yourself 10 years, boy,
I think you'll feel the same.

1024
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,427
You dick-sucking cunt!

1025
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:13,060
I only fucking aimed
to kick off her back door

1026
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:16,397
and pronged the other hole
by mistake... Ah.

1027
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,733
Else you wouldn't even
fucking be here!

1028
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:21,277
All right!

1029
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,321
Fuck's sake.

1030
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:28,326
Legs!

1031
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:34,540
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.

1032
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,668
Go to fucking...

1033
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,005
Clear!

1034
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,842
Fucking had presents
wrapped tighter than this!

1035
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,845
Fucking civil servant cunts!

1036
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,889
Take your fucking pips off,
let's fucking have it!

1037
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:55,811
Come on you...

1038
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,068
Fucking
have the lot of you.

1039
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,862
Come on, take your
fucking pips off!

1040
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:06,030
Let's fucking have you!

1041
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,075
The whole
fucking gang of you!

1042
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,163
Fucking men?

1043
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:18,709
My old fucking grandma
could have fucking had any of you,

1044
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,962
on her 60th fucking day!

1045
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:22,880
Let's fucking go at it,
you cunt!

1046
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:25,591
One on one!

1047
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:29,011
Come on, you fucking cunts!

1048
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:34,475
You fucking suck the cock of cunt,
you fucking assholes!

1049
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:35,768
Go.

1050
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:38,104
Oh, fucking shower, is it?

1051
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:40,231
You fucking women!

1052
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,149
Hey, what do you
fucking need?

1053
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:47,530
Clean my asshole
while you're at it, you fucking nancy boy!

1054
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:05,965
Boy!

1055
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,221
If you've fucking touched him!
If you've touched him!

1056
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,767
Come on boy, answer me.

1057
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:19,020
Don't fucking leave me
hanging like this.

1058
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,022
Just stop
all the fucking around

1059
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,524
and answer me!
I need to hear your fucking voice.

1060
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,569
Boy!

1061
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:29,989
Don't fucking mug me off!

1062
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:33,659
Boy!

1063
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:38,789
You touch him,
you fucking touch him!

1064
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,416
Oh, fuck off.

1065
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,545
What they do to you?

1066
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,384
Fuck all.

1067
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,970
Bottled it, didn't they.

1068
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,017
What,
they didn't do nothing?

1069
01:29:58,185 --> 01:29:59,643
No, fuck all.

1070
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:01,562
Pussy holes.

1071
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:17,870
Junior?

1072
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,019
I'm gonna
fucking top myself.

1073
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,230
I...

1074
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,817
I'm gonna fucking do it,
I swear to God.

1075
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:50,653
I'm gonna smash
my fucking head

1076
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,280
over on that fucking sink.

1077
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,949
Get me fucking Selfy.

1078
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:56,951
Get me him, he's the
only one who knows

1079
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,370
how to fucking deal
with me when I'm like this.

1080
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,664
I'm gonna do it, I swear.

1081
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:03,999
Please, please.

1082
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,086
Please do it.

1083
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,300
Who else fancies a pint? I'd be up for that.

1084
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,011
Cheers, lads.

1085
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,769
- You have a good night, yeah.
- Yeah, home free.

1086
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:25,271
All right, take it easy.

1087
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,653
Here.

1088
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:34,738
Open the door.

1089
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:36,407
No, I can't Nev.

1090
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:39,994
Why not?

1091
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:41,453
'Cause Haynes is on Center.

1092
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:42,872
Oh, fuck that.

1093
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,456
Come on, Selfy,
open the door.

1094
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:48,002
I just, I just want
to fucking get these off. I can't stand it.

1095
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:49,378
It's doing
my fucking head in.

1096
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:51,005
All right.

1097
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,639
You're soaking wet.

1098
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:03,601
Why do you think?
They gave me a fucking bath, didn't they?

1099
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:07,146
- You all right though, yeah?
- Yeah, mate, it's fucking mad.

1100
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,232
They fucking give me the hose.
You know, fucking wouldn't stop...

1101
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:14,361
Sorry, mate.

1102
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:38,988
- Where's Self?
- Don't know.

1103
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,056
Face the wall.

1104
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:09,393
Back on the wing.

1105
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:14,690
Hey, you gave me
the opportunity. Fair play.

1106
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:18,694
But... I'm...

1107
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,198
I'm not wired up right
in the, um,

1108
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,452
the father role, you know,
I can see that now.

1109
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:29,913
But I do need
to know he's safe.

1110
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:31,332
I need to
know that, Dennis.

1111
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:34,168
Because there's one thing
I will not allow,

1112
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:37,588
under any circumstances,
and that is for anyone...

1113
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:41,508
To fucking top my kid.

1114
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:44,303
Okay?

1115
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,434
You know I could never
harm your flesh and blood, Neville.

1116
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:00,736
The whole point
is safeguarding him.

1117
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:03,572
Get you on your toes
to teach him how,

1118
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,491
because it's not always possible
for you to be there

1119
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:07,159
- to protect him from himself.
- Yeah.

1120
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,536
You little fucking cunt.

1121
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,121
Ah... Fuck.

1122
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:14,792
I don't normally
say this, but...

1123
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,128
You're like family to me.

1124
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:23,384
I care about you, Neville.

1125
01:35:25,804 --> 01:35:27,137
You're like you're me own.

1126
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,317
You fuck.

1127
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:44,738
Fucking...

1128
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:00,963
Haynes wanted it.
Not me. I had to go along.

1129
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,346
Get down there quick.
You can save him.

1130
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:15,561
It's all right, Dennis,
you won't feel a thing.

1131
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:17,271
Argh!

1132
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:28,615
Okay, go.

1133
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:51,763
Hold him, hold him!

1134
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,518
Argh!

1135
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,403
No! Fucking...

1136
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:08,614
- Cut him down, cut him down!
- All right, all right.

1137
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:24,004
Sierra Foxtrot
from Kilo One, over.

1138
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:27,299
Kilo One, send.

1139
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,092
Attempted suicide

1140
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:31,178
in CSU, over.

1141
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,763
Come on then, boy.

1142
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:36,808
Eric. Eric stay, please.

1143
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:43,941
Oh, shit.

1144
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:50,030
It's all right,
it's all right.

1145
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:55,702
You're all right,
you're all right.

1146
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,163
Daddy's here, I'm here.

1147
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:01,166
I'm here, I'm here.

1148
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:11,552
Okay.

1149
01:39:01,603 --> 01:39:02,936
Eric.

1150
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:08,567
- Blood!
- Eric.

1151
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:13,989
Eric.

1152
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:19,911
Hey,
fucking answer me, blood.

1153
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,039
Else it's you, bruv.
We're coming for you.

1154
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:24,041
Fuck off,
you bunch of tarts.

1155
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:27,502
Hey, you fuck off.

1156
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:28,962
You all right, bruv?

1157
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:31,298
- Yeah, sweet.
- D Wing coming in!

1158
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,468
Hey,
hold it down, yeah, bruvva.

1159
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:36,094
All right, cool.

1160
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,318
Half hour outside.

1161
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:53,987
Come on,
do you good.

1162
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,671
Dad!

1163
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,125
Proud to be your dad.

1164
01:41:11,149 --> 01:41:12,941
- Thanks, guv.
- Welcome, son.
