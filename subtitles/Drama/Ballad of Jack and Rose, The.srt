1
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,993
You don't have to decide now
so don't be nervous.

2
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,029
<i>I won't be anxious about it.
Episode 39.</i>

3
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:16,430
So please get your hands out of this.

4
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,428
Go to the cottage
where I and my mother used to live

5
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,939
or go to Soo.

6
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:29,039
It's a favor and an order.

7
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:36,245
Now I really go to the death of way!
Baekjae 4th Prince's way,

8
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,156
to Crown Prince's way!
To the way of King!

9
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:44,660
Please vanish in front of my eyes!

10
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:51,564
Yes, please vanish.

11
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,069
That's abandoning me.

12
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,368
If we have to be apart
because of danger,

13
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,568
if we have to farewell
because of agony,

14
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:02,672
if we have to be separated
because of considering each other,

15
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,077
I don't believe in those.

16
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:09,481
We must be together
because you have sickness,

17
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:13,324
we must be together
because you confront agony,

18
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,619
we must be together
because you're in danger.

19
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:21,130
If we're not together for any reasons,

20
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:26,529
That's abandoning each other.
That's not protecting.

21
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,532
I don't do that.

22
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,239
If you have to use me,
I'll be used.

23
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,643
If I have to put my life on you,
I'll do that.

24
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:43,945
I won't ever vanish myself
for any circumstances.

25
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,053
This is the love I know!

26
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:15,504
Please use my vengeance.

27
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,708
How dare you!
I'll release soldiers and execute you.

28
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,320
Will you trust me
if I give the necklace to you?

29
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:25,321
I have a necklace 4 written on it.

30
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:29,621
If not, these don't mean
a thing to me.

31
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,530
So I will throw them away
into the ocean.

32
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,332
He gave up the necklace
which will prove himself?

33
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:46,837
He tried to be the throne by using me?

34
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:59,455
I didn't know this,
I didn't realize it!

35
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,424
Traditionally Baekjae gained strength

36
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,824
From diplomacy based on technology.

37
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:40,921
Isn't it why Prince Aja
used to concentrate on it.

38
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:45,435
It's true but in a way,
he had no choice.

39
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,834
He had no choice?

40
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:51,238
The Prince wouldn't dominate nobles,

41
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:55,745
it means he couldn't do national policy
under his leadership.

42
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,942
Do you mean there is
an important national policy?

43
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,245
Yes!

44
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,745
What could it be?

45
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:07,552
The King Onjo who found Baekjae,

46
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:10,661
The King Geunchogo
who strengthen Baekjae afterward,

47
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:14,789
the reason why he had to
conqeoror Mahan was because of salt!

48
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:20,001
To maintain lives of people at least,

49
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:23,301
Salt was essential thing.

50
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,999
That's why 3 nations were divided

51
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:28,806
in order to secure salt.

52
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,507
That's not all
but it's a significant reason.

53
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,517
Then what's the present era?

54
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:37,417
No, what's the next era?

55
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,320
- It's rice!
- Rice?

56
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,420
But rice isn't the main food.

57
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,726
Yes, but whoever had rice,

58
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,424
they want to have it again.

59
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,126
Yes, sure they do.

60
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,238
People want to have better food.

61
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:57,431
Yes, that makes the era.

62
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:00,137
What makes people better

63
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:04,442
naturally gets developed
its production and technology.

64
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,746
Finally rice will be the main food of 3 nations,

65
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,050
in this case,
Baekjae has geographic advantage,

66
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,488
And that's why we'll be attacked often.

67
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,187
In fact, during few centuries of 3 nations,

68
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:22,289
the production of rice rapidly increased.

69
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:28,202
<i>What Mok tried to teach was
Jang's lmperial education!</i>

70
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,308
<i>I was only used!</i>

71
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:35,208
Therefore, you make the naitonal plan
for the nation's future.

72
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:39,512
Notjust an individual engineer
can do to extend its prodcution

73
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,913
But what the nation can do!

74
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,816
What only nation can do!
Find those sorts.

75
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:45,321
If you succeed in it,

76
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:49,518
we'll attract nobles under Sir Sa.

77
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,026
How could it?

78
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,725
That's correct.

79
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,128
Nobles have open fields

80
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,331
they'll gain strength naturally
when agriculture is emphasized.

81
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:06,936
Princess will be satisfied
because it raises King's authority.

82
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,047
<i>Satisfy, satisfy.</i>

83
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:14,984
<i>I'll be satisfied
when I'm used by you, 4th son.</i>

84
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,487
<i>I won't leave you alive!
I won't leave you alive!</i>

85
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,005
What walked you here at this night?

86
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,700
What happened to this crack?

87
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,400
It's nothing serious.

88
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:50,618
Perhaps is it because of King's health?

89
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,324
Why didn't you tell me?

90
00:09:57,662 --> 00:10:01,826
Are you afraid of me
just like Dalsol Giroo said?

91
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:15,573
If that's the case,
I'm little sad and disappointed.

92
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:20,580
Although I made
bad decisions along the way,

93
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:24,883
it was only for our father
to be enthroned.

94
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:31,194
Plus, even if we have different mothers,

95
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,889
I thought you'd understand me well.

96
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,394
I've never thought of you
as an enemy or not in the future.

97
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:44,607
I won't hurt you in any circumstances.

98
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:48,701
Please stop extending the power,

99
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,816
and straighten up the 4th son!

100
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:58,215
That's the only way to have peace
between you and me.

101
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:04,323
So please consider it carefully.

102
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,127
Brother!

103
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,539
It's nothing.

104
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,647
I'll consider what you just said.

105
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,781
How's the lord?

106
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,380
Those doctors are good,

107
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,084
the sudden fit is eased.

108
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:14,331
But nobody knows when it'll start again,
so I'm anxious.

109
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:18,426
My brother knows the Lord is
in critical condition.

110
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,730
What?

111
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:25,139
Then what happened to us?

112
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,642
He said that he won't hurt us.

113
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,942
Is it true?
Can we trust him?

114
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:34,643
So he wanted to me stop
extending my power,

115
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:37,449
and tell him about 4th son.

116
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,251
Right, it should be.

117
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:47,659
However, the lord's health
is getting worse.

118
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,267
Shouldn't we have to do that?

119
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:46,246
<i>The man who brings this letter
is the 4th son.</i>

120
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:52,453
<i>This is the answer to you,
please take it.</i>

121
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:36,933
We have to keep going.

122
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,942
But the situation is different

123
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,443
when I chose to come to the palace.

124
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,643
Yes, if I knew King was that severe,

125
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:49,049
I wouldn't have seen
Princess Wooyoung.

126
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,155
I would have gone to the general.

127
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,154
Pardon?

128
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,453
It was crucial to
come back to the palace.

129
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:59,960
I was desparate that
I had to prepare myself.

130
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:03,761
How much I could learn
in different circumstances,

131
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:07,463
what kind of danger would
come to people here...

132
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:12,301
And how fast the danger would come,
I'm not sure of.

133
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:16,409
But I just want to push it forward.

134
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:23,410
So instead me becoming the king,

135
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,320
please think first

136
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:29,018
What we need to do for Baekjae to improve.

137
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,929
I still don't have an answer to that.

138
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,141
I see.

139
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,341
What is it?

140
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,545
The King's health needs
special treatment.

141
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:56,348
I've written down
in detail how to treat him.

142
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:58,353
Please hand it over to Queen.

143
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,060
I know you'd be worried about
King's health,

144
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,157
but you should promote national affair
in situation like this.

145
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:15,296
Therefore I told Eunsol to provide

146
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,908
the important national policy.

147
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,101
- So, you need to...
- You people

148
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:22,509
fooled me like that,

149
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:25,908
and act like it never happened.

150
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:29,115
- Princess!
- Where is Jang?

151
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,325
This is it.

152
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:41,121
My lady asked me to organize
the regions of each nobles

153
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:45,133
its farm and special products
as well as minerals.

154
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,930
Yes, thank you.

155
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,039
May I take this and have a look?

156
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:53,941
Of course! She'd have made it for you.

157
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,546
By the way, where is she?

158
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,345
She went to palace.

159
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,345
To palace?

160
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:05,453
What brought you here?

161
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,962
I came to apologize.

162
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,388
Apologize?

163
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:16,796
Duke Seodong and I
unintentionally cheated you

164
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,492
and you must be disappointed.

165
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:21,696
Duke Seodong?
Who are you talking about?

166
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:27,710
I'm talking about Eunsol Jang.

167
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,211
Why do you call him duke Seodong?

168
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,211
He used to sell yam with his mother,
when he was young.

169
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,114
So?

170
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:41,020
I heard him saying it was his happiest days

171
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:45,221
when I was young,
so I've called him since then.

172
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,028
You met him when you were young?

173
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:51,333
- Yes.
- And?

174
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,429
Pardon?

175
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:57,735
How do you as a Silla woman end up here?

176
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:03,437
I met him when he was in Haneuljae...

177
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,446
Please forgive me!

178
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,051
Forgive you what?

179
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:12,285
You followed him here
and doing dangerous thing now

180
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:17,190
beucase of love.
You just surprise me.

181
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:18,987
Princess!

182
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,692
What is he that you risk your life?

183
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,004
Off you go.

184
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,411
Dismiss! Go and get Eunsol!

185
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,816
Creature like your love is just

186
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,327
the greed of becoming the Queen.

187
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,946
He's here?

188
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,879
She went to palace?
She went to see Princess?

189
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:21,083
Yes, but she didn't let go of her anger.

190
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:24,285
She won't let it go easily.

191
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:27,295
But I don't feel good.

192
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:33,195
She wanted to see you.
Go and see her.

193
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,298
Yes.

194
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,510
You need to go to Junghwajung.

195
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,919
<i>The man who brings this letter
is the 4th son.</i>

196
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:56,319
<i>This is the answer to you,
please take it.</i>

197
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,590
Internal Affair Eunsol is here.

198
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,884
Let him in.

199
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:38,693
How may I help you?

200
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,306
Have a seat!

201
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,226
Pick up the glass.

202
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:18,940
I don't drink but this Sogokju
is the best for Baekjae men?

203
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:21,640
Did you want to see me?

204
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:26,344
When my brother acquired
Giroo on his side,

205
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,952
I saw him started with
a glass of Sogokju.

206
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,057
I'm trying to do that.

207
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,250
If that's your intention,
I'll drink it with pleasure.

208
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:39,462
It is too early.

209
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,258
If I need to trust you intactly,

210
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,564
there must be no lie like the last time.

211
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,174
Whatever is it, I asked you to
give me your true heart.

212
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,182
In order to do that,

213
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,085
we must not have
any lies between us.

214
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,293
Yes.

215
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,894
Except the last incident,

216
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:14,327
truly, do you have any other lies?

217
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,444
You don't have any other lies?

218
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,540
No.

219
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,350
I'll ask you for the last time.
You really don't have any?

220
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,968
No, I don't.

221
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,774
Ok, I got it.

222
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:04,074
I'll trust you.

223
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,020
Now drink it.

224
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,021
Yes.

225
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:29,229
<i>This is the first and
last drink I'll offer you.</i>

226
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,742
<i>Why you! Why you!</i>

227
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,140
I'll serve you with my loyalty.

228
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:50,356
Yes, I got it!
It's time to see the lord.

229
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,770
You can deliver this to my brother.

230
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:12,113
This is the gift that Jin wanted to
give it to my brother.

231
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,830
Isn't it fragile gift inside?

232
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,830
It's not fragile material.

233
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,237
I don't want to give it to him
so you need to deliver it.

234
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,837
Yes.

235
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:56,149
Will he be killed?
He will be killed?

236
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:58,354
Jang!

237
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:20,810
<i>He's not Jang, but the 4th son.</i>

238
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,416
<i>Jang,</i>

239
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,818
<i>Jang!</i>

240
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,619
You don't have any other lies?

241
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:33,022
No.

242
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:36,924
I'll ask you for the last time.
You really don't have any?

243
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,831
I'll serve you with my loyalty.

244
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,234
<i>I can't leave 4th son alive!</i>

245
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:54,045
Tell him.

246
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:58,055
Eunsol is here.

247
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,350
Bring him in!

248
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,150
Please go in.

249
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,258
What do you want?

250
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:11,261
Princess wanted me to deliver it to you.

251
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,198
What is it?

252
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:17,697
This is the gift from merchant Jin Gakyung.

253
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,001
Really?

254
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:25,810
Open it.

255
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,710
Yes.

256
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,636
It's switched!

257
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:53,235
I sent the wrong one.

258
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,498
Mine is the small one

259
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:20,793
and yours is big one.
It's my mistake.

260
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,808
Then, I'll go out.

261
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,850
Whatever it is,

262
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:10,352
her mind was switched, not the thing.

263
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,586
What was it?

264
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,295
What was it?

265
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,698
Princess! You just bestowed liquor to me.

266
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:37,610
You bestowed liquor as
its sign of your people.

267
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:40,808
To my brother,

268
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,112
I'll notice about your matter,

269
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:47,918
and hand over all of you!

270
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:52,827
I was afraid.

271
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,435
I was afraid that
King is getting severe...

272
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,532
I tried to give you and beg for my life!

273
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,037
But...

274
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,140
But?

275
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:12,774
But...

276
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:20,387
But I can't watch you die.

277
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:25,492
I can't kill you!

278
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:36,396
Whether it was from method bribery

279
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:42,702
or messengers of Soo,

280
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:46,713
I do not know.

281
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,316
What I know now is

282
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,721
that I can't kill you!

283
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:04,928
Unpleasantly, undigracefully,

284
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,439
my heart started to be stolen.

285
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:53,311
<i>What am I doing to save 4th son!</i>

286
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,213
<i>What am I doing!</i>

287
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,732
Dalsol is here.

288
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,347
What is it?

289
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:28,145
I think the original chest
is the right one.

290
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,452
What are you talking about?

291
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:36,150
There were just accessories of woman.

292
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:42,254
Really? Then Jin must have
brought the wrong one.

293
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,773
Was it necklace?

294
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,275
What are you saying?

295
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,974
I heard that general asked you to confirm

296
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:03,485
To confirm just the 4th son.

297
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:06,490
4th son is dead!

298
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,287
Did you think
I wouldn't check and accept them?

299
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,029
Do you trust them?

300
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:22,931
They deceived their relatioships
and approached to you.

301
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,541
You've found out?

302
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,939
But you still trust them?

303
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:33,848
Do you trust them?

304
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:38,348
It's true that they hid it.

305
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:43,051
But when I investigated,
I could understand their situations.

306
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:49,163
I'm not like my brother.
I see what you're doing to me.

307
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:56,269
But I'm curious about you instead of them.

308
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,871
Their actions were all about their love.

309
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,875
You knew all about these,

310
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,077
and why didn't you tell him about this?

311
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,124
Plus why couldn't you understand
their feelings

312
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,126
and betrayed Dr. Mok and Jang?

313
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,928
How much do you know

314
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,035
and how much are you hiding
from my brother?

315
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:31,239
Did you love Jin Gakyung as well?

316
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,948
That must be it!

317
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,966
<i>What did I want...</i>

318
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:09,773
<i>What did I want this from?</i>

319
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,957
- Princess!
- According to Dr. Mok,

320
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,963
you're preparing the national policy
to open the reign of King.

321
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,363
What is it?

322
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,269
Sit down and explain it to me.

323
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:17,706
What is it?

324
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,009
From doctor's vision,

325
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,212
it'll be the era of rice for the future.

326
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:28,621
Of course,
I prefer rice than any other crops.

327
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,218
But can it depend on the era?

328
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:36,526
If you like it,
people will like it for sure.

329
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:42,230
Anyhow isn't excellent reign
to feed people well?

330
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:46,832
Rice hasn't been great proportion
of agriculture,

331
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,744
but statistically among 3 nations,

332
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,746
only rice rapidly increased
its proportion.

333
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:57,451
It means that people favored rice.

334
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:59,146
So that Taehaksa investigated

335
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,850
to increase its production.

336
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,555
But the best way to cultivate
rice is not in field.

337
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,358
But in paddy field
where water can be supplied.

338
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,700
It's not the rainfall
but you can supply water on cropland?

339
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:15,100
Is it possible?

340
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:18,504
It looks impossible but if it's possible,

341
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,611
many people won't starve to death.

342
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,508
I'm trying to find a way.

343
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:30,818
So please allow me to focus on it
except I'm working here.

344
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,824
Although I lied to come back,

345
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,827
but my heart towards Baekjae is true.

346
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:48,236
I will dedicate this loyalty to you.

347
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:53,136
I understand.

348
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,056
Jang! Did you call me?

349
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:11,753
- Yes.
- Did you call them, too?

350
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,488
My father wasn't called up
but he followed me.

351
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,997
I just came to see Jang.

352
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,296
I told doctor about it
so you need to help me.

353
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,099
Open it now!

354
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,003
What, what's this?
Is it rice?

355
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,508
Isn't this the map of main land?

356
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,306
- Huh?
- Why this?

357
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,312
I wanted to make this as well.

358
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,609
You mean Baekjae?

359
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,511
It's good to make the whole thing
but that's too much.

360
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,314
Where mountains and open fields are.

361
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,924
Where rivers are and something like that.

362
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,425
That's foolish.

363
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:48,327
Mountains and rivers are

364
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,231
very large and tall and wide.

365
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,235
If there's a mountain,
woods have to be there.

366
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:56,135
As well as animals.

367
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,243
How can you draw all those
in a piece of paper?

368
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,244
Just like when we design things small,

369
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,847
we measure it and draw in reduced size.

370
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:08,941
Even if you reduce it,
think about it.

371
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:15,491
How can you do huge land
in this piece of a paper?

372
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,185
I see, I know people who can do this!

373
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:19,990
You're talking about Dolsye
from metallurgy, right?

374
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,693
Yes, and there's another person...

375
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,201
- Woosoo?
- Yes.

376
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,502
I stopped by on the way to here.
But she didn't want to talk.

377
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:36,807
After Juriyoung and Soji were killed,
she doesn't talk much.

378
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,917
I'll look after her.
I asked her something.

379
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,020
I'll investigate each regions with trainees.

380
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:48,023
I'll bring yummy foods when you're busy.

381
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,024
Please play with me!

382
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,225
- Deliver it.
- Yes!

383
00:38:58,468 --> 00:38:59,628
Uncle!

384
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,341
Long time no see.

385
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:08,138
Now you're Sir Eunsol,
you must lower your honorific.

386
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,041
Please don't do that.

387
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,870
Still.

388
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:15,382
I came here to ask you a favor,
so please don't do that.

389
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,781
A favor?

390
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:44,004
Why the hell is she looking at
Jang like that?

391
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:45,513
He'll be drilled.

392
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,611
Hey!

393
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,321
- Hey!
- Why?

394
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,427
I was going to see you.

395
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,928
- Why?
- I heard you don't eat much?

396
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,632
You gotta eat so you can fight with me.

397
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:09,034
When I fight with the weak,
what would people say to me?

398
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:14,167
It's the speical medicine
I asked from engineer Gomo.

399
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,878
This will stimulate your appeitite.

400
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,381
Don't worry.

401
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,183
Eat it! Damn it!

402
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,292
What's going on?

403
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,301
- I need to talk to you.
- Yeah? Let's go.

404
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,396
Just your land and
Sir Gook and Sir Baek,

405
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,804
try supplying water on it.

406
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,913
Then it's possible to use
a cow to cultivate

407
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,607
and it's notjust
strengthening your power,

408
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,513
you will grasp the era.

409
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:27,851
- Did you mine this mineral in that region?
- Yes.

410
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,351
- Have you found a mine?
- Yes.

411
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,257
It's a new mineral.

412
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,064
Here it is.

413
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,682
You came, Princess.

414
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,682
I'm raising 500 for martial soldiers

415
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,625
another 500 for weapon soldiers.

416
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,732
<i>You must decide.</i>

417
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,635
<i>You must decide!</i>

418
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:28,237
Lord!

419
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:44,152
Lord! What do I do! Lord!

420
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,462
Lord!

421
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,364
This man is not the lord!

422
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,922
Master! Why did you scream?

423
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,627
Did I scream?

424
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,130
Yes, you shouted 'Ack.'

425
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,236
It's nothing, I just dreamt.
Go back to sleep.

426
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:30,634
Yes, master.

427
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:21,620
<i>It's just a dream.</i>

428
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,525
Doctor!

429
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,835
What is it?

430
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,132
I'm the servant of King's room.

431
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,937
King's room? So?

432
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:46,846
Lord, lord just suddenly had a fit.

433
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,747
What? Sudden fit?

434
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:53,448
Yes, so I was ordered to
bring the doctor and Gomo.

435
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,147
His health is...

436
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,451
I see. I will wake doctor up

437
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:02,258
And you can wake Gomo up.

438
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:03,558
Yes.

439
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:10,171
Doctor! Doctor!

440
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,705
Doctor!

441
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,406
What do you need?

442
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:17,605
I need to talk to you urgently!

443
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:19,009
I see!

444
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,619
What is it at late night?

445
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,924
A disaster happened to me suddenly.

446
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,031
A disaster?

447
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,226
I can't cope with it by myself,

448
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,736
so please wait for me
outside of palace, Songguemjung.

449
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:45,433
- Songgeumjung.
- Yes, I'll follow you soon.

450
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:49,036
I'm asking you sincerely!

451
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,745
Yes, I got it.

452
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,005
Lord!

453
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,917
What happened?
What happened?

454
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:31,815
Lord! Lord!

455
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:37,222
What happened?
He's not coming back after depleting blood.

456
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,627
Give me the musk!

457
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:14,494
Lord!

458
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:19,295
Yes, lord! This is Sun!
Can you see me?

459
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:22,300
Sun!

460
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,599
Yes, lord! I'm Sun.

461
00:47:26,342 --> 00:47:30,210
Queen and Wooyoung,

462
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:35,814
- my Woochi...
- Yes, lord!

463
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,318
Lord!

464
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,613
Look after...

465
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,018
Lord!

466
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:47,722
Lord! Lord!

467
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:53,926
You can't go like this!
What about us?

468
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,936
Lord!

469
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:00,840
Lord! Lord!

470
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:04,037
Lord!

471
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,047
Lord! Lord!

472
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:14,883
Lord! Don't leave us here!

473
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:19,993
Don't leave young Woochi here!

474
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,496
Lord!

475
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:35,004
Was I too cautious?

476
00:48:39,248 --> 00:48:41,307
Lord!

477
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:48,117
Lord! Lord!

478
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,032
How come Dr. Wooyoung is
no where to be seen?

479
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,831
She went to Nosaji with Eunsol Jang.

480
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:05,840
Isn't Nosaji the region of Sir Sa?

481
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:09,241
Yes, he went to examine the fields

482
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,539
and took Princess.

483
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,276
They will be back tomorrow.

484
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:16,876
What about Dr. Mok?

485
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,283
How come Dr. Mok isn't here?

486
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:23,189
Since Gomo is here,
isn't it why he wasn't called up?

487
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,002
Didn't you message Dr. Mok
when King started a fit?

488
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,008
Yes, I did.

489
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,410
Did you see him and say?

490
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,710
Someone delivered it for me.

491
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,116
I was in a hurry to
escort engineer Gomo.

492
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,330
Go through procedure
under Queen's order.

493
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:05,628
Yes!

494
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,433
I can't find Dr. Mok.

495
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:12,268
- Did he run away?
- I don't know about that.

496
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:17,176
Princess and Jang are on the way
to here from Nosaji.

497
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,078
Proceed all other things normally,

498
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,675
and arrest Mok and Jang quietly.

499
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,584
We have many things to ask them, right?

500
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:27,883
Yes!

501
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,283
Move, now!

502
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,895
Lord, lord passed away?

503
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,007
- Search it!
- Yes!

504
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,336
Do a complete search!

505
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,941
Did the King pass away again?

506
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,341
We didn't know much
but he had chronic disease.

507
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,141
He rumbled to get there and now he's.

508
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,944
Did you hear it and came out?

509
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,143
Where is Jang?

510
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,753
He went to Nosaji.

511
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:31,945
Why there?

512
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,250
He had business there with Princess.

513
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,255
Tomorrow will come soon.

514
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:40,159
You guys go to merchant Jin
and inform the death of King.

515
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,560
And dispose people
where Jang is coming.

516
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,666
Is general trying to harm him again?

517
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,065
- It looks like it.
- What about the doctor?

518
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,263
I put him in the safe place.

519
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,864
You guys go now
and don't let Jang to come here.

520
00:52:00,616 --> 00:52:02,278
Stop now.

521
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:07,287
I stay a day in the Royal villa.

522
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,288
Yes!

523
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:13,225
But don't tell I'm staying here
but in Nosaji office,

524
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,228
to Dalsol of Internal Affair.

525
00:52:15,364 --> 00:52:16,525
Princess!

526
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,927
You left the office for 3 days.

527
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,234
We have to go now
to work for tomorrow.

528
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,933
- Go and deliver it.
- Yes.

529
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,044
I'll do it.

530
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,446
If Princess and I don't go back...

531
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,140
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with you.

532
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,845
Let's go!

533
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,464
He's not there?

534
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,365
Yes, I searched the room
but it wasn't found.

535
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:58,372
Then did they notice first and escape?

536
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,779
Dr. Mok is in missing.

537
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,880
We're ordered to prepare
the funeral of the King.

538
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,178
Dr. Mok Rasoo is not around
at the moment,

539
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:10,877
so prepare it with caution.

540
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,112
Yes, sir!

541
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:16,224
They knew it already.

542
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,621
If it is so,

543
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,924
they will message Princess
and Jang coming here.

544
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,032
Release soldiers now.

545
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,929
Mind your own business!

546
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,045
Why are you so late?

547
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,450
I had to prepare for it.

548
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:49,150
What is it?
What's the disaster happened to you?

549
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:53,354
Please follow me.
You must help me.

550
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,676
- Isn't it a boat?
- Yes.

551
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:10,078
Why a boat?

552
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,412
I want you to meet

553
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,610
a man across the river
so I prepared it already.

554
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,515
A man across the river?

555
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,418
He needs your help desparately.

556
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,719
I can't do it with my power.

557
00:54:27,162 --> 00:54:31,828
It won't be long.
So please get on it.

558
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,731
Isn't there other intention?

559
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:37,430
Doctor! Since when I had other intention

560
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,133
and lied to you?

561
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,738
I really do need your help!

562
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,741
Please get on the boat.

563
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:32,228
King really passed away?

564
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,126
Yes, the bell was rang already.

565
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,325
Ms Mojin said that soldiers were
looking for the doctor.

566
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:40,732
Where is he?
What happened to him?

567
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,533
Mother moved him to a safe place.

568
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,436
She told us not to worry about him.

569
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,738
So Jang!
Please don't let him come to the palace.

570
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,436
- I got it.
- He must have

571
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,843
and coming from residence of
Sa Dokwang to the palace.

572
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:55,542
Definitely, Abigi's men will be there.

573
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,346
Take Seochung and head
to shortcut behind the mountain.

574
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:01,252
- Yes.
- Stand in every path.

575
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,654
I got it!

576
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,056
Don't we have to go out?

577
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,857
I know.

578
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,491
Have you place men with Princess?

579
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:17,902
Yes,

580
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,011
It's right they visited
residence of Sa in Nosaji.

581
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,907
But why do you ask?

582
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:25,412
The King has passed away.

583
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,707
What?

584
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,213
Things are going easier than I thought.

585
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:32,513
Yes.

586
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:35,917
Did you find out?

587
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,723
Yes, Dr. Mok didn't come to Jin's house.

588
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:43,424
But trainee Bumro and
Eunjin just went by.

589
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,729
Isn't Dr. Mok in Taehaksa?

590
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,030
No!

591
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,639
I have to go to the palace,

592
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:52,935
please lookout whether Dr. Mok
goes to Jin's house.

593
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,440
Yes, I got it.

594
00:56:54,576 --> 00:56:57,137
You message to people
who were dispatched with Princess,

595
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,544
and check where she is now.

596
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:04,244
If merchant Jin knows this,
certainly she will hide Jang.

597
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:11,355
Dispatch all soldiers on the way
to the palace!

598
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,588
- Understood?
- Yes!

599
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:21,102
Why now, why Wooyoung went to Nosaji,

600
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:25,297
and couldn't see the King passing away.

601
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:29,401
I've sent soldiers
so she will come back soon.

602
00:57:30,746 --> 00:57:32,510
The will of the King is...

603
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,919
I'll keep his words.
Please don't worry.

604
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,117
Woochi,

605
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:42,818
Woochi!

606
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,391
How did you come here without alerting me?

607
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,395
I'll stay here one day and leave.

608
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,396
Yes.

609
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,899
I haven't eaten so prepare foods.

610
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,195
Yes.

611
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,522
Who is it?

612
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,527
I'm Naesol of military police.

613
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,727
Aren't you guard of Princess Wooyoung?

614
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,634
- Correct!
- How come Princess is not here,

615
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:04,933
and you came here alone?

616
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,942
Why are you standing
on the way of Princess?

617
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,739
The King passed away.

618
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,371
- What?
- So we came to escort Princess urgently.

619
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,176
Did King really pass away?

620
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,581
Yes, where is she?

621
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:23,188
Where is she?
We're ordered to escort her.

622
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:26,693
I see, I will escort her now

623
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,195
- You people can go back.
- What are you saying?

624
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,698
We have to escort her right now!

625
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,601
She's in government office in Nosaji.

626
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,500
- Go and get horses now.
- Yes.

627
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,304
She wanted to the management
so she's taking a day there.

628
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,312
Go to Sir Dalsol and say
I'm going to Nosaji office.

629
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:46,608
Yes!

630
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,310
Let's go!

631
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:53,012
What are you doing?
Let's hurry!

632
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:04,026
Why? Why is he saying Nosaji office?

633
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,827
- Brother Goosan!
- What happened?

634
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,774
You've been standing like this
for whole day.

635
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,776
You said that you've
an urgent matter to discuss.

636
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,704
What? She went to
government office in Nosaji?

637
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:54,011
Yes, we met the guard of Princess,

638
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,708
and he said that Princess is there.

639
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:59,913
Alright. Get ready a horse!
I'm going myself!

640
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,320
- Royal villa?
- Yes, she went there

641
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,426
but the guard tricked them
that she went to Nosaji.

642
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,425
- Well done.
- Yes.

643
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:11,824
Where did Sir Heuk go?

644
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,833
He went to Nosaji office.

645
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,130
Damn it!

646
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,933
Get ready horses and 10 soldiers!

647
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,133
- Why?
- That's not it.

648
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,951
Princess!

649
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,461
Although I lied to you,

650
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,964
I know that you've looked after us.

651
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:52,764
So I gave you my sincere.

652
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,668
To open the reign of the King,

653
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,179
I will dedicate my loyalty with you,
Princess.

654
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:01,878
But,

655
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,080
the order that your heart
was stolen by me,

656
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,286
I cannot accept it.

657
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:18,225
That I cannot help myself.

658
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:27,335
Jin Gakyung, I truly truly...

659
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:28,739
You don't,

660
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,839
You don't have to love me.

661
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:40,548
The most important thing is
that I can't harm you.

662
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,958
So what I'm left with is...

663
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,962
to marry you.

664
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,760
Princess!
