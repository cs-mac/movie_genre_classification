00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,707
In 1933 "Aliat HaNo'ar" was
established to save children

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,266
from the danger of extermination
at the hands of the Nazis.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,020
During and after the war its
representatives continued to gather

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,744
children from their hiding places
and brought the survivors to Israel

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,099
where they built their homes.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,905
Scores of youth villages were
set up for this purpose and they

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,024
absorbed 300 thousand
children and adolescents.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,223
The movie "Under The Domim Tree"

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,940
is dedicated to this
marvelous organization.

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,625
Misha?

35
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,705
Misha?

36
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,580
Misha Alboim?
Misha?

37
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,143
Misha?

38
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,146
Misha Alboim?

39
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,820
Over here!

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,867
They've found him.

41
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,104
We should have
taken care of him.

42
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,065
"There" we always took care of him.

43
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,104
Now the two of us are all alone.

44
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,903
Two of us are not all alone.

45
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,539
We should've gone with him.

46
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,780
Don't even think that way.

47
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,020
We couldn't have done anything.

48
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,228
Nothing at all.

49
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,789
Summer, 1953

50
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,823
My dear Aviya,
I'm going to Germany.

51
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,066
To see about our reparations.

52
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,469
Maybe things will finally work
out for us with this money.

53
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,304
I went to see your mother.
She's still

54
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,466
in the psychiatric ward.

55
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,343
It seems that she'll be there
for a long time.

56
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,268
Enclosed are two photographs
of your father.

57
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,905
I have a better
one somewhere.

58
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,861
If I find it,
I'll send it to you.

59
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,539
Take care.
Aunt Alice

60
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,348
Oudim

61
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,942
Money can't pay back
the murder of millions.

62
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,743
It's not about the Holocaust
I'm talking about my family..

63
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,579
Calm down.
- Isn't it enough that they

64
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,541
killed your parents?

65
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,149
Shut up!

66
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,865
It's not about the money.
It's a matter of principle.

67
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,538
Money for blood.

68
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,901
No reparations.

69
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,704
And that's final.

70
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,060
But it's money, Yurek.
Money.

71
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,784
I deserve that money.

72
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,106
It won't bring your Parents
back to life. -No.

73
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,705
But at least I'd have
something for my future.

74
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,345
We're not talking about you.
We're talking about our country.

75
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,107
Quite please.

76
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,027
Where are your manners?
You're in the dining hall.

77
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,779
I'm sorry, Rachel. They've
been arguing since yesterday.

78
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,059
There's no argument.

79
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,226
We all agree, except Sara B.

80
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,581
Zevik, I can hear you even when
you don't shout. Sit down.

81
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,547
But I'm the monitor.

82
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,301
The committee has to discuss
this before the children...

83
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,740
Rachel, they are old enough...
- Later

84
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,102
I want to introduce to you
a new girl who's joining us.

85
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,346
This is Miriam Segal.
- Mira.

86
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,860
Excuse me?
- Mira. My name is Mira.

87
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,186
This is Mira. I'm sure
you'll help her fit in,

88
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,380
and make her feel
at home.

89
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,628
Good luck, Mira. -I'm Ariel.
Let me introduce you?

90
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,382
Ayala, Aviya, Daniel.

91
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,341
She'll be in your room.

92
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,343
Pass me a knife. -Tell her
she can take off the hat.

93
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,099
Zevik, the tea's not hot.
- That's what there is.

94
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,468
Don't I eat get any fish?

95
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,388
Vegetarian table.
- I don't eat grass.

96
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,947
look what she's eating.
Miss Sarah B is on a diet.

97
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,664
She's not like the other
fat girls in the group!

98
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,827
No, Miss Sarrah B is special,
she's from Warsaw.

99
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,067
Stop Shouting.
You're making me death.

100
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,784
You look like your
from the ghetto.

101
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,629
Yurek's little servant.

102
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,499
Did you hear that, Yurek?
I'm from the ghetto.

103
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,384
Always on Yurek's back.
- leave him alone Sarah.

104
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,386
The bed unfolds like this.

105
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,948
In the morning, you fold it
back under the other bed.

106
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,665
Every morning. Why can't it
stay out like the rest?

107
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,384
I'm not a sucker.
- Who said you were?

108
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,940
Every year we draw lots
for the shelves and the beds.

109
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,941
Who was here before me?

110
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,109
Dita. Her mother married
an American millionaire

111
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,101
and took her to America.
- Yeah, sure.

112
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,983
This is your shelf.
Put your things here.

113
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,462
Where's your suitcase?
- This is the all I have.

114
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,026
When your shoes are dirty,
you leave them outside.

115
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,861
What a figure Sarah.
Congratulations.

116
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,026
It's "Bez" in Poland now.
- No, it's not.

117
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,141
What month is this?

118
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,068
No, in Polish.

119
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,308
June. "Czerwiec".
- Yes, "Bez" in June.

120
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,661
The leaves are
already dropping,

121
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,623
and when you walk on them
they make a sound like:

122
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,424
crik, crik, crik.

123
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,982
No, it sounds like:
Chak, chak, chak.

124
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,419
Leaves fall, girls.
They fall.

125
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,018
And you step
on them.

126
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,708
Fall. Drop.
What's the difference?

127
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,708
"Bez" is in October,
In the autumn.

128
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,425
And the snow is up to here.

129
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,348
And when you walk on it,
there's no sound at all.

130
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,906
I have soap in my eyes.

131
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,621
Isn't there a laundry
in this institution?

132
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,469
There is, but we wash
our underwear ourselves.

133
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,704
It's personal.
It's your own.

134
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,264
I don't care about the
Poles or the Fascists.

135
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,063
Yurek, why do you get so
angry when we talk about it?

136
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,182
Say your sorry or
I'll kill you. -Kiss my ass.

137
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,823
Stop it.

138
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,306
Yurek, what about?
- They're going crazy again.

139
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,428
Yurek.
- Run, run.

140
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,225
What are you staring at?

141
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,429
Get inside.

142
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,300
Why are you all standing
there like that? It's late.

143
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,900
Tell them to stop?

144
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,063
Don't you dare open it?

145
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,782
Nobody raises their voice

146
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,186
or their hand to me.

147
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,103
Go stop them now.
- They'll stop by themselves.

148
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,984
I've been telling you for months
that they must be separated.

149
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,228
If you don't do it, I will.
- Not now.

150
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,578
You don't learn from your
mistakes. Need I remind you?

151
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,186
of Misha? -Are you saying
Misha was my fault?

152
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,781
I'm not saying that?

153
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,829
But you don't want it
to happen again, do you?

154
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,786
Everyone here thinks
he's an expert.

155
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,944
It's the first time they're
like that since Misha drowned.

156
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,823
I thought they were cured.

157
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:35,189
Will they be like animals
all their lives?

158
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,188
If you want to talk, go outside.
I want to sleep.

159
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,346
Look at them now.
Acting as if they're normal.

160
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,827
Shut up? Pain in the neck.
- I knew mental cases like them.

161
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,181
Shut up.
- Hey, what's going on here?

162
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,029
It's because of yesterday's
discussion.

163
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,948
Things I want to forget
keep creeping into my head.

164
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,303
You're not the only one, chavy.
I think... -You think?

165
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,466
I think...

166
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,868
We have the right and the
obligation to talk about it.

167
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,062
What do you say, girls?

168
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,342
I wasn't "there".
I have no right to judge.

169
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,468
I think we should take
as much money as we can.

170
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,900
Shut up. You're both sabras.
(Native born Israeli)

171
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,823
Don't yell like that.

172
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,709
I say we should take
as much as we can.

173
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,105
I need the money
for my future.

174
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,738
All you think about
is money.

175
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,747
No blood money.
End of discussion.

176
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,901
In the end, everyone will
take the money.

177
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,225
Do you want to bet?

178
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,858
I'm ready to bet with anyone.

179
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,182
Sarah, what do you mean by
"my" money, "my" future?

180
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,098
We all have the same future.
Building the Kibbutz together.

181
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,381
Do you think I want to spend
my life in this group?

182
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,308
I've had enough
all these years.

183
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,348
I want to wake up alone.
Go to sleep alone.

184
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,267
Without 4 other girls.

185
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,785
I've had enough of all
this "togetherness".

186
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,306
I want to go study.
Succeed. Alone.

187
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,503
Did you hear that Yurek?

188
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,425
I've decided to break up
with Sarah B.

189
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,185
Then I'll break up with Ayala.
- But she's not your girlfriend.

190
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,149
If she were,
I'd break up with her.

191
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,700
What do you think of Ayala?

192
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,946
For me or for you?

193
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,545
What do you say?

194
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,625
For you, for you.

195
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,388
Woman give me a headache.

196
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,820
I give up.

197
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,747
Are your hands clean?

198
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,780
This is for you.

199
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,182
Very funny.

200
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,223
He's mad because
I tell him what I think.

201
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,947
You can't take it when
someone disagrees with you.

202
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,780
It's tough for you to digest.
- Digest. What Hebrew?

203
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,665
We should all learn from Sarah B.
- I digest, you digest.

204
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,708
Laugh. Even my Hebrew's
better than yours.

205
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,980
Right Yurek?

206
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,143
Aviya, come here for a minute.

207
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,384
Who me?
- He's talking to you, isn't he?

208
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,661
What's your answer?
- To what? -My letter.

209
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,099
What letter?
- The one I just gave you.

210
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,540
You gave me a ball of paper.
- Did you throw it away?

211
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,584
Read it.

212
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,065
So?
- What?

213
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,660
What did you want?

214
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,065
I liked what
you said today:

215
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,149
"I wasn't there.
I have no right to judge".

216
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,140
Is that why you called me?
- No.

217
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,144
I like how you speak.
Short. Staccato.

218
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,387
What?
- Staccato, "ta, ta, ta, ta."

219
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,187
Is that good or bad?
- Typical Sabra.

220
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,222
What?

221
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,029
Well.
- Wait a minute.

222
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,943
What, do Sabras shake hands?

223
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,659
Here comes Vim.
- Hi Vim.

224
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,302
Oudim Family,

225
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,342
let's welcome our friends
returning from Holland,

226
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,264
led by our dear
Vim Van Fliman.

227
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,823
To them, he's a hero
of the Dutch underground.

228
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,741
To us, he's a simple gardener
and leader of our Dutch group.

229
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,459
O.K. One moment, please.

230
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,744
This is really wonderful.

231
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,786
I. O.K. Now I'll speak
in Dutch,

232
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,823
because I can't find
the words in Hebrew.

233
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,140
I was visiting her majesty
Queen Juliana,

234
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,821
with my Jewish children
that I hid during the war.

235
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,222
Enough. I'm O.K. now.

236
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,261
I have a surprise.
The sack, please.

237
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,181
This sack has gifts from
my friends in the Resistance,

238
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:10,347
for all the school.
But I need "volunteers".

239
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,590
Who wants?
- Me! Me! Me!

240
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:23,224
For Vim's
a jolly good fellow.

241
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,148
Yes. That will do.

242
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,868
What happened?
- It's your fault.

243
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,709
"Unfold the bed,
fold the bed".

244
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,948
Everything's falling apart
and it's not my fault.

245
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,542
You're wasting your time.
It'll just break again.

246
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,785
How long has this
envelope been here?

247
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,708
You know that you're in charge
of the mail this week?

248
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,859
Why are you making such
a big deal?

249
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,988
Since you arrived, there's
been nothing but problems.

250
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,943
Go cry under your stupid tree.

251
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,507
For me, you don't exist.

252
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,383
And if you call me a bitch again,
I'll smack you both.

253
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,183
You understand Polish?
- "You understand Polish?"

254
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,703
Vim?
- Yes.

255
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,900
Why did you take the tractor?

256
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,420
We're planting.
- Are you crazy?

257
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,463
Planting Tulips in the summer.
It's too hot.

258
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,469
We're planting Tulips
to the north.

259
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,742
You're wasting your time.
Poor children.

260
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,862
There's not even a
drop of water here.

261
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,502
I read in book.

262
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,703
Once, many Tulips
in Israel.

263
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,469
Soon, this place
very beautiful.

264
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,865
What's this?
"Nabatean Farming".

265
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,420
The Nabateans lived here
over 2,000 years ago.

266
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,219
The Nabateans
know the secrets.

267
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:31,063
Soon, will be miracle here.

268
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,469
What are you doing with
the stones? You're nuts.

269
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:42,349
The Nabateans...
We shape the stone

270
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,109
to catch water.

271
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,659
And who told you, you could
take the tractor?

272
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,378
It's O.K.
- No. It's not O.K. at all.

273
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,989
I'll talk to Rachel
about this.

274
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,348
"Home sweet home we go".

275
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:12,386
Can I come with you?
- Not this time Yurek.

276
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,149
We have a wonderful house
with a tile roof.

277
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,420
You stick your head
out the window and plums

278
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,546
fall into your mouth.

279
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,664
I'm not sure you'll get along
very well with my mother.

280
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,020
You can gossip in Polish?

281
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,340
I forgot that horrible
language.

282
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,064
This time I have to go alone.

283
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,869
I'll take the photo out
like this?

284
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,223
What?

285
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,980
What is it?
- Untie it.

286
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,902
Your hair. Untie it.

287
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,380
Tie it up.

288
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,822
You mean braid it?
You "braid" hair.

289
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,701
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

290
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,549
My Dad would be happy.
- And his wife?

291
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,184
I'm going to see him,
not her.

292
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,026
I like it here when
everyone's gone.

293
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,618
At last, I get some privacy.

294
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,823
What, do Sabras
shake hands?

295
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,783
Last one to the gate,
washes the floor.

296
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,220
Is he coming?

297
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,944
He said he would come today?

298
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,947
Mama,

299
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,859
I brought you flowers.

300
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,503
I grew them myself.
- Henya, you have a visitor.

301
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,548
Don't talk to her like that,
she's not a little girl.

302
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,180
Do you want to go out
for some fresh air?

303
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,022
You're not dressed warmly
enough. You'll catch a cold.

304
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,618
I'm O.K.
It's very warm today.

305
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,542
Yes, warm.

306
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,104
Who gave you that photo?
- Aunt Alice.

307
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,869
She sent it to me
before she left.

308
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,669
She went to Germany?

309
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,669
To get our money
from the Germans.

310
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,387
There's no reason to go there.
They're all dead. I saw.

311
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,307
They're all dead,
in the woods of Narosdj.

312
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,265
Is this my father? -My father,
my brother, my husband,

313
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,180
they're all dead. I saw.
- Mama, you weren't there.

314
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,143
You came to Israel
before the war.

315
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,859
Don't tell me where I was.
You fool. You know nothing.

316
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,024
Isn't this from "there?"

317
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,618
Isn't this from "there?"
- What is that?

318
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,945
Is the doctor blind?

319
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,625
Shut the windows, I don't
want the neighbors to hear.

320
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,947
They don't need to know
what's going on in my house.

321
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,460
Tell me about him, mama.

322
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,942
I have to know.

323
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,341
It says here "Kaybeach".
Who's "Kaybeach?"

324
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,866
From Haifa.
- I want the nurse.

325
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,983
I'll call her in a minute.
You have to tell me. Please?

326
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,341
I need to know.
Who's Kaybeach?

327
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,229
Tell me something, Mama.

328
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,905
I have to know.

329
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,819
We're alone again, Yurek.
Just the two of us.

330
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,580
That's not enough for you.
You want to be all alone.

331
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,668
"Alone" means you and me.

332
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,828
What do you see in her?
Is it her braid?

333
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,418
I can make one too.

334
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,419
You mean "braid" one, Sarah.
You braid hair.

335
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,264
Stop, Sarah.
It's over between us.

336
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,063
What we had
can never be over.

337
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,548
It's forever.

338
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,700
Then promise me
we'll stay friends?

339
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,939
No matter what.
Always.

340
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,863
Did you hear?
They found Yola's father.

341
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,868
He's alive in Poland.
- What? -Yes.

342
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,308
Avi, why are you
back so soon?

343
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,669
Didn't you go visit
your mother?

344
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,706
Did you hear?
- Yes. -It's unbelievable.

345
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,221
They called me into
the office.

346
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,865
I saw Rutka, the nurse,
sitting with Rachel and Ariel.

347
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:50,384
Then, Rachel hugged me and said:
Yola, it's a miracle.

348
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,423
You are not an orphan anymore.
They found your father.

349
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,099
He's alive in Warsaw,
in Poland.

350
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,789
We've heard that story,
it's getting boring.

351
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,750
You should be ashamed.

352
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,463
My father's alive.

353
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,507
Can you believe it?

354
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,106
He's alive.

355
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,260
It's amazing.

356
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,984
My father is alive.

357
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,267
He had these big "Lappas".
- What?

358
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,301
Lappas.

359
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,625
Big hands.

360
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,748
That used to wrap up
my little hands.

361
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,904
Soon, Yola. Soon you'll
be holding his "Lappas".

362
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,819
I'd give anything to see
my father just once.

363
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,620
Do you remember him?

364
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,987
He died before I was born.

365
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,623
Maybe it's better that way.
To be an orphan from the start.

366
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,187
Sometimes, memories can kill.

367
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,549
So, how's Yola?
- So how's Sarah B.

368
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,980
You didn't go see
your mother, did you?

369
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,659
Leave me alone. I have enough
problems. -What do you mean?

370
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,822
You and Sarah B.
I saw you together, as if...

371
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,259
As if what?

372
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,185
It's over between
me and Sarah.

373
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,419
It's final.

374
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,704
I missed you.

375
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,628
Yurek. Avi.
Wait a minute?

376
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,419
Can I come with you?

377
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,260
It was just by chance, right?

378
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,548
What happened to Yola,

379
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,429
It couldn't happen to
someone else, could it?

380
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,822
Am I right?

381
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,621
It's a miracle.

382
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,979
What's this?
- To Yola.

383
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,748
It's for me.

384
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,859
- Yola, when you're in Poland,
try to find this man for me.

385
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,261
- Janek Tilas.
- He's my father.

386
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,389
- Thank you and come
back soon. Menachem Tilas.

387
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,978
"Mailbox For Letters To Poland"

388
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,859
Where's Yola? She received
a package from Poland.

389
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,062
A package arrived?

390
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,020
What a tiny dress. Doesn't he
know how old you are?

391
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,225
He probably remembers you
when you were little.

392
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,779
No. This dress
isn't for me.

393
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,504
When I was small,
I had a doll this size.

394
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,860
It's for my doll.

395
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,458
I'm sure he just wanted
to make me laugh.

396
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:04,139
O.K. girls, let's get Yola
ready for her trip to Poland.

397
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,744
We'll embroider her shirt.
- No, two.

398
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,703
One for the trip and one
to celebrate the Sabbath.

399
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,425
Shoulders, 87.

400
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,346
Boobs.

401
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,108
79. You got bigger.

402
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,146
Waist.

403
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,267
Tushie.

404
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,666
A package arrived from Poland?
- Not now. Later.

405
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,829
Try this on.
- It's so beautiful.

406
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,101
Try it on.
- I can't.

407
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,982
My aunt says that
it's forbidden.

408
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,102
You only buy new things
for a baby after he's born.

409
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,222
Let's see how you'll look
when you meet him.

410
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,387
Let's pretend you just
got off the plane.

411
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,829
Wearing Israeli clothes
in Poland. Can you imagine?

412
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,069
In Warsaw, with the
clothes we made.

413
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,380
Yola.

414
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,149
Only 60 more hours.

415
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,948
Lod - Zurich,

416
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,704
Zurich - Paris,

417
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,179
Paris - Vienna,

418
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,508
Paris - Vienna, yes.

419
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,940
Vienna - Warsaw.
- Vienna - Warsaw.

420
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,261
Miss Yola Mintz.
Miss Yola Mintz.

421
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,386
Not Yola, Yolanda,
Yolanda Mintz.

422
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,819
If he hears Yola,
he won't know it's me.

423
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,781
People only call me
Yola here.

424
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,904
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.

425
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,660
Wait. I forgot.

426
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,463
How do you say:
"How are you?"

427
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,824
And "Where have you been
all these years?"

428
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,984
Right.

429
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,828
And
"I love you Papa?"

430
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,026
Come on, let's pack.

431
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,144
First the winter clothes.

432
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,306
We'll put that in last.

433
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,668
And last but not least,
Rutka's coat.

434
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,540
Wait, we forgot something.

435
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,225
Bon voyage, Lalka.

436
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,102
Not so much water.
Just a little.

437
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,943
Vim, are you sure
it'll work?

438
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,669
Look.

439
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:23,020
A plant needs three things:

440
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,148
For the body
for the heart,

441
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,226
and for the head.

442
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,062
Water,

443
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,181
for the body.

444
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,268
Love for the heart.

445
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,269
And the Nabateans
for the head.

446
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,459
But, it's a secret.

447
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:45,862
Yola, Rutka wants
to see you.

448
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,981
Don't dance with anyone else.
I'll be back.

449
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,862
Whoever is not
in this group,

450
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,185
please leave now.

451
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,427
Your counselors
are waiting for you.

452
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,904
My dear children.

453
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,104
I have no words
of comfort.

454
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,181
We all shared
in Yola's joy,

455
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:00,221
and now we share
her grief.

456
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,989
I know that it's difficult.
- Where's Yola now?

457
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,542
In her room.
She's been taken care of.

458
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:18,705
I have a lot of letters
for Poland.

459
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:19,979
What shall I do with them?

460
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,069
I'll take care of it, Yola.
- No, I will.

461
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,420
We must end this.

462
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,379
Come with me, Yola.

463
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,063
Wash her face.

464
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,744
Lie her down in her room.

465
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,338
And close the shutters.

466
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:28,862
Yola, go rest.
It's heavy.

467
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,699
Damn. I can't stop myself
from crying.

468
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:39,099
I'm O.K. now.

469
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,901
Yola wants to return
the clothes you gave her.

470
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,624
There's no hurry.
- It can wait.

471
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,468
Go rest, Rutka.

472
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:02,104
Yes Rutka. I'm O.K.

473
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,345
Here's your coat.

474
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,620
I just want to unpack
the suitcase.

475
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,219
Why is Chavy crying?
Is she sick?

476
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,387
Don't just stand there,
help her.

477
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:22,944
Look at what my aunt
sent me.

478
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:26,904
For my trip to Poland.

479
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,220
I didn't even try them on.

480
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,306
My aunt sent me
long underwear.

481
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,908
She's completely crazy.

482
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,669
She wants me to travel
like this?

483
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:49,228
I ask you. To Poland.

484
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,179
Do you travel to Poland
like this?

485
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,222
Dressed like this?

486
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,026
Do you travel to Poland
like this?

487
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:19,465
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.

488
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:30,745
Do you travel to Poland
like this? Like this?

489
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,309
My father will run away
if he sees me like this.

490
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:04,140
What hysteria.
You would think.

491
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,141
She thought he was dead,
didn't she?

492
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,103
Well now she's sure.
- Shut up. You monster.

493
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,460
You're better off.
- Shut your mouth.

494
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,587
One day you might go
to Poland,

495
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,702
and you'll be able
to visit his grave.

496
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:27,539
Get out.
You filthy.

497
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,545
Stop.
Stop it immediately.

498
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:48,470
Wash your face.

499
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,424
Take your things
and go to your room.

500
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,578
Look at what those
animals did to me.

501
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,659
I could kill them
one by one.

502
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,223
What did I say that was
so terrible?

503
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,864
At least she knows for sure
that he's dead.

504
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,867
Think about it.

505
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,550
All those thoughts.
Alive. Dead.

506
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,942
Now she knows that he's dead,
and she can visit his grave.

507
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,101
Who else here has a grave
that they can visit?

508
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,540
The most important thing
is a grave with a headstone.

509
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,702
Do you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

510
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:46,144
Is there anyone up there?
I can hardly see.

511
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,142
I'm up here.
I'll be down in a minute.

512
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,068
"Kaybeach, Haifa"

513
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,381
Are you running away?

514
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,429
I'm not going anywhere,
and you didn't see me.

515
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,986
Cause if you leave,
I'm taking your bed.

516
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:52,146
Where are you going in Haifa?
Uptown or downtown?

517
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,068
I don't know.
I don't know the city.

518
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:58,064
I'm going to visit someone
that I don't know.

519
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,102
Stick with me. I know Haifa
like the back of my hand.

520
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:04,546
Do you know someone
named "Kaybeach?"

521
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,468
Kaybeach,
Kaybeach.

522
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:09,860
You can't live
with a name like that.

523
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:13,347
Kaybeach is the area
of cemeteries.

524
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,860
That's where I'm going.

525
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,864
Who are you looking for,
my dear?

526
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,988
Your brother?

527
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,662
Your father?
- My father.

528
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,940
Was he in this regiment?

529
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:20,542
He died before I was born.

530
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,583
This is the military cemetery.

531
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,463
The older graves
are over there.

532
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:37,382
"Max Alexandrovitch"

533
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,627
Papa.

534
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,548
Papa.

535
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,823
I brought you this flower.

536
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,339
It's from Holland.
Vim gave it to me.

537
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,902
He's our gardener
at the boarding school.

538
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,940
I work with him.

539
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,985
Mama's very sick.

540
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:49,222
That's why I'm at the
boarding school.

541
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,629
Watch over her, Papa.

542
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,941
And watch over me too.

543
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:09,463
I need someone
to watch over me.

544
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,428
Yurek.

545
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:40,342
I did it. It's unbelievable.
I found him.

546
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:42,938
I found my father.

547
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:46,187
What's wrong?
Was Ariel looking for me?

548
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:54,425
This day is the most...
The most...

549
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:47,188
I think...
- Listen,

550
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:49,949
I have to do
what I think is right.

551
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,582
We have to take care of the
problem once and for all.

552
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,627
Don't worry. I won't let
them be separated.

553
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,028
We'll come visit you.
You'll come visit us.

554
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,984
Zevik, Hadassim Boarding School
is a great place.

555
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,380
It's a lot like our "Oudim".

556
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:22,307
Yurek.
Come on.

557
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,187
We'll come visit you
in a week or so.

558
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:33,744
Have a safe trip.
- Don't worry.

559
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,784
So long, Zevik.

560
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,868
Guys, gather around.

561
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:10,747
I owe you an explanation.

562
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:15,778
Zevik is on his way to Hadassim...

563
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,141
He's going to Hadassim...

564
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:11,019
Take the dogs away.

565
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,220
Naomi. Listen to me.

566
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,548
They're search dogs.
Calm down.

567
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,465
They're here for the search.

568
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,428
This is all your fault.

569
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,582
We'll find them.

570
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,858
Do they have family.
or friends? Anyone?

571
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:05,346
No. But they can live
like this for months.

572
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:07,381
Like this? Outside?

573
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:09,944
They lived 2 years
in a forest "there".

574
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:12,061
They were like animals
when they were found.

575
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,420
Not "Like animals".
They were animals.

576
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:42,463
Don't ask me.
I don't have any answers.

577
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:46,541
But all these years that
you've been together.

578
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:49,469
We don't talk about
what happened "there".

579
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,660
I didn't tell them anything
about me either.

580
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,258
What does anyone know
about anyone else.

581
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:57,780
Even best friends don't know
anything about each other.

582
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:01,425
But that can drive one crazy.
- So you go crazy.

583
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,581
But for how long?

584
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,782
Maybe for good.
Maybe for life.

585
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:13,187
Remember last winter
when we searched for Misha?

586
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:18,622
We passed right through here.
I'm not going back there.

587
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:23,029
You're wasting your time.
They'll come back.

588
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:27,105
What's your problem?
Do your feet hurt?

589
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,103
Why are you making
such a big deal?

590
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,022
If you were missing,

591
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,187
it wouldn't be such
a big deal at all.

592
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:01,463
Somebody should look down.
In the water.

593
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:18,141
Please eat.
We must continue searching.

594
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:20,989
It sticks in my throat.
I have a bad feeling.

595
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,744
You always think the worst.
Stop it.

596
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:26,338
I'm afraid to think
what could've happened.

597
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:28,779
What could've happened?
There they are.

598
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,821
I told you they'd be back.

599
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,505
Either we stay together
or we die.

600
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,346
You'll stay together,
of course.

601
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,468
You'll stay together.

602
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:52,742
Let them breathe.

603
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:56,619
Come see.

604
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,025
The stupid psychologist
is leaving.

605
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,423
Are you happy now?

606
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:21,263
Stop, Yoram.
Enough, Yoram. Yurek.

607
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,302
Stop, Yoram!

608
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,023
Yurek, turn of the water.

609
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,300
Stop the water.
Save it for the tulips.

610
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:54,423
Daniel.
Don't walk on Tulips.

611
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,147
What's going on now, Vim?

612
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,900
Why did you take
all the hoses?

613
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,100
Couldn't you have left
me even one?

614
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,982
Why are you making holes?
Are you crazy?

615
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:18,659
Look.

616
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:24,829
The water drips. Drip-drop.
- Drip-drop?

617
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:28,659
Drip, drip, drip.

618
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,623
Drip-drop.

619
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:33,423
And who'll pay
for new hoses?

620
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,188
Maybe your Nabateans?

621
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,821
My invention.

622
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,463
Congratulations, Vim.

623
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:47,105
This is an agricultural
revolution in Israel.

624
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:50,859
You should patent it.
- Maybe.

625
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:59,665
Hi, Yorem Klein.
- How do you like "Yoram"?

626
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:02,900
"Uri"?
- What's wrong with "Yurek"?

627
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,340
I want to change my name.
- Why is a name so important?

628
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,420
I don't understand.
- You can't understand.

629
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:14,066
Your life's another story.
- Do I even have a story?

630
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,067
I have a great life.
I'm on vacation here.

631
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,146
We shouldn't argue so much.

632
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,989
Maybe we should go out
and have some fun.

633
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:26,700
And what about Zevik?
- Zevik's my problem.

634
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,422
He's not your problem.

635
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,984
Zevik's your problem.
I'm your problem.

636
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:34,068
Everyone's your problem.
- Don't be so dramatic.

637
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:39,347
You have no problems.
You have a wonderful house,

638
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:42,030
you stick your head out
and plums fall into your mouth.

639
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,108
You know what?

640
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,620
Let's go have some fun?

641
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,739
Let's go visit my mother.

642
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:54,979
Aviya, where are you
taking me?

643
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,219
You said we were going
to visit your mother.

644
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:12,341
Mama?

645
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,620
This is Yurek.

646
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:23,904
Mama, can you hear me?

647
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,221
I found him.

648
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,582
His name was on the tombstone.

649
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:36,385
I'll take you there.
We'll go together.

650
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:42,103
Just get out of here,
and everything will be fine.

651
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:50,387
There's nothing left "there".
- Mama, you weren't there.

652
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,183
She wasn't there.
It's all in her head.

653
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,104
Speak to her in Polish.

654
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:00,224
Mama, he is from "there".
He speaks Polish.

655
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:08,301
Where do you live?
- Same place as Aviya.

656
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:15,227
How's your father? -My father?
I don't have one. -Your mother?

657
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:20,344
How's your mother?
- Mrs. Alexandrovitch?

658
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,427
What did she say?

659
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,261
She told me about the house,
where you stick

660
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:35,781
your head out the window,
and plums fall into your mouth.

661
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:46,584
Some people want to forget
where they've been,

662
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:50,027
and others want to remember
where they've never been.

663
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:01,060
How do you pronounce
the letter "R"?

664
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,666
Mine sounds so foreign.
"Yurrrek".

665
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:07,029
But I like your rolling "R".

666
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,783
I want to pronounce it
like you.

667
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:13,663
They say...
- Yurrrek's Aviya's Boyfrrriend.

668
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:17,669
No. "Ruthi runs
by the Ararat River".

669
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,342
No. RRRuthi rrruns.

670
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:26,028
Come see.

671
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:28,744
Rruthi rrruns.

672
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,629
You have visitors.

673
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:31,026
Don't tease me.
Nobody came.

674
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,501
Who's here?
Nobody.

675
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:40,658
Tell me! Who is it?
- Some people.

676
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,187
What do they look like?
- I don't know. People.

677
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:47,143
A man and a woman.
They're short.

678
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:56,781
Wait! What should I tell them?

679
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,582
She's crazy.

680
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,261
My mistake.

681
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:29,900
They went on a trip and
they'll be back late tonight.

682
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,628
We should've called first.

683
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,304
I have to go. Leave whatever
you brought for her here.

684
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:43,182
That's her shelf.

685
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:47,221
What do you mean?
We don't have anything.

686
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:07,460
Why do you care
so much about her?

687
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:10,263
Why don't you air out
her smelly sheets?

688
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,342
That's exactly
what I'm doing.

689
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:24,743
You're terrible, Ayala.
- She won't notice.

690
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:27,259
It looks better like that
than it usually does.

691
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,861
What's with you?

692
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,509
Why are you doing
this to her?

693
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,940
I owe it to her, OK?

694
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,750
Ayala! Stop it!
- Can I come in?

695
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,819
She hasn't returned yet?

696
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,221
It'll be morning soon.

697
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:56,147
We'll have to start
a new search.

698
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:00,185
No, she'll be back.

699
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:03,347
After Zevik and Yurek,
I just don't know anymore.

700
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,706
They always come back.

701
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:10,543
Except Misha.
- Misha.

702
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:13,226
Right, Misha.

703
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:20,898
Get it into your head.
It wasn't your fault.

704
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:30,304
I can't believe we're
waiting up for her.

705
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:34,059
I'm afraid something happened.

706
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,348
I'm awake.
I'm awake.

707
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:49,906
Why are you all
awake so early?

708
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:53,147
We never went to sleep.

709
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:58,461
We were waiting up for you.
- Who made my bed?

710
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,068
Mira, are you OK?

711
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,829
Let us help you.
- Are you OK?

712
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,705
I'm taking off your
dirty socks, OK?

713
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,900
I brought you some food.

714
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,583
Eat.

715
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:33,747
It's good.
You must eat.

716
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,624
Those people.
They're horrible.

717
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,742
They found me in Naples.
In Italy.

718
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:54,065
We arrived there by ship
from Poland. -I told you.

719
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:56,465
I don't remember anything.

720
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:00,060
Except that I was in
an orphanage. -Which one?

721
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:05,059
It was called "Dom Jetzka".
- That means "Children's house"

722
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,862
They're all called that.

723
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:09,709
We were in
"Dom Jetzka Jerusalem"

724
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:14,900
One day, they brought
us to Israel.

725
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,987
The boat was filled
with children.

726
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,465
Girls?
- Come in, Ariel.

727
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:23,459
Mira, we were worried.

728
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:27,618
Are you O.K.? -She is fine.
Sit. She's telling everything.

729
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:32,985
Go on.

730
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:39,389
Those people
found me on the boat.

731
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:42,149
They said they we're
my parents.

732
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:45,269
They bought me a big doll.

733
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:52,388
We lived in Afula.
Everything seemed fine,

734
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:56,264
but I always knew
Something wasn't right.

735
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:01,903
Then she got sick,
and he lost his job.

736
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:04,498
And he started to...

737
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:07,787
my back is covered with
scars from his beatings.

738
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:13,665
I couldn't stand it anymore,
so, I ran away.

739
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:19,104
I never want to see them again.
I could kill them.

740
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,259
What's wrong with her?
What's going on?

741
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:51,224
Mira, what happened?
- Its them. Those people.

742
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:55,905
Miriam, wait.

743
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:59,622
Sir, the office is over there.

744
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:02,583
No need for police.
Miriam Segal is my daughter.

745
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:04,348
This is my wife,
Miriam's mother.

746
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,058
We want to see her.

747
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:08,260
She doesn't want to see them.

748
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:11,905
This is a scandal.
Let us see our daughter.

749
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,829
Please. Go to the office.
They'll help you.

750
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:18,909
What are you? Fascists?
Stealing peoples daughters.

751
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:21,624
She doesn't want to see you.

752
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,423
Please?
- He has a bad heart

753
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:26,387
because of the Germans.

754
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:28,660
We only want
to see our daughter!

755
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:31,100
Stop them.
- Please?

756
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:32,822
Is this how you
steal children?

757
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:38,505
You should be ashamed.
I'll see you in jail.

758
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:47,780
Miriam?
- Come home with us?

759
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,266
Please?

760
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:09,941
You just wait.
This is just the beginning.

761
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:15,187
Can the court decide
whether they're her parents?

762
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:22,300
We all dream that someday
someone will come.

763
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,898
A father, a mother, someone.

764
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:27,225
From "there". And she.

765
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:30,581
I don't remember anything,
but I know they're not my parents.

766
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,302
Then what do they want?

767
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,786
I bet it has something
to do with the reparations.

768
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:40,189
If she can't remember, maybe
they really are her parents.

769
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:55,180
Mira.
Calm down.

770
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,778
You have an excellent lawyer.

771
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:00,299
Everything will be fine.
You'll see.

772
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:04,105
Good luck.
- Good luck, Mira.

773
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:07,624
It'll be alright.
- Good luck.

774
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:18,584
Stop!
Tell Moussa to stop!

775
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:39,148
Mira?
- Stay there. I'm OK.

776
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,899
I must have eaten something.

777
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:50,421
Sit up front. OK, Moussa?
- No problem.

778
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:55,067
Get in, my child.
Sit.

779
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:21,265
Good morning.
Let's go.

780
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,263
Take the hat off, Mira.

781
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,823
But I like it.

782
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:29,226
You have nothing to hide.
You're so pretty.

783
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:32,387
You have lovely eyes.

784
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,185
"DISTRICT COURT
OF TEL AVIV"

785
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:47,228
I'm sorry, but you can't
come inside.

786
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:50,866
Good luck, Ofra.
We're counting on you.

787
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:54,427
Mira, remember what we said?
- Stay calm

788
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:58,509
and don't get upset.
- Let's go in.

789
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:08,343
All rise.

790
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:32,427
Approach the bench, please.

791
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:42,180
I suggest that you try
to find a way,

792
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:46,508
to avoid this hearing.

793
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:49,469
There's no room for compromise.

794
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:53,629
She must return to her parents.
- They're not my parents.

795
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:58,463
Your Honor, I'm sorry
for the Segal's

796
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,899
and the girl they lost
in the war.

797
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:04,784
But they can't just replace
her with another girl.

798
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:08,946
Before hearing the testimony,

799
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:14,224
I recommend that Mr. Segal
take a blood test.

800
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:16,910
What?
- Although the blood test...

801
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,782
No test!
No blood!

802
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:20,662
Don't you believe
Jews here?

803
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:24,829
They already
experimented on us.

804
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:27,623
Isn't that enough?

805
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:33,188
Wasn't Auschwitz enough?
- Me too. This is from Hitler.

806
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,788
All we want is our daughter.

807
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:43,384
Mira, daring.
Come with us.

808
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,020
How can you concentrate
on trigonometry now?

809
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:03,585
Yes. They had a daughter?

810
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:09,387
She was four or five years old.

811
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,858
Today she must be big.

812
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,183
Then you can identify the girl?

813
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:23,188
Mr. Rosenberg,
do you recognize the girl?

814
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:29,060
That's the girl.

815
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:35,938
It was years ago,
mistakes have been made.

816
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:38,106
Maybe.

817
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:40,346
So here and there
new families were created.

818
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,983
Nobody gets hurt.

819
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:47,020
But in this case,
I'm not mistaken.

820
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:54,226
But Mira's teacher testified
that she noticed signs of violence,

821
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:58,059
and suspected that Mira
has been beaten.

822
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:01,666
I knew that the family.
had survived the Holocaust.

823
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:04,350
That there was tension
in the home.

824
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:06,779
Fears and rage.

825
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:10,266
Maybe they did hit
the child from time to time.

826
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:15,669
Then they did beat her?
- Your Honor, this is irrelevant.

827
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,702
The issue is not whether
they're ideal parents,

828
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:21,390
but rather whether they're
her parents or not.

829
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:23,785
And I state that they are.

830
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,025
I want you to wear this.

831
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,469
It'll look very nice on you.

832
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:54,144
Tell her to wear it.

833
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:57,741
It's brand new.
I've never worn it.

834
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:02,546
Quiet please.
- I told the judge

835
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,786
that it was important
for you to be with Mira.

836
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:06,821
You're everything she has.

837
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,225
He's agreed to let you
sit inside,

838
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:13,787
but you must all
behave yourselves.

839
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:17,820
Ladies and gentlemen.

840
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,504
I've heard the testimony.

841
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:28,868
The time has come
for my ruling.

842
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:40,024
Mira, Mira.

843
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,462
Don't worry.

844
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,426
My child,

845
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:55,228
you claim that these
are not your parents.

846
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,868
Then who are your parents?

847
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:06,061
Try to remember.

848
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,708
Your mother?
Your father?

849
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:13,107
A sister?
A brother?

850
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:15,346
Nothing.
I don't remember anything.

851
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:19,869
Try to remember something,
someone?

852
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:29,222
Your Honor, the situation
is very clear.

853
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:33,866
The girl has no evidence

854
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,823
to refuse the claims
made by her parents.

855
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:40,226
She must go home with them.
for everyone's good.

856
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:54,268
These people claim that
they're your parents,

857
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,742
and that they love you.

858
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,546
If they're mistaken,

859
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:04,100
I need to know
how they are mistaken.

860
01:31:05,190 --> 01:31:08,182
Make an effort.
This is very important.

861
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:13,389
Give me a sign?
Anything?

862
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:21,069
Otherwise, you'll have to
go home with them.

863
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:27,262
I think they were taller.
My mother was taller.

864
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:30,264
Am I tall or short?

865
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:34,946
When my children were little,

866
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:39,505
I seemed very big to them.

867
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,820
When you were little,

868
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:44,788
you looked at your mother
from down here.

869
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:51,584
Mira, you have two people
here who want your happiness.

870
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:55,823
After all you and
they have suffered,

871
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:59,499
why don't you just go with them?
- I'd rather die.

872
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:03,703
Mira, think for a moment.

873
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:31,898
Miss...
We must move on.

874
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:35,665
Blue... -I have no choice
but to rule that the girl...

875
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:38,464
I remember the color blue.

876
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:44,700
I can't hear you, my child. Speak up.
- I remember the color blue.

877
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:50,581
When I looked up at her, from here,
I saw blue.

878
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,580
She had blue eyes.
Very blue.

879
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:57,144
Not like mine.
They were blue.

880
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:03,469
She had dark eyelashes,
like butterflies...

881
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:12,820
I can see her face.
I see my mother's face.

882
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:17,348
I see my mother's face.

883
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:21,589
Her teeth stuck out a bit,
like mine...

884
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:26,422
My brother had the same teeth.
My brother, Antek.

885
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:29,138
His name was Antek.
Antek Rozner.

886
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:33,388
My mother is Ella Rozner.
My father is Menachem Rozner.

887
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:35,387
My name is Miriam Rozner.

888
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:43,386
And we lived in
Lubartovska St. in Lublin.

889
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:46,581
My name is not Segal.
They're the Segal's.

890
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:52,667
I want to be who I really am.
I want my name back.

891
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:54,860
How could I have
forgotten them?

892
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:57,345
How could I have
forgotten you, Mama?

893
01:33:57,470 --> 01:34:00,940
And Papa?
And Antek?

894
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:05,382
How could I have
forgotten my mother?

895
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:09,264
Don't leave me. I wanted so
much to remember you,

896
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:12,541
and I couldn't.
Please don't leave me.

897
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:15,707
I wanted so to remember.

898
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:34,704
Mira Rozner!
Mira Rozner!

899
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:14,064
"An old straw hat,
and a wrinkled shirt,

900
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:18,583
"Not fancy you must say, "But
we don't mind, for all day long,

901
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,986
"we laugh and sing away,
ha-ha!"

902
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,264
We're going there
the minute we arrive.

903
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:32,346
Where?

904
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:34,866
I can't wait.

905
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:48,665
Stop!

906
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:52,268
What is it, Vim?

907
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:57,187
Come and see.

908
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:22,027
Avi?

909
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:24,863
We can't go there now.
It's occupied.

910
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:28,778
The Domim tree is occupied.

911
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:01,145
UNDER THE DOMIM TREE
