1
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,480
Avast you heathens.
Here it comes.

2
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,349
Mr Morris, the Chinese
are killing each other.

3
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,993
Come along, Mr. Morris.

4
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,153
Break out the guns.

5
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,273
Stand clear.

6
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,313
They told us we shouldn't mix
Punti and Hakka together.

7
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,757
Mountain and valley people
have hated each other for years.

8
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,236
Punti and Hakka,
they're all Chinese.

9
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,398
They all bring the same price
in the dock in Honolulu.

10
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,480
They won't bring us a dime
dead at sea.

11
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,269
Damn!
Who brought her aboard?

12
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,119
What name you?

13
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,355
I said no women
aboard this ship.

14
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,309
She looks none the worse for it.
Would you like her topside, captain?

15
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,595
Who belong you?

16
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,714
She belongs to me!
She's my wife.

17
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,833
Well, damn your eyes.
Did you pay her passage?

18
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,078
Passage all paid. The name
is the same, Son of Ti Chong.

19
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,759
Look at the contract,
you'll see.

20
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,191
I'll do that. And, i'll teach you
not to try any more tricks...

21
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,674
you smart bastard.

22
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,191
Nail up the hatch cover.

23
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,595
No food and water for 24 hours.
Give them something to think about.

24
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,869
Aye, sir.

25
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,200
- Watch out for him.
- What for? He's dead.

26
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,597
More shark meat.
You'd think they'd know better.

27
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,518
How many does that make?

28
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,994
Seven all together.

29
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,110
I'd hate to lose money on
my last voyage on the Carthaginian.

30
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,232
You're sure is your last?

31
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,835
Your grandfather is not
going to like it.

32
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,110
Unless you're taking command
of a newer ship.

33
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,595
From now on,
i'm shorebound.

34
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,192
I've got a scheme bigger than
the old man ever dreamed.

35
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,708
He'll love it.

36
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,432
We'll miss you, sir.
The Carthaginian is a good ship.

37
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,839
Maybe i can talk the old man
into letting you have her.

38
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,110
If we can keep enough Chinamen
alive to turn a profit.

39
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,234
I learn you Pidgin,
you savvy?

40
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,035
I learn you Pidgin,
you savvy?

41
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,395
Ship, you say.

42
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,869
You say.

43
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,708
"Shhhhhip."

44
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,837
"Shhhhhip."

45
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,309
Ship!

46
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,909
Ship!

47
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,595
Bed.

48
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,350
Bed, you say.

49
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,995
Bed!

50
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,995
Bed!

51
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,433
Pakes, this side...

52
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,475
Move along.

53
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,950
I'll miss things about the sea,
but not that stink.

54
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Can you spy my wife,
Mr Morris?

55
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,908
No. Is hard to see anything with
that crowd seeing the lepers off.

56
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,631
You there, stand clear.

57
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,469
Come along, now.
Come along.

58
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,155
Chop-chop.

59
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,589
I see why you mean
to quit the sea.

60
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,755
Purity!

61
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,076
Purity!

62
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,474
Whip!

63
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,070
He says her name
is Char Nyuk Tsin.

64
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,829
You, Tsin.

65
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,475
You belong Island of Mauie.
You are Prohilde.

66
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,149
Next Pake.
You, boy.

67
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,716
He says his name
is Kee Mun Ki.

68
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,999
Too long.
We call you Kee.

69
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,675
You belong Janders and Whipple,
Island of Kiwai.

70
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,274
Next Pake.
You, boy.

71
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
This the girl from the brothel
of Spring Nights in Macao?

72
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,109
She's Hakka! I want half
my money back.

73
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,072
She healthy?
No mark up?

74
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,115
She's not for sale.

75
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,559
What the hell's going on here?

76
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,513
Me buy woman.

77
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,711
You told me
she was your wife.

78
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,919
Sure, she's my wife.
See? Me buy.

79
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,439
Me want woman.

80
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,592
Whip, if she's his wife,
you can't let them be separated.

81
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,714
Is none of my business.
I don't know who's cheating who.

82
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,150
He cheat me.
Me want woman.

83
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,679
Whip, couldn't they work for us?

84
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,872
You bet. Me cook,
in whorehouse in Macao.

85
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,513
Plenty fine house.

86
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,675
All right.

87
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,073
We'll give it a try.

88
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,156
You just bought
yourself a wife.

89
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,629
Maybe you're lying to him,
but you better not be lying to me.

90
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,949
Come on.

91
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,716
Aloha, Pakes. Aloha!

92
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,834
Aloha!

93
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,274
This your house.

94
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,836
Hey sister,
how about one drink?

95
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,029
Ship.

96
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,191
Ship? No ship, house.

97
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,678
No ship, house.

98
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,875
Bed.

99
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,238
By damn, some Pidgin,
you learn pretty good.

100
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,671
Whip, please don't go back
to sea.

101
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,719
I couldn't stand it.

102
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,515
I won't.

103
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,995
You know...

104
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,996
we should have a Hoxworth
shipping line with schedules...

105
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,430
instead of just tramps
sailing here and there.

106
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,475
If i can just
convince the old man.

107
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,877
We can make Honolulu
the crossroads of the Pacific.

108
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,636
Your grandfather died
six weeks ago.

109
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,312
I didn't want to tell you until...

110
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,638
Was that too selfish of me?

111
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,389
No...

112
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,954
I'm glad you didn't.

113
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,429
Is like a main mast breaking.

114
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,879
You don't believe it
can happen until it does.

115
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,475
I didn't expect such a
gathering of the clans.

116
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,671
I thought the will
had already been read.

117
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,875
Hello, Malama.

118
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,672
Why so glum?
Must be the company you keep.

119
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,199
Is good to have you back.

120
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,789
I wish you'd seen grandfather
once more.

121
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,033
Cousin, Micah.

122
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,276
The will has been read, Whip.
Some time ago.

123
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,716
Perhaps you'll want
to look it over privately.

124
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,996
No, I'm only interested
in the ships.

125
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,394
I imagine he left all the other
businesses to Malama and you.

126
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,876
If you read it, you'll see
that he left the shipping business...

127
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,757
all the businesses to us.

128
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,152
What the hell do you mean?

129
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,033
You get Hanakai Plantation,
free and clear.

130
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,710
Hanakai?
85,000 acres of nothing.

131
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,870
He always said is
the only mistake he ever...

132
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,958
Did you put him up to this?

133
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,797
I had nothing to do with it. If you
think my wife did, you're wrong.

134
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,152
I don't. The only thing I've ever
held against her is marrying you.

135
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,716
I loved that old son of a bitch.

136
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,713
And he loved you.

137
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,874
Whip...

138
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,879
At the end, he was obsessed
with the old missionary families.

139
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,789
He said they left
all their sons rich...

140
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,718
but he didn't have
to do that for you...

141
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,030
because you could make it
on your own.

142
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,193
He provided you with an option
to buy the Carthaginian...

143
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,472
out of earnings if you chose
to stick to the sea...

144
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,519
which he advised.

145
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,915
He wasn't married
to Purity.

146
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,829
Granted, but he knew you better
than you know yourself.

147
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,997
Now, we're prepared
to make an offer.

148
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,112
For Hanakai?
You name it.

149
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,195
No, we agree
that Hanakai has no value.

150
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,593
Assuming you don't want
any favours from your sister...

151
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,516
we'll give you, not lend,
but give you...

152
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,109
funds enough to buy
the Carthaginian outright.

153
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,914
I don't want a gift and I don't
want one stinking ship...

154
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,715
I want a shipping line,
a scheduled line.

155
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,156
I want it enough
to eat crow for it.

156
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,351
All right, Micah,
you've got the ships.

157
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,236
Let me organise it,
run it.

158
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,437
Micah, thas a wonderful
idea.

159
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,599
But impractical.
You have no business experience.

160
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,278
You've been a hell raiser for
too long to turn respectable now.

161
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,435
You're prepared to give me
a ship just to get me out of here?

162
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,398
No.

163
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,989
If this offer isn't enough,
name your price.

164
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,793
There's not enough money
here to pay my price.

165
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,593
I envy the pious...

166
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,511
they can be bastards
and never know it.

167
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,798
Captain, the name's Overpeck.

168
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,557
What?

169
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,512
I'm opportunity knocking
at your door.

170
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,632
I'm a well driller and I can make
Hanakai bloom for you.

171
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,989
Like hell you can.

172
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,873
My grandfather tried to find
water there for 20 years.

173
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,196
I know all about it.
He dug six wells.

174
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,994
All down to caprock,
all dry.

175
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,677
That right.

176
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,839
But caprock ain't deep enough.
The way I see it, id be...

177
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,032
Excuse me. You wouldn't have
a drink in the house, captain?

178
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,755
Come on in.

179
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,278
You've got a lovely place here.

180
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,353
Is that your grandfather?

181
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,310
That him.

182
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,673
A fine figure of a man.
Will you be going back to sea?

183
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,999
The whole island knows
about the will.

184
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,153
Coconut telegraph.

185
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,114
You're a queer bird
to be in the water business.

186
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,589
That a fact.

187
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,149
Look...

188
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,635
these two volcanoes
built this island.

189
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,753
The lava flowed from both,
overlapping, building up in layers.

190
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,275
You've got to be able
to read them layers.

191
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,556
You can?

192
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,558
Yes, sir.
Like a chart at sea.

193
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,718
I've been reading Hanakai.
I've got the only drill...

194
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,151
that can bust through the caprock
to milk them layers.

195
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,478
If is so easy, why hasn't
anybody tried it before?

196
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,349
Because...

197
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,115
these pious fool believe that if
God intended them to have water...

198
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,231
he'd have installed fountains.

199
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,637
Where's this drilling rig?

200
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,357
In hock,
for 900 dollars.

201
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,718
If you're broke, make me a deal,
and I'll steal it back.

202
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,594
I can get the money,
whas the deal?

203
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,273
Whiskey and grub money
for every day it takes.

204
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,235
Too cheap.

205
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,110
I was hoping
you weren't all hot air.

206
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,591
Nice to have met you,
Mr Overpeck.

207
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,598
Don't make a mistake,
that was the price of a dry well.

208
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,790
If i find water, and i will.
I want 3,000 acres of your land.

209
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,549
Have a drink.

210
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,230
Foo Sen is a very wise man.
We do what he says, savvy?

211
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,555
Savvy.

212
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,956
You're going to have a boy,
his name is Kee Ah Chow.

213
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,395
You, girl.

214
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,032
You understand me?

215
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,152
The wife of Kee Mun Ki lives
in China, in the Low Village.

216
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,718
She's naturally the mother
of all his sons.

217
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,709
You'll care for all
of his sons...

218
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,077
until he returns with them
to his wife in China.

219
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,595
You understand?

220
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,472
When baby comes,
I take care, yes?

221
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,073
When you're delivered
of Mun Ki's son...

222
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,479
his wife in China will change
her name to "Mother of Wu Chow."

223
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,956
The mother of five continents.

224
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,554
How am i called?

225
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,149
Your name will become
"Aunt of Wu Chow."

226
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,112
The Aunt of five continents.

227
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,075
When baby comes,
I'm the auntie?

228
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,952
In China, man, he bring baby.
I bring very good.

229
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,989
His name Kee Ah Chow,
all same Asia.

230
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,836
Asia? That little Pake?
He'd better have broad shoulders.

231
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,517
Pakes very strong.

232
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,671
Pretty soon come,
Africa...

233
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,995
America...

234
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,673
Australia.

235
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,394
I forget other name.

236
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,354
Here...

237
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,315
for luck.

238
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,909
Whip, there's something...

239
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,991
What wrong with me?

240
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,679
There's nothing wrong
with you.

241
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,240
Just hurry up and have
that baby so we...

242
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,108
Wu Chow's Auntie.

243
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,199
I'd be deeply grateful
if you could manage to...

244
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,637
that is if you still have enough?
Missy doesn't have any milk.

245
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,431
Missy's sick?

246
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,111
No, she'll be all right. The milk
will probably come in a day or two.

247
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,358
Thank you,
more than I can...

248
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,673
Who told you,
you could start a garden here?

249
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,434
Making money,
I sell in town.

250
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,673
Don't you have enough work?

251
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,789
I give you half,
all right?

252
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,792
Why do you need money for?
I'll see your family's fed.

253
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,559
Take money, buy land,
buy this land, maybe.

254
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,957
You can't buy this land,
is practically in my parlour.

255
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,593
Anyway, Chinese don't buy land.
They take money back to China.

256
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,556
I'm never going back!

257
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,189
All right.

258
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,349
Grow what you can,
and keep the money.

259
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,996
I may need to borrow
from you someday.

260
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,993
Overpeck!
Overpeck!

261
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,994
Damn!

262
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,674
Damn your scabby,
rummy soul.

263
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,275
Hello, love.

264
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,277
Get out to that rig.

265
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,231
You can take that food
right back down the hill.

266
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,391
He traded the last batch for booze,
he can work hungry for a while.

267
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,238
Food from garden,
doesn't cost anything.

268
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,192
Then take it in town
and sell it.

269
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,555
Pretty soon, water.

270
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,792
Pretty soon, dry hole.
Dry hole number four.

271
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,513
Come on, get in here.

272
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,998
Garden food belongs to me,
you said.

273
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,039
Any whiskey in there?

274
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,273
What makes you so sure
he'll find water?

275
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,310
Not sure. No sure in China,
I come here.

276
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,716
I have baby, garden...

277
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,551
alongside great man Hoxworth.

278
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,437
I think pretty soon water.

279
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,833
What the matter, honey?

280
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,828
I don't know.

281
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,879
Maybe is too soon.

282
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,228
You're fine,
the baby's fine.

283
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,438
Hell, it seems like
a year to me.

284
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,151
I don't want to stop you.

285
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,955
Good night.

286
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,195
Purity...

287
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,589
what are you doing?

288
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,631
Thinking back
a thousand years or so.

289
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,711
Thinking of the first canoes
that came up from Bora Bora.

290
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,551
Why did our people
come here?

291
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,189
Our people?

292
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,278
A little Hawaiian blood
doesn't make us natives.

293
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,632
It does if we want it to.

294
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,633
There was no one here
and they came thousands of miles.

295
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,439
Who knows how many lives
were lost in those canoes.

296
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,035
The missionaries,
the whalers...

297
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,156
the Chinese,
it was easy for them.

298
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,078
But, not for our people.

299
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,031
They were magnificent, Whip.

300
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,356
Is coming,
I promise you.

301
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,232
You've been saying that
for two years.

302
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,989
Is coming, i can feel it,
thas why I've got you here.

303
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,515
I can hear it.

304
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,514
I've got the land and now,
I've got the water.

305
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,998
The only difference between
a sugar planter and me is money.

306
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,873
Don't you want to see me
turn respectable?

307
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,034
You're not just asking for a loan?
You're trying to blackmail us.

308
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,959
That right. I'll disgrace you a lot
less as a planter than a beachcomber.

309
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,833
- No.
- You'd be broke again next year.

310
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,793
There's not money enough
in sugar to pay for irrigation.

311
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,319
The water is free.

312
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,159
But, not the labour to dig ditches
and keep them open.

313
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,510
You know very well,
we'd have to foreclose.

314
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,639
You're not a farmer
and certainly not a businessman.

315
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,071
I don't know if sugar
will pay or not.

316
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,432
But, i've got something nobody
else does, artesian water...

317
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,471
and miles of land.

318
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,070
Sooner or later,
is got to be worth money.

319
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,238
We can't see the sooner and
we're not interested in the later.

320
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,715
Take my advice,
and go back to the sea.

321
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,799
I'll see you in hell first.
And be damn glad of the trip.

322
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,597
What the matter, Micah,
cat got your tongue?

323
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,115
Pious bastards.

324
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,075
Don't you care?

325
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,028
Of course I do,
but they're all pirates.

326
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,549
They came here, took everything,
and now, they won't part with it.

327
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,558
I sure thought they'd fall
off a few points in my direction.

328
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,875
What will we do now?

329
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,231
I don't know. I'll have to
go back to sea, I guess.

330
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,192
Whip, i don't want you to go.

331
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,479
All right, I'll stay.

332
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,996
By God, i'll stay.
We'll lick them yet.

333
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,996
I've got enough cash to plant
a few acres of sugar. I can...

334
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,478
We can mortgage
the house...

335
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,432
We could sell the house.

336
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,190
We could sell the house
and just live.

337
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,950
We can live the way
our ancestors lived.

338
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,116
In a grass hut?
On fish and poi?

339
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,197
Yes! Listen...

340
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,435
You didn't marry some kanaka,
you married me...

341
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,278
remember? You love me?

342
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,390
Yes.

343
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,830
I love you.
That how it all began.

344
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,999
I can't understand you.

345
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,919
How could i? We haven't
shared a bed for 6 months.

346
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,269
No, Whip.

347
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,589
Whip, please.

348
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,476
What is it?
What wrong?

349
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,715
I don't know.

350
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,275
I know this.

351
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,430
If i ever needed you,
is now.

352
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,798
And all you can do is tell me
to go to some beach and play dead.

353
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,476
Nothing to worry about.
Most babies get cranky sometimes.

354
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,229
Noel was just an excuse.
Is Purity i want you to see.

355
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,470
Did you notice
the way she is?

356
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,353
Why all this Hawaiian culture?

357
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,154
She's filled the house
with this stuff.

358
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,913
I can't get near her.

359
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,955
Thank you.

360
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,356
Was it having the baby?
Is that what did it?

361
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,157
It may be a post-natal depression
but then again...

362
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,755
it may not.

363
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,390
Purity isn't just
one quarter Hawaiian...

364
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,875
she's one quarter royal Hawaiian.

365
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,512
You know how those families
have been intermarrying for years.

366
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,793
She's losing her mind?

367
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,629
Is possible.

368
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,595
Yes.

369
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,672
Here chick, chick.
Come here, chicken.

370
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,552
Here's my big fella.

371
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,395
Wu Chow's Auntie...

372
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,430
You did a good job nursing Noel.
I've got another baby for you.

373
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,433
What kind of baby?

374
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,514
Pineapple, from halfway around
the world, French Guiana.

375
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,231
The French won't export any.

376
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,399
I had a sailor friend steal this
seed plant, and smuggle it out.

377
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,393
It looks dead.

378
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,709
Just about. Ill take
a green thumb like yours.

379
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,077
Plant them among the vegetables,
and don't say a word.

380
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,517
If you can make them grow
and taste sweet...

381
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,518
I'll smuggle out some more
to plan at Hanakai.

382
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,670
We grow.

383
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,758
We grow.
You, come with me.

384
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,713
Maybe Captain Hoxworth
will loan us money.

385
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,592
Money? For what?

386
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,875
Buy littee bittee land.

387
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,951
You'll like. I know.

388
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,754
No good buying land
in this country.

389
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,909
I want a field.

390
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,316
Buy field in China.

391
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,272
I want a field here.

392
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,273
No savvy Punti!

393
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,798
You savvy Punti yesterday.

394
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,233
A little bit, one word.
Maybe.

395
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,759
You learn savvy Punti!

396
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,188
Too old!

397
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,109
Not smart.

398
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,188
Soon my sons will begin
to think they're not Chinese.

399
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,398
In one year, we'll go back
to China. One year.

400
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,431
Where will we live
in China?

401
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,155
I'll take my sons, and live
with my wife in Low Village.

402
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,309
Where am i going to live?

403
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,031
You'll live in your village.

404
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,909
No!

405
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,797
I want to buy a field here.

406
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,349
Not buy a field.

407
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,398
Asia! Africa!

408
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,113
This you'll honour all your life.
Your mother.

409
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,673
Your true mother, in China.

410
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,309
Remember?

411
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,275
She's my wife.
She looks pretty, no?

412
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,515
Wu Chow's Auntie...

413
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,876
I can't wait any longer on this.

414
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,718
Les see what we've got.

415
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,555
A little prayer
to Confucius wouldn't hurt.

416
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,509
You brought off a miracle.
You grew a good pineapple.

417
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,115
Wait. Now, you've got
something coming.

418
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,069
Shall we go look
at that littee bittee land?

419
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,875
What land?

420
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,790
Small land up the road.
The man says is 100 dollars.

421
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,276
Captain says, i pay 20
and maybe he'll lend 80.

422
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,675
80, hell, this is on me.

423
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,637
Make up your mind,
do you want it?

424
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,955
I got to get to French Guiana
before I go broke in that sugar cane.

425
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,832
Yes, i want it.

426
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,509
Jesus shall reign...

427
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,471
wherever the sun...

428
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,870
does his successive...

429
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,437
journeys run.

430
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,548
His kingdom stretched...

431
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,550
from shore to shore...

432
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,028
till moons shall wax...

433
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,951
and wane no more.

434
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,277
People and realms...

435
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,157
of every tongue...

436
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,791
dwell on his love...

437
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,797
What brings you here for
the first time in your life?

438
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,155
Business.

439
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,755
Business?

440
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,112
You know, we don't
discuss business here.

441
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,034
Why not? You've all
got rich in the name of the Lord.

442
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,072
I want the Carthaginian
for a year.

443
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,189
That impossible.

444
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,396
You're as penniless
as we said you'd be.

445
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,549
Look...

446
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,671
The will states I can sail the
Carthaginian with an option to buy.

447
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,795
I'll give up the option
for the use of her.

448
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,873
Well, brother Micah...

449
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,317
what saith the Lord?

450
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,070
Amen.

451
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,271
10.07 and twelve seconds,
Mr Stein.

452
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,236
42 degrees, 8 minutes
and 22 seconds.

453
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,835
Right, sir.

454
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,428
Too many dishes.

455
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,236
Ah! You burnt!

456
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,668
No, no.

457
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,359
I look this hand.

458
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,079
It no hurt?

459
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,151
Do you have medicine
for Mai Pake?

460
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,634
Did you get the medicine?

461
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,512
But, no like Chinese doctor.
I like to see Dr Whipple.

462
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,792
No, he'll send me to Molokai.
Never, you savvy?

463
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,392
I hear about lots of bad Chinese men.
They tell police about Mai Pake.

464
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,114
Police pay money.

465
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,552
I think Chinese doctor
and bad men are the same.

466
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,315
What will we do
when the money runs out?

467
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,949
Kee Mun Ki.

468
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,873
You know, i no like
go back to China...

469
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,277
but maybe is better.

470
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,318
My Chinese wife see me
as a leper? Never, never.

471
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,438
In China ill be the same.

472
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,079
Wu Chow's Auntie...

473
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,993
you're a good woman.

474
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,111
You're a good woman.

475
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,398
Why don't we get the mosquitoes
to carry the pineapples?

476
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,034
Quiet, there may be
patrol boats along here.

477
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:57,991
Got him.

478
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,872
Damn your eyes, Conroy.

479
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,075
I said no shooting!

480
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,800
Morris pick him up.
Glendar take his place.

481
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,440
Stand by to give way together.
Oars out.

482
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,752
All right. Work as fast
as you can, but quiet.

483
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,155
Any man comes out of there
without a full sack gets left behind.

484
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,557
Good morning. Now, is time
for my preparation number 41.

485
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,679
How much this time?

486
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,151
Very special formula.
15 dollars.

487
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,509
15 dollars!
I don't have 15 dollars.

488
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,153
You have a vegetable patch.
You could sell.

489
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,198
No! I've got five sons.
Patch for sons.

490
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,194
Then, i'm afraid your friend
can't be cured.

491
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,238
No cure anyway. Medicine no good.
Better i go see Dr Whipple.

492
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,878
A white doctor?
He'll sell your friend to the police.

493
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,753
Pig! Liar! You sell
to the police already.

494
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,149
Go after her.

495
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,548
- You know where he's staying?
- No, they go, didn't say where.

496
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,320
- Where are the kids?
- Not home from school yet.

497
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,353
- Where's Mrs Hoxworth?
- She's gone.

498
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,108
Listen...

499
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,948
if those two Pakes come back,
you tell us.

500
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,759
Sure!

501
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,555
Better sleep now.

502
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,798
No, you sleep.
I'm not sleepy.

503
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,230
Funny thing. I'm sick,
but I don't feel sick.

504
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,553
Everybody's afraid of me...

505
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,039
but, i feel the same
as the day we came here.

506
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,671
Maybe, you should
be afraid too.

507
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,235
No.

508
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,949
Better we go.

509
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,553
No chance unloading tonight.

510
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,153
Don't worry about that.
We'll unload the cargo ourselves.

511
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,915
Purity!

512
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,628
Captain, you're home.

513
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,636
Where's Missy?

514
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,149
Gone. I don't think
she'll come back.

515
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,712
Captain, little Pakes are in bad
trouble. Come and help, please.

516
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,708
What do we do?

517
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,359
Help me get him
in the buggy.

518
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,479
Poor little Pakes.

519
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,919
Kee Mun Ki.

520
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,992
Aloha, Mun Ki.
Aloha, little Pake.

521
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,510
All kokuas aboard!
All kokuas aboard!

522
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,435
What are Kokuas?

523
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,278
They've not got Mai Pake.

524
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,916
Husband takes care of wife,
wife takes care of husband.

525
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,231
They stay there
and don't come back.

526
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,476
I'm a kokua. I go.
I'll help Mun Ki.

527
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,875
You got babies, Pake wahine.

528
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,231
You take care of these babies.

529
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,999
I take care of Mun Ki.

530
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,033
Wu Chow's Auntie,
you can't go there.

531
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,595
Last call for kokuas!

532
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,236
I go, i help Mun Ki.

533
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,557
I go, please.

534
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,717
Ready to make sail.
Stand by to cast off.

535
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,033
Kee Mun Ki.

536
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,150
You take me with you?

537
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,592
One more time?

538
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,434
This time...

539
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,275
I'll learn Punti.

540
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,598
All right. Everybody out.

541
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,719
Come on, lively now.

542
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,315
Over you go.

543
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,870
Look, i came here
to see you.

544
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,470
Purity, i want you
to come home with me.

545
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,713
But this is my home.
I belong here.

546
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,715
You belong with me.

547
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,032
If you really mean that,
stay here.

548
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,912
By God, if i thought...

549
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,189
Look...

550
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,556
whatever has been wrong
between us...

551
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,435
is it over?

552
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,275
Purity...

553
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,115
do you want me?

554
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,519
I don't know.

555
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,149
By God, there's one way
to find out.

556
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,678
Whip, please put me down.
Please, put me down.

557
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,031
Please, put me down!
Put me down!

558
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,715
I'm sorry.

559
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,029
I'm sorry.

560
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,789
You're trying to trick me!

561
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,275
All right.

562
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,390
But, i'm taking Noel
back with me.

563
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,792
Noel belongs here
with his people.

564
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,553
These aren't his people.

565
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,479
He's my son.

566
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,554
Whip!

567
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,550
Here, you take him.

568
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,999
Captain Hoxworth!

569
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,716
Captain Hoxworth,
you got Mai Pake?

570
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,315
No...

571
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,354
No, by God.

572
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,200
If i did they'd have to kill me
to get me out here.

573
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,915
What about you?

574
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,073
She doesn't have Mai Pake
yet, she's a strong woman.

575
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,594
Mun Ki.

576
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,155
I got your message.

577
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,034
Captain...

578
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,148
Better you take baby,
go quick.

579
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,516
Sorry, the baby's a girl.

580
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,591
There's a place for girls
in the world too.

581
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,353
Is she weened?

582
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,199
She has no name.

583
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,630
You ask Foo Sen
for a good name, please.

584
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,749
Sure.

585
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,075
Well...

586
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,235
I'd better go.

587
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,675
Good luck.

588
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,188
Noel.

589
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,635
Dad...

590
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:25,756
Is it true you killed a man when you
got the pineapples? In cold blood?

591
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,874
Where did you hear that?

592
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,435
School. Is it true?

593
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,794
Yes, is true.

594
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,111
What else do they
teach you at that school?

595
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:46,753
Did they tell you I found water here
so they could raise the pineapples?

596
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,555
No. They're saying the pineapples
have blood on them.

597
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,956
You don't know whether your old man
is a son of a bitch, or not.

598
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,879
Still want to go to sea?

599
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,155
Yes, sir.

600
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:14,875
All right.

601
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,153
You'll go to sea.
See what you learn there.

602
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,388
Maybe you can figure out whether
those pineapples are worth the
blood.

603
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,355
It has been long since
we heard anything from them.

604
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,189
And your sister, did you name her
Mei Li as i instructed?

605
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,478
Yes, will you tell our mother?

606
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,753
Also tell her we're going to build
a house by the vegetable patch.

607
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,674
A house?
You are ambitious.

608
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,191
A pity your Punti is so poor.

609
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,512
Go, go.

610
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,309
Those aren't Chinese.

611
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,635
Japanese.

612
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,710
They're a lot tamer
than the Chinese.

613
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,034
Work cheaper too.

614
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,157
Is time for you
to get along.

615
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,159
Do you need anything?

616
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,039
I don't know, Dad.

617
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,392
If you get in trouble just...

618
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,632
you just get yourself out.

619
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,954
Bye, father.

620
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,876
What the hell's going on here?

621
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,232
They finished it last week.
A good job.

622
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,634
On whose time, mine?

623
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,549
No, sir. And they paid for every
penny's worth of materials used.

624
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,909
If i was you,
I wouldn't put up a stink.

625
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,033
Bathing is a kind of religion
with these Japanese.

626
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,352
Is hotter than Port Said
in the summer today.

627
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,277
Give me a hand with these.

628
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,238
Am i supposed to give him money?

629
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,194
He makes the soap, or his wife does.
I reckon you'll be on the house.

630
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,153
You speakie pidgin?

631
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,592
No?
No fellow speakie pidgin?

632
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,999
My name's Fumiko.

633
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,468
I speak.

634
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,314
Fumiko, you don't
need to speak.

635
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,838
In Japan,
I worked in a custom house.

636
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,674
I can speak many languages.

637
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,158
Why are you working
here as a field hand?

638
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,789
He wrote me a marriage proposal
and i came.

639
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:50,312
He's not a respectable man.
He's very bad.

640
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,878
You see...

641
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,555
Hawaii's not what i thought.

642
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:02,317
No work for a respectable
Japanese girl, except field hand.

643
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,312
I think maybe you can help.

644
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,188
Help you do what?
Find someone to marry you?

645
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,836
I don't think thas much
of an idea.

646
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,473
You've got a wife already?

647
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,792
My wife doesn't live with me.

648
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,037
Men like you have plenty
of women.

649
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:27,999
That not true.

650
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,153
Men like you don't need Fumiko.

651
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,669
You don't know anything
about a man like me.

652
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,558
Wu Chow's Auntie.

653
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,358
But, they said you weren't
allowed to leave Molokai.

654
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,548
Captain Hoxworth,
got me out.

655
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,318
You, Asia?

656
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,678
No, Africa.

657
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,079
Africa.

658
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:03,677
Europe?

659
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,870
That right.

660
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,956
America, Australia.

661
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,150
Where's Asia?

662
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,157
Asia is at his restaurant.

663
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,675
Restaurant?

664
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,949
That good.

665
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,669
What her name?

666
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,997
Mei Li. The name
given her by Foo Sen.

667
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,148
Are you a leper?

668
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,993
No, no.

669
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,389
Do you think you can climb
the ladder to your house?

670
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,714
My house?

671
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,588
I'll help you.

672
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,438
Have you got Mai Pake?

673
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:07,713
No. But every night i look.

674
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,557
Now, you and me got secret,
understand?

675
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,351
Africa is smart. Much study.
Better he be lawyer.

676
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:32,393
But he can't be.
They don't want any Chinese lawyers.

677
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,230
Five sons. Why did
Kee Mun Ki have five sons?

678
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,832
So, the house of Kee
would be big and strong.

679
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,113
In China, big, strong family
always has a lawyer.

680
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,039
But they won't teach me here.
I'd have to go to America.

681
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,878
You go to America.

682
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,715
But having to send money to mother
in China, we could never afford it.

683
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,990
So, we'll make more money.

684
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,279
Restaurant too little,
make it bigger.

685
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,677
Garden too little,
make it bigger.

686
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,552
But, we haven't any more land.

687
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,193
We get more land.

688
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,719
I'm sorry, is impossible.

689
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,636
Impossible come back
from Molokai.

690
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,035
Micah, what do you think
of our new Queen?

691
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,073
She's a proud, strong woman.

692
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,198
Some think she's got herself confused
with the Queen of England.

693
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,598
Can you handle her? Or should we push
someone else for Secretary of State?

694
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,316
I doubt you'll succeed. She knows
I've served three monarchs loyally.

695
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,638
My loyalty is to my pocketbook.
I hope you can protect it.

696
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,637
Maybe this monarchy is becoming
a luxury the islands can't afford.

697
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,633
Can i give you a lift?

698
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,518
No, thank you.
I prefer to walk.

699
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,032
To the Kee farm.

700
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,354
I don't care if you buy it.
I'll even lend you the money.

701
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,199
The Queen won't stand for it.

702
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:42,274
It belongs to a Hawaiian family.
She won't let them sell their land.

703
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,830
To white man?

704
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,190
To anyone,
except Hawaiians.

705
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,352
Do you know
this Hawaiian family?

706
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,675
It won't do you a bit of good.

707
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,674
I still would like to meet
this Hawaiian family.

708
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:13,196
Frankly, as Prime Minister
you aren't worth spit in a
windstorm.

709
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,479
What were you doing when the Queen
tore up our Constitution?

710
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,669
Praying?

711
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,192
She's given herself the power
to confiscate all the land and
money.

712
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,991
I couldn't stop her. I believe is
a gesture to prove her independence.

713
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,589
Gesture! She wants every
white man out of Hawaii.

714
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,479
She's trying to drive the islands
back to the 16th Century.

715
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,319
She's trying to protect
herself and her people.

716
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,394
Can you deny that for years
you've financed...

717
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,194
a campaign to promote
the American annexation of Hawaii?

718
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,472
Why should i deny it?
I'll tell you something else...

719
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:51,471
for the past six months
a group of us, in the family...

720
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,830
have been buying up
every firearm in Hawaii.

721
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,590
Including some from
the Queen's arsenal.

722
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,156
For amateur revolutionaries
we've done pretty well.

723
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,595
Whip...

724
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,790
you must wait.

725
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,036
What for? Until we
lose everything.

726
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,713
I'll not participate
in this ungodly scheme.

727
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,911
Do you want your relatives
shot for treason?

728
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,315
No, you've got to be
our white knight.

729
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:19,512
I tell you, i'll not be paety
to a revolution.

730
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:22,871
I'll supply the revolution,
you be the father of your country.

731
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:26,789
Never! And i don't intend to let you
drag the family down either.

732
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,318
There's only one thing worse
than a successful revolution...

733
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,996
that an unsuccessful one.

734
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,072
Sit tight, Brother Micah...

735
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,511
and await your call
to greatness.

736
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,879
Is coming, believe me.

737
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,155
Tired?

738
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,999
Tired? Hell, no.

739
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,715
More?

740
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,232
I never know if you do that
because you love me...

741
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,708
because is the custom, or just
to keep the furniture clean.

742
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,038
No one ever comes here.

743
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,438
You better see who it is.

744
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,032
I'm Lieutenant Keholo.
I know Mr Hoxworth is here.

745
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,154
You're under arrest, sir.

746
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,275
Am I?

747
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,474
Whas the charge?

748
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,480
Violation of the Defence
of the Realm Act. Treason.

749
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,359
You're taking me to jail?

750
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,755
Yes, sir.

751
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,029
Fumiko...

752
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,276
you go to the American Minister...

753
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,869
give him this.
He'll know what to do.

754
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,717
Anytime you're ready, Lieutenant.

755
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,315
After you, sir.

756
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,232
Hey, hold it...

757
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,397
what are you doing here?

758
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,078
Captain Hoxworth,
you're in trouble.

759
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,390
You'd better go
or you'll be in trouble.

760
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,956
You need money,
maybe?

761
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,076
No, thanks.
I don't need money, maybe.

762
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,076
Captain Hoxworth is
an American citizen.

763
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:35,189
For too long the whites have claimed
any citizenship that suited them.

764
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,829
Is particularly convenient
when there happens to be...

765
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,235
two American warships
in the harbour.

766
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:46,399
Apparently, you suspect
some sort of conspiracy.

767
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,871
Let me ask
a hypothetical question.

768
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,837
Suppose an uprising
did occur and failed?

769
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,591
The rebels would be beheaded.

770
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,873
What? I'm sorry, i put it poorly.
I meant a bloodless uprising.

771
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,071
Is a custom of the islands...

772
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,390
he who acts against
the throne is beheaded.

773
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:09,151
But if Americans are involved,
prominent Americans.

774
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:13,755
You've travelled all over, you are
familiar with civilised custom.

775
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:17,316
Mr Houghton, what you call
civilised custom...

776
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,548
has been more cruel to these islands
than beheading greedy men.

777
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:27,152
If you have any influence over them,
I suggest you use it.

778
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,750
This is all hypothetical,
of course.

779
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,710
I'm sure you intend to release
Hoxworth, soon.

780
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,076
I intend to execute him.

781
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,714
You can't be serious!

782
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,197
I'm sure Hoxworth is serious.
Why shouldn't I be?

783
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,154
He must have a trial. This is
a government founded upon law.

784
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,920
This is a government
fighting for its life.

785
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,479
Are you with it
or against it, Mr Hale?

786
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,115
Good evening, ma'am.

787
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:14,069
We're dealing with men
who hope to buy a revolution.

788
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:18,671
Will they be so eager when they see
it will cost them their lives?

789
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:29,471
This uprising must stop.
You must call it off.

790
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:35,156
I'm sorry, there's nothing i can do.
They've started the ball rolling.

791
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,549
Ma'am...

792
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,390
I still think is all talk.
Let me speak to them!

793
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:46,116
You have great influence
with many people, so much so...

794
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:49,750
they speak of you as Hawaii's
first President after my fall.

795
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,393
Without my consent.

796
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,038
Your influence could be decisive.
If is crystal clear...

797
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:59,915
you stand shoulder to shoulder
with me, no matter whom it hurts.

798
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,349
This man is guilty
by his own admission.

799
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,316
Are you prepared
to concur in the sentence?

800
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,909
- Is barberous.
- Not if it saves other lives.

801
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,629
Yes or no?

802
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,870
Time is short.
Yes or no, Mr Hale?

803
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,918
No, your Majesty.

804
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:46,598
Ma'am, sailors and marines
are in the city...

805
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,950
and already in
the palace grounds.

806
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,799
As God is my witness,
it was none of my doing.

807
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,868
This is a sad day
for both of us...

808
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,431
for only God
will believe you.

809
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,035
Congratulations, Mr President.

810
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,948
How does it feel
to be the father of your country?

811
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:30,679
Now, we're finally annexed and Micah
is a 10,000 dollar chunk of art.

812
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,636
The Hawaiians think
he was a hell of a fellow.

813
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,354
How many Hawaiians
have forgiven you, father?

814
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,193
Whose side are you on?

815
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,834
Let say i think i understand
your viewpoint.

816
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:47,316
What was that Hoxworth and Hale
sign i saw coming up from the dock?

817
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:50,438
Since Micah died,
your Aunt Malama and i...

818
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,676
have gone into things together.

819
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,349
Ignition, spark.

820
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,791
Sounds like i've come back
to a little empire.

821
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,115
Does that scare you?

822
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,476
It might, if i were
committed to it.

823
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,032
You've got a nice touch
with that razor.

824
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:43,238
Why don't you ask what a
girl like me is doing here?

825
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,437
All right. Whas a girl
like you doing here?

826
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:50,069
Shaving you.

827
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:52,798
Is that supposed to stop me?

828
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,433
Yes.

829
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,674
Then how about lunch?

830
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,517
If i can choose the restaurant.

831
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:20,794
Why not?

832
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,679
Good Lord, Mei Li.
Does the whole family live here?

833
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,474
Of course. All my brothers
are married now.

834
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,559
Why should it surprise you?

835
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,355
I've got to agree
with the Chinese...

836
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,270
white people live
and die alone.

837
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,719
Don't forget...

838
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,433
we're having lunch tomorrow.

839
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,439
I won't.

840
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,672
Pistol, we're going to be seeing
a lot of each other...

841
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,074
let go for a drink.

842
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,429
Why not?

843
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,236
Forgive me, but you forget
how fortunate you've been...

844
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:43,955
in having five sons.
A daughter is a far different matter.

845
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:47,869
Matter, no matter. Wong family
wanted too much dowry last year...

846
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,479
and want too much
this year.

847
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:53,958
Mei Li's not getting any younger.
Time is on the side of the Wongs.

848
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,993
Wongs got only two sons
and one is not smart.

849
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:01,189
With Mei Li they get five
more sons, all smart.

850
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,993
I say, good bargain.

851
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:15,749
They're rich. They know the alliance
can be of benefit to you.

852
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:20,159
Together, you'll be as powerful
as all the old white families.

853
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:23,830
No family is rich with only
two sons, and one thas not smart.

854
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:28,635
They ask for ten city lots,
I think they take six.

855
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,951
They refused that last year.

856
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:32,229
Seven.

857
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,634
Seven...

858
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,239
I will try it.

859
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:15,632
Quick, he's very sick. Take him away
before the police come.

860
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:29,552
All right. I'll put out a couple
of cases of rat poison, if you want.

861
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:33,118
No!

862
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,228
Captain Hoxworth.

863
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,670
Put them on my desk.
I'll check them later.

864
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:48,950
Three cases of bubonic
plague reported in Chinatown.

865
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:53,228
I'm not surprised. I never saw
a worse pesthole in China...

866
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,514
and your shacks
are no better than the rest.

867
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:01,673
You've been seeing the pigsty
the Kee family lives in...

868
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:03,559
they could afford a palace.

869
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,593
They'd have it if it weren't
for the old lady.

870
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,270
Watch what you say
about that old lady.

871
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:13,357
While we're on the subject,
stay away from her daughter.

872
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,275
I've seen Mei Li 12 times and
I haven't been alone with her yet.

873
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,471
What are you getting out of it?

874
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:27,153
I enjoy being with her,
she's whas keeping me here.

875
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,679
What do you mean by that?

876
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,508
I suppose I love her.

877
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:38,479
All right. Live with her,
but keep quiet about it.

878
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:43,269
You carried her back from Molokai
when she was six months old.

879
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,832
I plan to marry her.

880
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,199
Have a drink.

881
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,113
No, thanks.

882
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,351
I've never been easy on you...

883
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,189
but there's no point making life
tougher than is got to be.

884
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,152
Have a drink.

885
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,958
There isn't a club
in this town that will let me in.

886
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,557
I can't remember the last time
I was invited into a private house.

887
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,990
I don't give a damn,
I never have.

888
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,718
But, maybe you would.

889
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,959
I like Mei Li, but I don't
like the idea of this marriage.

890
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:01,518
If they were to marry, they'll be
sorry. You know all the reasons.

891
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,798
I know reasons.
I'm against it too.

892
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,712
I can't stop it,
but maybe you can.

893
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:25,957
Captain Hoxworth,
doesn't like the marriage either.

894
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:29,029
But it was Noel
who did the proposing.

895
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,597
No Hoxworth has broken
his word to us yet.

896
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,711
He isn't even asking
for a dowry.

897
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,474
Marry Wong boy,
marry whole family...

898
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:40,393
Marry Hoxworth,
marry one sailor.

899
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,478
At least he speaks our language.

900
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,199
He speaks Hakka?

901
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,632
Only Punti.

902
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,952
If this plague gets worse,
whall happen to our business?

903
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,668
The city lots the Wongs want
are worth money...

904
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,791
and we may need it.

905
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,669
Now, you hear me...

906
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:04,148
Captain Hoxworth is my friend,
so his son is my friend...

907
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,273
but they're white.
They don't think like Chinese.

908
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:12,111
They don't have 5 sons, 1 daughter,
14 grandsons, 10 granddaughters.

909
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,995
They don't think about when they'd
be married to families...

910
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:23,035
that are the same one family
and they spread and spread forever.

911
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:29,630
That what Mun Ki and i
talked about on Molokai.

912
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:34,233
That what makes Mun Ki
live forever.

913
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:40,478
Hawaiian families understand,
but white families don't.

914
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:47,790
Wongs want ten lots,
we pay ten lots.

915
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:04,478
All of your clothes
have to be burned.

916
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,318
They're burning
the house down.

917
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:13,239
They found a dead man in it,
they say is the plague.

918
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,919
This place belongs
to Hoxworth and Hale.

919
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,918
Go and see Dr Whipple,
he's over there.

920
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:26,515
You speak their language?
Tell her we need to burn everything.

921
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,275
First, you tell me.
Have you got a permit?

922
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,471
No, but i know plague
when I see it.

923
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,194
Sue me if is your propeety
but talk to her first.

924
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,554
Don't talk to me about poison,
the rats laugh at it.

925
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,117
Our only chance
is to burn the blocks down.

926
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:05,834
You talk freely about burning
down other people's propeety.

927
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:08,235
I'm sorry, but he's right.

928
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,757
Do you want a plague thall cover
the island or to save lives?

929
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,438
Very noble, Doctor Whipple...

930
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,076
but not very practical.

931
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:22,716
Chase the people out of here,
hold them in quarantine and clean up.

932
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,673
And in a little time,
we'll get rid of the rats too.

933
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,313
Is too late for that.

934
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,115
By the time we cleaned up, we'd have
lots more of those on our hands.

935
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:33,470
Simmons, can you get
fire engines in here?

936
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,716
Some places yes,
most places no.

937
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,679
Then you risk setting
the city on fire.

938
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:42,710
You start anything like that,
I'll get an injunction to stop you...

939
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,069
and don't think I won't.

940
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,276
Let me have your attention.

941
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:49,479
Anyone who wishes
to enter the area...

942
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:54,597
must pass medical inspection.
Repeat...

943
01:56:55,360 --> 01:57:00,150
Anyone wishing to enter
must pass inspection.

944
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:22,720
First tent, please.
To the second tent, please.

945
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:33,998
You know the quarantine
hasn't worked.

946
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,112
There are hundreds
hiding in those shacks...

947
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:39,948
if we wait any longer
they'll all be infected.

948
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,513
You want to burn them up?

949
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,392
We won't burn anybody.

950
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,916
I'm asking you to get
that injunction called off.

951
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:52,351
Either you get rid of it,
or we'll go to the governor.

952
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,518
What does he know about it?
He's from Chicago.

953
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,872
He never even saw Hawaii
until six months ago.

954
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,555
These islands
have stayed afloat...

955
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:05,513
long before your great
granddaddy got here.

956
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:09,116
I guess we can them from
sinking under the Americans.

957
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,554
They've provided a good way
of life for you.

958
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,074
Yes, sir.

959
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:20,876
First at the expense of
the Hawaiians and now the Chinese.

960
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,875
I'm talking about the plague!

961
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,435
What do you expect
the governor to do?

962
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:29,469
I'll show you.

963
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:33,993
Hey...

964
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,829
you're getting a kick out of this,
aren't you?

965
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,396
Oh, yeah. I'm having
the time of my life.

966
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:46,871
Is a life's work to make
this island of yours fit to live in.

967
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,237
Damn right.

968
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:03,630
Left. Left. Left.
Platoon, halt.

969
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:06,829
Open up.

970
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,153
- Yes?
- Get your stuff out.

971
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:11,669
We've to dynamite this place
to clear a firebreak.

972
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,270
- I don't understand.
- The governor declared Marshall Law.

973
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:17,079
You've ten minutes.

974
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:47,156
Keep moving!

975
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:52,992
Africa, quickly!

976
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,156
Look out for those
burning beams!

977
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:11,671
Go this way.

978
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,229
Make way for the fire wagons!

979
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:35,914
We can't save it.

980
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:39,838
That the end of that.

981
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,280
Everybody move back.
Chop-chop.

982
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:52,355
I can't hold it anymore.
The whole place is about to go.

983
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:55,589
Doctor, i suppose
you're happy now.

984
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,071
Where's Wu Chow's Auntie?

985
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:07,759
- The Chinese won't leave.
- They're hiding everywhere.

986
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,432
Make way for
the fire wagon.

987
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:13,030
I've been over half Honolulu
looking for you.

988
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:15,914
You've got to come
to Chinatown with me.

989
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:19,193
The old people won't leave,
they don't know English.

990
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,079
I only speak Hakka.

991
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,793
At least is Chinese.

992
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:28,716
She's with me.

993
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,797
Mei Li, come with me.

994
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,514
There's still people
on the next street.

995
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:45,598
Get some water, quick!

996
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:04,039
She said the government
will pay them. It won't.

997
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:06,510
Quiet. Is no time for details.

998
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:38,669
Where have you been?

999
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,835
Looking for you.

1000
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:41,598
Take him, he's heavy.

1001
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:43,638
You stay with me.

1002
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:57,949
There should be 458 dollars here.

1003
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:00,390
And we owe 96,000.

1004
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:03,558
It looks like we're more than broke.

1005
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,397
Don't sell vegetable patch.

1006
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:24,436
I guess we were squeezing
too many people in here.

1007
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,273
I have to admit it...

1008
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,793
Is better off gone.

1009
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:31,353
You're not broke.

1010
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:34,317
I'm better off
than i was before.

1011
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:38,435
I've got cash to buy this land
for what ill bring now.

1012
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,839
Dirt cheap.

1013
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:44,635
I guess the Chinese will
hate me for that.

1014
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,639
What about you?

1015
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:49,670
I'll never hate you, Captain.

1016
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:55,990
You know, if Mei Li were
to marry Noel...

1017
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:57,918
it may heal a lot of wounds.

1018
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:02,238
No good. Hoxworth up here,
Kee down there.

1019
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:07,318
I know what you really think.
Hoxworth down there, Kee up there.

1020
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:12,712
You know, Mei Li is supposed
to marry the smart Wong boy.

1021
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:18,389
You never cared much for being
Auntie to your own children?

1022
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,789
But, at least you had
the man you wanted.

1023
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:27,189
Never mind, i guess you can't
let her marry a white boy.

1024
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:30,393
I'll still let you borrow
any cash you need.

1025
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,871
96,000 dollars.

1026
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:34,875
96,000 dollars?

1027
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:38,470
And a bit more to buy bit
of land while is cheap.

1028
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:46,517
And Mei Li marry Noel.

1029
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,953
You know,
I'm a damn lucky man.

1030
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:55,393
At my age i still
have a goal in life...

1031
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,274
to keep you from getting my shirt.

1032
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:09,235
Wu Chow's father...

1033
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:14,029
I know you're bothered that
Mei Li's marrying a white man...

1034
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:17,597
but remember that
all the sons...

1035
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,360
have married as well
as you could hope.

1036
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:24,278
Asia has six children.

1037
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,638
Africa, seven.

1038
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:30,919
Australia has five
and another will come soon.

1039
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:35,348
Europe, remember
we worried about him...

1040
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:38,079
he has two.
