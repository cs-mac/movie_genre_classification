1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,635
Previously on "Damien"...

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,021
Help!

3
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:07,640
I blame you for those deaths,

4
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:09,663
the evil you felt that night.

5
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:12,493
It comes from inside of you.

6
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:14,623
You showed him the shrine?
How did he take it?

7
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:15,546
He'll be back.

8
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,882
That's three dead by freak accident.

9
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:17,765
It's a holy trinity.

10
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:18,812
It's Kelly's notebook.

11
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,874
She must've been working on
some kind of religious story.

12
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,813
We've been thinking
it's time for a change.

13
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:28,353
Troy will take over.

14
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:30,613
There are very
mysterious forces at work.

15
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,313
They can't be manipulated.

16
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:35,314
They operate according to design.

17
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:04,484
Jesus.

18
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:34,314
Ugh.

19

20
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,533
This will certainly make me think twice

21
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,493
about wearing my necktie again.

22
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:15,873
How did you get this?

23
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:17,663
Ann Rutledge left it in my bathroom.

24
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,413
I thought I warned you about her.

25
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:22,533
I made a mistake. I dropped my guard.

26
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,953
She used me.

27
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:25,833
Used you? How?

28
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,743
To kill Troy Hendrie.

29
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,533
Are you saying you're somehow
responsible for his death?

30
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:32,913
It's complicated.

31
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:37,493
Son, I know we've lost
touch through the years,

32
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:39,493
but even I can see you're a mess.

33
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:41,413
Why? What's troubling you?

34
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:43,993
You'll think that it's crazy, that...
that I'm crazy.

35
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:48,834
Nothing surprises me anymore.
What exactly did Ann tell you?

36
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:58,834
I'm the Antichrist prophesied
in the Book of Revelation.

37
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:05,913
I'm not making this up.

38
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:10,663
I know Ann is... challenging,
to say the least,

39
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,743
but this takes batshit crazy
to a whole other level.

40
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:16,623
Forget about her. I'm worried about you.

41
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:19,793
You need some help. Please see someone.

42
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:23,033
Lean on me all you want.

43
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:26,834
And whatever you do, stay
far away from that woman.

44
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:12,994
Yo.

45
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,413
Perfect timing.

46
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:15,833
You went shopping without me?

47
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,493
Got you some fresh batteries.

48
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:20,663
You know you don't have to
keep checking up on me.

49
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,373
I'm not. I got some news.

50
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,623
Collodion Collective
wants to meet with you.

51
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,703
The photography co-op?

52
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:29,663
Yeah. I sent them your portfolio.

53
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:31,663
You know I'm not much of a joiner.

54
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:33,533
I know, but hear me out.

55
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:36,533
With editors, right, even Ceci,
we've always been on a leash,

56
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,873
beholden to their corporate interests.

57
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,373
Comes with the territory.

58
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,993
Well, the Collective
is photographer-owned.

59
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,663
It's completely autonomous.

60
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:44,413
They want your point of view.

61
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,083
If they let you in, you
broaden your reach by a mile.

62
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:47,743
If they let me in?

63
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:50,493
Yeah, well, they have to
approve of you in person.

64
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,664
I can't do a dog and pony
show right now, Amani.

65
00:07:56,624 --> 00:07:58,793
Come on, man.

66
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,413
You can use the win right about now.

67
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,413
Detective Shay. From the other night?

68
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:14,033
I remember. What can I help you with?

69
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:16,033
I just wanted to come by, check on you,

70
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,624
make sure you're all right.

71
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:18,729
I'm fine.

72
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,833
Good.

73
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,123
I heard about the thing
in the subway last night.

74
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,663
It's a good thing you weren't killed.

75
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:24,743
It looks like I should
be asking about you.

76
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:26,663
Yeah, do you know, there was someone

77
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,059
killed in the subway, though.

78
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,453
Yeah, and he heard about that

79
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,123
after he pulled the kid
off the train tracks.

80
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,333
Saved his life.

81
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,584
Who are you?

82
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,413
A friend.

83
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:38,873
Do you have a name?

84
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:40,833
What can I do for you, Detective?

85
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,833
Well, I got a whole bunch of questions

86
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:45,533
about the, uh, taxicab incident
that you were involved with.

87
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,623
And I have some information
about your assailant.

88
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,583
I thought maybe you could
come down to the station,

89
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:50,793
we could talk about it.

90
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,794
Shouldn't take too long.

91
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,743
Whatever I can do to help.

92
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,873
I'll catch up with you later.

93
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:00,664
Sure thing.

94
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:05,413
You got some big balls,

95
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,623
pulling that kid off
the tracks like that.

96
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:10,413
I just did what anyone else would've.

97
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:11,474
Yeah, well...

98
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,833
...most people, they'd like
to think they'd be the hero.

99
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,123
But in that moment of truth,

100
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,623
they're more concerned about
saving their own skin.

101
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,743
It's a shame about that
other guy, though.

102
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,033
What happened?

103
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,993
Well, some guy got his tie
stuck in the escalator.

104
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,244
Couldn't yank it free.

105
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:33,663
Pulled his face right
into the machinery.

106
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,833
Ripped it wide open.

107
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:41,833
You want anything? Corn chips?
Twizzlers?

108
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,413
Mm.

109
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,333
Yeah, broke his teeth...

110
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:55,874
...chewed off his nose...

111
00:09:55,877 --> 00:10:00,033
...severed his carotid artery.

112
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:03,453
Blood everywhere. It was a mess.

113
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,333
You know...

114
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,664
it was right about that
time you saved that kid.

115
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,793
I saw some of the commotion.

116
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:14,123
Mm.

117
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,083
How'd you know him?

118
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,703
Who?

119
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:18,913
Escalator guy.

120
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,034
I didn't know him.

121
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,743
Troy Hendrie. Wall Street player.

122
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:26,704
Armitage Global. Mm?

123
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,703
I pulled the security tapes
in the subway station.

124
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:33,794
It was pretty clear
you were chasing him.

125
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,953
I was just running to catch the train.

126
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:42,453
Oh, yeah? What train?
Where were you going?

127
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:47,533
I'd really like to help you, but
I just don't know anything.

128
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:50,373
See, here's what I'm struggling with.

129
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:53,493
In the last few days, you've
been in very close proximity

130
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:56,663
to a few, uh... oh, I don't
know, what do I call 'em?

131
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:59,373
Unexplained deaths?

132
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:01,373
Four, to be exact.

133
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,664
And that's a shitload of
wrong place, wrong time.

134
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,873
So... why don't you sit down?

135
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:11,124
We have a lot to talk about.

136
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm not going to mince words.

137
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:21,090
There's a void here today.

138
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,880
We all feel it.

139
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,840
We're all stunned and confused.

140
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:27,260
In all that confusion,

141
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:31,340
let's not forget about
what's really important...

142
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:34,421
Troy, and all that he gave.

143
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:40,131
Ann? Would you like to say a few words?

144
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,170
Um...

145
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:54,920
John and I have, um, been
around the block a few times.

146
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:56,420
We're at that age

147
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:58,460
where we're losing some
of our dearest friends,

148
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:00,761
people we've known all our lives.

149
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:05,920
But so many of you are so young.

150
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,840
I can tell by looking around this room

151
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:11,551
that this is the first
tragic death you've faced.

152
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:17,260
I remember when I was told

153
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,380
that my husband and
daughter were killed.

154
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:22,261
I was... I was 20.

155
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:25,761
My whole world fell down.

156
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:31,011
The only thing that got
me through that...

157
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,840
was people reaching out.

158
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:40,340
That's the only way we get
through times like these.

159
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:44,510
Compassion heals...

160
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:46,551
all suffering.

161
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:54,090
You never fail to surprise me.

162
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:58,960
We've seen a lot of people
come and go over the years.

163
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,050
Nature of the beast.

164
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,421
Pardon the pun.

165
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:06,220
But you and I are still here.

166
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,261
Perhaps we'll be the last ones standing.

167
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:16,921
Damien said you left
this in his apartment.

168
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:24,170
I had nothing to do with that.

169
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,340
Things are reaching a critical point.

170
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:30,260
We can't afford to fall
into separate camps.

171
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:34,010
Perhaps we should get used
to sharing the stage.

172
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:35,300
What are you proposing?

173
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,645
You've got Damien.

174
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,071
I have everything else in place.

175
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:42,231
We need to work together,
not against each other.

176
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:46,651
We need to trust each other.

177
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:48,362
I couldn't agree more.

178
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:57,731
Igor Reneus.

179
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:59,901
You and Kelly Baptiste
paid him a visit. Why?

180
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:01,902
She was doing research for an article.

181
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,901
Around the same time that she died

182
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:07,821
in her "accident"...

183
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:10,031
right outside of your
apartment, I might add...

184
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,942
he was mauled to death
by a pack of wild dogs.

185
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:17,031
The cab driver who hit Hermon Saroyan?

186
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:19,571
He swerved to avoid a wild dog.

187
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:22,361
I don't know what you're
up to or how you do it,

188
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:26,362
but you're puling some
really freaky shit.

189
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:31,231
I may to be able to prove it,

190
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:34,732
but I know you're responsible
for those deaths.

191
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:40,901
Get up.

192
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:42,232
Wanna show you somethin'.

193
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,321
So last night, I'm walking
down the hall just like this,

194
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,071
when out of nowhere, a Rottweiler...

195
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,771
must've weighed 90 pounds...

196
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:56,901
jumps on me, tries to take my arm off.

197
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,731
Ooh. Careful. You don't
wanna walk into that,

198
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,232
get it on your shoes.

199
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:10,731
Can you believe it?

200
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,941
I was in the E.R. till 3:00 a.m.

201
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,901
22 stitches.

202
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:18,941
They did say there was no, uh,
permanent nerve damage, though.

203
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,651
The dog was not so lucky.

204
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,861
Well... what the hell?

205
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,731
He was trying to kill me, so...

206
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,942
I blew his head off.

207
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:39,231
Good thing he didn't go for
my shooter hand, though.

208
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,111
I would've been gone.

209
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:44,611
Scary thing
about this hallway...

210
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,111
there are no cameras.

211
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:10,981
Uhh!

212
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:13,651
Oh, yeah. Come on, try something.

213
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:15,732
Give me the chance.

214
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:20,821
Leave me alone.

215
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:23,071
That professor, your dog
attack, the taxi...

216
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,611
nothing to do with me.

217
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,861
Let me tell you how this plays
out with guys like you,

218
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,821
how we handle it.

219
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,071
Now, I know you're a piece of
shit, but I can't prove it.

220
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,901
So I keep my eyes on you.

221
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:39,231
Person of interest.

222
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,151
And I keep you here all
night for questioning,

223
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:44,151
kick you free when you're exhausted,

224
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,191
and then bring you back tomorrow...

225
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:49,271
and the next night, and all next week.

226
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:53,271
After a while, you've got a shadow.

227
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:56,231
Always right over your shoulder.

228
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:59,771
One night, you're driving.

229
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:02,691
There's sirens in the mirror. Pull over.

230
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:06,571
Busted tail light, expired tags. Mm.

231
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:09,651
I'll find somethin'.

232
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:13,571
And you're pissed 'cause
I'm crawling up your ass.

233
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:16,401
Agitated.

234
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,151
And I ask to see your license,

235
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:23,112
and you reach over to get your wallet.

236
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:26,771
Boom!

237
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:32,571
Just... I thought I saw a gun.

238
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,231
I feared for my own life.

239
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:39,732
But you, no one will miss
an asshole like you.

240
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,322
Trust me...

241
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,732
you don't want to do that.

242
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:51,902
Are you threatening me?

243
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:56,981
People who come after me,
they don't fare so well.

244
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:58,731
You've seen enough to know.

245
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:04,111
Very weird stuff happens around me.

246
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:08,191
Not to me. Never to me. To others.

247
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:10,771
Can't explain it.

248
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:12,651
You think my wallet's a gun?

249
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:15,031
Your pistol's likely to
blow up in your face.

250
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:17,771
So you're the roadrunner,
and I'm the coyote?

251
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,071
Is that what this is?

252
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:20,321
I'm just a guy living his life,

253
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:22,031
and you're just a weak-ass cop

254
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,232
with nothing but a handful of piss.

255
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,231
I'm a war photographer, remember?

256
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:31,902
Mm-hmm.

257
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:36,691
I've been in the shit.

258
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:41,231
More than you ever will.

259
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:44,611
You wanna play the cowboy?
Go ahead, pull your gun.

260
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:59,271
Yeah.

261
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,152
I didn't think so.

262
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:07,191
Hey, Sherlock Holmes,

263
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,191
you know who seems to
have all the answers?

264
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,981
Ann Rutledge.

265
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:14,361
She has a room full of
my childhood possessions

266
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,941
in her house,

267
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:18,031
behind a secret doorway in a bookcase.

268
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:23,691
Oh, so she's creating all these
deaths to make you look guilty?

269
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,111
You're the police. You figure it out.

270
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:36,771
What's he doing here?

271
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:39,071
The Destroyer!

272
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,571
You let him in?!

273
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:44,231
He is the one who
follows me in darkness.

274
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:46,862
He is the serpent!

275
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,071
He needs to stop running.

276
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:53,151
It's time to confront this head on.

277
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:54,731
What did you say?

278
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:58,191
He urges me and tempts me.

279
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:01,942
He is the lie!

280
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:04,861
Hey!

281
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:07,071
Uhh!

282
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:11,612
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

283
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:13,612
- That's enough!
- Hey! Don't!

284
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:14,942
Get off!

285
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:17,611
Get down! Hands behind your back!

286
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:20,111
Hey! Don't! Don't! Don't! Hey, watch...

287
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:21,172
Uhh!

288
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,271
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

289
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,901
Get him up here!

290
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:46,151
The Beast.

291
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,997
Mr. Thorn's work is brilliant.

292
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,481
There's no question about that.

293
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:03,521
But we do have some concerns
about him professionally.

294
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:07,482
Is this because he didn't
show up to the interview?

295
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:12,231
Among other things.

296
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:20,481
The woman he loves
dies a horrible death,

297
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:23,601
is literally ripped from his hands,

298
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,441
and you think he should've
made this his priority?

299
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:28,731
Two days after Kelly dies,
he risks his own life

300
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:32,151
to save a stranger's kid
from the train tracks,

301
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,101
and you're saying he's
not a reliable guy?

302
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:35,441
Mr. Golkar...

303
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:37,271
Damien Thorn is the best
photographer out there,

304
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,481
hands down.

305
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:40,061
But he's also the most selfless,

306
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:42,101
courageous guy I've ever met.

307
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:45,481
And if these aren't the
qualities you want

308
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,441
in your collective,

309
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:48,652
then good luck to you.

310
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,602
Mr. Golkar, please, wait.

311
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,561
Detective Shay.

312
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,651
Good afternoon, Ms. Rutledge.

313
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:14,401
Is something wrong? Is Damien...

314
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:17,481
No, he's fine. Do you,
uh, mind if I come in?

315
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:19,312
Of course.

316
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:22,022
Just had a few questions to ask you.

317
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:23,731
May I offer you some coffee?

318
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:25,691
No, thank you.

319
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,311
I'm gonna get right to the point.

320
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,151
Mr. Thorn's down at the
police station right now.

321
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:30,941
We brought him in for questioning

322
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:34,061
about his possible involvement
in the death of Troy Hendrie.

323
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,601
Mr. Thorn suggested that
you might've known him.

324
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:40,061
Yes. He worked with me at Armitage.

325
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:41,521
Hmm.

326
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:43,271
Ms. Rutledge, are you Mr.
Thorn's attorney?

327
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:44,981
Yes.

328
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,441
He says you're not.

329
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:48,561
He says he only met you a week ago,

330
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:51,101
and he suggested that you
might be stalking him.

331
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:54,021
He said that?

332
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:57,021
Well, to be specific, I'm
not his personal attorney.

333
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:58,981
I represent the Thorn Family Estate.

334
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:01,101
Hmm.

335
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:04,601
He said there was a special
room in your house,

336
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:07,101
with, uh, his personal belongings

337
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,061
from when he was a child?

338
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:10,521
Now that's ridiculous.

339
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,401
Well, he said this room has access

340
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:15,152
through a secret doorway in a bookshelf.

341
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:39,151
It's a panic room.

342
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,941
I never use it.

343
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:43,522
I never panic.

344
00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:58,271
I suppose I should warn you.

345
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:01,311
Damien's given to very erratic behavior.

346
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:13,231
Are you saying that he's a liar?

347
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:24,601
I'm saying he has trouble distinguishing

348
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:28,191
between reality and fantasy.

349
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:59,521
Good meeting?

350
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:01,102
You have that look.

351
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:04,522
I think I got their attention.

352
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:09,271
Who were you pitching? Bob? Carol?

353
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:11,231
That fat bastard Luigi?

354
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:15,651
No, it was, uh, Fumika.

355
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:19,601
Ooh. Fumika... she's tough.

356
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,021
I heard she once knocked out
an intern with a staple gun.

357
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,442
Don't tell her I told you.

358
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:30,731
I hope you're headed out to celebrate.

359
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:34,271
Yeah, you know what? I am
heading out to celebrate.

360
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:36,191
Know any good bars around here?

361
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:41,191
I've known him his entire life.

362
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:43,941
Besides handling the legal
affairs of the Thorn Estate,

363
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,191
I'm also executor of his father's will.

364
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,021
Then why would Damien claim to
only have met you last week?

365
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:51,481
He spent years overseas

366
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:54,481
in extremely high pressure situations.

367
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:57,441
That's certainly taken a psychic toll.

368
00:25:57,442 --> 00:25:58,941
Could you be more specific?

369
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:00,561
The specifics of his mental health...

370
00:26:00,562 --> 00:26:02,272
...are attorney-client privilege.

371
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:04,401
But you have to understand,

372
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:07,191
if there's a hell on earth,

373
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,101
Damien's been dead center,
photographing it.

374
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,311
Mm.

375
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:14,231
Does he own dogs?

376
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:16,151
I don't think so.

377
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:18,441
'Cause I was attacked by one last night.

378
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:20,771
Another man was mauled to
death by a pack of them.

379
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:23,601
Damien training
dogs to attack people?

380
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:26,691
You give him too much credit.

381
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:30,941
I will say he used to, uh,
be prone to fits of rage.

382
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:32,601
He supposedly knocked his
mother over a balcony

383
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:34,101
when he was young.

384
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:36,191
I assumed it was an accident.

385
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:38,481
But then I was on the board of
one of the school he attended,

386
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:41,101
and there was an altercation
with another student.

387
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:42,167
I can't remember his name.

388
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,231
Thorn hurt him?

389
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:46,191
The poor boy spent
his life in a facility.

390
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:48,981
So he rang his bell pretty bad?

391
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,651
Charles Powell. That's the name.

392
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:54,521
I will look into that.

393
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:57,101
Damien was treated after that.

394
00:26:57,102 --> 00:27:00,271
And I thought he'd
pulled himself together.

395
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:03,101
But I guess we can only outrun
our demons for so long.

396
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:05,102
Wouldn't you agree, Detective?

397
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:16,101
What the hell is this?

398
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,271
He's a very powerful babalawo.

399
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:19,521
A witch doctor?

400
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:21,311
The bird in the tub was Kelly.

401
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,061
The bird that broke the
stained glass window

402
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:24,561
at the funeral, it was Kelly.

403
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:27,401
She's trying to come back
or she's lost her way.

404
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:29,101
Either way, she's trying
to tell us something.

405
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:30,397
He can help her.

406
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,361
Mom, this is not real.

407
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,441
This is an old world superstition.

408
00:27:35,442 --> 00:27:37,361
You can't possibly believe this.

409
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:41,271
You found a... bird in your bath?

410
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:45,311
Yes.

411
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:47,271
Then you are threatened, too.

412
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:49,981
The spirits will come for you.

413
00:27:59,102 --> 00:28:00,602
What are you gonna do?

414
00:28:09,692 --> 00:28:13,441
This house need to be purified.

415
00:28:14,548 --> 00:28:15,651
Mom.

416
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,441
Oh, my God. Please stop.

417
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,021
No. No! Those are Kelly's things!

418
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:30,101
Please! No! Oh, no! No!

419
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:35,481
May the road be open to you.

420
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:40,191
May nothing evil meet you on the way.

421
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,573
I hate photography.

422
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,707
Taking pictures is for people
who can't remember things

423
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:58,441
with their own brain.

424
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:01,021
Kidding.

425
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:02,441
These are great, really.

426
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:05,191
I'm not surprised you crushed it today.

427
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,271
So you and this photographer
been working together long?

428
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:10,611
Uh, two years.

429
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:12,611
You know, I think we make a-a good team.

430
00:30:12,612 --> 00:30:14,941
You guys have obviously
been through a lot.

431
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,612
You don't even know.

432
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,151
So tell me.

433
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,941
All right. Uh, well, uh,

434
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,321
I was working as a
translator in, uh, Libya

435
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:27,904
for the Americans, and, um,

436
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:30,061
Gadaffi loyalists, they just
blitzed through Tripoli,

437
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,521
and they were rounding people up.

438
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,271
And, you know, they put me in a ditch

439
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:34,931
with a hood over my head.

440
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:39,021
And the soldiers, they
moved down the line.

441
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:43,271
Started, uh, shooting
guys I knew one by one.

442
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:46,181
And, uh, all I could think about w...

443
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:49,601
was my mother, my sisters.

444
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:53,891
They'd, uh, never know
what happened to me.

445
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:59,601
And Damien, he just steps
up out of nowhere.

446
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:02,312
And I have no idea what he said, but...

447
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:06,891
...they let me go.

448
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:15,851
Never really told anyone
that story before.

449
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:17,852
Why are you telling it now?

450
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:22,931
I don't know.

451
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:24,471
Taxi!

452
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:26,472
Ooh, hoo!

453
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:28,142
All right, no, I got it. I got this.

454
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:29,352
- Yo! Wait!
- Oh, he sped up!

455
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,372
Oh, come on! Taxi!

456
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:33,181
Seriously! Wow. Don't worry, I got it.

457
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,391
This is it for sure.

458
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,062
Oh.

459
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:40,181
Wow.

460
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:41,521
You wanna give it a go?

461
00:31:56,432 --> 00:32:00,022
You gotta teach me that trick sometime.

462
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,522
Right.

463
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,352
Bye.

464
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:41,101
We can't hold you.

465
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:42,522
You're free to go.

466
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:00,181
What is this?

467
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:02,181
Did you see the room?

468
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:03,891
I'll take it from here.

469
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:07,471
Everything's going to be all right.

470
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:10,141
What the hell did she tell you?
You can't let her do this.

471
00:33:10,142 --> 00:33:11,391
You take care.

472
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:13,101
And don't let me see you again.

473
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:14,392
Let's get you home.

474
00:33:20,272 --> 00:33:22,101
What did you say to him?

475
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,391
That you've witnessed more than
your fair share of suffering.

476
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:27,391
Did you tell him the part you've played?

477
00:33:27,392 --> 00:33:30,061
Not exactly the most eloquent
"thank you" I've ever received.

478
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:31,931
Why would I say thank you?

479
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:33,141
You say you've been there my whole life,

480
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:34,352
- watching out for me.
- I have.

481
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:36,181
You've done a shitty job!

482
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:39,311
Look at this mess! You want gratitude?

483
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:43,231
I can't leave my apartment
without shit going down.

484
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:45,521
Enough death.

485
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:47,471
You're just looking
for someone to blame.

486
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:50,561
Oh, you're not the puppet master?

487
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,231
Oh, you sure do play the part well.

488
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:54,352
The part I play is insignificant.

489
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:03,641
This stops now. These
killings will stop now.

490
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:07,022
Even if I have to slit
your throat to make them.

491
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:11,022
Do it.

492
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:16,521
Slit my throat.

493
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,021
You know that's what you want.

494
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:22,522
Desperate men have nothing to lose.

495
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:40,061
The day will come.

496
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:00,244
Did you go to Ann Rutledge's home today?

497
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,784
I hear you accused her

498
00:35:01,785 --> 00:35:03,675
of being involved in
that escalator death.

499
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:04,555
N-Not exactly...

500
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,053
I don't give a rat's ass
what you were doing. Stop it.

501
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,841
Captain, listen, I went
there for a reason.

502
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:10,091
Damien Thorn, he accused her of...

503
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,301
What's your obsession with this guy?

504
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:14,091
Is he your type?

505
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:15,761
Just drop it.

506
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:17,801
Let's not make this
another Baltimore, okay?

507
00:35:17,802 --> 00:35:19,801
Took you years to climb
out of that pile of shit.

508
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:21,721
You wanna go right back there?
I don't think so.

509
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:26,341
Be smart. Leave Thorn alone.

510
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:39,971
Hey.

511
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,261
Can I come in?

512
00:35:41,262 --> 00:35:42,682
Of course.

513
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:50,681
Everything all right?

514
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,842
No.

515
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:03,181
Where did you get this?

516
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:04,921
Ever since Kelly died,

517
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:07,261
I've been seeing things.

518
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:10,681
The church where we held the funeral...

519
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:14,011
you remember the bird that
flew into the window?

520
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:16,721
I found another one in my drain.

521
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:18,181
My mom's Nigerian.

522
00:36:18,182 --> 00:36:21,181
I told her, and she brought
in a Yoruba priest.

523
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:25,052
He thinks Kelly's trying to talk to us.

524
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:28,131
That was a scam.

525
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:31,761
What else could it be?

526
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:35,131
There's a rational
explanation for all of this.

527
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:38,421
You know, a bird flew into your window,

528
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:40,381
and another got caught in your drain.

529
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:44,261
I don't know how, but it did.

530
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:47,341
And your fortune-teller
pulled a magic trick.

531
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:49,472
He might as well have
sawed a lady in half.

532
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,342
I wish things were different.

533
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:02,301
But trust me, I do.

534
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:06,801
The things I... and Kelly...
have seen...

535
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:09,381
brutality, natural
disasters, massacres...

536
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:12,051
there's always the ones left behind.

537
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:13,972
Human wreckage.

538
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:19,841
People suffering so badly,

539
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:21,341
they can't possibly go on.

540
00:37:21,342 --> 00:37:23,472
They need answers. They're...

541
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:29,301
Well, their... their pain is... is so...

542
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:33,302
great, th-there must
be a higher purpose.

543
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:37,182
There must be a reason.

544
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:43,655
But, uh...

545
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:46,839
There is none.

546
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:51,629
Kelly died.

547
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,298
And a bird is just a bird.

548
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,798
I'm sorry.

549
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:05,457
I'm...

550
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:06,709
No...

551
00:38:06,712 --> 00:38:08,458
I am.

552
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:10,999
You know, I wish you two
had gotten to be together.

553
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:14,878
She really loved you.

554
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:16,628
I probably shouldn't be saying that.

555
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,998
No, it's okay.

556
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,669
I know.

557
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,868
You don't think McGarry's
gonna make trouble?

558
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:57,179
He hates you, you know.

559
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:59,203
He hates everybody.
That's why he's a cop.

560
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:00,727
Well, he's right. You should
leave well enough alone.

561
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,321
I got it.

562
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:05,981
If that suspect has a history
of mental illness...

563
00:39:05,982 --> 00:39:07,901
That only confuses his alibi.

564
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:09,731
That doesn't explain anything
about all the deaths around him.

565
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,061
It's a statistical cluster...

566
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:12,771
Don't talk down to me, okay?

567
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:14,861
You know I can't handle
the Stephen Hawking shit.

568
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:16,441
Well, I try not to talk down to you.

569
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:17,771
It's just so hard not to.

570
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:22,441
Are we getting all healthy now?

571
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:23,981
Yeah, we're
gonna go with olive oil.

572
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:25,731
Olive oil. So domestic.
I love this.

573
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:30,482
- That's it. See that?
- Parsley, yeah.

574
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,271
How many eggs do you want?

575
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:34,061
Two.

576
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:35,901
This Thorn guy is a dick.

577
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:37,521
He walks into my station,

578
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:39,151
and there's some guy in
there for parking tickets

579
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:41,061
who suddenly decides he
wants to castrate himself.

580
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,151
And then there's all these
deaths and the dog attack.

581
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:44,771
I-I just don't get it.

582
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:46,151
You're not gonna leave
well enough alone, are ya?

583
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,145
I try, but it's just so hard not to.

584
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:15,646
Jacob! Breakfast!

585
00:40:17,026 --> 00:40:19,315
Babe, come on. It'll get cold.

586
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,356
Jacob!

587
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,895
Jacob! Jacob!

588
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,566
Oh, God, Jacob.

589
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:38,895
Patrick! Patrick!

590
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,066
Jacob?

591
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:41,395
I'm here. I got him. I got him.

592
00:41:41,396 --> 00:41:43,025
All right, Jacob. Jacob.

593
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,106
- Oh, Jacob.
- Honey, come on. Jacob, wake up.

594
00:41:45,107 --> 00:41:46,395
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

595
00:41:46,396 --> 00:41:48,065
Move out of the way. Move
out of the way. 1, 2...

596
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:49,945
Come on. Come on.

597
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:51,066
Come on, Jacob. Come on.

598
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:53,855
Ah! There he goes! It's okay. It's okay.

599
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:55,186
- Okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

600
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:57,985
Okay, get him in there.

601
00:41:57,986 --> 00:41:59,525
I got him. We need an ambulance.

602
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:00,946
- You got him?
- Yeah.

603
