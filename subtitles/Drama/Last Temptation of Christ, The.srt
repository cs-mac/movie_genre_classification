00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:08,319
<i>Episode 49</i>

2
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:16,781
Welcome.

3
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:20,071
Did you confirm it?

4
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:26,181
I'm sure you saw what would have really
happened to the real Hong Myeong Ho.

5
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,711
<i>010-447-437</i>

6
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:35,670
<i>Moon Seon Ho, this is Jin Hyeong Woo.</i>

7
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,871
<i>Wait a minute. Don't hang
up, listen carefully.</i>

8
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:43,260
<i>Don't trick me. You're tracing my
location with the police, aren't you?</i>

9
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,101
<i>That's not it. I'm alone now.</i>

10
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:51,470
<i>Give me just a minute. Nobody
can get you in that time.</i>

11
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,650
<i>What do you want?</i>

12
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,410
<i>I know you're in a bad position.</i>

13
00:00:55,411 --> 00:01:00,620
<i>You are wanted nationwide. Even if you want to go
abroad, you are banned from leaving the country.</i>

14
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:04,611
<i>Moon Seon Ho, if you want to get away,
your only choice is as a stowaway.</i>

15
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:09,240
<i>However, it's not easy to stow away, either</i>

16
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,380
<i>because Kwon Soo Myeong is
trying to get rid of you.</i>

17
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:17,060
<i>Haven't you figured how Kwon Soo
Myeong really takes care of someone</i>

18
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:19,580
<i>who knows too many of his secrets?</i>

19
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:23,030
<i>So? Just get to the point.</i>

20
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:25,261
<i>Where are you going to stow away?</i>

21
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,630
<i>Hey, am I stupid? Aren't you trying
to sucker me and then capture me?</i>

22
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,291
<i>You don't have many alternatives right now.</i>

23
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:37,961
<i>Either trust me, or die by
Kwon Soo Myeong's hands,</i>

24
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:43,951
<i>you have less than a minute. You decide.</i>

25
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:59,560
<i>Hong Myeong Ho?</i>

26
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,151
<i>Who are you?</i>

27
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:05,481
<i>I'm Moon Seon Ho.</i>

28
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,910
<i>Are you sure you're Moon Seon Ho?</i>

29
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:12,680
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

30
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,581
<i>Hey, guys!</i>

31
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,691
<i>Take him away.</i>

32
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:27,540
<i>Ah, yes. I caught him.</i>

33
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:32,831
Did you bring a homeless Hong Myeong Ho?

34
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:39,351
Why did you go that far to help me?

35
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,171
Kwon Soo Myeong's ₩300 billion
that you sent to Brazil...

36
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:47,640
- I have it.- What did you say?

37
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:53,121
I followed the method you
always used and hacked it.

38
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:57,910
You jerk. You trap me and then rescue me?

39
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,911
What is your motive?

40
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,611
To divide you and Kwon Soo Myeong.

41
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:17,411
Moon Seon Ho, you have nowhere else to go.

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,741
My motive is to catch Kwon Soo Myeong.

43
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,401
It's not because I have
any grudge against you.

44
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:28,381
Help me catch him.

45
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:32,500
<i>Then I'll help you to get away.</i>

46
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,930
How should I trust you?

47
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:36,141
You know I came here alone.

48
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:42,111
If I wanted to arrest you, I
would have brought the police.

49
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,811
Moon Seon Ho,

50
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,951
there was definitely a time
when you loved Eun Soo.

51
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:57,141
There isn't much time before Eun Soo will
be on trial for instigating a murder.

52
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:00,641
Please help.

53
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:09,380
Are you saying that Kwon Soo Myeong had money
sent to Dr. Im in the Eun Gang Foundation's name?

54
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:14,660
Yes, they are going to try to make me clearly
into an instigator of murder before the trial.

55
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,460
So did you have the money sent?

56
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:20,520
Yes, but I didn't send it in the Eun
Gang Foundation's or the Madame's name.

57
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:23,930
I sent it in the name of the bank that
Kwon Soo Myeong withdrew the money from.

58
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,220
Manager Jo, I think we may be able
to catch Kwon Soo Myeong using this.

59
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:31,540
Because it wasn't sent in his
name, he'll try to get out of it.

60
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:36,080
I'll testify. Regarding everything
Kwon Soo Myeong ordered me to do.

61
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,020
But he'll still slip out.

62
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:42,130
We have to find direct evidence that Kwon
Soo Myeong and Dr. lm were connected.

63
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:47,290
Manager Jo, is it possible we can
wiretap him committing a crime?

64
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:52,600
Even until before you appeared,
Eun Soo had faith in you.

65
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,541
Even after I revealed your true identity,

66
00:04:56,821 --> 00:05:00,141
she said you wouldn't do that
and believed in you to the end.

67
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,561
You want to send that kind
of woman to jail again?

68
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:10,671
So why are you doing that for Shin Eun Soo?

69
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:16,761
That woman let you go and married
an old ex-Prime Minister.

70
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:23,281
Why are you hanging yourself over
a woman who's been married twice?

71
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,361
She was my first love.

72
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,431
If I hadn't let her go back then,

73
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:45,431
Eun Soo's life wouldn't have
gone through so much difficulty.

74
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:51,371
I've lived regretting
it forever since then.

75
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,091
Now it's your turn.

76
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:05,771
Do you want to live regretting it, too?

77
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:09,801
It's an amazing love.

78
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,431
I'm different from you, so you two
should take care of it yourselves.

79
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:20,931
Are you going to keep this up to the end?

80
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:25,270
What kind of grudge do you
have against Eun Soo?

81
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:28,211
It wasn't enough that Kwon
Soo Myeong used Eun Soo.

82
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:33,990
It wasn't enough you sent an innocent
woman to jail and kept ₩2 billion.

83
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:37,470
You show up again in front
of that poor woman.

84
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:40,661
The one who manipulated the Eun
Gang Foundation money was you, too.

85
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,561
Why in the world are you doing this?

86
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,830
I don't know a thing.

87
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:48,771
What don't you know?

88
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,241
You're the same as Kwon Soo Myeong.

89
00:06:54,641 --> 00:07:00,551
You are a dog-man that waves its
tail while being fed scraps by him.

90
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,641
If I hadn't done that, Shin Eun Soo
would've died seven years ago!

91
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:15,441
Don't try to break a boulder with an egg.

92
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,640
You don't know Kwon Soo Myeong's power.

93
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:22,901
By doing this, you're only putting
Shin Eun Soo in more danger.

94
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,640
I was taken. I got taken by him again.

95
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:46,421
My money. How did I steal ₩300
billion from the Prime Minister?

96
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,470
What brings Mrs. In-Law...

97
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:06,641
Kwon Soo Myeong, I reported you for
instigating the murder of the Prime Minister.

98
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,351
Here's the complaint.

99
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,770
What kind of threat is this
using a sheet of paper?

100
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:19,510
Kim Gyeong Min confessed

101
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:23,310
that you told him to send money to Dr.
Im in my name.

102
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,631
Is this still only a threat?

103
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:31,800
This proves you falsely
accused me, doesn't it?

104
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:35,300
And I will catch that murderer
in Singapore as well.

105
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:42,481
I will make sure that you
won't sleep until then.

106
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:53,341
<i>Negotiations between Ruling and Opposition Parties
Break DownOver Personal Cell Phone Tapping Bill</i>

107
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:13,810
<i>Hello?</i>

108
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:17,170
I sent the money, but you
can't take it out yet.

109
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:20,750
<i>- What are you saying?</i>- Shin
Eun Soo's side got wind of it.

110
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:25,670
I'll find another route, but in return,
you can't show up at the bank.

111
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:27,030
<i>Did you send all ₩20 billion of it?</i>

112
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:30,910
What are you talking about?
I promised ₩10 billion...

113
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:32,810
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

114
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:36,650
<i>When I called you five days ago,
I definitely said ₩20 billion.</i>

115
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:40,571
<i>If you don't send all of that money, I'll
reveal that it was you who pulled the strings.</i>

116
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,980
Can you restore the date erased?

117
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,610
Yes. If you give me 2-3
days, it's possible.

118
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:13,460
This doesn't work as conclusory evidence
that my father really went to that hospital.

119
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:14,760
Then?

120
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:18,100
I'll have to investigate the
pictures from a long time before.

121
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,430
I like that kind of stuff.

122
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:24,641
Alright. Good work. Keep watching him.

123
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,440
Is thephone tapping successful?

124
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:30,421
No, he only spoke with the secretary.

125
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,020
Perhaps, haven't they noticed?

126
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,671
I don't know.

127
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:41,301
Don't get too disappointed.
Someday, we'll catch him tripping.

128
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:13,861
<i>President Kwon</i>

129
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,410
<i>If you have an ounce of conscience,</i>

130
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:26,860
<i>testify about Kwon Soo Myeong in court.</i>

131
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:30,130
<i>Tell them what he did to my life.</i>

132
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:32,430
<i>Why should I endanger myself like that?</i>

133
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:34,451
<i>Because you're Mi Rae's dad.</i>

134
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:41,341
<i>At the very least, I don't want her to
think her dad was like Kwon Soo Myeong.</i>

135
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,750
I'm sorry.

136
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:11,211
You're here and I thoughtlessly
touched Prime Minister's things.

137
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,401
He used it for a long time.

138
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,151
Could this have been your present to him?

139
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:22,470
Yes.

140
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,421
Team Leader Go.

141
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:33,160
I spent more than half my
life with the Prime Minister.

142
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:39,330
I still feel like he wants
the newspaper every morning.

143
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:43,581
So I bring the newspaper, but...

144
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,261
But...

145
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,961
You're putting me to shame.

146
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:04,481
But you single-mindedly stayed
with the Prime Minister.

147
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:10,690
No, Madam.

148
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:16,891
Because of you, the Prime
Minister was very happy.

149
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,441
I'm thankful to you for that.

150
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:30,841
Madame. I think you need to come out.

151
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:33,871
Honey.

152
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,611
The step.

153
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:42,551
No. Why did this set that left
the house come back again?

154
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,791
Agasshi.

155
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:50,900
Please! How could you be like this?

156
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:55,851
How can you hit such a rock bottom?

157
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,600
What happened?

158
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:05,510
Yeah, with what you took, you could have played
around for years on what you got for it.

159
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,950
My husband... tried to do
business here and there.

160
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,800
We got conned.

161
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,980
- Excuse me. Give me another bowl.
- Yes.

162
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,020
You're eating that!?

163
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:21,460
Really! Seriously! How
can you be like that?

164
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:26,290
Il Ran, still, he can't starve.

165
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,801
You do whatever you want, it's your money.

166
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,520
Of course, I should report them.

167
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:34,680
Hey, Il Ran.

168
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:37,260
When it comes to money,
there's no blood or tears.

169
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:41,500
However, I'll leave this
matter to my wise husband.

170
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:44,551
Excuse me? Me?

171
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:07,201
<i>Haven't you wanted to see
Mi Rae at least once?</i>

172
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:13,081
<i>At the very least, I don't want to let her
think her father was like Kwon Soo Myeong.</i>

173
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:31,751
Here. Here.

174
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,271
Here.

175
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:40,650
You can't take this off here, or
else the balloon will fly away.

176
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:46,010
Wow. When are we going
to go to New Zealand?

177
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:47,911
New Zealand?

178
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:52,880
When you're better, we have to go.

179
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:56,241
I'm all better.

180
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,941
Yeah.

181
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:06,410
When you can run and play.

182
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:08,061
Let's go then.

183
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:14,021
You're cold, aren't you?
I'll go bring you a blanket.

184
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:03,811
<i>When more time passes and
when everything ends,</i>

185
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:10,071
<i>let's talk again. I will
mark time until then.</i>

186
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:33,081
Mi Rae. I'm going to go take a call.

187
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,231
Hello?

188
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:12,911
It's a pretty balloon.

189
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:15,831
Thank you.

190
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,931
What's wrong?

191
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:30,400
I got hurt.

192
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,261
Why?

193
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,941
To protect something precious.

194
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,621
It must hurt a lot.

195
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:45,571
You called for me?

196
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:50,190
I have something to ask you, Manager Jo.

197
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:55,380
Seven years ago, on the day when we
learned that Mi Rae's dad had died,

198
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:58,381
we went to the amusement park.

199
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:04,400
At that time, why did you and
the Prime Minister go there?

200
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,410
Did you see us?

201
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:08,270
Yes.

202
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:13,090
Because of that, my husband ran away
in a rush. Why did you do that?

203
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:17,360
Honestly, I also received a report
about a week ago before that incident.

204
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:21,700
It said that someone was looking for the
Prime Minister's Swiss bank account,

205
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,821
and when I looked into
it, it was Moon Seon Ho.

206
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:32,461
So I escorted the Prime Minister and went to catch
him, but he beat up all my subordinates and ran away.

207
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:37,601
We were also flustered when we
heard that he died the next day.

208
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:43,060
So Kwon Soo Myeong has been targeting the
Prime Minister's slush fund since then.

209
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:45,671
That's probably the case.

210
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:51,810
I couldn't tell you beforehand
for fear you would be hurt.

211
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,051
- I apologize.- It's fine.

212
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:58,561
Now, the mystery is solved.

213
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:30,671
Now, you're even upsetting me?
Why won't you open the door?

214
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:49,970
Why are you doing this? Let's
talk, you know I abhor violence!

215
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:51,670
You tried to get rid of me first.

216
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,290
Hey, that's because you took my money!

217
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,280
There's something called ethics, how
could you just steal it like that?

218
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:01,060
I didn't take it. Jin Hyeong
Woo intercepted it en route.

219
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,370
- What?- What about my payment?

220
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:07,001
Hey, then you should get it from Jin
Hyeong Woo. Why would you come to me...

221
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:10,900
I got it, I'll give it to you.
I'll give it to you.

222
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,790
Wake him up right now and
bring it to me in cash.

223
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,860
Ugh, I said I got it.

224
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:19,520
Don't think of ever searching for me again.
Don't even call me.

225
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:24,960
If there's even an hint of you tracking me, I'm going
to tell the prosecutors everything you've done.

226
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:28,310
Look here, you'll need my help
if you want to stow away.

227
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:34,391
I can do just fine on my own as well, because I
want to end this tiresome relationship with you.

228
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,241
You...

229
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,570
Aigoo, why do you live in a place like
this when you have so much money?

230
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:59,171
If you have ₩300 billion, shouldn't you at
least have a house the size of a gymnasium?

231
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:09,280
- It seems you met Moon Seon Ho.-
Look here, Lawyer Jin. Let's make up.

232
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:17,281
I also have things I agreed to with your mother
in the past. Let's just split that equally

233
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:24,930
and let's stop bothering each other now.

234
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:28,060
We'll only shed blood if we
start a war with each other.

235
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:31,970
I'll make sure Shin Eun Soo is
found innocent at her trial,

236
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,761
so let's make a peace treaty.

237
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:39,820
I told you I don't trust your strategy that you are taking
whatever you can get while hiding behind a weak façade.

238
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:43,161
You've stabbed me in the back
more than once or twice.

239
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:48,260
I'm sorry, but the government
will confiscate that money.

240
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:53,070
What has the government done?
Lawyer Jin, are you crazy?

241
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:56,840
Are you a patriotic separatist?
Why are you really doing this?

242
00:24:56,841 --> 00:25:01,480
Honestly, you have nothing against me.
As you said,

243
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:06,550
let's just say I did something to my in-law.
Then shouldn't you be grateful to me?

244
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:08,310
Why are you bothering me?

245
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:12,300
Please take ₩150 billion and go to New Zealand with
Shin Eun Soo together as you originally planned.

246
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:15,250
Then everyone will be happy.

247
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:17,180
Why the hell are you doing this to me?

248
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:22,441
- Because of justice.- Justice?
What's that?

249
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,790
Yeah,

250
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:30,690
when I was young, I thought that
something like that existed

251
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:34,101
but does the world revolve around justice?

252
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:42,380
In this society, power and
money rule the world.

253
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,050
Don't you know that? Is that why you're
complaining about justice like a little child?

254
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:48,290
If the world is like that,
we should try to change it.

255
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:54,681
- That's what I learned from my father.-
What's the result? Your father just died.

256
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,100
Yes,

257
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:01,760
my father proved justice through his death.

258
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:05,980
The same goes for me. Even if I die,

259
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,341
even if I'm attempting to break a stone with
eggs, I'm going to fight until the end.

260
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:12,630
That's how you and I are different.

261
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:18,131
At least Kang Seok Hyeon reflected
before he died. You're just a monster.

262
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:22,941
I know how many people
that monster will kill,

263
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,631
so I'm going to fight until the end.

264
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:36,690
Yeah, he wants to have a go?

265
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:40,281
Something that my dead in-law
couldn't do, he dares to...

266
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:49,430
- What is this?- I'm Prosecutor Jeong
Ji Yeong from the Seoul District.

267
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:53,050
Since Shin Eun Soo reported you on charges of instigating
the former Prime Minister Kang Seok Hyeon's death

268
00:26:53,051 --> 00:27:00,940
and threatening her personally, we're
planning to investigate. Please cooperate.

269
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:04,890
Aigoo... what is this world coming to?

270
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:08,340
A goby is jumping, and a small
octopus is jumping as well.

271
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:10,901
Call my lawyer.

272
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,601
Yeah, let's go.

273
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:22,180
Did you say you are Prosecutor Jeong?

274
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:25,600
Do you think it makes sense that
I instigated my in-law's murder?

275
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,780
Didn't you give money to Kim Gyeong Min

276
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:32,630
and send it to Singapore under the
pretense that it was from Shin Eun Soo?

277
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:34,380
President...

278
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:39,470
Look here, I don't know
who Kim Gyeong Min is,

279
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:46,300
and I sent money to Singapore to invest
in the construction of a building.

280
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:49,160
The recipient's account is also
from the construction company.

281
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:52,760
Did that murderer, Im Dong
Jun, take that money?

282
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:55,601
Did he?!

283
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:09,590
Excuse me. I'm going to make
you confront each other.

284
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:14,630
Kim Gyeong Min, is everything
you testified to true?

285
00:28:14,631 --> 00:28:17,010
Yes, everything is true.

286
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:21,581
I said I didn't know who that person is.

287
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,401
What do you do?

288
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:28,871
I have evidence.

289
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:36,880
<i>President, I took about three
voices and did a test.</i>

290
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,080
<i>Find the coordinate book.</i>

291
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:42,000
<i>Find the coordinate book.</i>

292
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,770
<i>Find the coordinate book.</i>

293
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:48,110
<i>Once you pick among these
three, I'll use that voice.</i>

294
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:52,470
In-Law, where is my voice in that file?

295
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:56,830
Coordinate book or whatever, is there a
reason for me to be studying math at my age?

296
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:00,320
The phone number Gyeong
Min called is your number

297
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:06,290
- and he also visited your office multiple times.-
I receive around 20 spam phone calls a day.

298
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:10,600
I've never met that person in my life.
I'm Kwon Soo Myeong.

299
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:15,970
- Why would I associate myself with that scammer?-
I even sent money to Singapore under your orders.

300
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,870
- Are you going even to deny
it?- I have nothing to say.

301
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:23,071
The right to remain silent. Do you know
what the right to remain silent is?

302
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:28,450
Father-in-Law was arrested
by the prosecutors?

303
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:32,950
Yes, that woman Shin Eun Soo reported him.

304
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:37,160
There's nothing to worry about. My father
has the prosecutors in his pocket.

305
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:39,650
He won't be imprisoned just
because of a woman's complaint.

306
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:45,770
But you also think that your father
instigated my father's murder.

307
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:47,571
Yeah, of course.

308
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,930
You need to have this
much evidence like me.

309
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:56,701
Tada! Do you want to see?

310
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:07,430
Isn't this the hospital
Father-in-Law used to go to?

311
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,200
So are you going to turn this
over to the prosecutors?

312
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:13,841
Are you crazy? Why would
I persecute my father?

313
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,050
Then why did you obtain this?

314
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:19,310
As insurance for you.

315
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:25,201
I can use this to force my father to
retire and take his President's seat.

316
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:33,561
What is this?

317
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:37,691
<i>Prosecution Service</i>

318
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:49,381
I'm Shin Eun Soo's
attorney, Jin Hyeong Woo.

319
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:53,670
I've brought supporting evidence that Kwon Soo
Myeong instigated the murder of the Prime Minister.

320
00:30:53,671 --> 00:30:57,341
Hey. Jin Hyeong Woo.

321
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:11,551
Prosecutor, would you step
outside for a moment?

322
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,751
Chief Prosecutor.

323
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:38,770
We'll investigate you without detention.

324
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:43,790
Without detention? You haven't
even interrogated him properly.

325
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,530
Then, I just have to go?

326
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:49,240
No! You killed the Prime Minister.

327
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:53,220
Since as far back as nine years ago, you've
used me to get the Prime Minister's money.

328
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:55,930
You even threatened me that you
were going to kill my child.

329
00:31:55,931 --> 00:32:00,341
Look here, Lawyer Lee, can you also
charge this woman for defamation?

330
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:04,301
I tried to leave her alone because of
Eun Gang's face but I can't do it.

331
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:12,390
Didn't I tell you that I have other
evidence? You have to at least look at it.

332
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,670
Submit it as a written reference.

333
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:18,810
How can you do this?
Investigate it properly!

334
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,700
We have evidence, why
are you releasing him?

335
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:24,050
Even though it's without
detention, I'll indict him.

336
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:26,311
He'll be judged at trial.

337
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:42,680
Why do I have to do this?

338
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:45,860
Oh, my. You can't do it like that.

339
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:49,150
You have to wring the water completely
out of the rag first before wiping it.

340
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:52,781
You're the one who most hated having
water on the table while eating.

341
00:32:54,841 --> 00:33:00,390
Right now, who is supposed to do this and
who is standing idly giving instructions?

342
00:33:00,391 --> 00:33:01,820
What are you doing it
not wiping it yourself?

343
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,580
Why would I do that?

344
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:09,091
Team Leader Go clearly said that in the future
we are to leave the housecleaning to you.

345
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:11,520
Look here.

346
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:13,111
Hey!

347
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:16,330
Why? Is she goofing off?

348
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:19,240
Agasshi, this isn't right. How
could I do what the maids...

349
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,620
Shut up!

350
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:24,560
Do you want to go to the police then? Must you
make me do things that aren't good for the baby?

351
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:28,280
No, who said I wasn't going to?

352
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:31,751
I'm doing it now, see? So clean!

353
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:49,440
What... what is this?

354
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:52,940
I didn't do it, your employee did.

355
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:56,080
But In-Law Ma, honestly,
isn't this too much?

356
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:59,080
Even still, can you work
me like a dog like this?

357
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,460
I'm higher ranking than you in the house.

358
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:05,520
But at work, didn't I
tell you to call me Boss?

359
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:09,070
And everyone here is working so diligently.

360
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:13,500
Will it do or not for you
to work so nonchalantly?

361
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:18,050
And the life of our restaurant is a smile.

362
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:20,320
Did I or did I not tell you that?

363
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:22,530
With an already tough-looking face,

364
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:26,090
if you scowl like that, would
customers want to come in?

365
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:29,720
How can I help if I look like this? Do you
want me to get plastic surgery like Il Ran?

366
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:33,111
I don't know. I'm not doing it. I can't.

367
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:38,501
Fine.

368
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:41,500
Ah, hello?

369
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:44,570
Hello, this is 111, right?

370
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:47,570
I want to report a thief.

371
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:52,971
Ah, fine, fine. I'll just do it... Sir.

372
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,600
Smile.

373
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:58,070
It doesn't seem to help.

374
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:02,460
The shop work is good enough, but
if you go out, the lobsters,

375
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:06,460
can you count how many are left, and if
there aren't enough, place an order.

376
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,380
Here's the number.

377
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:11,721
Fine... Sir.

378
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:20,271
Ah. Really.

379
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:29,081
Oh, no, my hand slipped!

380
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:33,980
What, what happened now?

381
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:35,850
How did it fall in there?

382
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:38,650
My hands have always been fern hands.

383
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,820
I'm so sorry, what can I do, Boss?
You'll have to buy a new one.

384
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:45,470
How can you drop someone
else's phone into the water?

385
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:47,550
Sheesh, seriously.

386
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:53,021
Hey, guys. Were you not hurt? Are you okay?

387
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:58,410
You did it deliberately, didn't you?

388
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:01,410
You're so immature, I can't take it.

389
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:05,090
Stop doing stupid things and
go inside and wash the dishes.

390
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:08,520
It's piled up like a mountain.

391
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:11,041
What is this?

392
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,830
I heard about you, Father-in-Law.
You've had a hard time, haven't you?

393
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:26,580
Yeah. I have just been to visit a neighbor
for a short time. How about Moo Hyeok?

394
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:28,240
He went to work.

395
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,111
That's good.

396
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:33,071
Have a seat.

397
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:41,021
What is it?

398
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:43,690
Give that here and go.

399
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:45,171
Yes.

400
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:02,011
You are really hopeless.

401
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:06,090
The memory chip was changed.

402
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,430
Where is the original one?

403
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:12,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

404
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:14,371
I'm sure you don't.

405
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:23,610
This is my cell phone log.

406
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:27,711
Even though it was deleted on
the cellphone, it's still here.

407
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:34,320
You called Dr. Im, didn't you?

408
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:39,460
Father-in-Law, you instigated
my father's murder.

409
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:44,440
Let's say I did. So what are
you going to do about it?

410
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:47,690
Just having spoken to him isn't evidence.

411
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:50,200
But you're different.

412
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,081
There's a witness that
you pushed the child.

413
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:57,311
And the child herself could
open her mouth and talk.

414
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:03,910
Il Joo, I really like you.

415
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:06,451
We're of the same breed.

416
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:13,081
But if you put a knife to my
neck, what will I do with you?

417
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:24,510
Power is uniquely such a thing.

418
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:29,201
It is like a very high castle wall that the
ordinary people like us can never jump over,

419
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:33,281
no matter how hard we struggle.

420
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:36,570
It's not over yet.

421
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:40,041
He's looking down at us
from that high castle.

422
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:43,421
How can we bring them outside?

423
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:48,561
How can we prove Il Joo did it?

424
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:56,941
The breaching of the castle wall has
already started, so please be patient.

425
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:15,300
<i>Il Joo, bring that child to me.</i>

426
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:19,670
<i>That's the only way you can live.</i>

427
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:22,900
<i>I'm not trying to harm the child.</i>

428
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:26,631
<i>I want to negotiate with Shin Eun Soo.</i>

429
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:36,970
Soo In, the doctor is looking for you!

430
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:38,530
Yes!

431
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:41,501
Mi Rae, stay here for a moment.

432
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,481
Mi Rae.

433
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:14,741
I'm sorry.

434
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:20,981
Do you... remember me?

435
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:31,230
That's right. Our daughter-in-law
finally did something I like.

436
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:33,111
I got it.

437
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,450
<i>In-Law,</i>

438
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:20,780
<i>what fault does the child have?</i>

439
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:24,641
<i>How could she get into such an accident
after being born to the wrong mother?</i>

440
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:29,820
It's still not too late.

441
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:35,011
Just plead guilty at the trial.

442
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:40,440
The child is making small sounds.

443
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:43,741
Isn't it all right for
your mother to raise her?

444
00:42:08,311 --> 00:42:12,590
As I've told you, the
Prosecution's sole evidence

445
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:15,440
is a single letter by the
murderer, Im Dong Jun.

446
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,320
My client

447
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:20,350
is certain that he received
an order from someone else

448
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:22,560
and sent that letter.

449
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:26,730
Unless Im Dong Jun personally comes
to this trial and confesses,

450
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:28,921
my client is innocent.

451
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:36,891
Prosecution, do you have more questions?

452
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:47,711
Defendant. You love your daughter, right?

453
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:53,791
Then, even if it's just for
your daughter, confess proudly.

454
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:06,130
If you have no more questions, we'll
adjourn here. The next session will...

455
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:08,241
Just a moment, Your Honor.

456
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,250
I request a witness.

457
00:43:12,251 --> 00:43:17,470
Please summon President Kwon Soo Myeong, who has
made a false accusation against the defendant.

458
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:22,480
Look here! This is Shin Eun Soo's trial.
Why should we call him here?!

459
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:25,170
As of now, President Kwon Soo Myeong

460
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:29,450
is under indictment for blackmailing
and threatening Shin Eun Soo.

461
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:34,001
Your Honor, to establish
Shin Eun Soo's innocence,

462
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:37,411
we must have his testimony.

463
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:54,650
<i>You said Chief of Staff Lee Eun
Seok was the Blue Beauty, right?</i>

464
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:59,780
<i>Call him and tell him
exactly what I tell you.</i>

465
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:01,250
<i>What do I have to say?</i>

466
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,990
<i>"You have those documents, don't you?"</i>

467
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:08,691
<i>"Return them to my wife."</i>

468
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:14,611
She's a vicious woman.

469
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:18,681
Even though I told her that I had her
child, she's still not confessing.

470
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:24,320
Since the situation has come to this,
you should reveal this at the trial.

471
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:28,000
Let's make her look completely shameless.

472
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,810
Are you going to go as a witness?

473
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:34,760
If I avoid it even after they called
me, then I wouldn't be a man.

474
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:37,040
What would they do to me?

475
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:42,271
As long as the attending physician
doesn't show up, no one can imprison me.

Witness.

506
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,240
During the time the defendant was arrested on charges
of instigating the murder of Kang Seok Hyeon,

507
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,400
you used Brian Moon.

508
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:06,820
Through a computer expert
named Moon Seon Ho,

509
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:12,390
you fabricated evidence to give the impression that money from the
Eun Gang Foundation was transferred to Im Dong Jun's wife, correct?

510
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:16,960
Brian Moon? Is he a Korean residing abroad?

511
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:19,730
Ah, this is quite the situation.

512
00:49:19,731 --> 00:49:25,990
I don't even have dementia. Even if I look back over my entire
70 years of life, there is no name like that in my memory.

513
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:30,600
The witness, using the same method,

514
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:35,421
attempted to transfer a huge amount of money to
Im Dong Jun under Shin Eun Soo's name once again

515
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:42,491
through Kim Gyeong Min.

516
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:47,720
Objection! The prosecutors who
investigated the President

517
00:49:47,721 --> 00:49:49,890
have already concluded
that that was not true.

518
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:54,810
What?! Kim Gyeong Min, you bastard,
you were that man's subordinate?

519
00:49:54,811 --> 00:50:00,000
Oppa! Oppa, do that later.
Look at that shameless face.

520
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:04,890
Aigoo... I'm sorry, Your Honor.

521
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:10,500
As I am sitting in front of the
person who killed my lifelong friend,

522
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:13,551
my heart is breaking apart.

523
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:16,410
Why did you do that, In-Law?

524
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:21,850
You should stop now.
Please stop, it was you.

525
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:25,090
You killed the Prime Minister!

526
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:31,250
Right! It's not Mother! No matter how I look at it, it's
you, you piece of trash that's not even worth a used rag!

527
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:33,950
Be quiet! I'll have you removed.

528
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:38,660
Why? As a pregnant woman, I have a free pass. I
have the right to sit down anywhere I want to.

529
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,750
Why? What's wrong? What did I do?!

530
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:46,230
Aigoo, it's a mess. Anyway,
you're quite pitiful as well.

531
00:50:46,231 --> 00:50:52,550
A mother should protect her child. How
could you waste time in a place like this?

532
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:59,300
Your Honor, we have other evidence that the
defendant murdered Prime Minister Kang.

533
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:04,531
I call the former Prime Minister's daughter,
Assemblywoman Kang Il Joo, as a witness.

534
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,841
<i>Witness</i>

submitted yourself, correct?

537
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:40,771
Yes. Please turn it on.

538
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:51,410
This video from the black box installed
in President Kwon Soo Myeong's car

539
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:55,590
was filmed the night before my
father visited the hospital.

540
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:57,770
What are you doing right now?

541
00:51:57,771 --> 00:51:59,570
Gallery! Silence.

542
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:02,181
There is one more remaining video.

543
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:13,111
Coincidentally, Doctor Im Dong Jun's car was
parked next to President Kwon Soo Myeong's car.

544
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:19,081
He abandoned his car in his
rush to escape to Singapore.

545
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:23,471
The next video is the black
box recording from that car.

546
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,830
<i>Oh my, what to do?</i>

00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,561
<i>No...</i>

549
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:49,510
Your Honor!

550
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:52,770
Kang Il Joo is a criminal who
pushed a seven-year-old child down.

551
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:56,410
She's the very woman who tried
to kill Shin Eun Soo's child.

552
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:59,940
On top of that, she even
kidnapped that child.

553
00:52:59,941 --> 00:53:06,291
How could this type of culprit be a
witness at Shin Eun Soo's trial?

554
00:53:08,831 --> 00:53:13,931
That's true. I pushed the child.

555
00:53:14,531 --> 00:53:16,450
<i>Wait, she pushed the child?</i>

556
00:53:16,451 --> 00:53:17,690
<i>Goodness, goodness, goodness.</i>

557
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:20,030
<i>Why on earth...</i>

558
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:27,821
In this seat, I'll reveal that
truth and accept my punishment.

559
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:38,660
However, President Kwon Soo Myeong was the
one who ordered me to kidnap the child.

560
00:53:38,661 --> 00:53:41,871
<i>- What?- Goodness...</i>

561
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,110
Where's Father?

562
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:01,060
He was summoned as a witness
in Shin Eun Soo's trial today.

563
00:54:01,061 --> 00:54:02,711
I see.

564
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:07,790
What? Who's she?

565
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,830
Pardon? Ah, that's...

566
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:12,210
Who is she?! Why is she in my father's
office when my father isn't here?!

567
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:15,190
The thing is... she's
Shin Eun Soo's daughter.

568
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:20,841
Mi Rae? Why is she in this office?

569
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:36,031
This isn't Mi Rae.

570
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:42,941
My father brought her here
thinking she was Mi Rae?

571

00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:32,331
<i>Just confess your crimes at the trial.</i>

606
00:59:34,301 --> 00:59:39,910
<i>The child is making small sounds. Wouldn't it
be all right for your mother to raise her?</i>

607
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:43,340
<i>- How could he do this, how?!-
How could he use a child?</i>

608
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:47,400
<i>- What did he do to the child?
- What do we do about Mi Rae?!</i>

609
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:50,331
<i>What kind of situation is this?</i>

610
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:16,641
Once again, I'll report
President Kwon Soo Myeong.

611
01:00:19,271 --> 01:00:24,560
He put the defendant into the former Prime Minister Kang's
house forcefully, blackmailed and threatened by all means.

612
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:29,670
And ordered to kidnap the child, stole the
former Prime Minister Kang's slush fund,

613
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:34,201
and instigated the murder of former Prime Minister Kang
Seok Hyeon. On those charges I am reporting against you.

614
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:39,371
The defendant is you now.
