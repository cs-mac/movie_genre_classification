1
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,333
Do you understand "jet-lagged"?

2
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,795
OK, thanks. Be right down.

3
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,066
I don't know, it depends.

4
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,494
OK.

5
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,053
Give your mom my love.

6
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,486
<i>Heaven has reached down to earth.</i>

7
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,275
<i>And what does this tell us?</i>

8
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,078
<i>That God has not forsaken us,</i>

9
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,577
<i>that He is always watching over us,</i>

10
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,500
<i>that He loves us.</i>

11
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,667
<i>Through this sign,
He has manifested His presence.</i>

12
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,423
<i>He is telling us,</i>

13
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,085
<i>you are not alone.</i>

14
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,267
Excuse me.

15
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,569
Excuse me...

16
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,944
Could I have a light, please?

17
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:07,944
Yeah.

18
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,199
Thanks, you're very nice.

19
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,457
- OK?
- Yeah.

20
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,215
Yeah, thanks.

21
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,011
Are you taking the Metro?

22
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,175
Of course.

23
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,388
Do you...?

24
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,353
You both live in Paris, or not?

25
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,307
We actually live nearby.

26
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,485
I'm sorry but...

27
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,187
What did you say?

28
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,068
We live right around here...

29
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,364
in this neighbourhood.

30
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,192
Yes, OK, I understand.

31
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,908
Me, I stay here for a few days but...

32
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,453
then I leave soon for...

33
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,879
<i>I'm going..-</i>

34
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,629
In fact, I leave...

35
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,923
I'm sorry about my French.
It's awful, I know.

36
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,929
It's OK, don't worry.

37
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,512
- What's your name?
- What?

38
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,059
You got a problem?

39
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,727
What?

40
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,356
Don't you say excuse me?

41
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,156
He's not French.

42
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,486
I'm sorry, sir.

43
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,287
So he doesn't speak French?

44
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,757
Like a girl.

45
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,006
And why do you have two girls
and I have none?

46
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,467
OK, that's it, enough.

47
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,225
Hold on!

48
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,643
Come on, stop!

49
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,446
No, it's OK.

50
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,321
What time is it?

51
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,996
It's 10:05.

52
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,200
We don't have time?

53
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,965
I'm hungry-

54
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,964
Let's go.

55
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,975
- See you around, maybe?
- Nice meeting you.

57
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,810
Evening, sir.

58
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,109
Excuse me, good evening.

59
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,469
My friend...

60
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,437
Wanna spend the evening
with some pretty girls?

61
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,685
What?

62
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,688
A nice night with pretty girls.
Interested?

63
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,144
Right over there.

64
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,897
What do you mean exactly?

65
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,949
You go in, have a drink,
look around...

66
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,494
There are pretty girls
to keep you company.

67
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,073
If you want more, if you want sex,
that's possible too, OK?

68
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,329
But, how much?

69
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,628
10 Euros for a drink...

70
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,704
If you don't like it, you leave.

71
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,008
What do you think?
A great souvenir of Paris.

72
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,381
Trust me, I'm no crook.

73
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:30,967
There?

74
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,654
Good evening.

75
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,278
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

76
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,618
Hi.

77
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,165
What's your name?

78
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,164
My name's Simon.

79
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,794
Will you have a drink with me?

80
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,675
Yeah, but how much will that be?

81
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,551
<i>- 20 Euros.
- 20 Euros...</i>

82
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,340
Thank you.

83
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,763
Where are you from?

84
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,198
Are you all set?

85
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,295
Thank you.

86
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,330
You're very handsome.

87
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,792
I'm not just saying that for work,
I really think so.

88
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,040
That's sweet.

89
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,890
Yeah, I understand.

90
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,679
I studied eyes in college.

91
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,223
Yes.

92
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:04,515
I studied the relationship
between the brain and the eye.

93
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,477
- You speak French very well.
- No, that's not true.

94
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,214
Thank you.

95
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,045
You OK?

96
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,048
- And you?
- Yeah.

97
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,305
What is that?

98
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,667
Hold on...

99
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,382
I have to take it off.

100
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,467
It's OK.

101
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,094
Take my number, if you like.

102
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,619
Really? I missed a party?

103
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,327
No, it was great.
I had it all to myself.

104
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,708
What, like I don't need dough?

105
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,169
Hi, girls!

106
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,509
- How's it going?
- Everybody's here.

107
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,758
Where else would we be?

108
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,214
Want a drag?

109
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,511
Why you staring, huh?

110
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,098
You got a problem?

111
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,938
On the left, at the corner.

112
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,256
Sit over there.

113
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,182
I rent it from an old lady.

114
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,514
She's kind of lonely.

115
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,553
You've got other bruises?

116
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,757
He was very violent.

117
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,758
He never let me go out.

118
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,272
Once, I woke up
in the middle of the night.

119
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,772
I was pregnant.

120
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,615
I had a baby boy inside me.

121
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,446
My belly was so big.

122
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,411
I woke up suddenly...

123
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,330
and there was blood everywhere.

124
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,345
And I walked into the kitchen.

125
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,933
And my husband was there.
He looked at me.

126
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:37,018
I was covered in blood.
It was everywhere.

127
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,644
And before going to the hospital...

128
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,482
he fucked me in the kitchen.

129
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,193
Are you here?

130
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,243
I saw a client at a hotel.

131
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,118
Very aggressive.

132
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,999
But he left me some coke.

133
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,373
Want a glass of wine?

134
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,283
You know, most of these guys...

135
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,644
I got the phone.

136
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,189
Take a look.

137
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:01,085
I love navy blue. It's got class.

138
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,224
Hold on! It's not right.

139
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,830
Sorry, excuse me.

140
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,740
Are you Jean?

141
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,579
Yes.

142
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,286
Did you see a girl tonight?

143
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:09,830
What?

144
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,231
OK.

145
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,067
I'm going to speak in French,
you understand?

146
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,190
Yes, I understand.

147
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,818
I'm a cop.

148
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:39,610
Understand?

149
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:41,991
Yes.

150
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,832
That means I could...

151
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,705
if I wanted to...

152
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,041
Do you understand?

153
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:59,471
If I fuck a whore, what's it to you?

154
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,969
Do you really have something,
or are you just fucking with me?

155
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,896
Cause if you do,
I'll hurt you.

156
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,143
Understand?

157
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,156
Stop it.

158
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,032
Stop.

159
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:06,931
Stop.

160
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,349
Want to see what it feels like?

161
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,052
You're such a fucking pain!

162
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,853
Hold on, let me show you.

163
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,397
Turn around.

164
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,020
Do you like that?

165
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,229
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

166
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,698
Like that?

167
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,191
OK, come here.

168
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,078
Like that?

169
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,704
Yeah, that's good.

170
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,598
Are you OK?

171
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,272
- Yes. And you?
- Yeah.

172
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:56,135
Have I told you about the first time
I saw a woman on the Boulevard?

173
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:03,267
I walked down the Boulevard.
My mother held my hand.

174
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:06,695
We were going to Sacré Coeur.
It was a Sunday.

175
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,031
That day...

176
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,953
I noticed a woman leaning against
the side of a building.

177
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,625
She was big...

178
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:28,004
She was wearing a miniskirt,
without stockings.

179
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,256
She stared at me.

180
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,007
She was beautiful.

181
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,883
She stared at me.

182
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,732
And with her finger,
she gave me a sign like this.

183
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:51,030
She was so close,
I could smell her.

184
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,953
At that time,
I didn't know what the smell was.

185
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,201
Now, I know.

186
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,573
It was sex.

187
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,668
When I was older...

188
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,590
I went back to find her,
just to ask her...

189
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,384
<i>What did you want with me?</i>

190
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,636
You see?

191
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:22,180
<i>What did you want to do
with an 8-year-old boy?</i>

192
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,199
Undress.

193
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,801
Rene'?

194
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,553
Yeah.

195
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,567
Wait, wait, wait...

196
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,237
Rene'-.

197
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,908
You're a kid.

198
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,753
It wasn't easy for me
to get this money.

199
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:26,181
I've got a wife, a kid, a home.

200
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,060
- Yeah, I understand.
- I have responsibilities.

201
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,652
Are you sure
about how you're feeling?

202
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,696
Look me in the eyes.

203
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,571
So?

204
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,490
Enough said. Want a drink?

205
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,742
Just a Coke, please.

206
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,373
You'll come by again...

207
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,082
- I hope so.
- You won't forget us?

208
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,667
Of course not.

209
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,298
You're staying in Paris, I hope?

210
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,427
No, no, I'm not leaving.

211
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,804
No, one day at a time.

212
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,555
Love's fleeting.

213
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,104
Whatever it is,
I'm much better right now.

214
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,147
Here's to love!

215
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,976
May you find love, too!

216
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:18,262
Do you... remember me?

217
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,546
Look.

218
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,802
This is your fault.

219
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,229
It's you who did this.

220
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,984
He didn't take the money.

221
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,252
Me... I always wanted to be a tiger.

222
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:17,646
Simon?

223
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,140
Yeah, it's me.

224
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,859
Where were you?

225
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,612
Why were you gone for so long?

226
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,332
You OK?

227
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,025
What are you doing?

228
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:18,457
Make love to me.

229
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,500
<i>Rene.
Leave me a message after the beep.</i>

230
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,023
Thank you. Goodbye.

231
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,489
<i>René.
Leave me a...</i>

232
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:28,413
<i>Rene.
Leave me a message after the beep.</i>

233
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,132
<i>Rene.
Leave me a message after the beep.</i>

234
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:56,017
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I am.

235
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,432
<i>Why didn't you come home last night?</i>

236
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,641
<i>Who are you with?</i>

237
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:26,819
<i>What friend?</i>

238
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:11,944
One second.

239
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,189
Not now, sir!

240
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,498
It's fun having coffee with you!

241
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,377
I'm just kidding.

242
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,017
Where were you last night?

243
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,808
Why didn't you come home?

244
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,138
You disgust me.

245
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,322
Get the fuck out.

246
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,118
You're a piece of shit.

247
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:04,578
And you lie.

248
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,637
That's right, leave.
You're pathetic.

249
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,805
And take your money.

250
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,132
Take it.

251
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,642
Look at yourself, look...

252
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,227
You're a coward.

253
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,237
You're not a man.

254
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:46,287
You know, we get what we deserve.

255
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:11,309
I never asked you for anything, Simon.

256
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,185
I was just fine as I was.

257
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:25,739
I called.

258
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:32,042
You understood me.

259
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:51,562
<i>Happy birthday to you,</i>

260
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:55,319
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

261
01:34:55,940 --> 01:35:00,696
<i>Happy birthday, Carlo...</i>

262
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,543
Thank you, thank you!

263
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,677
Carlo, someone's here to see you.

264
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:27,138
What are you doing here?

265
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:37,573
You OK?

266
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:55,584
Let me introduce you.
He's the son of my mother's friend.

267
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,009
Sort of my American cousin.

268
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,837
- Hi.
- Hi.

269
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,724
Excuse me.

270
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,897
- Have a nice evening.
- You, too.

271
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:26,118
I was putting him up for a while and...

272
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,541
He didn't stay long.

273
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:39,060
OK, it's fine.

274
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,432
You can go.

275
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:42,475
Go on.
