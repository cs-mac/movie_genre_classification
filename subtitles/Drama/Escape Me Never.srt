1
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,080
And here we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:23,583
in 1900,
standing on the very spot

3
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:26,586
where Desdemona first met
Othello many centuries ago.

4
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,089
Venice-Queen of the Adriatic.

5
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
Venice-the city of silence.

6
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:35,095
That cannon,
ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,099
is fired off every day to
indicate the noon hour.

8
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:42,602
Every day in Venice at noon,
you hear, boom.

9
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,604
In Venice,

10
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,608
there are 177 canals
measuring 28 miles,

11
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:52,612
and there are 156 bridges
connecting 114 islands.

12
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:56,616
And there is the great
Church of St. Mark.

13
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:59,619
The Church of St. Mark
was begun in 830,

14
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:02,622
but was not finished
until the 15th century.

15
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,625
There are
more than 500 marble columns

16
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,129
in the Church of St. Mark.

17
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:14,134
The mosaic work covers an
area of 45,970 square feet,

18
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,637
and the interior is completely
produced and decorated...

19
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,175
Are you finished, Caryl?

20
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,676
Yes. Until 7:00.

21
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,179
You're a darling
to have waited so long.

22
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:00,680
I didn't mind.

23
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:03,683
You know, you must be
made of strawberry ices.

24
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,686
Oh... did you ask Ilanti for
an increase in salary?

25
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,188
Yes. And he said no.

26
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:10,190
Then you shouldn't
be working here.

27
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:11,691
Darling, you're a genius.

28
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:14,194
Oh, please don't say that,
Fenella. I'm not a genius.

29
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,695
If you persist in thinking I am,

30
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,697
you're going to be
terribly disappointed.

31
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:22,202
Photographs of the big fair
and party, friends,

32
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,704
celebrating the opening
of the 20th century.

33
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,705
Photograph?

34
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,207
No, thank you.

35
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,708
I've got an idea.

36
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:31,211
Why don't you give a concert
of your own in a hall?

37
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,713
That's what I want to do,
but that takes money.

38
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:36,216
Don't you know some rich
person who'd sponsor you?

39
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,718
Even if I did, he mightn't
consider me a good investment.

40
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,720
Oh, silly, you'd be a wonderful investment.

41
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:42,222
Caryl Dubrok-

42
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:44,224
The son of the great composer.
- Alfred Dubrok.

43
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:47,227
Why, any sensible sponsor
would jump at the chance.

44
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:48,728
Grazie mille.

45
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,234
I know. Professor Heinrich.

46
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,735
Professor Heinrich?

47
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,238
Of course. Why didn't
we think of him before?

48
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:00,240
Professor Heinrich is
not only your friend.

49
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,242
He was your father's as well.

50
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,244
I'll ask him to arrange
a concert for you.

51
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,745
He's at home now.

52
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,259
No, I'm sure he wouldn't
consider me talented enough to bother with.

53
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:09,749
He'd be embarrassed,
and so would I.

54
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,751
Very well. If you
want to be stubborn.

55
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,764
I'm not stubborn.
It's simply a case of-

56
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,256
Then there's only one
thing left for us to do,

57
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,757
and that is to get married.

58
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,259
Married?

59
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:21,261
Of course. Papa and
Mama know we're in love.

60
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,773
And our marriage would solve everything.

61
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,264
How?

62
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,765
Don't be silly.

63
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,267
The Maclean money.

64
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,768
And the Dubrok genius.

65
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,270
No. No, Fenella.

66
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,305
Caryl...

67
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
What, darling?

68
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:35,275
Don't you want us to be married?

69
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,777
You know I do, Fenella. More
than anything in the world.

70
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:40,280
That's why I'm saving my money.

71
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:43,783
In a year's time, I'll have saved
enough to give a concert in Milan.

72
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,285
Then if I'm a success, we-

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,299
Look here, though, I shan't be able to save
anything if we always ride in gondolas.

74
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,604
I mean, wouldn't we get to your
house sooner if we walked?

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
The canal is so roundabout.

76
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,294
I don't want to get home
sooner, as you put it.

77
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:55,795
This is Wednesday, you know.

78
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,297
Wednesday?

79
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,799
Yes. That's why I don't
want to go home early.

80
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,303
I don't understand.

81
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,805
Well, I, Fenella Maclean,
am at present residing

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,808
in the Neroni Palace in Venice,

83
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,310
which is a famous city of Italy.

84
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,312
All of Venice is famous,

85
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,314
and the Neroni Palace
is especially famous.

86
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,316
It's very old and smelly.

87
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,818
It contains on the lower floor

88
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,820
priceless paintings
and frescoes.

89
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,323
The Macleans occupy
quarters on the second floor.

90
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:24,824
And on Wednesdays,

91
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,328
The public is admitted to the
art treasures of the palace.

92
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
Little barbarians.

93
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,868
Giggling females.

94
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,381
Good afternoon, Herr Heinrich.

95
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,871
Good afternoon.

96
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,373
My dear.

97
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,379
This schoolgirl visitation
gets worse every week.

98
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:22,382
The place is fairly swarming
with the little wretches.

99
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,884
But it does give the
palace a certain atmosphere.

100
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,886
You must admit that, Ivor.

101
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
I don't want atmosphere. I want peace.

102
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
Here, darling. Drink your tea.

103
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
And your rehearsals,
Herr Heinrich,

104
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:34,894
are they going well?

105
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,396
Rather well, yes.

106
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:39,399
But I miss my own orchestra.

107
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:43,403
It will be a relief
to get back to London.

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,907
Let me go. Let go.

109
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,409
Let me go.

110
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,412
Let me go, or I'll crack
your shins for you.

111
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:53,913
Let me go.

112
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
Giuseppe, who is that young person?

113
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,917
It's a thief, Signor Maclean.

114
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,919
We found her in the
Signorina's bedroom.

115
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:02,422
A thief, huh? Bring her in.

116
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,924
Let me alone. Let me alone.

117
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,427
Giuseppe, you may wait outside.

118
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,445
Oh, stop her. She'll
jump in the canal.

119
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,449
Yes, I will if you don't
let me alone, you ninnies.

120
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:32,452
Why all the fuss? I'm no thief.

121
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:35,455
Then what were you
doing in my daughter's room?

122
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,458
Oh. Was it your daughter's?

123
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:41,961
She has a lot of
clothes, hasn't she?

124
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
Well?

125
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
I was hiding.

126
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:47,967
Hiding? From whom?

127
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,469
The schoolgirls.

128
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:50,981
Then the teachers began to call roll,

129
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,472
and I had to skip.

130
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:54,474
You see, I'm not a schoolgirl.

131
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,476
But why did you
join them at all?

132
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,478
To get something to eat.

133
00:07:58,513 --> 00:07:59,513
To eat?

134
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,481
Yes. You see, it's this way.

135
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:02,982
These school groups visit

136
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,984
the museums and stuffy
old places like this.

137
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,487
Then afterward, they
go to a shop for tea,

138
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,489
and I go along and eat with them

139
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,491
if they don't find me out first.

140
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:12,992
It's a good arrangement.

141
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,495
It works out
very well, generally.

142
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,998
But you mean you've done
this sort of thing before?

143
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,000
I do it all the time.

144
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,502
But that's stealing.

145
00:08:22,537 --> 00:08:26,005
Aha. Someone has been
cheating at solitaire.

146
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,009
There's a red 8 on a red 9.

147
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:32,011
Cheating a bit at solitaire is

148
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,524
quite different from stealing, my girl.

149
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:36,516
Yes, it is. You have
no need to cheat at cards.

150
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:39,018
But sometimes,
I do have to steal food.

151
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,020
Oh, hello.

152
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:43,022
So your present costume
was merely put on

153
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,524
for the occasion, right?

154
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,527
You are a clever old
verwandte, aren't you?

155
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,028
What does she mean - verwandte?

156
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,030
It's difficult to translate,

157
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,532
fortunately.

158
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,034
Young woman, I shall call the police

159
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,036
unless you confine yourself to English

160
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
and sensible English at that.

161
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,040
If you call the police,

162
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,042
I shall tell them
you cheat at solitaire.

163
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,545
Now, then, what is your name?

164
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,546
Gemma.

165
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:07,547
Gemma what?

166
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:09,048
Gemma Smith.

167
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,553
You don't like Smith? Then
my name is Gemma Porloniovsky.

168
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:15,054
However, it's really Smith.

169
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,556
But you're English.

170
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,559
I was born of an English
father and a Hungarian mother

171
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:21,561
on a Dutch ship on the high seas.

172
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:24,063
But as soon as
we made port, they put my father in prison.

173
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,065
For fathering you?

174
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,067
No. For killing a man.

175
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,068
What?

176
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,069
Yes.

177
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:33,072
And later on, my mother
committed suicide.

178
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:35,074
And-and then?

179
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,775
Oh... nothing much. Grew up with
relatives of my mother.

180
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
Decided I didn't care
for them and ran away.

181
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,081
But how did you get to Venice?

182
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
On a wine cart from Padua.

183
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,585
But the driver wasn't a nice man.

184
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,587
And as soon as we came
to the edge of the city,

185
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,088
he kicked me off.

186
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,091
And in Venice, what did you do?

187
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,594
I went to a hospital,
a free one.

188
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,596
Oh, were you ill?

189
00:09:56,631 --> 00:10:00,099
No. No, I felt fine.
But I was having a baby.

190
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:03,102
Perhaps you would like
me to tell you about it.

191
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:05,104
Thank you. We shan't go into that.

192
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,106
Oh, but the baby is wonderful.

193
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:10,109
I call him Piccolo
because he is so little.

194
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:13,112
This, uh, child, did it
have a father?

195
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
What do you think?

196
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,116
Certainly, it did.

197
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:20,620
The father was my husband...
for a while.

198
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:22,622
He is dead now.

199
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,123
Oh, dear.

200
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,125
Yes.

201
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,128
Well, that's about all.

202
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,631
Venice... my baby,

203
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,633
me discharged from the hospital

204
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:37,136
with no strength in my bones
and no money in my stocking.

205
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,639
But it all came out all right.

206
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:42,141
I'm like a cat.
I always land on my feet.

207
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,644
You know, inside of a day,
I'd fainted in the street,

208
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,646
and there my friend found me.

209
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,148
The baby and I are staying
with him for a moment.

210
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,150
And this friend of yours, is he-

211
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,152
Oh, no. He has no money either.

212
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:56,155
That's why I go about with the schools.
To get food for us.

213
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,158
This so-called
friend, who is he?

214
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:02,161
Young musician.
His name is Dubrok.

215
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:03,663
Oh!

216
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:06,165
Yes, he's the son of Albert Dubrok.
The composer.

217
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,668
A famous father, but the son,

218
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:11,671
weren't a much smaller bush
if you ask me. However he might-

219
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:13,172
You may go.

220
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,674
You mean it?

221
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,175
I do, indeed.

222
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,677
Please go at once.

223
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:19,178
Oh, all right.

224
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,218
Arrivederci.

225
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,193
Thank heavens
Fenella wasn't here.

226
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,696
By the way, where is she?

227
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:39,699
She... she's out with Mr. Dubrok.

228
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,701
Hello, everybody.

229
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,203
I have news for you.

230
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,205
Oh, I'm so glad you're here,
Professor Heinrich.

231
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Darling.

232
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
Mama, papa.

233
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:50,209
Fenella, listen to me.

234
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,211
No. You listen to me, Papa.

235
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,714
I have a wonderful
surprise, and it won't keep.

236
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:56,716
I'm going to marry Caryl Dubrok.

237
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,718
Great scott. What did you say?

238
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:01,220
She said she's going
to marry Caryl Dubrok.

239
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,222
No, darling.
You couldn't possibly.

240
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,724
The fellow's a scoundrel.

241
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,225
We're leaving Venice at once.

242
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,235
It's just as well.
One can't trust it.

243
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,238
You know, the whole idea of fetching
a train in a boat is ridiculous.

244
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,240
I can't get used to it.

245
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,275
How are you?

246
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,746
Fenella, I...

247
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,248
What's happening? Are
your parents going away?

248
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,751
Yes. And I'm going with them.

249
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:32,786
You're what?

250
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,253
Fenella, come along.

251
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
I can't marry you, Caryl.

252
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,258
But why not?

253
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:40,760
Because of Gemma.

254
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,767
Gemma? Gemma?

255
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
But who is Gemma?

256
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,273
Ask Professor Heinrich.

257
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,278
Fenella, please wait a moment.

258
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,781
Really, I don't know any Gemma.

259
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,283
I've never even heard of such a person.

260
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,285
You've got to believe me.

261
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,787
Fenella...

262
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,793
Look, Professor, I don't know any Gemma.

263
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:16,295
I've never even heard of such a person.

264
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,297
You've got to believe me.

265
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,299
I do. The trouble is

266
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,301
the Macleans prefer
to believe Gemma.

267
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,803
That's why they are taking

268
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,805
their daughter out
to the Dolomites.

269
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,309
The parents would have
objected to you in any case.

270
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,812
They don't like musicians.

271
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,313
Musicians are not practical.

272
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,315
They don't make money.

273
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,317
Fenella doesn't care
about money.

274
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,820
Rich people
are always saying that,

275
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:43,322
but they don't really mean it.

276
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:44,824
Which way, Signore?

277
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,325
Diritto.

278
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Diritto? Bene.

279
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,831
Listen.

280
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,836
Oh, it's an original tune

281
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,337
and rather diverting.

282
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,340
Why, that's one of
my father's things,

283
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,455
and that concertina's mine.

284
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
It is your concertina?

285
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:06,846
Yes. I loaned it to
Sebastian in Milan last year.

286
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:08,848
Don't you see? That must be

287
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:10,861
my brother Sebastian
playing the concertina up there.

288
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,351
Gondolier, stop.

289
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
The music's coming
from that upper window,

290
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,857
the one with the white rags
hanging out over the ledge.

291
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:22,361
Your so-called white rags are
baby napkins, my young friend.

292
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,863
What do you mean?

293
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:25,364
They're Gemma's.

294
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,371
Gemma, huh?

295
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:01,400
Piccolo, there is positively
no boy soprano part

296
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:02,902
in this composition,

297
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
so shut up!

298
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
Thank you.

299
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,924
I knew it.

300
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,925
Oh, hello.

301
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,426
Look here, Sebastian-

302
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:28,461
I'm glad you dropped in.

303
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,940
There's something
I want you to hear.

304
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,441
I've got something
I want you to hear.

305
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:32,465
Listen.

306
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:36,435
You've upset my applecart
again, haven't you?

307
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,437
Have I? It must be

308
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,940
a very poorly balanced
applecart to upset so easily.

309
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,441
Besides, how could I?

310
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,443
I haven't seen you since Milan.

311
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,445
Do you know a girl named Gemma?

312
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,448
Also, her brat.

313
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:54,954
He's a cute little
fella, isn't he?

314
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,455
Mm-hmm.

315
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,958
Oh, no, thanks.

316
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,460
I create music. It's Gemma's.

317
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,963
Would you be so kind as
to explain who Gemma is?

318
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:05,965
Certainly. I found her wandering around

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,466
in the streets one day,

320
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,968
sort of starving
and so on, you know,

321
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:10,970
so I thought the only humane thing to do

322
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,972
was to take her in, so I did.

323
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:14,473
Very noble of you.

324
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:15,975
It certainly was,

325
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,490
considering the state of my finances.

326
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
Uh, by the way-

327
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:20,980
Not a lira.

328
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,983
Loaning you money is like
feeding straws to a fire.

329
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
What's that you're whistling?

330
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,995
This little song I'm writing.

331
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,497
Gemma has got
a pretty nice voice.

332
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,000
I thought she might sing it some day.

333
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,035
Here. Take a look.

334
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
"Escape Me Never."

335
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,006
Mm-hmm. Words by Browning,

336
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,508
With slight additions
by Sebastian Dubrok.

337
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
Escape me never.

338
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:56,015
My beloved-

339
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,517
While I am I.

340
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,020
And you are you.

341
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:03,533
Of course, I'm not letting Gemma know
she's got voice enough to sing it.

342
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,524
You know how women are.

343
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,503
Once they begin to think they're
important, they get absolutely out of hand.

344
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,540
From what I've heard of Gemma,
she's already out of hand.

345
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,031
Why? Do you know her?

346
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,532
No. But she forced her way

347
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,034
into the Neroni
Palace yesterday,

348
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,036
and the palace happens to be

349
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:18,548
in the residence of
some friends of mine-

350
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,539
Mr. And Mrs. Maclean
and Miss Maclean.

351
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,541
And your precious
Gemma told them

352
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,543
she was living with a
musician named Dubrok,

353
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,046
so naturally, they
assumed it was me.

354
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,547
They-they thought I-

355
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,084
Oh, shut up.

356
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
Oh, that's very funny.

357
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,057
Hey, Gemma.

358
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
Signore.

359
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:42,561
Is your name Gemma?

360
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,564
If it is, you've put on
a bit of weight.

361
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,566
Gemma.

362
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,069
Yeah?

363
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,104
Huh?

364
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
Come on up.

365
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,075
Something's happened.
Come on up quick.

366
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,576
I'll be there in a minute.

367
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:59,091
All right, everybody to the fountain.

368
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,579
I'm in a hurry. Come on.

369
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
You must go now, Signorina.

370
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:16,095
Maybe someday, you will not have to go.

371
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,596
That would be nice.

372
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
All of us here feel the same way.

373
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,603
I know I'm older than you, and I'm fat,

374
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,605
but perhaps there's other things.

375
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,607
If you were my wife,

376
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,610
you will have all the
bread you want to eat

377
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,112
and love and 5 little ones.

378
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,616
You think 5 too many?

379
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:42,121
Ah, but everyone must have
at least 5, to be happy.

380
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,622
You marry me,

381
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:47,126
and you get 5 all at
once without no trouble.

382
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,627
Signorina, if you could-

383
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,630
Dino, can we talk
about it later, huh?

384
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,632
Antonino.

385
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,641
Up.

386
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:05,144
Ah, thank you, Antonino.

387
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,179
Thank you.

388
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
Piccolo.

389
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,654
Don't worry. He's all right.

390
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,156
Nothing wrong with him.

391
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,158
Gemma, hey.

392
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:20,233
Behold my brother - Caryl.

393
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
The fool of the family, huh?

394
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:23,696
But he's in trouble.

395
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,164
You remember that palazzo

396
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
you went barging into yesterday?

397
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,667
Mm-hmm. What about it?

398
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,669
The family are friends of Caryl's.

399
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,171
Ahem, especially the daughter.

400
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,675
You have no right
to laugh at Fenella.

401
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,677
You've never even seen her.

402
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,180
Nevertheless, I know
exactly what she's like.

403
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:44,183
She's the kind that is
always taking cold baths.

404
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,686
And she's frightfully
keen on croquet, you know,

405
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:50,689
and the only perfume she
ever uses is cologne water.

406
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,691
Why don't you be quiet?

407
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:55,194
But she has nice gloves.
Just my size.

408
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,196
You stole those gloves
from Fenella.

409
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,198
Of course. And what if I did?

410
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,699
Give them to me.

411
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,701
No. You try and get them.

412
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:06,705
Sebastian.

413
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
No.

414
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:15,214
You know... I like you.

415
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,216
Well, I don't like you.

416
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,218
How Sebastian can stand
having you around

417
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,220
I can't, for the life of me, see.

418
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:22,721
I am going.

419
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,723
Wait. Is she really
your sweetheart?

420
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:27,226
She was until you spoiled it.

421
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,227
Aw.

422
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:29,728
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:33,232
I had no idea you were
more than friends with her.

424
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:35,234
I shouldn't have laughed
a moment ago.

425
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,746
Why don't you just go to this Fenella

426
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,737
and knock some sense into her?

427
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,739
Being a woman, she'll
love you all the more.

428
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:41,740
She's gone.

429
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,242
Left Venice, you mean?

430
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,243
Yes.

431
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,744
Where did she go?

432
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,246
To the Dolomites.

433
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:48,747
What will you do?

434
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm going to find her and tell
her about you and Sebastian.

435
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,251
Bravo. That's the stuff.

436
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,752
And I'll go with you.

437
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,254
Oh, no, you won't.

438
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,766
You better not go alone. I know women.

439
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,258
She'll never believe
you. You need a witness.

440
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:00,759
The Dolomites, yes.

441
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,261
We'll take my concertina

442
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:03,762
and set out immediately.

443
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,265
We'll cross valleys, climb mountains,

444
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
sing for our supper

445
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,768
in every swank hotel until you find her.

446
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:11,270
What do you say?

447
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,772
But it's not the way to
do it. It's not dignified.

448
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,274
Digni...

449
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,276
Oh... if she had wanted
someone dignified,

450
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,278
she could have had
her pick of them at home.

451
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,779
But, no,

452
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:23,782
she took you because you
are the opposite sort of person

453
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:25,784
her parents
would have chosen for her.

454
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,787
Besides, think how pleased she'll
be to have you come after her.

455
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:30,789
That's what a woman
really wants-

456
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:34,293
to be needed, pursued,
made to feel that she's-

457
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:36,295
Oh, what do you know about it?

458
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,796
I need a holiday,

459
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:40,299
and the Dolomites are
just the place for it.

460
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:41,800
Stop grumbling. It's all settled.

461
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:44,803
Very well. Come along if you've
got the money for your train fare.

462
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:47,306
Train fare? What do
we need train fare for?

463
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,308
We're going a piedi, on
foot, shanks' mare.

464
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:51,310
What's the matter with
you? Can't you walk?

465
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:52,311
Are you a cripple?

466
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:53,812
All right.

467
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:54,813
Good.

468
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,315
Yes, it'll be wonderful.

469
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,817
We'll eat wild
strawberries with our lunch

470
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,321
and sit under the pine
trees when we are tired

471
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,822
and pick edelweiss
and alpenrosen.

472
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,324
But you're not coming.

473
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,328
Well, what I mean is

474
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:12,831
somebody's got to stay here
and take care of Piccolo.

475
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,333
After all,

476
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:15,834
this jaunt of ours might be

477
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:19,338
nothing but, well,
a wild goose chase.

478
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,340
You can't haul a little baby.

479
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,841
Don't you think?

480
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,852
Caryl, what time is it?

481
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,856
Oh, that's the watch father
gave you, isn't it?

482
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:38,857
Yes.

483
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:41,360
Mm-hmm. Gold, too, eh?

484
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,861
Oh, no, you don't.

485
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:45,864
It's the last valuable
thing I own, and I won't part with it.

486
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,366
What? Do you mean to tell me

487
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,379
that you'd allow a miserable gold watch

488
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:50,869
to stand between you and Fenella?

489
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,383
Come on, we're going to need
a little dinero, aren't we?

490
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,374
I'll pawn it first thing in the morning,

491
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:56,875
and in return,

492
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,388
I shall bring you together with Fenella.

493
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:00,379
You shall be wed and go to live

494
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:01,880
in a little green-shuttered house.

495
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,382
Of course, there's a hitch.

496
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,883
You'll have to make
a living for her.

497
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,385
I'll expect to.

498
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,387
Don't worry. She'll expect you to.

499
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:09,899
Every morning you
leave the little house,

500
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,890
you'll have an attaché case

501
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,392
full of contracts and music,

502
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,894
and Fenella will be upstairs
waving good-bye to you.

503
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,896
And then after you
have children-

504
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:19,909
Oh, stow it. How do you know
so much about my future?

505
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,900
Because I know your past.

506
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:24,403
But it'll be a pretty good life for you.

507
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:27,906
Why wouldn't it be a
good one for you, as well?

508
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,412
My dear, Gemma, Caryl is
the nice, dependable sort,

509
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,414
solid from tip to toe.

510
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,916
I only wish I were like him.

511
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,918
I'll bet you do.

512
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,420
But I never shall be.

513
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
I'm what the lady poets
call a free spirit.

514
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,924
Meaning a selfish pig-

515
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,927
about everything but your music.

516
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:50,429
Uh-huh. Ah, but honest about it.

517
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,930
Don't you think?

518
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:57,436
Funny little codger, isn't she?

519
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:58,937
Good-bye, Gemma.

520
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,946
My little Piccolo,

521
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:09,948
My pupazzetto,

522
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,951
I still have you, haven't I?

523
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:14,453
For a while, I have.

524
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,956
But in a few years,

525
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:21,960
you'll grow up to be
a big strong handsome man,

526
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,962
who makes some woman very unhappy.

527
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,967
Oh, so sweet.

528
00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:32,971
You'll make her
happy at first, no doubt,

529
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,475
but in the end,
it'll be the same story.

530
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,976
Yes, it will.

531
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,001
Oh, it's all right, yes.

532
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:06,004
It's all right, Piccolo.

533
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,007
Yes, it's all right, my Piccolo.

534
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,525
I thought Piccolo would have
a feather to wake up with.

535
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,027
He gets a lot of fun out of it.

536
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,035
I suppose you don't
like being left behind.

537
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,539
I don't mind at all.

538
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,541
You shouldn't.

539
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,045
You'll be all right here, won't you?

540
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,047
Perfectly.

541
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,055
But Dino has asked me
to marry him.

542
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,057
I think I'll do it.

543
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:00,092
You'll what?

544
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,562
Marry Dino.

545
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,065
In the name of Piccolo?

546
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,569
What for?

547
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,573
Well, it would be a
very good arrangement.

548
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,075
I could take care
of his children,

549
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,578
and he could take care
of Piccolo and me.

550
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,079
Why, that's absolutely nonsense.

551
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,082
I never heard anything so ridiculous.

552
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:27,586
You ought to be pleased
to get rid of me.

553
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,588
Maybe I should, at that.

554
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,089
Very well.

555
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,150
Then there's nothing
further to discuss.

556
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,096
You'll go your way,
and I'll go mine.

557
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:41,099
And we shall both be free
as we were before...

558
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,103
and Dino will be kind to me,

559
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:47,105
much kinder than
you've ever been.

560
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,608
So, he's been kind
to you, has he?

561
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:52,611
Why, that fat bread peddler.

562
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:55,614
I suppose the next thing
you'll be telling me,

563
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:57,115
He calls you his coricino.

564
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,117
I can hear him now.

565
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:01,620
"Ah, signorina, I love you."

566
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,627
Shut your mouth.

567
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:11,129
I don't understand
your wretched Italian.

568
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:13,632
You don't? Then
I'll translate it.

569
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,134
"Without you, my love...

570
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,138
without you on my arm, I cannot live."

571
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,647
But enough.

572
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,659
Come to think of it...

573
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:44,663
you don't sing as much through
your nose as you used to.

574
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,164
You might be useful.

575
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,167
Caryl can play the concertina,

576
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:52,170
and you and I
can do the singing.

577
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:56,675
But what would I do with Piccolo?

578
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,177
Piccolo? Put him in an orphanage.

579
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:00,679
He's not an orphan.

580
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,681
Well, all right.

581
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,185
I can live with it.
Take him along.

582
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,688
The mountain air would be good for him.

583
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,691
Good for you, too.

584
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,696
Wouldn't it?

585
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,701
All right. Then it's settled.

586
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,711
Dino.

587
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,224
Piccolo, Piccolo,

588
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,727
We are going with him, yes.

589
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,236
Behold-the Dolomites-

590
00:28:58,271 --> 00:28:59,738
a region named

591
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:01,250
for the famous french geologist Dolomieu

592
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:02,741
because it was he

593
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,743
who made them known to the world.

594
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:07,245
I wish he'd made them less steep.

595
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,247
How much farther is it to Orzano?

596
00:29:09,282 --> 00:29:10,749
Oh, about a kilometer.

597
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,751
Orzano tonight.
Tomorrow night, Martino.

598
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:14,753
She may have left Martino.

599
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:17,255
Heinrich's letter said they'd
be there until Wednesday.

600
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,257
They might have changed
their plans.

601
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:22,761
Oh... here. You carry Piccolo
for a while.

602
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:25,263
That'll give you
something to worry about.

603
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,267
Great scott, Piccolo. You're
getting heavier every day.

604
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,768
Naturally.

605
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,777
Look, Sebastian, edelweiss.

606
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,781
Isn't it beautiful?

607
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:43,816
Mm-hmm.

608
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,283
She loves me.

609
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:46,785
She loves me not.

610
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,286
No, don't. You'll ruin it.

611
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,290
Oh, come on.
You're wasting time.

612
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,792
We're not wasting time.

613
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,293
We're enjoying ourselves.

614
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,295
Don't tease him. He's
unhappy without his Fenella.

615
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,297
Just because he's unhappy,

616
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:00,852
he wants everybody else to be unhappy.

617
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,801
Come along, Monsieur le Duc.

618
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,302
We have to find Caryl's lady love.

619
00:30:04,337 --> 00:30:06,304
Then he won't be so cross.
Come on.

620
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,806
Come, follow, follow, follow.

621
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:08,807
Follow, follow.

622
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,308
Follow me...

623
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:12,310
Come, follow, follow, follow.

624
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:14,312
Follow, follow, follow me...

625
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:16,314
Come, follow, follow, follow.

626
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,316
Come, follow, follow me...

627
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:20,318
Come, follow, follow, follow.

628
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:20,819
Follow, follow.

629
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,320
Follow me...

630
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:24,322
Come, follow, follow, follow.

631
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:25,824
Follow, follow, follow me.

632
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,325
Oh, Sebastian, I think

633
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,327
we had better find another way.

634
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,330
Why? Afraid of getting
your feet wet? Go on.

635
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:34,833
Wait until I take my shoes off.

636
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,835
Oh!

637
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,337
You know, I think it might be deep.

638
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:40,839
Well, you go first,

639
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,341
then if you sink,
we'll know it is.

640
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:44,843
Come on, come on.

641
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,855
Come on, Monsieur le Duc.

642
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,857
Shove, Caryl.

643
00:30:58,892 --> 00:30:59,892
Pull.

644
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,362
Piccolo, Piccolo!

645
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:06,865
What are you trying to do,
drown my baby?

646
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,870
Piccolo. Aw, Piccolo.

647
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:13,371
Oh.

648
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,374
I'm sorry, Caryl.

649
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,376
Does it hurt very much?

650
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:19,878
I can walk.

651
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:21,880
It can't be very far now.

652
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,887
Grüße, fraulein.

653
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,388
Grüß gott.

654
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,390
I wonder if you could tell us,

655
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,392
how far is it to Orzano, please?

656
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,894
Just a few kilometers.

657
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:38,396
You'll see it around the turn.

658
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:40,899
Uh-huh. And what about
lodgings-cheap ones?

659
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:43,902
Oh, there's an inn there that's
very cheap and also very good.

660
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:45,904
Just this side of the hotel.

661
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,405
Zumkefeldzen, it's called.

662
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,918
Well, that's very kind of you, indeed.

663
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:50,408
And may I say

664
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,922
that if all the natives of the
Dolomites are as charming as you,

665
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:54,412
our travels will be
most pleasant?

666
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:56,915
Oh, for heaven's sake,
Sebastian.

667
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,919
Auf wiedersehen.

668
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,938
There it is-

669
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:21,439
big as life and twice as wonderful.

670
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,450
Caryl, take this to the landlady

671
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:34,452
and ask her to fill
it with warm milk, huh?

672
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:35,487
All right.

673
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,957
Oh, don't take that off, Sebastian.

674
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,959
It's his good luck charm.

675
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:41,960
This?

676
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:43,962
Mm-hmm.

677
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:45,964
Hey, be careful.
That's valuable.

678
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:46,965
Valuable?

679
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,966
Yes.

680
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,467
It's a composition-my father's,

681
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,970
signed by his own hand. Look.

682
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,472
Boy, I could sell this
for a barrelful of money.

683
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,974
Then why don't you.

684
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,074
I'm keeping it for
something to shoot at.

685
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,478
Ah, he was a master of melody.
The old man.

686
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:03,481
You do better than that.

687
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:04,482
Hmm?

688
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:06,484
You're a master of everything,

689
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,986
but nothing ever masters you.

690
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,504
Miss-uh, madam, I think
it's just warm enough.

691
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,006
Danke schön, frau Huber.

692
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,511
I'll take care of your knee
in a moment, Caryl.

693
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,516
Piccolo, look.

694
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,527
Hmm...

695
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:51,529
pretty good...

696
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,532
for the price.

697
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,534
Sebastian, better
get over to the hotel

698
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,536
and see if they'll
let us sing tonight, huh?

699
00:33:58,571 --> 00:33:59,537
All right.

700
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:01,539
Wait until I make myself seductive.

701
00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:03,541
Hmm, you must expect the
manager to be a woman.

702
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:06,044
No, but he'll probably have a wife.

703
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,546
See if the hotel orchestra
will help us out.

704
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:10,048
It'll make a better concert.

705
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,550
That way, we can expect
a fee from the manager

706
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:14,552
on top of what we collect
from the guests.

707
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:16,054
Will you remember?

708
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:19,057
Mm-hmm. You know, you two
are lucky to have me along.

709
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:20,558
We've landed a concert engagement

710
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:22,560
every night since we left Venice.

711
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,562
Don't take all the credit for that.

712
00:34:24,597 --> 00:34:28,066
You've had to use Gemma's baby
to clinch the deal more than once.

713
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,568
Well, how do I look?

714
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:34,072
Uh, like a duke in disguise.

715
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,074
What? Only a duke? Wow.

716
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:38,576
Oh, yes, you better
wear this tonight.

717
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:41,079
It's quite becoming. It
makes you look like a woman.

718
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:42,580
Well, arrivederci, children.

719
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:45,083
And don't forget to
keep the door locked.

720
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:47,085
There may be dragons in the forest.

721
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,116
Let's see.

722
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,121
Yes, it's a bad bruise,
all right.

723
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,622
Gemma.

724
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:28,126
You think this is going
to be too tight, huh?

725
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:29,627
Gemma.

726
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:33,131
You really are in love
with him, aren't you?

727
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,166
Ah.

728
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,136
He's a dreadful man.

729
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:40,638
That girl we met on the bike,

730
00:35:40,673 --> 00:35:43,141
he could never expect
to see her again,

731
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:46,144
oh, but he had to spread
his charm on her

732
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:48,146
like jam on a piece of bread.

733
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,148
He does it all the time.

734
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:53,151
He's probably ogling some
woman at this very moment.

735
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:54,652
He just can't help it.

736
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,654
He's always been like that.

737
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:58,656
Now, you lie down and make
yourself comfortable.

738
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:00,658
I have to get Piccolo
ready for bed.

739
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,165
Women are nothing but
parsley to Sebastian.

740
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,167
Music, that's his meat.

741
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:10,668
I know.

742
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:13,171
That's the only thing
in this whole world

743
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:15,173
that he's really unselfish about.

744
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,178
It's a pity you don't
care more for music.

745
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:22,180
But I have the baby.

746
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:26,684
You know, Caryl, Piccolo
actually belongs to me.

747
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,686
He's my music

748
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:31,689
and much more wonderful than
anything Sebastian could ever write.

749
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:33,691
I still think it's a pity

750
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:36,194
you don't care more for his music.

751
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:38,196
What difference does it make?

752
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:40,698
Does a wife have to be-

753
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:42,200
I mean a woman-

754
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:45,203
mad about the profession
of the man she loves?

755
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:46,238
Is that necessary?

756
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,206
No. I suppose not.

757
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:50,208
I could take care of him-

758
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:51,709
cook for him, mend,

759
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:53,211
keep him well,

760
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:55,713
see that he worked when he should.

761
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,715
That's important, isn't it?

762
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,717
We could be happy together.

763
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:02,720
Except that it wouldn't be fair to you.

764
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:04,222
Sebastian's wife will have

765
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:06,724
a rather unpleasant
time of it, I imagine.

766
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:09,227
My dear Caryl, do
you expect love to be pleasant?

767
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:11,229
Has it been pleasant for you?

768
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:12,730
Is your Fenella perfect?

769
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:13,765
Practically. Yes.

770
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,239
Parsley. I don't even
mean that much to him.

771
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:23,241
But... ah, but surely-

772
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:25,243
No. It's not what you think, Caryl.

773
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:28,246
A pat on the head,
an occasional hug,

774
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:29,747
absent-minded kiss now and then.

775
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,760
That's all that's
ever been between us,

776
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:33,251
and it's not enough.

777
00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:36,254
I want more than that.
I want my share of love.

778
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:38,256
I want him to be my husband.

779
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,757
Your brother's a beast.

780
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,759
He seems to think I have
no feelings whatsoever,

781
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,761
no blood in my veins,

782
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:45,274
no need to be happy like other women.

783
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:47,765
I hate him.

784
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:51,780
Caryl, I think you had better stay
home tonight with that knee.

785
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:54,272
Then you can take care
of the baby for me.

786
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:57,775
All right, if you and
Sebastian can manage without me.

787
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,810
Of course, we can.

788
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,778
Piccolo...

789
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:04,282
did you hear what he
said about my dress?

790
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:07,785
You know, he's never really
noticed my clothes before.

791
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,288
That's because I've never
had anything stylish,

792
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,790
and I wouldn't have had this time

793
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:16,294
if I hadn't bought the
stuff and made it myself.

794
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:19,297
And it'll look even
better in the moonlight,

795
00:38:19,332 --> 00:38:20,798
because after the concert,

796
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:24,302
we'll walk home together,
and I'll take his arm,

797
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:27,305
and perhaps he'll
say more nice things,

798
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,308
but not about
my dress, about me.

799
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,811
Perhaps he'll even tell me

800
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:36,814
he's in love with me, huh?

801
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,351
We'll see you later.

802
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,353
Thank you.

803
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,855
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

804
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,358
And now for your pleasure...

805
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:22,360
for your pleasure,

806
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:26,864
a song- "Love for Love."

807
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,378
'Promise me.

808
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:44,382
Love for love.

809
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,883
And I'm yours.

810
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:52,390
Till the end of time.

811
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:56,894
Love is a wondrous adventure.

812
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:00,898
Something that
no one should miss.

813
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,403
If you want me, darling.

814
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:07,405
Take me.

815
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:12,910
All that I ask is this.

816
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:19,417
Give me love for love.

817
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,420
Nothing more.

818
00:40:22,455 --> 00:40:25,423
Nothing less.

819
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:30,428
Don't promise me the moon.

820
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:33,431
Leave the stars.

821
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:38,436
Where they are.

822
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:43,441
Give me just your heart.

823
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:46,944
Say it's mine.

824
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:51,449
Only mine.

825
00:40:51,484 --> 00:40:52,950
Promise me.

826
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:58,456
Love for love.

827
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:00,458
And I'm yours.

828
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:08,493
Till the end of time. '

829
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,473
Collect now.

830
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:16,474
What?

831
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,476
Collect now.

832
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:20,978
But we haven't given them a fair go.

833
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:23,481
Shouldn't we play
one or 2 more songs?

834
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:24,982
Go on.

835
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,991
Thank you.

836
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,996
Thank you, sir.

837
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,998
Thank you, sir.

838
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,500
It was charming, monsieur.

839
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:44,001
Charming.

840
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:46,003
Indeed it was, madam. Charming.

841
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:49,006
Our pleasure, I assure you. Charming.

842
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,508
The manager's wife.

843
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:51,543
Of course.

844
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,010
Charming.

845
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,012
Your pleasure, ladies and gentlemen.

846
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,514
Thank you, sir.

847
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,021
Thank you, sir.

848
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,524
Madam, thank you.

849
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:07,559
Thank you.

850
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,527
Not there. The old geezer.

851
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:11,028
Oh, boy.

852
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,534
Thank you.

853
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,038
Oh, thank you, sir.

854
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:22,073
Melvin.

855
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,043
Thank you. And you, madam, thank you.

856
00:42:26,078 --> 00:42:27,545
Our pleasure.

857
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,052
Did you do well tonight?

858
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:37,054
Uh-huh. Pretty well.

859
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:39,557
Aha. You did all right yourself.

860
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:43,561
I don't just mean the money.

861
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,563
You were wonderful-singing.

862
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:47,565
Thank you.

863
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,568
You're happy tonight, huh?

864
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:52,570
Yes, I am. And do you know something?

865
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:54,071
What?

866
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:56,574
I didn't mind your
flirting with that woman.

867
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:58,075
Me? Flirting?

868
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,577
What woman?

869
00:42:59,612 --> 00:43:01,078
The manager's wife.

870
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:02,580
Oh. The manager's wife.

871
00:43:02,615 --> 00:43:05,583
We got to be nice to people like that.

872
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:07,585
After all, they're our bread and butter.

873
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,587
Yes, I know, but, Sebastian,

874
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:12,590
we wouldn't even have
to bother with them

875
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,091
if you'd settle down and write-

876
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,093
and I know you can-

877
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:17,595
really good music.

878
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,096
Gemma, darling,

879
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:21,098
to write really good music,

880
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:24,602
you've got to be... inspired.

881
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:26,103
Inspired?

882
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:29,106
Yes. By a place, by somebody.

883
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:30,141
Somebody?

884
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,612
Look, a falling star. Make a wish.

885
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:37,615
Aw. Too late.

886
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,117
Yes, it generally is too late.

887
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,622
But if you had seen it,

888
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,624
what would you have wished for?

889
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,628
Well, what would you
have wished for?

890
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:54,632
Me? Ooh, a nice
cold glass of beer.

891
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,635
How about you?

892
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,638
Oh, I don't know.

893
00:44:00,673 --> 00:44:03,641
A pair of new shoes
or a woolly for Piccolo.

894
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,645
Piccolo needs if a new woolly, buy one.

895
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,146
We can afford it.

896
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:10,648
Thanks, Sebastian.

897
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,651
And Caryl-

898
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:15,653
if he'd seen that falling star,

899
00:44:15,688 --> 00:44:19,156
he would have wished
for the lovely Fenella.

900
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:20,658
Oh, that reminds me.

901
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,661
I must collect our fee from the
hotel manager in the morning.

902
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,663
Then we can go on to Martino.

903
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,165
Sebastian.

904
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,167
Hmm? Hmm?

905
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:32,670
Then we can go on to Martino.

906
00:44:32,705 --> 00:44:33,705
Yes.

907
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,677
Did you really think my dress
looked attractive tonight?

908
00:44:39,712 --> 00:44:41,679
Very...

909
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:43,180
very attractive.

910
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,183
Maledetto.

911
00:44:46,218 --> 00:44:47,685
I forgot my concertina.

912
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,687
Well, is that important now?

913
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:50,688
Well, certainly, it's important.

914
00:44:50,723 --> 00:44:52,189
Someone might pinch it.

915
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:54,191
I better go and get it.

916
00:44:54,226 --> 00:44:57,194
Look, you go along
and I'll join you, hmm?

917
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,701
All right? Huh?

918
00:45:03,736 --> 00:45:05,202
Go on.

919
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,232
Oh.

920
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,235
Good evening.

921
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,737
Please don't think me rude.

922
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:43,240
But I couldn't help noticing
you back there on the terrace.

923
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:46,243
I said to myself, I've seen
that face somewhere before.

924
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:47,745
Possibly Innsbruck. Was it?

925
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,747
I've never been
to Innsbruck. Sorry.

926
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,250
Oh. Monte Carlo, perhaps.

927
00:45:53,285 --> 00:45:56,253
Don't you think this talk
of seeing me before is

928
00:45:56,288 --> 00:45:58,255
a little old-fashioned?

929
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,757
Frankly, yes.

930
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:02,760
Well, would you be more
willing to believe me

931
00:46:02,795 --> 00:46:05,262
if I admit that I've never
seen your face before,

932
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,766
but once having seen it,
I had to see it again?

933
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:12,269
If I say yes, I'd be a bit
conceited, don't you think?

934
00:46:12,304 --> 00:46:13,270
No.

935
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,773
Really, I must be going in now,

936
00:46:15,808 --> 00:46:18,275
but thank you for the
charming compliment.

937
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,277
Oh, please don't go, not just yet.

938
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:22,780
I hate to repeat the obvious,

939
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:24,281
but... you are beautiful.

940
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:26,784
There's something so
cool and lovely about you.

941
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,285
You're like...

942
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,788
well, you're like edelweiss.

943
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:32,289
Yes, that belongs on you.

944
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,791
Will you wear it?

945
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,796
Satisfied?

946
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,798
Thank you.

947
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,299
You know, I think

948
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:45,302
every woman's a little bit
like a flower, don't you?

949
00:46:45,337 --> 00:46:47,304
Some are like roses,
some, poppies.

950
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,307
But you-you're like edelweiss,

951
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:51,809
preferring the mountaintops,

952
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:53,310
hard to reach.

953
00:46:53,345 --> 00:46:55,813
That girl who sang, what of her?

954
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:58,816
Oh, you mean
my professional partner?

955
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:00,818
She's like a little buttercup.

956
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:03,320
You do have a way with words, don't you?

957
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,323
You think so? I think
I have a way with music.

958
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:08,826
You're a very talented
fellow, aren't you?

959
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:10,828
Oh, very. Tell me,
do you like music?

960
00:47:10,863 --> 00:47:12,329
I adore it.

961
00:47:12,364 --> 00:47:14,331
Oh?

962
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:16,834
Good music or just concertina?

963
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:18,836
Any kind that's really good-

964
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:20,838
symphony, opera. Why?

965
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:24,842
I do a bit of composing
now and then, that's all.

966
00:47:24,877 --> 00:47:26,343
Really? How amazing.

967
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,346
Seeing you here at the hotel like this,

968
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:32,349
I should never have
taken you for a composer.

969
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,351
Well, even composers
have to eat.

970
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:38,389
Look at that.

971
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,358
Beautiful, isn't it?

972
00:47:41,393 --> 00:47:42,393
Yes.

973
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,863
Tell me about your music.

974
00:47:45,898 --> 00:47:49,366
What kind of music is it?
Would I have heard it?

975
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:51,368
I'm really interested.

976
00:47:51,403 --> 00:47:53,871
Do you know what you look like,

977
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:55,873
standing there in the moonlight?

978
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:58,375
A picture I once saw in
Florence by Botticelli.

979
00:47:58,876 --> 00:47:59,877
The Goddess of Spring-

980
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,379
in the Woods, I think.

981
00:48:02,414 --> 00:48:03,881
I know the one you mean.
Primavera.

982
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,883
That's the one.

983
00:48:05,918 --> 00:48:08,886
Primavera.
What a wonderful name for a ballet.

984
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,888
That's marvelous.

985
00:48:10,923 --> 00:48:13,390
I can see the whole thing now-

986
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:14,892
the symbol of Spring.

987
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:16,393
You, you're Primavera yourself.

988
00:48:16,428 --> 00:48:17,895
I am?

989
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,930
Listen.

990
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,408
That's the theme.

991
00:48:31,443 --> 00:48:32,910
Do you like it?

992
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:34,411
Oh, yes.

993
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,413
It must be terribly exciting

994
00:48:36,448 --> 00:48:38,415
to do things like that-

995
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,418
be able to create
something out of the air.

996
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,920
I never could.

997
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:44,421
You don't need to.

998
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,424
Some people are born to inspire.

999
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:48,926
I really mean it.

1000
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:52,429
I knew that it was no mere coincidence

1001
00:48:52,464 --> 00:48:54,932
that sent me to seek you out tonight.

1002
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:56,934
Do you believe in destiny?

1003
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,936
I don't know.

1004
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:01,939
I never did until now.

1005
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:04,441
I'd better get back
to the hotel.

1006
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:10,948
No. Not until you tell me your name.

1007
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:12,449
Primavera.

1008
00:49:12,484 --> 00:49:14,451
Very well, then.

1009
00:49:14,486 --> 00:49:15,953
Don't go yet, Primavera.

1010
00:49:15,988 --> 00:49:17,454
I should.

1011
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:19,456
Please.

1012
00:49:19,491 --> 00:49:21,458
Well, all right.

1013
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:23,460
But only for a few minutes.

1014
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,982
Can you tell me where
the manager is, please?

1015
00:49:45,017 --> 00:49:47,484
His office is just upstairs, to the left.

1016
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,987
Oh, Miss Maclean, if you please.

1017
00:49:50,022 --> 00:49:51,488
A letter for you... Oh?

1018
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:53,991
Perhaps the one
you have been expecting.

1019
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,492
Thank you.

1020
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,496
Uh, Fenella.

1021
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:02,499
Oh, yes?
How do you know my name?

1022
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,002
Well, Caryl told me.

1023
00:50:05,037 --> 00:50:06,503
What did you say?

1024
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:09,006
I'm Gemma. What
are you doing here?

1025
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:11,008
I thought you were
staying in Martino.

1026
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:15,012
I'm spending the weekend with
friends if it's any of your concern.

1027
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:17,514
So you're Gemma Smith.

1028
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:20,517
That's right. I have some
news for you. Caryl is here.

1029
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:21,518
What?

1030
00:50:21,553 --> 00:50:23,020
Yes, in Orzano.

1031
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:25,022
Caryl Dubrok?

1032
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:27,024
Well, do you know
any other Dubroks?

1033
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:28,525
He's here with you.

1034
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,527
In a manner of speaking, yes.

1035
00:50:30,562 --> 00:50:32,029
Now, listen...

1036
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:34,531
I'm not Caryl's girl. I never was.

1037
00:50:34,566 --> 00:50:36,033
But you told my parents-

1038
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:38,035
It was a bit of a crisscross.

1039
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,037
I meant Sebastian, not Caryl.

1040
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:42,039
Sebastian? Who is he?

1041
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:43,540
Caryl's brother.

1042
00:50:43,575 --> 00:50:45,042
Ha ha ha!

1043
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:46,543
Sebastian!

1044
00:50:46,578 --> 00:50:49,046
I have a wonderful
surprise for you.

1045
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,551
Fenella, this is Sebastian.

1046
00:50:54,586 --> 00:50:58,055
Sebastian, this is Fenella.

1047
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,556
How do you do?

1048
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:02,559
You-you're-

1049
00:51:02,594 --> 00:51:06,063
Sebastian, Caryl's brother.

1050
00:51:06,098 --> 00:51:07,564
Oh!

1051
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,071
Another raffle card, eh?

1052
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,084
Which is Miss Maclean's room, please?

1053
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,585
Number 5.

1054
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,620
Thank you.

1055
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,612
What do you mean by coming
into my room like this?

1056
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:57,114
Sorry.

1057
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,616
Please go. I have nothing
further to say to you.

1058
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,118
Oh, yes, you have.

1059
00:52:01,153 --> 00:52:03,620
Look, we've been hunting
for you for weeks on end,

1060
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:06,123
sleeping in the rain, bruising
our feet on stony roads,

1061
00:52:06,158 --> 00:52:08,136
just because we wanted to
straighten it out with you

1062
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,626
about Caryl and me,

1063
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:11,628
and now when we do find you

1064
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:13,703
and things are apparently
in a worse mess than ever,

1065
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,632
you climb on your high horse and-

1066
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,138
Sebastian gave you this.

1067
00:52:21,173 --> 00:52:24,141
You have no right to take that.

1068
00:52:24,176 --> 00:52:26,643
No one has a better right.

1069
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:28,645
Are you Sebastian's wife?

1070
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,147
No.

1071
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:31,648
What, then?

1072
00:52:31,683 --> 00:52:34,151
We belong together.

1073
00:52:34,186 --> 00:52:36,746
Then why did he assure me you
were only his professional partner,

1074
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,156
someone to sing tunes
to his concertina?

1075
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:41,158
Oh, that.

1076
00:52:41,193 --> 00:52:44,661
What about Caryl?
Do you love him?

1077
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:48,165
Certainly I do. We were
engaged to be married.

1078
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,667
That was in Venice.

1079
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:53,670
How about afterward? Did
you change toward him?

1080
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:56,173
Naturally I did, after my
parents told me about you.

1081
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:58,175
Any girl would have.

1082
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,177
No, some girls would have
believed in him,

1083
00:53:00,212 --> 00:53:01,678
no matter what they heard.

1084
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:03,680
But that's neither here nor there.

1085
00:53:03,715 --> 00:53:04,715
Do you still love him?

1086
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,683
I told you I did!

1087
00:53:06,718 --> 00:53:07,718
But did you mean it?

1088
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,686
Get out of here!

1089
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,691
You are mixed up. You don't
know whether it's Caryl

1090
00:53:14,726 --> 00:53:17,194
or his brother you want, do you?

1091
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,203
Well, which is it, then?

1092
00:53:26,238 --> 00:53:27,704
Caryl or Sebastian?

1093
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,211
Answer me.

1094
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:37,714
I don't know. Will you
stop pestering me?

1095
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:41,718
I tell you, I don't know!
I-I don't know.

1096
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,223
I know.

1097
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,236
What a pity.

1098
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,790
Where's Caryl?

1099
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:55,292
Gone to meet Fenella I presume.

1100
00:54:55,327 --> 00:54:57,794
He was getting dressed
when I left the inn.

1101
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:59,296
Did you tell him

1102
00:54:59,331 --> 00:55:00,797
about you and Fenella last night?

1103
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:02,799
What would have been
the sense of that?

1104
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:04,301
Well, what did you tell him?

1105
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,804
Simply that we'd met her
in the lobby of the hotel.

1106
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,806
I said that she was
waiting for him

1107
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:11,308
in the summer pavilion.

1108
00:55:11,343 --> 00:55:13,810
Then you did have an
appointment with her.

1109
00:55:13,845 --> 00:55:15,312
Did Caryl know about that?

1110
00:55:15,347 --> 00:55:17,314
Of course, he didn't know
about it.

1111
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:19,316
And why don't you
stop badgering me?

1112
00:55:19,351 --> 00:55:22,319
I had no idea it was
Fenella last night.

1113
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:25,322
I wonder if it would have
mattered if you had known.

1114
00:55:25,357 --> 00:55:26,823
Oh, for heaven's sake, Gemma,

1115
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:29,326
why are you holding Piccolo
on your hip like that?

1116
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:32,329
It looks like an old sack of
potatoes you bought at the market.

1117
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:33,830
Here. Give him to me.

1118
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:36,333
He's too heavy for you
to lug around anyway.

1119
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,339
Now, if you'd care to listen,
I'll explain how I met Fenella.

1120
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,342
Last night-
We haven't time to go into that.

1121
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:48,345
Sebastian, I want to talk
to you very seriously.

1122
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,847
Oh. Go ahead.
Who's stopping you?

1123
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:52,349
We're leaving Orzano.

1124
00:55:52,384 --> 00:55:53,850
Leave-why? When?

1125
00:55:53,885 --> 00:55:55,852
Today. We'd have to see a lot

1126
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:58,355
of Caryl and Fenella
if we stayed on,

1127
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,358
and I think that'd be
a little embarrassing.

1128
00:56:01,393 --> 00:56:03,360
All right. We'll go back to Venice.

1129
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,362
We are not going to Venice.

1130
00:56:05,397 --> 00:56:06,863
What-oh.

1131
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,866
Afraid the Maclean's might be
going back there, aren't you?

1132
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,368
We'll go to Vienna.

1133
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:12,869
I don't like Vienna.

1134
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:14,871
Then we'll go to Paris.

1135
00:56:14,906 --> 00:56:16,873
I don't like Paris, either!

1136
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:19,876
Besides, you know we
haven't got the money.

1137
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:21,878
Oh, yes, we have.

1138
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:23,880
I sold the concertina

1139
00:56:23,915 --> 00:56:26,383
and... the duke.

1140
00:56:26,418 --> 00:56:29,886
You so-ha ha ha!

1141
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:32,389
The concertina belonged to Caryl,

1142
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:34,891
and so did half the donkey.

1143
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:38,395
Getting rid of you and me
will be worth more to him

1144
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,896
than a concertina and half a donkey.

1145
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:42,399
Oh, why don't you stop-

1146
00:56:42,434 --> 00:56:43,434
Women.

1147
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,405
I also sold your father's
autographed music.

1148
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,907
You did what?

1149
00:56:50,942 --> 00:56:53,910
Sold your father's
autographed music.

1150
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,914
Why, you-you little runt.

1151
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:00,417
You've certainly got a nerve.

1152
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:03,420
Well, instead of carrying
other people's stuff around,

1153
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:06,423
you should be writing
great things of your own.

1154
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,929
Yes. That's what
I'm going to do...

1155
00:57:12,964 --> 00:57:15,432
beginning with Primavera.

1156
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:16,467
What?

1157
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,935
Oh, I haven't told you
about that, have I?

1158
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,438
That's to be the name
of my ballet.

1159
00:57:21,473 --> 00:57:22,939
What ballet?

1160
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:26,943
It's a brand-new idea, wonderful,

1161
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:30,947
symbolizing the very
spirit of Spring.

1162
00:57:30,982 --> 00:57:34,451
Primavera. Listen.

1163
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,467
Oh, I'm sorry, Gemma.

1164
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,969
Oh, I wish we could
go away somewhere

1165
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:56,473
where I could get this down
on paper so it could be staged.

1166
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,977
You'd help me, wouldn't you? Gemma? Hmm?

1167
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:02,479
The way you always have?

1168
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,982
Are you bawling?

1169
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:07,984
If I am, it's my affair.

1170
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:09,986
It's mine, too.

1171
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:13,490
Sebastian, I've known a lot
of rotten people in my life,

1172
00:58:13,525 --> 00:58:15,492
but none the equal of you.

1173
00:58:15,527 --> 00:58:17,994
You lie and cheat and break
promises right and left

1174
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:21,498
and then think because you put your
arms around me, everything's all right,

1175
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:23,500
Forgiven and forgotten.
Wait a moment. I-

1176
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:26,002
You're rotten. I say it again,
and I say it to your face.

1177
00:58:26,037 --> 00:58:27,515
I have a star to follow,
I've always told you,

1178
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:29,005
and I must follow it alone.

1179
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,008
What you follow isn't a star.
They don't come that low.

1180
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:34,010
But whatever it is, go after it.

1181
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,512
I'm finished.

1182
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,017
What do you mean by that?

1183
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:43,019
I'm leaving you, Sebastian.

1184
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:53,029
Gemma! Gemma!

1185
00:58:53,064 --> 00:58:55,532
Put Piccolo down.

1186
00:58:55,567 --> 00:58:57,033
Put him down!

1187
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,541
Now, come here.

1188
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,045
You little fool.

1189
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,553
Oh, if I could only tell you
how thoroughly I despise you,

1190
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:20,056
then up and leave you, let it
be finished once and for all.

1191
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,058
It'll never be
finished between us.

1192
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:24,561
Gemma, you know it won't.

1193
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,567
Loving you is the most awful
thing that has ever happened to me.

1194
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,569
Is it?

1195
00:59:32,604 --> 00:59:34,571
Yes, it is.

1196
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,076
Perhaps you're right.

1197
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:43,580
Maybe you do deserve a better man.

1198
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,084
But I don't want
a better man, Sebastian.

1199
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:50,086
I just want you.

1200
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,600
Fenella.

1201
01:00:03,635 --> 01:00:06,603
Oh, Fenella, darling,
you're looking wonderful.

1202
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:08,104
I've never seen you
so-so beautiful.

1203
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,606
Thank you, Caryl.

1204
01:00:09,641 --> 01:00:11,608
You didn't expect me to follow you

1205
01:00:11,643 --> 01:00:12,609
to the Dolomites, did you?

1206
01:00:12,644 --> 01:00:14,110
No.

1207
01:00:14,145 --> 01:00:16,613
Oh, it doesn't seem any
longer than yesterday

1208
01:00:16,648 --> 01:00:18,615
we were sitting
in the Café Galante.

1209
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,117
I feel as if there had never been

1210
01:00:21,152 --> 01:00:22,619
a misunderstanding at all.

1211
01:00:22,654 --> 01:00:24,621
I know how you feel, but-

1212
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:27,624
I say, Gemma explained the
mix-up in Venice, didn't she?

1213
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:29,125
Yes. She explained very thoroughly.

1214
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,627
Well, everything's the same,

1215
01:00:30,662 --> 01:00:32,629
and yet everything's
changed since I saw you last.

1216
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,131
Yes. That's what
I want to talk to you-

1217
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:38,635
I have a surprise for you. I've
come round to your way of thinking.

1218
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,137
How do you mean? About our
getting married, of course.

1219
01:00:41,172 --> 01:00:42,172
Oh, Caryl!

1220
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,641
Yes. I think it would
be a good thing.

1221
01:00:44,676 --> 01:00:46,643
And to make myself
acceptable to your parents,

1222
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:48,144
I'm going to get a job.

1223
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:50,647
Oh, not the sort of thing
I had in Venice,

1224
01:00:50,682 --> 01:00:52,148
but something with a future

1225
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,089
and, at the same time, something
which will further my career.

1226
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,653
I know it sounds rather vague,

1227
01:00:56,688 --> 01:00:59,155
but I'm positive
I can work it out.

1228
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,657
What do you think?

1229
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:04,160
Oh, I... I don't know.

1230
01:01:04,195 --> 01:01:06,162
Where would you find such a job?

1231
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,165
Oh, lots of places.
Vienna, Salzburg, perhaps London.

1232
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,167
Yes. London would
be best, I imagine.

1233
01:01:11,202 --> 01:01:13,169
My father had
a great many friends there.

1234
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,173
A music broker by the name
of Steinach to name just one.

1235
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:18,675
He'd be a good contact for me.

1236
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,677
Would you marry me

1237
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:22,679
if I had a proper job, Fenella?

1238
01:01:22,714 --> 01:01:25,682
Well-I can make you happy, darling.
I know I can.

1239
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:28,685
Oh, Caryl, I don't know
how to say this,

1240
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,688
but there's something
I've got to tell you.

1241
01:01:31,723 --> 01:01:33,189
Last night, I-

1242
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,191
Excuse me. Mr. Caryl Dubrok, please?

1243
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:36,693
Yes. What is it?

1244
01:01:36,728 --> 01:01:38,695
I have a note for you, sir.

1245
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,196
Oh, thank you.

1246
01:01:40,231 --> 01:01:41,698
Excuse me.

1247
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:43,199
It's from Sebastian, my brother.

1248
01:01:43,234 --> 01:01:44,701
Oh?

1249
01:01:44,736 --> 01:01:46,703
Good heavens. He and Gemma
are leaving for London.

1250
01:01:46,738 --> 01:01:48,705
London? Yes. He intends
to finish his ballet.

1251
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:52,208
He says at last he's got a name
for it. It's to be called Primavera.

1252
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,711
Primavera.

1253
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,213
They're getting married
right away.

1254
01:01:57,248 --> 01:01:58,715
Oh, that's wonderful.

1255
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,717
Well, that's just like Sebastian.

1256
01:02:00,752 --> 01:02:03,720
One never knows
what to expect of him.

1257
01:02:03,755 --> 01:02:05,221
Now, what was it, darling?

1258
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,224
You said you had
something to tell me.

1259
01:02:08,259 --> 01:02:10,727
It was nothing, nothing at all.

1260
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,235
So Sebastian's getting married.

1261
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:27,243
Do you, Sebastian Dubrok,
take this woman Gemma Smith

1262
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:29,746
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1263
01:02:29,781 --> 01:02:31,247
I do.

1264
01:02:31,282 --> 01:02:34,250
And do you, Gemma Smith,
take this-

1265
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,754
And do you, Gemma Smith,

1266
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:39,756
take this man Sebastian Dubrok

1267
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:42,759
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1268
01:02:42,794 --> 01:02:44,260
I do.

1269
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:47,263
Then I pronounce you man and wife.

1270
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:06,783
Won't you buy
my sweet-scented lavender?

1271
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:12,789
There are 14 branches
for a penny.

1272
01:03:12,824 --> 01:03:19,295
If you buy it once,
you buy it twice

1273
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,799
'cause it makes your clothes
and handkerchiefs

1274
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:24,801
smell very nice.

1275
01:03:24,836 --> 01:03:27,303
I'll take a bunch, please.

1276
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,806
Thank you, sir.

1277
01:03:29,841 --> 01:03:36,813
Won't you buy my
sweet-scented lavender?

1278
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,840
Caryl! I ought not
to be glad to see you.

1279
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,842
You have lunch with
Sebastian time after time,

1280
01:04:05,877 --> 01:04:07,844
but you never once come to visit me.

1281
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:10,847
Time after time. Only twice.

1282
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:12,849
Those lunches were business.

1283
01:04:12,884 --> 01:04:15,351
Oh, you have a new suit.
Let me see.

1284
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,354
My, you are turned out
in style. Look, Sebastian.

1285
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:19,856
Well, I can afford it now.

1286
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,358
My job with Steinach
pays me £200 a year,

1287
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:24,360
And besides that,
I get commissions.

1288
01:04:24,395 --> 01:04:26,362
Oh, that's wonderful.
How is Fenella?

1289
01:04:26,397 --> 01:04:28,865
Oh, splendid. We're planning
to be married very soon.

1290
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,369
Well, well. Congratulations.

1291
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,374
I'll congratulate you if
you've licked that finale.

1292
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:39,409
Oh, yeah?

1293
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,379
Hmm. It looks good.

1294
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,882
Well, now I have
a surprise for you.

1295
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,884
Have you?
A pleasant one, I hope.

1296
01:04:47,919 --> 01:04:49,897
Fenella and her family are
giving a party next Friday,

1297
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:51,387
And you're both invited.

1298
01:04:51,422 --> 01:04:52,422
Oh, really?

1299
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,366
Well, it's Fenella's doing, actually.

1300
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,892
She's asked Mr. Steinach to come

1301
01:04:55,927 --> 01:04:58,394
on the idea that you're
to play your ballet for him.

1302
01:04:58,429 --> 01:04:59,896
If he likes it,

1303
01:04:59,931 --> 01:05:01,898
he'll probably offer to
produce your Primavera.

1304
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,399
You could use Heinrich as conductor

1305
01:05:03,434 --> 01:05:04,912
and perhaps Natrova
as the prima ballerina.

1306
01:05:04,936 --> 01:05:06,903
That is, if we can get her.

1307
01:05:06,938 --> 01:05:08,404
Caryl!

1308
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:10,406
Good old Caryl. We can
always rely upon you.

1309
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:13,409
Little one, I'm going to
take you to a party, at last.

1310
01:05:13,444 --> 01:05:15,411
Yes. It'll be wonderful.

1311
01:05:15,446 --> 01:05:18,414
And if the ballet is a success,
we can all go back to Italy.

1312
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:20,917
If it's a success.
Confound that gas. It's always going out.

1313
01:05:20,952 --> 01:05:22,418
Here. I have some change.

1314
01:05:22,453 --> 01:05:24,921
Oh, put it back in your pocket.
We don't need your money.

1315
01:05:24,956 --> 01:05:26,422
Gemma, put a shilling
in the meter,

1316
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,424
will you, darling?

1317
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:30,437
Don't know what I'd do without
her and that little sewing machine.

1318
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:31,928
Between the 2 of them,

1319
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:33,429
they support the 3 of us.

1320
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:34,931
Where is it?

1321
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:37,433
Huh? Oh, I wonder if I spent it.

1322
01:05:37,468 --> 01:05:38,935
Mmm, for beer.

1323
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:40,436
Oh, yes. The beer.

1324
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:41,938
There you are, Gemma.

1325
01:05:41,973 --> 01:05:43,439
Thank you, Caryl.

1326
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,944
Well, I guess I'd
better be running along.

1327
01:05:47,979 --> 01:05:49,946
Oh, would you, uh, like these?

1328
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:51,447
Oh, thank you, Caryl.

1329
01:05:51,482 --> 01:05:52,949
I have some Mexican jumping beans.

1330
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,951
I thought they might amuse Piccolo.

1331
01:05:54,986 --> 01:05:56,452
Hmm?

1332
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:57,954
They jump as soon as they get warm.

1333
01:05:57,989 --> 01:05:59,455
They won't do
much jumping in here.

1334
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,957
This place is like an icebox.

1335
01:06:00,992 --> 01:06:02,469
It was very thoughtful of you, Caryl.

1336
01:06:02,493 --> 01:06:03,960
Piccolo will love them.

1337
01:06:03,995 --> 01:06:05,962
All right. I'll see
you two at the party.

1338
01:06:05,997 --> 01:06:08,464
If the baby is all right
and I can leave him.

1339
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:11,467
He'll be all right.
Just got a bit of a cold.

1340
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:14,470
No, Sebastian. Not a penny.

1341
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:49,005
Oh, for heaven's sake, Gemma, will
you stop stitching those cuffs?

1342
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,007
You're going to
sew yourself blind.

1343
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:53,509
Well, when I finish
these, I get 12 shillings

1344
01:06:53,544 --> 01:06:55,511
we can use it, I imagine.

1345
01:06:55,546 --> 01:06:58,514
Oh, Sebastian!

1346
01:06:58,549 --> 01:07:00,516
Look.

1347
01:07:00,551 --> 01:07:02,518
A 5-pound note!

1348
01:07:02,553 --> 01:07:04,020
Uh-huh.

1349
01:07:04,055 --> 01:07:05,521
Mutton chops for supper.

1350
01:07:05,556 --> 01:07:07,023
Did you sponge this off Caryl?

1351
01:07:07,058 --> 01:07:09,525
If I did? What he's
solvent. He can afford it.

1352
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,527
And there's not going
to be any mutton chops.

1353
01:07:11,562 --> 01:07:13,029
You're going to buy yourself

1354
01:07:13,064 --> 01:07:14,530
a new dress for the party.

1355
01:07:14,565 --> 01:07:16,532
No. I can use my blue one.

1356
01:07:16,567 --> 01:07:18,034
Oh, no, I can't.

1357
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:20,536
What? I didn't pawn your blue dress.

1358
01:07:20,571 --> 01:07:22,538
No, but I did.

1359
01:07:22,573 --> 01:07:25,041
Oh. Well, we'll... buy a new one.

1360
01:07:25,076 --> 01:07:27,543
I tell you, I can borrow one
from the landlady's daughter.

1361
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,045
That's a good idea.

1362
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,547
Yes, the pretty one.
She's just about your size.

1363
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,549
And by way of reward,

1364
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:35,551
we shall allow her to
take care of Piccolo

1365
01:07:35,586 --> 01:07:37,053
while we go to the party.

1366
01:07:37,088 --> 01:07:39,555
You have a nerve.

1367
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,063
Oh, go on. Hurry up.

1368
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,074
Hurry up!

1369
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:02,578
Amore mio.

1370
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,124
It was beautiful, Sebastian.

1371
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:49,625
Very good, my boy.

1372
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,127
Thank you, Mr. Steinach.

1373
01:08:51,162 --> 01:08:53,629
I must talk this over
with your brother.

1374
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,631
Fine. Thank you, sir.

1375
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,639
You look lovely, my dear.

1376
01:09:03,674 --> 01:09:06,642
You may tell the dance
orchestra to start now.

1377
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:08,144
Yes, madam.

1378
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:09,645
We shall have supper later.

1379
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,147
Oh, you are very kind.

1380
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,149
Not at all, my dear.

1381
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,659
May I have the pleasure of
dancing with you, Mrs. Dubrok?

1382
01:09:23,694 --> 01:09:25,161
Oh, thank you very much.

1383
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,663
Rather odd having
to call you missus.

1384
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:30,166
You don't look to have
a husband, you know.

1385
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:32,168
Oh, sometimes I wonder
if I have.

1386
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,178
I suppose wives do wonder
about that at times.

1387
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,181
I beg your pardon.

1388
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,184
Oh, no, no. It was my fault.
I don't dance very often.

1389
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:49,685
I wish Fenella
didn't dance so much.

1390
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,698
She's out practically every
night with her young man.

1391
01:09:51,722 --> 01:09:53,189
Never spends the evening in anymore.

1392
01:09:53,224 --> 01:09:54,690
Oh?

1393
01:09:54,725 --> 01:09:56,192
Restless sort of girl,

1394
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:58,694
but marriage will settle her,
I suppose. At least, I hope so.

1395
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,197
Well, then why don't you
let them get married?

1396
01:10:01,232 --> 01:10:02,198
Huh?

1397
01:10:02,233 --> 01:10:03,699
Well, why not?

1398
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,701
You may be right. By jove, yes.

1399
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,205
I think I'll speak to
her young man about it,

1400
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,208
tell him it's time to dust off
the wedding bells.

1401
01:10:12,243 --> 01:10:14,710
I say, you're a smart
little thing, aren't you?

1402
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:16,712
Oh, I wouldn't be
too sure of that.

1403
01:10:31,762 --> 01:10:34,230
Primavera is going to be a
marvelous success, Sebastian.

1404
01:10:34,265 --> 01:10:37,233
Of course, I never had
any doubts about it,

1405
01:10:37,268 --> 01:10:41,237
not even that first night when
you whistled the theme for me.

1406
01:10:41,272 --> 01:10:42,738
Then you do remember Orzano.

1407
01:10:42,773 --> 01:10:44,740
Did you think I'd forgotten?

1408
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:48,244
Frankly, I didn't think much
about it one way or the other.

1409
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:49,745
Bad business, thinking.

1410
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,747
What do you mean?

1411
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:55,251
Simply that the worst mistake
anyone can ever make in life

1412
01:10:55,286 --> 01:10:56,752
is taking it seriously.

1413
01:10:56,787 --> 01:10:58,754
It's too unpredictable,
too haphazard.

1414
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,758
But you're a musician, and music
is based on order and purpose.

1415
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:04,760
That's exactly why I am a musician.

1416
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:09,265
I pursue art to help me forget
that life is not worth pursuing.

1417
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,268
Surely you believe that it's
wanting things and getting them

1418
01:11:12,303 --> 01:11:13,769
that brings us happiness.

1419
01:11:13,804 --> 01:11:16,772
No. Who knows what they want?

1420
01:11:16,807 --> 01:11:18,274
Do you?

1421
01:11:18,309 --> 01:11:20,276
Yes. Of course, I do.

1422
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:22,278
Then you're one
of the rare exceptions-

1423
01:11:22,313 --> 01:11:24,780
A woman who knows
what she's after.

1424
01:11:24,815 --> 01:11:28,284
Not only that, but I
always get what I'm after.

1425
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,787
You do? Then you're
a very fortunate girl.

1426
01:11:31,822 --> 01:11:34,790
I don't see it that way at all.

1427
01:11:34,825 --> 01:11:37,793
My life is nothing
but a flat, stale vacuum.

1428
01:11:37,828 --> 01:11:40,296
I hate it, and I loathe it.

1429
01:11:40,331 --> 01:11:43,299
And...

1430
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:46,802
if you changed it, would
it make you any happier?

1431
01:11:46,837 --> 01:11:48,304
Yes.

1432
01:11:48,339 --> 01:11:50,806
Are you sure? You'd better be.

1433
01:11:50,841 --> 01:11:55,311
Once you've made the break, it
might be difficult to get back.

1434
01:11:55,346 --> 01:11:58,314
But I shouldn't want to get back.

1435
01:11:58,349 --> 01:12:00,316
Never?

1436
01:12:00,351 --> 01:12:02,318
Never.

1437
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:12,328
Sebastian!

1438
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:24,340
Sebastian, I have a note. Piccolo
is ill. I think we ought to go home.

1439
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:26,342
Would you try and find a cab?

1440
01:12:26,377 --> 01:12:27,843
I'll get your things.

1441
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,852
Well, good night.

1442
01:12:36,887 --> 01:12:38,854
Fenella.

1443
01:12:38,889 --> 01:12:41,357
Fenella, I want to talk to you.

1444
01:12:41,392 --> 01:12:43,359
Yes?

1445
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:46,362
This is very different
from Orzano, isn't it?

1446
01:12:46,397 --> 01:12:48,864
You are engaged to Caryl,
and Sebastian-

1447
01:12:52,903 --> 01:12:54,870
Please take your foot away.

1448
01:12:54,905 --> 01:12:57,873
You know, you aren't
the first distraction we have had.

1449
01:12:57,908 --> 01:12:59,375
There have been others.

1450
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:02,878
But, you see, once Sebastian
makes a conquest of this sort,

1451
01:13:02,913 --> 01:13:04,880
he forgets it.

1452
01:13:04,915 --> 01:13:06,382
You're being spiteful,

1453
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:08,177
and you completely
misinterpret our relation.

1454
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,885
Oh, do I?

1455
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,887
Yes. Sebastian is going to be famous.

1456
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:13,389
He's not an ordinary man.

1457
01:13:13,424 --> 01:13:16,392
You are so right. He's an
utterly selfish, cold-hearted pig.

1458
01:13:16,427 --> 01:13:18,394
Don't you know
that he's a genius?

1459
01:13:18,429 --> 01:13:20,896
I ought to. He's
always telling me so.

1460
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,401
Would you mind
my speaking frankly?

1461
01:13:25,436 --> 01:13:26,902
Haven't you been?

1462
01:13:26,937 --> 01:13:28,904
Gemma, give him up.

1463
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:29,939
So that you can have him?

1464
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,918
Yes. There's so much
I could do for him,

1465
01:13:31,942 --> 01:13:33,409
Just as I've already helped him.

1466
01:13:33,444 --> 01:13:34,444
Oh, have you?

1467
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,412
Yes. I gave this party

1468
01:13:36,447 --> 01:13:37,913
so that he could meet Steinach.

1469
01:13:37,948 --> 01:13:40,416
I persuaded Heinrich
to conduct his ballet.

1470
01:13:40,451 --> 01:13:41,917
I- I even inspired Sebastian

1471
01:13:41,952 --> 01:13:43,919
to write the ballet
in the beginning.

1472
01:13:43,954 --> 01:13:46,922
He got the idea for it in
Orzano the night we met.

1473
01:13:46,957 --> 01:13:49,425
So, you see, if you
were to give him up, I-

1474
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,427
Don't say that again.

1475
01:13:51,462 --> 01:13:53,929
Very well. But you must realize

1476
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:56,932
that no woman can hold
a man like Sebastian

1477
01:13:56,967 --> 01:13:59,435
if he doesn't want to be held.

1478
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,936
What do you mean by that?

1479
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,439
Suppose he were to leave you.

1480
01:14:03,474 --> 01:14:06,942
Leave me? Never.

1481
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,451
I've got a cab at the side gate.

1482
01:14:15,486 --> 01:14:16,952
Thank you.

1483
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,957
Darling, I have good news for you.

1484
01:14:21,992 --> 01:14:24,960
Your father suggests we be
married early next Spring.

1485
01:14:24,995 --> 01:14:25,995
Isn't that wonderful?

1486
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,964
My dress is torn.
I must go in and change.

1487
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:37,473
Did you tell her?

1488
01:14:37,508 --> 01:14:39,475
Yes. Good. Then it's settled.

1489
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,477
And so's your brother's
ballet, I understand.

1490
01:14:41,512 --> 01:14:42,978
What?

1491
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,482
Heinrich says that they're going
to start rehearsals immediately.

1492
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,499
No, no. That
curtain is 2 bows late.

1493
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:06,001
All right, lads.
This is a quick change.

1494
01:15:06,036 --> 01:15:08,003
Now, come on, ladies.
Off the bloomin' stage.

1495
01:15:08,038 --> 01:15:10,005
Take your limes off, Fred.

1496
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,007
Take up your tableau curtain.

1497
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,010
Charlie, douse your foots.

1498
01:15:15,045 --> 01:15:17,012
Fred, turn off your limes.

1499
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:20,516
Now, come on, lads.
Get a move on. Props!

1500
01:15:20,551 --> 01:15:22,017
What'd you think of it?

1501
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:23,519
Oh, it's splendid.

1502
01:15:23,554 --> 01:15:25,020
The orchestration
is very effective.

1503
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,522
Yeah? Thanks.

1504
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:29,525
Sebastian. 5 minutes, gentlemen.

1505
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:45,040
I wish it were your ballet
instead of Sebastian's.

1506
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,043
You could write a ballet

1507
01:15:48,078 --> 01:15:49,545
if you really applied yourself.

1508
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,046
I told you in Venice

1509
01:15:51,081 --> 01:15:53,048
that I wasn't a genius, Fenella.

1510
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,550
I had my heart set

1511
01:15:54,585 --> 01:15:57,052
on you doing something
really important in music

1512
01:15:57,087 --> 01:16:01,056
I haven't given it up. I've merely
exchanged composing for a steady job.

1513
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:03,559
You're so utterly
different from Sebastian.

1514
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:05,561
He cares nothing for money.

1515
01:16:05,596 --> 01:16:08,063
I wish you wouldn't keep
dragging Sebastian into this.

1516
01:16:08,098 --> 01:16:09,565
He has nothing to do with it.

1517
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,068
Or has he?

1518
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,075
Sebastian's like his father-

1519
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:25,080
a great, cruel, wind of a man
that no one can leave alone...

1520
01:16:25,115 --> 01:16:28,584
that women apparently
never want to leave alone.

1521
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:30,085
I resemble our mother-

1522
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:34,089
solid and proper and dull.

1523
01:16:34,124 --> 01:16:38,594
There are times, Caryl, when
I'm inclined to agree with you.

1524
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,095
Fenella.

1525
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,597
Well?

1526
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:46,101
If you have made a mistake about
us, now is the time to say so.

1527
01:16:46,136 --> 01:16:48,604
Are you trying to break
our engagement?

1528
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:51,106
I am, if it needs to be broken.

1529
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:56,612
We can't talk here. The
next scene's about to begin.

1530
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:23,318
Stop it! Stop it! It's
impossible! It cannot be done!

1531
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:25,821
But why? You've been
doing it that way for the last 2 weeks.

1532
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,834
Well, in short shirts, yes, but
today is the first time

1533
01:20:27,858 --> 01:20:29,324
in a long dress.

1534
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:30,826
All right.
Change to short skirts.

1535
01:20:30,861 --> 01:20:34,329
How can I? The role calls
for a long, full costume.

1536
01:20:34,364 --> 01:20:35,831
If anything is to be changed,

1537
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,833
it is your music, Monsieur Dubrok.

1538
01:20:37,868 --> 01:20:39,334
I hope you're not serious.

1539
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:40,836
Professor Heinrich.

1540
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:42,838
Madame Natrova,
if you would, perhaps-

1541
01:20:42,873 --> 01:20:45,340
May I make a suggestion?
Yes. What is it?

1542
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:47,843
I was thinking that perhaps
something of Tchaikovsky

1543
01:20:47,878 --> 01:20:49,344
might be used at this point.

1544
01:20:49,379 --> 01:20:50,846
But Tchaikovsky!
That's wonderful!

1545
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:52,848
His music is always good.

1546
01:20:52,883 --> 01:20:54,349
Don't you think so,
Monsieur Dubrok?

1547
01:20:54,384 --> 01:20:55,851
Certainly, madam, yes.

1548
01:20:55,886 --> 01:20:57,853
No one appreciates
Tchaikovsky more than I,

1549
01:20:57,888 --> 01:20:59,855
but not in my ballet.

1550
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:02,357
This is my music, and it's
going to remain my music!

1551
01:21:02,392 --> 01:21:03,859
I tell you, it cannot be danced!

1552
01:21:03,894 --> 01:21:05,374
The tempo is too fast,
too exhausting,

1553
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,363
and just when I must catch
my breath before the finale!

1554
01:21:08,398 --> 01:21:09,876
What about a slower
tempo, Sebastian? What?

1555
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,368
What do you want me to
do, change a Spring waltz

1556
01:21:13,403 --> 01:21:15,370
into some sort of
funeral dirge? Nonsense

1557
01:21:15,405 --> 01:21:17,372
I have spent weeks on my solo.

1558
01:21:17,407 --> 01:21:19,374
It must be done my way
or not at all!

1559
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:21,376
Excuse me. Would you
tell Mr. Dubrok

1560
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:23,378
I would like to speak
with him, please?

1561
01:21:23,413 --> 01:21:25,380
I can't go out there now, miss.

1562
01:21:25,415 --> 01:21:27,382
Yes, but my baby
is very sick. Please.

1563
01:21:27,417 --> 01:21:29,384
I'm sorry, miss.

1564
01:21:29,419 --> 01:21:30,699
All right.
If she can't dance it,

1565
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:31,898
let's get someone who can!

1566
01:21:31,922 --> 01:21:33,388
People come to see Natrova,

1567
01:21:33,423 --> 01:21:35,390
not to listen to the music
of an unknown composer.

1568
01:21:35,425 --> 01:21:37,893
If they'd sooner watch some
kangaroo hop around the stage-

1569
01:21:37,928 --> 01:21:39,394
Enough of this! Both of you!

1570
01:21:39,429 --> 01:21:41,396
I'm finished!

1571
01:21:41,431 --> 01:21:44,399
We are dismissed!
We are dismissed!

1572
01:21:44,434 --> 01:21:45,901
Sebastian-

1573
01:21:45,936 --> 01:21:47,416
Don't you realize
what this will mean?

1574
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,405
The posters are all
ready. Some of them are up.

1575
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,907
Well, take them down, burn them,

1576
01:21:51,942 --> 01:21:54,409
do anything you want
with them. I don't care.

1577
01:21:54,444 --> 01:21:56,411
Don't argue with him.
It's useless.

1578
01:21:56,446 --> 01:21:58,413
Sebastian, Sebastian,
please come home with me.

1579
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,916
The baby is very sick,
and I'm so frightened.

1580
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,418
Is he? Well, get
a doctor for him.

1581
01:22:03,453 --> 01:22:05,420
But how can I? We have no money.

1582
01:22:05,455 --> 01:22:08,924
Darling, please, please, don't
you see I've got so much on mind?

1583
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:10,926
I've got to have time to think.

1584
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,442
I must talk to you, Sebastian.

1585
01:22:27,477 --> 01:22:29,444
Caryl, I was right, wasn't I?

1586
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:30,946
That stupid, preening woman.

1587
01:22:30,981 --> 01:22:32,447
With her ridiculous airs and-

1588
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,450
It's not the ballet I want
to discuss at the moment.

1589
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:36,952
Oh? What is it?

1590
01:22:36,987 --> 01:22:38,954
It's Fenella.

1591
01:22:38,989 --> 01:22:40,466
Fenella? Doesn't
anybody care about the music?

1592
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:41,957
At least I expected you, a musician-

1593
01:22:41,992 --> 01:22:44,459
You're in no position
to force issues.

1594
01:22:44,494 --> 01:22:46,962
You behaved like a fool.

1595
01:22:46,997 --> 01:22:50,966
Thanks. Thanks very much.

1596
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:16,491
Don't let them do anything
to your music, Sebastian.

1597
01:23:16,526 --> 01:23:18,994
Fenella. Why did you stay?

1598
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,996
Well, I...

1599
01:23:21,031 --> 01:23:23,999
I thought there might
be something I can do.

1600
01:23:24,034 --> 01:23:28,503
Did you? How nice of you.
There isn't.

1601
01:23:28,538 --> 01:23:30,505
I'm not engaged to Caryl anymore.

1602
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:33,008
Oh, but that's silly.

1603
01:23:33,043 --> 01:23:35,510
Caryl's a wonderful fellow.

1604
01:23:35,545 --> 01:23:37,012
What happened?

1605
01:23:37,047 --> 01:23:39,514
Please let's not talk about him.

1606
01:23:39,549 --> 01:23:41,516
I wish I could get away.

1607
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,018
I hate London.

1608
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,020
So do I.

1609
01:23:45,055 --> 01:23:47,022
I wish I could get away
somewhere, too,

1610
01:23:47,057 --> 01:23:49,024
somewhere where I could
pull myself together and-

1611
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:51,526
I know a place, in the country.

1612
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,030
Do you? Where?

1613
01:23:55,065 --> 01:23:57,032
Down in Kent.

1614
01:23:57,067 --> 01:24:00,535
It belongs to my family. It's lovely-

1615
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:02,037
quiet and...

1616
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,042
Is it?

1617
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:20,055
Here we go.

1618
01:24:21,591 --> 01:24:23,558
He's coming now, darling.

1619
01:24:25,095 --> 01:24:26,095
Shh.

1620
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,068
How is he?

1621
01:24:33,103 --> 01:24:37,072
Mrs. Cooper gave me some
medicine, and he's quieter now.

1622
01:24:37,107 --> 01:24:40,075
That's good. You shouldn't
let it upset you so much.

1623
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:42,577
Babies always have earaches
or something like that.

1624
01:24:42,612 --> 01:24:45,580
Sorry I blew up
like that at rehearsal.

1625
01:24:45,615 --> 01:24:49,084
Oh, that's all right. Now that
you're home, I'm not so frightened.

1626
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:52,087
That's the last time I'll
ever write a ballet, I swear.

1627
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:53,588
But, Sebastian,
there's money in it.

1628
01:24:53,623 --> 01:24:56,091
And when they do pay you
for the ballet,

1629
01:24:56,126 --> 01:24:59,094
do you think we could
use some of it for-

1630
01:24:59,129 --> 01:25:01,096
well, to get some
warm things for Piccolo?

1631
01:25:01,131 --> 01:25:03,598
He just can't stand
this cold climate.

1632
01:25:03,633 --> 01:25:06,601
Fat chance there is of
them paying me anything.

1633
01:25:06,636 --> 01:25:08,603
You mean they won't pay you?

1634
01:25:08,638 --> 01:25:10,605
Oh, but, Sebastian,
that can't be.

1635
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,108
The ballet might not
go on at all.

1636
01:25:13,143 --> 01:25:16,111
Oh, don't worry about it.
Something will turn up.

1637
01:25:16,146 --> 01:25:17,612
It always does.

1638
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:19,614
I wonder.

1639
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,621
I had to do it. There comes a point

1640
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:29,624
when one more compromise
would have ruined the music.

1641
01:25:29,659 --> 01:25:31,626
That point was reached
this afternoon.

1642
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,630
Well, that's that.

1643
01:25:35,665 --> 01:25:38,133
No ballet, no money.

1644
01:25:38,168 --> 01:25:39,634
Money's not that important.

1645
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,637
Not to you, perhaps.

1646
01:25:42,672 --> 01:25:45,140
What do you want me
to do, hack work?

1647
01:25:45,175 --> 01:25:47,142
If so, you're going to
be very disappointed.

1648
01:25:47,177 --> 01:25:49,144
You always seem to be
complaining.

1649
01:25:49,179 --> 01:25:52,147
Because I don't make you
a fortune, I suppose-

1650
01:25:52,182 --> 01:25:54,149
Oh, it isn't that, Sebastian.

1651
01:25:54,184 --> 01:25:56,151
The baby's sick, and I'm tired,

1652
01:25:56,186 --> 01:25:59,654
and I don't consider a
shilling for the gas meter a fortune.

1653
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,659
What are you doing
with those clothes?

1654
01:26:04,694 --> 01:26:06,661
I've got to go down
to Surrey tonight.

1655
01:26:06,696 --> 01:26:08,163
Why?

1656
01:26:08,198 --> 01:26:09,675
To see Natrova,
make her listen to reason.

1657
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,177
She's down there,
staying with friends.

1658
01:26:11,201 --> 01:26:13,179
But you said everything was over
with the ballet and finished.

1659
01:26:13,203 --> 01:26:15,170
Exactly. That's why I have
to go down and see her.

1660
01:26:15,205 --> 01:26:17,605
You said yourself you wanted the ballet
to go on, didn't you?

1661
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,685
Don't lie to me, Sebastian.
You're not going down there

1662
01:26:19,709 --> 01:26:21,676
to talk to Natrova.
I know you too well.

1663
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:23,689
What do you mean by that?
You know exactly what I mean.

1664
01:26:23,713 --> 01:26:26,681
No, I don't, but I do know one thing.
I'm getting out of here.

1665
01:26:26,716 --> 01:26:28,694
So you were going down to Surrey
to talk to Natrova, were you?

1666
01:26:28,718 --> 01:26:30,185
Yes, I was! You liar!

1667
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,686
I know who you were
going to see-

1668
01:26:31,721 --> 01:26:33,688
Fenella, and don't try to deny it.

1669
01:26:33,723 --> 01:26:36,691
Well, go on. Get out of here.
I don't need you. Go to her.

1670
01:26:36,726 --> 01:26:38,693
Let her tell you
what a genius you are!

1671
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,196
Wait a minute. You'll
ruin that, you little fool.

1672
01:26:41,231 --> 01:26:43,198
That's yours
as much as it is mine.

1673
01:26:43,233 --> 01:26:44,699
Mine? It's never been mine!

1674
01:26:44,734 --> 01:26:47,202
It belongs to Fenella.
You wrote it for her.

1675
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:50,205
That night in Orzano, you
got the idea for it, remember?

1676
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,707
Well, go on. Take your
precious ballet to her.

1677
01:26:52,742 --> 01:26:57,212
And I hope I never set eyes on
it, or you again, as long as I live!

1678
01:26:57,247 --> 01:26:58,713
You mean that?

1679
01:26:58,748 --> 01:27:01,716
Yes. Yes, I do!
Now, get out of here!

1680
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:03,218
Get out!

1681
01:27:03,253 --> 01:27:04,719
Get out.

1682
01:27:43,793 --> 01:27:45,260
Who is it?

1683
01:27:45,295 --> 01:27:46,761
Caryl.

1684
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:50,265
Oh. Caryl, would you
mind putting a shilling

1685
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,267
in the gas meter, please?

1686
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:04,779
Where's Sebastian?

1687
01:28:04,814 --> 01:28:06,781
He's gone.

1688
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,785
When will he be back?

1689
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:12,787
He won't.

1690
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,293
I'm sorry, Gemma.

1691
01:28:18,328 --> 01:28:21,796
What was it you wanted
to talk to him about?

1692
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,801
Fenella and I have
broken our engagement.

1693
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,804
Oh.

1694
01:28:31,841 --> 01:28:33,808
Piccolo! Piccolo!

1695
01:28:36,346 --> 01:28:37,812
Oh, Caryl!

1696
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,317
Mrs. Cooper! Mrs. Cooper!

1697
01:28:42,352 --> 01:28:43,818
Yes. What is it?

1698
01:28:43,853 --> 01:28:46,821
Please, Piccolo is
terribly sick. I know he is.

1699
01:28:46,856 --> 01:28:48,823
Would you try and do something?

1700
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:54,329
Do you think a little warm oil
in his hair might help?

1701
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,833
I think you ought to take
him to the hospital, ducky.

1702
01:28:58,868 --> 01:29:00,835
They'd know what
to do with him there.

1703
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,337
That sounds like good advice, Gemma.

1704
01:29:02,372 --> 01:29:04,839
Yes, but I'd have to
stay there with him.

1705
01:29:04,874 --> 01:29:08,343
You see, he just couldn't stand
it with a lot of strange people.

1706
01:29:08,378 --> 01:29:09,844
Don't worry. I'll go with you.

1707
01:29:09,879 --> 01:29:12,347
Nothing could happen to him,
could it, Caryl?

1708
01:29:12,382 --> 01:29:14,349
He's so little.
It just wouldn't be fair.

1709
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,852
Thank you, Mrs. Cooper.

1710
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,877
He is quiet now.

1711
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,883
Do you think he's a little better?

1712
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,397
You should have brought him sooner.

1713
01:30:02,432 --> 01:30:03,898
Oh, yes, I know, but-

1714
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,401
There's nothing we can do now.

1715
01:30:06,436 --> 01:30:09,904
Well, then give him
back to me. I will take care of him.

1716
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,406
It's too late.

1717
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:15,910
No. That's a lie,
a dirty, hospital lie!

1718
01:30:15,945 --> 01:30:17,412
Give him back to me!

1719
01:30:17,447 --> 01:30:19,914
Give him back to me,
do you hear?

1720
01:30:19,949 --> 01:30:21,916
That's a lie!
Give him back to me!

1721
01:30:21,951 --> 01:30:24,919
It's a lie! It's a lie!

1722
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,453
He'll be all right, Caryl.

1723
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:00,955
He'll be all right.

1724
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:03,958
It's just this awful
English weather.

1725
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:08,963
As soon as he gets better, I'm
going to take him back to Italy,

1726
01:31:08,998 --> 01:31:10,965
where there's sun.

1727
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,967
That's all he needs...

1728
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:18,473
because back in Italy, he was
well and happy all the time.

1729
01:31:18,508 --> 01:31:21,976
And in Venice, he was...

1730
01:31:22,011 --> 01:31:23,978
in Venice, he was...

1731
01:31:24,013 --> 01:31:28,483
come on. Let me buy you a cup
of coffee. You're-you're cold.

1732
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,493
A cup of coffee, please.

1733
01:31:38,528 --> 01:31:41,996
Here you are, sir.

1734
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:45,500
You know, back in Venice,
I was going to marry Dino.

1735
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,004
Dino was a baker. We would have
had all the bread we needed.

1736
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,009
Caryl, you must marry.

1737
01:31:55,044 --> 01:31:58,012
You must marry Fenella
and be very happy

1738
01:31:58,047 --> 01:32:00,014
and live in a little warm house,

1739
01:32:00,049 --> 01:32:03,017
and every morning
when you go to work,

1740
01:32:03,052 --> 01:32:05,019
you will leave
your little house,

1741
01:32:05,054 --> 01:32:08,523
and you will have an attaché
case full of music and contracts,

1742
01:32:08,558 --> 01:32:11,526
and Fenella will wave good-bye
to you from the window-

1743
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,027
Please, Gemma-

1744
01:32:13,062 --> 01:32:16,030
Oh, Caryl, please don't
let her go. Bring her back.

1745
01:32:16,065 --> 01:32:17,532
Marry her and never leave her...

1746
01:32:17,567 --> 01:32:19,534
because people
have to be families.

1747
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:22,537
There has to be
a mother and a father,

1748
01:32:22,572 --> 01:32:25,039
And the father has to go to work

1749
01:32:25,074 --> 01:32:26,541
and the children go to school,

1750
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,543
and then the children come home,

1751
01:32:28,578 --> 01:32:30,044
and they play.

1752
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:33,548
Oh, Piccolo! Piccolo!

1753
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,051
Gemma!

1754
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:41,556
Gemma!

1755
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:44,559
Gemma! Gemma!

1756
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,082
2 bottles?

1757
01:33:08,117 --> 01:33:09,584
2 people.

1758
01:33:09,619 --> 01:33:12,086
Oh, not tonight.

1759
01:33:12,121 --> 01:33:15,590
Hey, I'll be needing that.

1760
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,091
Tonight's too precious.

1761
01:33:17,126 --> 01:33:18,593
Later on,

1762
01:33:18,628 --> 01:33:21,596
you'll bring me back that bottle
with your own little hands.

1763
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,598
Oh? Why should I?

1764
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:25,600
You'll see.

1765
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:32,106
To us. All the people who like
us and all the ones who don't.

1766
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,612
Drink up. It'll help.

1767
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:05,640
Oh, it was so cold and strange
on the way down here.

1768
01:34:05,675 --> 01:34:08,142
Let's go and sit by the fire.

1769
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:12,647
Yes. It's burning nicely, isn't it?

1770
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:24,158
What do you see in the fire?

1771
01:34:24,193 --> 01:34:25,660
Coal.

1772
01:34:25,695 --> 01:34:27,662
Oh, don't you see us?

1773
01:34:27,697 --> 01:34:30,665
I do, the way we're going to be,

1774
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:32,667
perhaps in this very house.

1775
01:34:32,702 --> 01:34:35,670
It'll be mine one day, you know.

1776
01:34:35,705 --> 01:34:37,171
Will it?

1777
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:48,683
Nice... parties, rooms full of
flowers and music, nice people.

1778
01:34:48,718 --> 01:34:52,186
Oh, nice. Will you stop
using that stupid word?

1779
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:58,693
I'm sorry.

1780
01:34:58,728 --> 01:35:00,695
I didn't mean it, darling.

1781
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:03,698
Oh, everything's going
to be wonderful, isn't it?

1782
01:35:03,733 --> 01:35:08,703
No more poverty for you,
no worry, no Gemma.

1783
01:35:08,738 --> 01:35:11,205
Let's leave Gemma out of it.

1784
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,708
Out of it? Of course.

1785
01:35:13,743 --> 01:35:18,212
I quite like Gemma. I think
she has a lot of good in her.

1786
01:35:18,247 --> 01:35:19,714
Some of these girls have.

1787
01:35:19,749 --> 01:35:21,215
What girls?

1788
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,717
Well, her sort.

1789
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:26,220
Father says that every genius
has some little creature

1790
01:35:26,255 --> 01:35:27,722
like that in his past

1791
01:35:27,757 --> 01:35:30,224
because when he's
starving in a garret,

1792
01:35:30,259 --> 01:35:32,727
he has to have someone cheap.

1793
01:35:32,762 --> 01:35:35,229
Of course, they don't understand

1794
01:35:35,264 --> 01:35:38,232
about his art or his career,

1795
01:35:38,267 --> 01:35:40,234
but they're useful.

1796
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:49,744
Useful...

1797
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,747
loyal...

1798
01:35:52,782 --> 01:35:55,249
unselfish...

1799
01:35:55,284 --> 01:35:57,251
forgiving.

1800
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:00,254
Why are you doing them up again?

1801
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,259
Because I'm taking you home, my dear.

1802
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,263
So...

1803
01:36:09,298 --> 01:36:10,765
You're angry.

1804
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,768
No. Grateful.

1805
01:36:13,803 --> 01:36:15,770
Look at me.

1806
01:36:15,805 --> 01:36:18,773
Even the most selfish pig may have...

1807
01:36:18,808 --> 01:36:22,276
may have something he won't face,

1808
01:36:22,311 --> 01:36:24,278
even though it's the only decent thing

1809
01:36:24,313 --> 01:36:25,780
that ever happened to him.

1810
01:36:25,815 --> 01:36:27,782
I was afraid. That's it.

1811
01:36:27,817 --> 01:36:30,785
I was afraid to admit
what Gemma meant to me

1812
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,286
because, I suppose,

1813
01:36:32,321 --> 01:36:35,289
I wanted to go on
being a selfish pig.

1814
01:36:35,324 --> 01:36:38,292
Sebastian, you mean
you brought me down here-

1815
01:36:38,327 --> 01:36:39,794
And that's the luckiest thing

1816
01:36:39,829 --> 01:36:41,295
that ever happened to you...

1817
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:43,798
because I'm taking
you back, to Caryl.

1818
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:46,801
Caryl-he's your kind of man.

1819
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:50,304
And Gemma-Gemma's
my kind of woman.

1820
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:56,310
Look, Fenella,

1821
01:36:56,345 --> 01:36:57,345
you're a sensible girl.

1822
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:00,815
What you want is a nice
marriage, a nice husband-

1823
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:03,317
Now you're using
that word "nice."

1824
01:37:03,352 --> 01:37:05,319
Ha ha ha!

1825
01:37:05,354 --> 01:37:09,323
I'll give it to you,
for a wedding present.

1826
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,325
Friends?

1827
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,328
Please?

1828
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:16,330
Good friends.

1829
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,355
Where's Gemma?

1830
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,359
She's gone.

1831
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,863
The baby died
while you and Fenella...

1832
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:13,507
Good evening.

1833
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:17,511
Oh, it's going to be
a great success, Sebastian.

1834
01:40:17,546 --> 01:40:19,513
Any word from her?

1835
01:40:19,548 --> 01:40:22,516
Nothing. I've looked
all over London.

1836
01:40:22,551 --> 01:40:24,518
I'm so sorry.

1837
01:40:24,553 --> 01:40:26,520
Good luck tonight.

1838
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,539
Gemma!

1839
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,544
Gemma!

1840
01:40:50,579 --> 01:40:52,546
Gemma. I hoped you'd come.

1841
01:40:52,581 --> 01:40:55,049
I don't want to talk to you. Please-

1842
01:40:55,084 --> 01:40:58,052
They're going to
start. Let me go. Let me go!

1843
01:40:59,588 --> 01:41:01,555
Gemma! Gemma, wait.

1844
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:03,057
Please.

1845
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:06,060
Gemma, I don't know what to say.

1846
01:41:06,095 --> 01:41:08,062
Say nothing. It's better.

1847
01:41:08,097 --> 01:41:09,563
I didn't know about Piccolo.

1848
01:41:09,598 --> 01:41:11,565
Don't tell me
you're sorry, Sebastian.

1849
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,568
Be like you always were.
Not sorry about anything.

1850
01:41:14,603 --> 01:41:18,072
I wasn't going to say
that I'm sorry.

1851
01:41:18,107 --> 01:41:21,075
That's such a-
such a small word.

1852
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:23,577
It's so easy for people to be sorry,

1853
01:41:23,612 --> 01:41:28,082
but no one can tell what it
means to a mother to lose a child,

1854
01:41:28,117 --> 01:41:30,584
because she's the only
one who understands,

1855
01:41:30,619 --> 01:41:35,089
who can imagine the kind of man
he was going to grow up to be.

1856
01:41:35,124 --> 01:41:37,591
I loved the little
fellow, too, Gemma,

1857
01:41:37,626 --> 01:41:39,093
in my own way.

1858
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:42,596
Oh, Sebastian...

1859
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,600
listen.

1860
01:41:48,637 --> 01:41:50,104
Your music.

1861
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,607
Yours, too.

1862
01:41:53,642 --> 01:41:56,610
I could never have
written it without you.

1863
01:41:56,645 --> 01:41:59,113
You know that, don't you?

1864
01:41:59,148 --> 01:42:01,615
No. Don't lie to me,
not at a time like this.

1865
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:02,650
I'm not.

1866
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,121
Look.

1867
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:12,126
I wrote it for you
long ago, in Venice.

1868
01:42:12,626 --> 01:42:14,128
It's your song.

1869
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:22,636
You're hurt.
When we get home, I'll...

1870
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:36,150
I'll try to change.

1871
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:40,154
Perhaps-perhaps in time,
I'll be a better man.

1872
01:42:40,189 --> 01:42:43,657
But I don't want
a better man, Sebastian.

1873
01:42:43,692 --> 01:42:45,659
I just want you.
