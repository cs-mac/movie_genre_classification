1
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:26,242
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

2
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:31,288
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

3
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,693
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

4
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:52,488
Oh, God!

5
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:47,997
The object of this massive tribute...

6
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,249
...died as he had always lived:

7
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,500
A private man...

8
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,835
...without wealth...

9
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,461
...without property...

10
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,172
...without official title or office.

11
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,674
Mahatma Gandhi...

12
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,718
...was not the commander of armies...

13
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,512
...nor a ruler of vast lands.

14
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,723
He could not boast
any scientific achievement...

15
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,684
...or artistic gift.

16
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,143
Yet men...

17
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:16,106
...governments, dignitaries
from all over the world...

18
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,233
...have joined hands today
to pay homage...

19
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:21,111
...to this little brown man
in the loincloth...

20
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,197
...who led his country to freedom.

21
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,408
In the words of
General George C. Marshall...

22
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,703
...the American secretary of state:

23
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:34,123
"Mahatma Gandhi has become
the spokesman...

24
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:37,250
...for the conscience of all mankind.

25
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,044
He was a man...

26
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,754
...who made humility...

27
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,589
...and simple truth...

28
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:45,842
...more powerful than empires."

29
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:48,010
And Albert Einstein added:

30
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:52,890
"Generations to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this...

31
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,267
...ever in flesh and blood...

32
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:58,311
...walked upon this earth."

33
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:42,727
Tell me...

34
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,396
...do you think about hell?

35
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:48,566
No, neither do I.

36
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,860
But this man here...

37
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,488
...is a Christian, and he's written
that in order to believe...

38
00:06:58,658 --> 00:06:59,784
Excuse me, sir.

39
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:02,454
How long have you been
in South Africa?

40
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:03,788
A week.

41
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:06,457
I don't know how you got a ticket.

42
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,502
Just what are you doing
in this car, coolie?

43
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,546
Why, I have a ticket.

44
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:15,048
A first-class ticket.

45
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:18,885
- How did you get it?
- I sent for it in the post.

46
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,387
I'm an attorney.
I didn't...

47
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:22,806
There are no coloured attorneys
in South Africa.

48
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,223
Sit where you belong!

49
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:26,601
I'll take your luggage back, sir.

50
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,728
Just a moment, please.

51
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:30,688
You see?

52
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:34,399
Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.

53
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:37,736
I'm going to conduct a case
for an Indian trading firm.

54
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:42,657
Didn't you hear me? There are no
coloured attorneys in South Africa.

55
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:45,243
I was called to the bar in London...

56
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:48,704
...and enrolled at
the High Court of Chancery.

57
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:50,831
I am, therefore, an attorney.

58
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,584
And since I am,
in your eyes, coloured...

59
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,086
...I think we can deduce
that there is at least...

60
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:58,171
...one coloured attorney
in South Africa.

61
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:01,341
Smart bloody Kaffir!

62
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:02,634
Throw him out.

63
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:05,219
Just move your black ass
back to third class...

64
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,847
...or I'll have you thrown off
at the next station.

65
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,849
But I always go first class!

66
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,414
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?

67
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:24,042
Yes, I am rich. But I am Indian.

68
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,586
I do not expect
to travel first class.

69
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:29,213
- In England, I was a poor student.
- That was England.

70
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:31,090
This is part of England's Empire.

71
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:36,053
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and
you see a successful Muslim trader.

72
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:39,097
Most South Africans see him
simply as an Indian.

73
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:43,059
And the vast majority of Indians,
mostly Hindus, like yourself...

74
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:46,229
...were brought here to
work mines and harvest crops.

75
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,939
Most Europeans don't want them
doing anything else.

76
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,566
But that is very unchristian...

77
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:53,027
Mr. Gandhi, in this country...

78
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:57,072
...lndians are not allowed to walk
along the pavement with a Christian.

79
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,244
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker
as your attorney...

80
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,079
...but you can't walk down
the street with him?

81
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,831
Well, I can.

82
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:10,292
But I risk being kicked
into the gutter by someone...

83
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:13,128
...less holy than Mr. Baker.

84
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,098
Well, then it must be fought.

85
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:27,683
We are children of God
like everyone else.

86
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,185
Allah be praised!

87
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:31,896
And what battalions
will you call upon?

88
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,818
I will write to the press...

89
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:40,278
...here and in England.

90
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:41,863
I will use the courts.

91
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:44,532
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is...

92
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:47,326
We are members of the Empire.

93
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,539
And we come from
an ancient civilization.

94
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:55,375
Why should we not walk on
the pavements like other men?

95
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:59,671
I rather like the idea of
an Indian barrister in South Africa.

96
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:03,967
I'm sure our community could
keep you in work for some time...

97
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:06,928
...even if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

98
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:11,932
Especially if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

99
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,495
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.

100
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,958
You also said your article
would draw a thousand people.

101
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:45,838
At least some of the Hindus
brought their wives.

102
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,675
No, I asked my wife
to organize that.

103
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,636
Some of them are leaving.

104
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,354
"Ladies and gentlemen:

105
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:07,775
We have asked you to gather here
to help us proclaim our right...

106
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:11,153
...to be treated as equal citizens
of the Empire.

107
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,447
We do not seek conflict.

108
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:17,659
We know the strength of
the forces arrayed against us...

109
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:22,747
...know that because of them,
we can only use peaceful means.

110
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:26,292
But we are determined
that justice will be done.

111
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:31,672
The symbol of our status
is embodied in this pass...

112
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:34,216
...which we must carry
at all times...

113
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,302
...but which no European
even has to have.

114
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,388
The first step towards
changing our status...

115
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:43,766
...is to eliminate
this difference between us."

116
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:53,025
Now?

117
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:02,617
You write brilliantly, but you have
much to learn about handling men.

118
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,163
"We do not want to ignite...

119
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,791
...the fear or hatred of anyone.

120
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,751
But we ask you...

121
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,213
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...

122
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,257
...to help us light up the sky...

123
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,802
...and the minds of
the British authorities...

124
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,180
...with our defiance
of this injustice."

125
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:32,394
We will now burn the passes of
our committee and its supporters.

126
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,773
We ask you to put
your passes on the fire...

127
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,316
You bloody dog!

128
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:45,406
Those passes...

129
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,992
...are government property!

130
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:52,496
And I will arrest the first man
who tries to burn one!

131
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:05,383
Take him away.

132
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:28,487
You little...

133
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:30,114
...Sammy...

134
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:31,615
...bastard!

135
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:36,119
Now! Are there any more?

136
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,539
If you want this kind of trouble,
you can have it.

137
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,646
Let me go!

138
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:07,690
Let me go!

139
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,917
Stop.

140
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:49,478
The London papers have
arrived from the Cape.

141
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,105
The worst was the Daily Mail.

142
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:52,648
They said the burning of passes...

143
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:55,984
- Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
...-was the most significant act...

144
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:59,446
...in colonial affairs since
the Declaration of Independence.

145
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,948
They'll find we're better
prepared this time.

146
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:05,326
Mr. Gandhi will find
he's on a long hiding to nothing.

147
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:09,914
"A High Court judge confirmed
that Mr. Gandhi...

148
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:13,542
...would've been within his rights
to prosecute for assault...

149
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:16,878
...since neither he nor Mr. Khan
resisted arrest."

150
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,839
I told you about English law.

151
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:22,008
As I told you about English policemen.

152
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:24,302
Yes?

153
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:28,222
We're very pleased
to have you back, Papa.

154
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,724
And I am glad to be back.

155
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:31,767
Come.

156
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,354
Mind your face.

157
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:45,113
Tomorrow I'll tell you about
my days in a police hospital.

158
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:47,740
Come, come.

159
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,873
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.

160
00:16:57,124 --> 00:17:00,377
They're boys and they're Indian.

161
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:06,215
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time I speak.

162
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:13,931
I've got it.

163
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,940
You'd be Gandhi.

164
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,026
I thought you'd be bigger.

165
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:30,738
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

166
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,866
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.

167
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:35,367
I've come from India.

168
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,162
I've read a great deal about you.

169
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,331
Some of it good, I hope.

170
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,792
Would you care to walk?

171
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,879
You're a clergyman?

172
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:51,006
I met some remarkable people in India.

173
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:54,259
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.

174
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,386
- Does that surprise you?
- Not anymore.

175
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,388
At first, I was amazed...

176
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:01,307
...but when you're fighting
in a just cause...

177
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:05,853
...people seem to pop up, like you,
right out of the pavement.

178
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,981
Even when it's dangerous or...

179
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,694
Hey, look what's coming!

180
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:17,114
A white shepherd leading
a brown Sammy!

181
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:19,950
Perhaps we should...

182
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:21,743
Doesn't the New Testament say:

183
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:25,413
"If your enemy strikes you on
the right cheek, offer him the left"?

184
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:28,165
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord...

185
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,625
I'm not so sure.

186
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,294
I have thought about it a great deal.

187
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:34,546
I suspect He meant
you must show courage...

188
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:37,883
...be willing to take a blow,
several blows, to show...

189
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:40,760
...you won't strike back,
nor will you be turned aside.

190
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:44,889
And when you do that, it calls on
something in human nature...

191
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:48,726
...that makes his hatred for you
decrease and his respect increase.

192
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:52,271
I think Christ grasped that,
and I have seen it work.

193
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,731
Good morning.

194
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,316
Get off the pavement,
you bloody coon.

195
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:57,859
- Yeah, get off.
- Kaffir!

196
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,154
Colin, what you doing?

197
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:02,280
Nothing.

198
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,365
Come out where I can see you!

199
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,621
I said, what you doing?

200
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:13,874
We were just trying
to clean up the neighbourhood.

201
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,461
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone 10 minutes ago.

202
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:19,462
Get on!

203
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:27,595
You'll find there's room for us all.

204
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,979
- That was lucky.
- I thought you were a man of God.

205
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:42,442
I am, but I'm not so egotistical as to think
he plans His day around my dilemmas.

206
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:48,781
You could call it
a communal farm, I suppose.

207
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,492
But you've all come
to the same conclusions.

208
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,244
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,
your Bible.

209
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:57,664
It's always the simple things
that catch your breath.

210
00:19:58,123 --> 00:20:00,250
"Love thy neighbour as thyself."

211
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,418
Not always practised...

212
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:06,005
...but it's something we Hindus
could learn a lot from.

213
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:08,924
That's the kind of thing
you'll be seeking on this farm?

214
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,593
Well, we shall try.

215
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,678
Bad news, I'm afraid.

216
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:15,597
They're going to change the pass laws.

217
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:21,353
It's taken time...

218
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:23,855
...but it needed to be done fairly.

219
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,483
We didn't want to create an injustice
simply because Mr. Gandhi...

220
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,277
...was abusing our
existing legislation.

221
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:33,072
Just one moment, sir, please.

222
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:37,242
I beg your pardon.

223
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:40,370
But on a short trip...

224
00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:44,499
...I wouldn't spend too much time
on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.

225
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,501
It's a tiny factor
in South Africa.

226
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,130
Well, it is news at the moment.

227
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:54,133
I plan to report on
the condition of the mines here...

228
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,760
...as well as the economy.
- Good.

229
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:58,762
But I would like to meet
this Mr. Gand-eye.

230
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:00,513
Gandhi.

231
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,976
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...

232
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:08,062
...for these spiritually inclined
men of India.

233
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:11,190
But as an old lawyer,
let me warn you.

234
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,359
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet...

235
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:17,237
...however otherworldly he may seem.

236
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:20,365
But I'm sure you're enough
of a reporter to see that.

237
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:23,368
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.

238
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:30,458
So it's not spiritualism
or nationalism.

239
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,878
We're not resisting anything but the
idea that people can't live together.

240
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,296
You see?

241
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,882
Hindus, Muslims...

242
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,009
...Sikhs, Jews...

243
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,802
...even Christians.

244
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,513
Mr. Walker of the New York Times.

245
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,681
How you doing?

246
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,518
Without a paper,
a journal of some kind...

247
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,604
...you cannot unite a community.

248
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,940
You belong to a
very important profession.

249
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:02,987
And what do you think an important
professional should write...

250
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,741
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?

251
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,743
I don't know.

252
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,287
I'm still searching for a response.

253
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:13,330
You will respect the law?

254
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:18,919
There are unjust laws
as there are unjust men.

255
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:22,338
You're a small minority to take on
the South African government...

256
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:24,132
...not to mention the British Empire.

257
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:27,760
If you are a minority of one...

258
00:22:28,135 --> 00:22:30,387
...the truth is the truth.

259
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,515
Herman Kallenbach...

260
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,727
...our chief carpenter,
also our chief benefactor.

261
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:38,645
Vince Walker, New York Times.

262
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:40,814
This is quite a place
you've got here.

263
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:44,025
And you call it an ashram?

264
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:47,153
That's right.
The word only means "community."

265
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:50,656
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."

266
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:53,158
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.

267
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,077
I hope not.

268
00:22:57,954 --> 00:23:01,916
I hear that you also prepare
the meals and clean the toilets.

269
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,877
- Is that part of the experiment?
- Ba!

270
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:09,632
We will need another place set
for Mr. Walker's driver.

271
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:12,051
I will tell Tara.

272
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:17,764
Yes, it's one way to learn
that each man's labour...

273
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:19,724
...is as important as another's.

274
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,143
While you're doing it,
cleaning the toilet...

275
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:24,604
...seems far more important
than the law.

276
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:26,814
Please, come and join us.

277
00:23:27,064 --> 00:23:29,817
You'll need something before
your journey back.

278
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:33,237
- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yeah, sure.

279
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,706
What is it?

280
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,417
Sora was sent to tell me I must...

281
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,878
...rake and cover the latrine.

282
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:52,254
That's right.

283
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:54,298
Everyone takes their turn.

284
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,924
It is the work of untouchables!

285
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:59,052
In this place,
there are no untouchables...

286
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,179
...and no work is beneath any of us.

287
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:03,139
I'm your wife!

288
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,099
All the more reason.

289
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:09,395
As you command.

290
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:15,734
The others may follow you,
but you forget...

291
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,403
...I knew you when you were a boy.

292
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:20,196
It's not me.

293
00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:22,907
It's the principle.

294
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:26,828
And you will do it with joy
or not do it at all.

295
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,747
Not at all then.

296
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:35,794
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!

297
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:39,839
Go and leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!

298
00:24:40,674 --> 00:24:41,800
Have you no shame?

299
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:43,468
I'm your wife!

300
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,898
Where do you expect me to go?

301
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:01,651
What's the matter with me?

302
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:10,910
You're human.

303
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,788
Only human.

304
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,376
And it's even harder
for those of us...

305
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:23,338
...who do not even want to be
as good as you do.

306
00:25:27,383 --> 00:25:28,843
I apologize.

307
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,559
I must get back to that reporter.

308
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:40,854
And I must...

309
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:45,066
...rake and cover the latrine.

310
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:13,342
I want to welcome you all.

311
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,553
Every one of you.

312
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,140
We have no secrets.

313
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:30,274
Let us begin by being clear...

314
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,235
...about General Smuts' new law.

315
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,364
All Indians must now
be fingerprinted...

316
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:38,532
...like criminals.

317
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:40,533
Men and women.

318
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:44,787
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid.

319
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:46,539
Under this act...

320
00:26:46,998 --> 00:26:49,542
...our wives and mothers are whores.

321
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,420
And every man here is a bastard.

322
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:00,343
He has become quite good at this.

323
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:05,139
And a policeman...

324
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,643
...passing an Indian dwelling...

325
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:10,728
...I will not call them homes...

326
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:14,898
...may enter and demand the card of any
Indian woman whose dwelling it is.

327
00:27:15,107 --> 00:27:17,109
Goddamn them!

328
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,694
Understand...

329
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:23,656
...he does not have to
stand at the door.

330
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,284
He may enter.

331
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:27,827
I will not allow it!

332
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,830
I swear to Allah.

333
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:35,542
I'll kill the man who offers
that insult to my home and my wife...

334
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:38,462
...and let them hang me!

335
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:46,594
I say: Talk means nothing!

336
00:27:47,094 --> 00:27:51,390
Kill a few officials before
they disgrace one Indian woman.

337
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:55,227
Then they might think twice
about such laws.

338
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:59,481
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!

339
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,658
I praise such courage.

340
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:13,660
I need such courage...

341
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:17,164
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.

342
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:18,874
But, my friend...

343
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:24,253
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.

344
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,089
Whatever they do to us...

345
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,300
...we will attack no one...

346
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,468
...kill no one.

347
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:35,556
But we will not give
our fingerprints, not one of us.

348
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,518
They will imprison us. They will fine
us. They will seize our possessions.

349
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:44,022
But they cannot take away
our self-respect...

350
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,732
...if we do not give it to them.

351
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,984
Have you been to prison?

352
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,445
They beat us and torture us.
I say...

353
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:54,740
I am asking you to fight.

354
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:59,619
To fight against their anger,
not to provoke it.

355
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:04,749
We will not strike a blow.

356
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,919
But we will receive them.

357
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:09,628
And through our pain...

358
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:13,257
...we will make them see
their injustice.

359
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:15,133
And it will hurt...

360
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:17,761
...as all fighting hurts.

361
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:21,264
But we cannot lose.

362
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:23,600
We cannot.

363
00:29:25,643 --> 00:29:27,853
They may torture my body...

364
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,731
...break my bones...

365
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,608
...even kill me.

366
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:34,151
Then...

367
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,237
...they will have my dead body...

368
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:40,782
...not my obedience.

369
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,678
We are Hindu and Muslim...

370
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:07,265
...children of God, each one of us.

371
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:12,269
Let us take a solemn oath
in His name...

372
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,105
...that, come what may...

373
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,651
...we will not submit to this law.

374
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:05,359
God save our gracious King

375
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:10,698
God save our noble King

376
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:14,952
God save our King

377
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:18,510
These men are contracted labourers.

378
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:20,095
They belong in the mines.

379
00:32:20,345 --> 00:32:22,764
You put their comrades in jail.

380
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:23,806
When you free them...

381
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:26,350
...they will go back to work.

382
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:28,602
I've warned you.

383
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:30,896
We've warned each other.

384
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,824
I don't think that's very good.

385
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,075
Steady, steady.

386
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:31,452
Stop!

387
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:45,339
At the canter, charge!

388
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:49,385
We should lie down.

389
00:33:49,635 --> 00:33:50,469
Down!

390
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:54,473
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!

391
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:36,762
Follow me! Follow me!

392
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:58,657
Now what the hell do we do?

393
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,950
Let them march.

394
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,248
In our own sweet time,
in our own sweet way...

395
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:09,250
...we'll get them.

396
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:13,754
One law!

397
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:14,880
One king!

398
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,173
One law!

399
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,632
One king!

400
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:26,474
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.

401
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:31,395
But I would ask you, assembled
here in this house of God...

402
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:35,566
...to recognize that we are
witnessing something new...

403
00:35:35,816 --> 00:35:39,027
...something so unexpected,
so unusual...

404
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:42,030
...that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss.

405
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,159
What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...

406
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,036
...is ask questions about ourselves.

407
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:54,458
As Christians, those are
difficult questions to answer.

408
00:35:56,168 --> 00:36:01,131
How do we treat men
who defy an unjust law...

409
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,092
...who will not fight...

410
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,928
...but will not comply?

411
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:10,473
As Christians, or as people
who have not heard the word...

412
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,863
They're sparing no one, I see.

413
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,075
No, you were the surprise.

414
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,327
It has been all over the prison.

415
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:35,912
We thought they'd be too afraid
of the English press.

416
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:37,873
So did I.

417
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:50,301
I don't know who they've
left out there to do the work.

418
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:52,678
Have they touched the women?

419
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:57,224
My wife publicly defied the law.
They've arrested her and four others.

420
00:36:57,474 --> 00:36:59,351
It split the government.

421
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,061
Well, that's one victory.

422
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,815
If we hold firm,
it won't be the last.

423
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,108
Don't worry.

424
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,152
I've never seen men so determined.

425
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,696
You have given them a way to fight.

426
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:18,952
Gandhi!

427
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:20,995
I want Gandhi!

428
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:23,164
Which Sammy is it?

429
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:05,912
Mr. Gandhi.

430
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,999
I thought we might have
a little talk.

431
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:13,127
Thank you, Daniels.

432
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,381
Will you have a glass of sherry?

433
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,550
Thank you, no.

434
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:21,926
Perhaps some tea?

435
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,053
I dined at the prison.

436
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,310
Please, do come and sit down.

437
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,911
I've more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the act...

438
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,622
...that you have taken
such exception to.

439
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:58,418
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.

440
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:00,920
It's not quite that simple.

441
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:03,214
Somehow, I expected not.

442
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:06,217
I thought of calling for
a royal commission...

443
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,636
...to investigate the new legislation.

444
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,890
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repealed.

445
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:15,100
I congratulate them.

446
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:16,893
But they might also recommend...

447
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:21,439
...that all future Indian immigration
be severely restricted...

448
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:23,858
...even stopped.

449
00:39:32,157 --> 00:39:36,370
Immigration was not an issue
on which we fought.

450
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:39,914
It would be wrong of us
to make it one, now that we...

451
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:44,002
We are in a position of advantage.

452
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,469
I'm ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next 24 hours.

453
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:58,306
You yourself are free
as from this moment.

454
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:08,399
Assuming we are in agreement.

455
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:10,818
Yes, yes.

456
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:15,614
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer to go by taxi.

457
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:16,990
All right. Fine.

458
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:20,827
I'm afraid I have no money.

459
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,580
Neither have I.

460
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:28,084
I'm awfully sorry.

461
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:29,502
Daniels...

462
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:32,880
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

463
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:35,173
I beg your pardon, sir?

464
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:38,301
How far will you be going, Gandhi?

465
00:40:38,552 --> 00:40:43,097
Now that this is settled, I'd thought
seriously of going back to India.

466
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:47,184
But a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment.

467
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:56,818
Thank you.

468
00:41:02,323 --> 00:41:04,701
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

469
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:07,536
...but I can find my own way out.

470
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:26,095
Guard of honour!

471
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,014
Guard of honour!

472
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:31,058
Attention!

473
00:41:44,112 --> 00:41:46,614
Present arms!

474
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:54,830
- My God, he loves it!
- I'm sure he hates it.

475
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:58,291
Generals' reputations are
being made in France today...

476
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,168
...fighting on the Western front.

477
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:04,380
Not as military governors in India.

478
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:07,174
What the devil's going on back there?

479
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,136
Must be that Indian who made
all that fuss in Africa.

480
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:13,305
My cabin boy told me he was onboard.

481
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,891
There he is.

482
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,729
God, he's dressed like a coolie!

483
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:22,522
I thought he was a lawyer.

484
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:26,317
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused
to wear European clothes?

485
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,152
No, I haven't refused.

486
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:31,488
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

487
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:33,449
Will you support the war effort?

488
00:42:33,657 --> 00:42:38,495
If I wish to enjoy the benefits
and protection of the British Empire...

489
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:42,248
...it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defence.

490
00:42:42,457 --> 00:42:44,667
Now that you're back in India,
what will you do?

491
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,210
I don't know.

492
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,212
- I don't know.
- One more question.

493
00:42:48,462 --> 00:42:52,174
As an Indian woman, how could you
accept the indignity of prison?

494
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:55,427
My dignity comes
from following my husband.

495
00:42:55,677 --> 00:42:56,970
Thank you very much.

496
00:43:03,935 --> 00:43:06,604
Just a few words, then we'll
get you to civilization.

497
00:43:06,854 --> 00:43:07,980
May I?

498
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:21,201
I'm glad to be home...

499
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:28,666
...and I thank you for your greeting.

500
00:43:47,516 --> 00:43:48,809
I'll follow with your wife.

501
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,769
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.

502
00:43:54,982 --> 00:43:55,941
Who's that young man?

503
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:57,484
That's young Nehru.

504
00:43:57,692 --> 00:44:00,278
He's got his father's intellect,
his mother's good looks...

505
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:01,946
...and the devil's own charm.

506
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:05,741
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge...
Wave, wave!

507
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:07,910
He might amount to something.

508
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:18,295
I must say, when I first saw you as
a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...

509
00:44:18,545 --> 00:44:20,755
...I never thought I'd greet you
as a national hero.

510
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:22,882
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

511
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:24,759
Yes, you are!

512
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:27,887
It's been 200 years
since an Indian cocked a snook...

513
00:44:28,137 --> 00:44:30,389
...at the British Empire
and got away with it.

514
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:35,310
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.

515
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:04,379
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.

516
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:06,881
Too bad you came back third class.

517
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:08,549
He might have been impressed...

518
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:12,261
...by a successful barrister
who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.

519
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:15,222
Yes, I'm sure.

520
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:28,693
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?

521
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:33,155
No. I leave practical matters
to my husband...

522
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:35,699
...and revolution to my son.

523
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:39,869
Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...

524
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:42,122
...member of congress and leader
of the Muslim League...

525
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,706
How do you do?

526
00:45:43,957 --> 00:45:46,083
And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...

527
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:49,628
...is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

528
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:53,257
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

529
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:54,716
I have simply written...

530
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:58,261
...if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law...

531
00:45:58,512 --> 00:46:00,430
...it is an Indian's duty
to kill an Englishman...

532
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,224
...for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

533
00:46:03,683 --> 00:46:07,103
It's a clever argument. It may not
produce the end you desire.

534
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:11,690
We hope you'll join us in our
struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

535
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:15,944
Excuse me. May l, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.

536
00:46:16,194 --> 00:46:17,237
Excuse me.

537
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:21,074
Sorry to rush you.

538
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,994
He told the press
he'd support the British in the war.

539
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:26,913
That's nonviolence for you.

540
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:29,665
You know, Mohan...

541
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:32,418
...now I have a confession to make.

542
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:35,379
I didn't decide to come
to South Africa.

543
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,589
Professor Gokhale sent me.

544
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,718
We are trying
to make a nation, Gandhi.

545
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,637
But the British keep trying
to break us up...

546
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:48,599
...into religions,
principalities, provinces.

547
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,935
What you were writing
in South Africa...

548
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:53,687
...that's what we need here.

549
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,148
I have so much to learn about India.

550
00:46:56,356 --> 00:47:00,318
And I have to begin my practice again.
One needs money to run a journal.

551
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,905
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is Indian talk.

552
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:07,074
We want none of you imperialists here.

553
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:11,078
All right, I'll go
and write my report to the viceroy.

554
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,747
You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...

555
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,874
...and convert her to Christianity.

556
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,877
That's as much mischief
as you're allowed.

557
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,006
Come, let's find a quiet corner.

558
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:26,968
Now, you forget about your practice.

559
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:29,261
You have other things to do.

560
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:33,682
India has many men
with too much wealth.

561
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,061
And it's their privilege to nourish
the effort of the few...

562
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:42,148
...who can raise India
from servitude and apathy.

563
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:44,067
I'll see to it.

564
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,860
You begin your journal.

565
00:47:46,194 --> 00:47:47,361
I have little to say.

566
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:49,447
Come, let's sit down.

567
00:47:49,697 --> 00:47:51,699
India is an alien country to me.

568
00:47:52,074 --> 00:47:53,325
Change that.

569
00:47:54,368 --> 00:47:56,787
Go and find India.

570
00:47:57,037 --> 00:47:58,413
Not what you see here...

571
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:01,207
...but the real India.

572
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,293
You'll see what needs to be said...

573
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:07,296
...what we need to hear.

574
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:16,179
When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.

575
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:21,101
I knew I could die in peace.

576
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:25,313
Make India proud of herself.

577
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:54,755
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.

578
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:58,049
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.

579
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,802
Please! Come in.

580
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:02,804
No violence, please.

581
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:06,349
Let me hang on with two hands
or I will fall.

582
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:07,892
Englishman, sahib!

583
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:10,019
Come, there is room up here!

584
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,148
Put your foot on the window.

585
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,691
Come!

586
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,825
- What are you doing?
- I'm going nearer to God.

587
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:29,787
Charlie! Be careful!

588
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:32,206
Let go. Let go!

589
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:34,750
- Let go!
- Oh, dear!

590
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:48,429
Hello.

591
00:52:50,598 --> 00:52:53,392
You see?
It is most comfortable.

592
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:55,018
Sahib?

593
00:52:56,228 --> 00:52:57,270
Are you a Christian?

594
00:52:58,146 --> 00:52:59,731
Yes, I'm a Christian.

595
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:01,524
I know a Christian.

596
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:04,193
She drinks blood.

597
00:53:05,403 --> 00:53:07,446
Blood of Christ. Every Sunday.

598
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:12,826
Charlie!

599
00:53:17,414 --> 00:53:19,416
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.

600
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:21,501
Bend!

601
00:53:25,046 --> 00:53:28,966
Pray to God, sahib.
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.

602
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:31,927
I agree with Jinnah.

603
00:53:32,428 --> 00:53:36,139
Now that the Americans are in,
the war will be over soon.

604
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,808
The Germans are worn out as it is.

605
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:41,352
And our first act should be...

606
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,647
...to convene
a congress party convention...

607
00:53:45,148 --> 00:53:47,358
...and demand independence.

608
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:50,778
And we will speak
with one voice, united.

609
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:54,156
And we should invite Gandhi.

610
00:53:54,406 --> 00:53:56,158
What the devil's happened to him?

611
00:53:56,742 --> 00:53:58,535
He's discovering India.

612
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:01,496
Which is better than
making trouble where it matters.

613
00:54:01,746 --> 00:54:04,707
Invite him, let him say his piece
about South Africa...

614
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:07,126
...then let him slip into oblivion.

615
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,488
Insurgents.

616
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,407
They've derailed a troop train.

617
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:43,826
Keep clear!
Come on.

618
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:52,209
They've killed an English soldier.

619
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:02,886
We were asked for toleration.

620
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:06,180
We were asked for patience.

621
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:08,349
Some of us gave it...

622
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,726
...and some did not.

623
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:14,605
Their war is over.

624
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:18,024
And those of us who supported it...

625
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:20,777
...and those of us who refused...

626
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:24,364
...must forget our differences.

627
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:27,908
And there can be no excuses...

628
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:30,411
...from the British now.

629
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,538
India wants...

630
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,164
...home rule.

631
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,499
India...

632
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,751
...demands home rule!

633
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:55,934
Congratulations.

634
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:09,029
And let no one question...

635
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:11,240
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...

636
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,659
...not just for the Muslims...

637
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:14,952
...but for all India!

638
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,376
And now...

639
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:25,920
...l'm going to introduce to you...

640
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:28,089
...a man whose writings...

641
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:30,424
...we are all becoming familiar with.

642
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:34,761
A man who stood in high esteem
with our own beloved Gokhale.

643
00:56:35,012 --> 00:56:39,432
A man whose accomplishments in
South Africa will always be remembered.

644
00:56:39,724 --> 00:56:41,726
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!

645
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:45,980
Your journal has made great impact.

646
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:48,524
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.

647
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:51,819
I would be even more flattered
if what he said were true.

648
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:53,278
But it is true.

649
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:55,906
I read it. Often!

650
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:11,337
Since I returned from South Africa...

651
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,258
...l've travelled over much of India.

652
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:21,012
And I know that I could travel
for many more years...

653
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,474
...and still only see
a small part of her.

654
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:27,351
And yet, I already know...

655
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:29,478
...that what we say here...

656
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:33,524
...means nothing to
the masses of our country.

657
00:57:34,149 --> 00:57:37,694
Here, we make speeches
for each other...

658
00:57:38,445 --> 00:57:42,490
...and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines.

659
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:47,161
But the people of India...

660
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:48,704
...are...

661
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:50,706
...untouched.

662
00:57:51,665 --> 00:57:54,835
Their politics are confined to bread...

663
00:57:55,168 --> 00:57:56,503
...and salt.

664
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:59,130
Illiterate they may be,
but they're not blind.

665
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:02,634
They see no reason to give their
loyalty to rich and powerful men...

666
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:06,012
...who simply want to take over
the role of the British...

667
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,055
...in the name of freedom.

668
00:58:09,765 --> 00:58:12,601
This congress tells the world...

669
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,978
...it represents India.

670
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:17,355
My brothers...

671
00:58:17,814 --> 00:58:18,899
...lndia...

672
00:58:19,107 --> 00:58:22,610
...is 700,000 villages...

673
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:25,738
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...

674
00:58:26,822 --> 00:58:28,407
...and Bombay.

675
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:31,827
Until we stand in the fields...

676
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:35,956
...with the millions that toil
each day under the hot sun...

677
00:58:36,832 --> 00:58:40,001
...we will not represent India.

678
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:43,921
Nor will we ever be able
to challenge the British...

679
00:58:44,505 --> 00:58:46,215
...as one nation.

680
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:05,066
Have you read his magazine?

681
00:59:05,691 --> 00:59:06,817
No.

682
00:59:07,568 --> 00:59:09,153
But I think I'm going to.

683
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,200
Pull over.

684
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:16,993
This can't be the way.

685
00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:20,914
Yes, I'm sure this is
the direction India is taking.

686
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:24,917
To think I almost got
excited by Mr. Jinnah...

687
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:27,211
...when all this was awaiting me.

688
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:48,189
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.

689
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:53,819
- You'll find him under that tree.
- Thank you.

690
00:59:54,903 --> 00:59:57,280
I'm anxious to meet this new force.

691
00:59:57,739 --> 01:00:00,909
I try to live like an Indian,
as you see.

692
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:03,202
It's stupid, of course.

693
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:04,996
Because in our country...

694
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:07,748
...it is the British who decide
how an Indian lives...

695
01:00:08,624 --> 01:00:10,876
...what he may buy, what he may sell.

696
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:12,878
And from their luxury...

697
01:00:13,128 --> 01:00:16,882
...in the midst
of our terrible poverty...

698
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:21,428
...they instruct us on
what is justice, what is sedition.

699
01:00:21,678 --> 01:00:25,681
So it's only natural
that our best young minds...

700
01:00:25,932 --> 01:00:28,768
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...

701
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:30,686
...while greedily assimilating...

702
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:34,731
...every Western weakness as quickly
as they can acquire it.

703
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:39,778
If we have home rule...

704
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:41,613
...that'll change.

705
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:46,617
Would you, please?

706
01:00:48,703 --> 01:00:51,330
Why should the British
grant us home rule?

707
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,876
We must take
the peelings to the goats.

708
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,880
We only make wild speeches or
perform even wilder acts of terrorism.

709
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:02,757
We've bred an army of anarchists...

710
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:06,344
...but not one group that can
fight the British anywhere.

711
01:01:06,594 --> 01:01:08,471
Hello! Hello!

712
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:10,556
But I thought you were
against fighting.

713
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,976
Now just spread it around.

714
01:01:14,184 --> 01:01:15,727
There you are.

715
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:19,773
They like the new peelings
mixed in with the rotting ones.

716
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:25,069
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.

717
01:01:25,903 --> 01:01:29,657
The question is, do you fight
to change things or to punish?

718
01:01:29,865 --> 01:01:33,702
I've found we're all such sinners,
we should leave punishment to God.

719
01:01:33,952 --> 01:01:36,580
And if we really want
to change things...

720
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:39,332
...there are better ways
of doing it...

721
01:01:39,582 --> 01:01:42,961
...than derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.

722
01:01:43,169 --> 01:01:44,921
The fire is ready.

723
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:48,174
You see, even here...

724
01:01:49,383 --> 01:01:51,176
...we live under tyranny.

725
01:01:57,724 --> 01:02:00,477
What did I tell you?
Look at him!

726
01:02:01,186 --> 01:02:03,605
I can see the British shaking now.

727
01:02:21,162 --> 01:02:22,914
Hello!

728
01:02:23,164 --> 01:02:26,000
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.

729
01:02:28,169 --> 01:02:31,672
I've been trying to speak
to you for a long time.

730
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:35,592
Our crops.

731
01:02:35,842 --> 01:02:37,594
We cannot sell them.

732
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:40,305
We have no money.

733
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:43,641
But the landlords still
demand the same rent.

734
01:02:45,226 --> 01:02:47,687
We have nothing left.

735
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:33,562
Mr. Taylor, sir. Up here!

736
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:47,158
Jesus!

737
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,161
What the hell is going on?

738
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,538
I don't know, sir.

739
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,002
The agent got a telegram.

740
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,964
And it just said, "He is coming,"
and gave the time of the train.

741
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,096
Who the hell is "he"?

742
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:13,265
I don't know, sir.

743
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:39,497
Out of the way.
Come on, you!

744
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,547
- Who the devil are you?
- My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.

745
01:04:48,756 --> 01:04:50,549
Whoever you are,
we don't want you here.

746
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:53,802
I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves.

747
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:55,971
They seem to want me.

748
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:57,264
Now, look here.

749
01:04:57,514 --> 01:04:59,432
I'll put you under arrest
if you'd prefer.

750
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:01,643
On what charge?

751
01:05:06,022 --> 01:05:07,607
I don't want any trouble.

752
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:12,444
I'm an Indian travelling in my own
country. I see no reason for trouble.

753
01:05:15,072 --> 01:05:17,199
Well, there had better not be.

754
01:05:21,578 --> 01:05:23,454
Make way for the officer.

755
01:05:43,389 --> 01:05:45,015
For years...

756
01:05:45,557 --> 01:05:47,768
...the landlords have ordered us...

757
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:49,311
...to grow indigo...

758
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,521
...for dyeing cloth.

759
01:05:52,397 --> 01:05:56,276
Always, they took part
of the crop as rent.

760
01:05:57,277 --> 01:05:58,361
But now...

761
01:05:58,945 --> 01:06:02,990
...everyone buys their cloth
from England.

762
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:04,408
So no one wants...

763
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:07,119
...our indigo.

764
01:06:07,703 --> 01:06:08,787
The landlords...

765
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:11,873
...say we must pay our rent...

766
01:06:12,124 --> 01:06:13,541
...in cash.

767
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:16,920
What we could...

768
01:06:17,378 --> 01:06:19,005
...we sold.

769
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:22,049
The police have taken the rest.

770
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:23,801
There is...

771
01:06:24,135 --> 01:06:26,303
...no food.

772
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:29,431
I understand.

773
01:06:31,892 --> 01:06:33,268
The landlords are British?

774
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:45,696
What we can do, we will try to do.

775
01:07:05,923 --> 01:07:06,924
Shukla...

776
01:07:07,508 --> 01:07:09,676
...is all Champaran like this?

777
01:07:10,344 --> 01:07:11,803
Yes, Bapu.

778
01:07:12,137 --> 01:07:13,805
The whole region.

779
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:15,473
Hundreds.

780
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:16,599
Thousands.

781
01:07:19,352 --> 01:07:21,687
Some landlords have tried to help.

782
01:07:22,188 --> 01:07:24,064
But what can they do?

783
01:07:38,953 --> 01:07:41,747
- Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?
- Yes.

784
01:07:41,956 --> 01:07:43,999
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

785
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,251
I'm not sorry at all.

786
01:07:56,636 --> 01:07:59,097
Who did you say
would be buying the drinks?

787
01:08:02,516 --> 01:08:04,018
Oh, no!

788
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:14,110
Wouldn't you know, that's the best
innings I've had since Oxford.

789
01:08:14,402 --> 01:08:16,029
India's full of grief, old man.

790
01:08:16,404 --> 01:08:17,238
I've got no idea.

791
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:21,242
All I know is there's a riot or
something at Motihari in Champaran.

792
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:22,702
The whole company's ordered out.

793
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,386
I would like to see the prisoner.

794
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:56,024
On the left, sir.

795
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,534
Shades of South Africa.

796
01:09:07,785 --> 01:09:08,869
Not quite.

797
01:09:09,244 --> 01:09:10,829
They're only holding me...

798
01:09:11,038 --> 01:09:13,164
...until the magistrate's hearing.

799
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,417
Then it will be prison.

800
01:09:18,127 --> 01:09:19,837
Did they take your clothes?

801
01:09:21,464 --> 01:09:23,132
These are my clothes now.

802
01:09:25,092 --> 01:09:28,220
You always had
a puritanical streak, Mohan.

803
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:30,806
If I want to be one with them...

804
01:09:31,223 --> 01:09:32,766
...I have to live like them.

805
01:09:32,974 --> 01:09:34,309
Yes, I think you do.

806
01:09:35,435 --> 01:09:37,604
But thank God we all don't.

807
01:09:37,854 --> 01:09:39,814
My puritanism runs in a different way.

808
01:09:40,064 --> 01:09:42,024
I'm far too modest for such a display.

809
01:09:48,405 --> 01:09:51,491
Couldn't I be let in with
the prisoner? I am a clergyman.

810
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:06,630
They're calling you "Bapu."

811
01:10:06,922 --> 01:10:08,549
I thought it meant "father."

812
01:10:09,216 --> 01:10:10,676
It does.

813
01:10:11,676 --> 01:10:13,720
We must be getting old, Charlie.

814
01:10:16,806 --> 01:10:18,266
What do you want me to do?

815
01:10:21,811 --> 01:10:23,521
I think that you can help us most...

816
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:27,149
...by taking that assignment
you've been offered in Fiji.

817
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,237
I have to be sure...

818
01:10:32,863 --> 01:10:34,906
They have to be sure
that what we do...

819
01:10:35,115 --> 01:10:38,368
...can be done by Indians alone.

820
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:51,755
But you know the strategy.

821
01:10:51,963 --> 01:10:55,258
The world is full of people who
will despise what's happening here.

822
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,218
It is their strength that we need.

823
01:10:57,427 --> 01:10:58,803
Before you go...

824
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,015
...you could start us
in the right direction.

825
01:11:12,691 --> 01:11:14,609
I must leave from Calcutta...

826
01:11:15,735 --> 01:11:17,403
...and soon.

827
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:21,824
Say goodbye to Ba for me.

828
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:27,830
Well, I...

829
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:32,042
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.

830
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:36,171
Wherever you are,
you will always be in my heart.

831
01:11:57,315 --> 01:11:58,983
I'm going to clear the courtroom.

832
01:11:59,317 --> 01:12:00,568
I'm not sure we'd be able to.

833
01:12:00,776 --> 01:12:03,112
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.

834
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:05,155
And he's a lawyer.

835
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,075
I don't know where
they found the nerve.

836
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:11,369
I don't either, but the troops
won't be here till tomorrow.

837
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:14,039
How did the press get here
before the military?

838
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,041
That English clergyman sent
a number of telegrams yesterday.

839
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:20,586
I understand one of them
even went to the viceroy.

840
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:35,892
You have been ordered
out of the province...

841
01:12:36,142 --> 01:12:38,686
...on the grounds
of disturbing the peace.

842
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:47,486
With respect, I refuse to go.

843
01:12:50,364 --> 01:12:52,741
Do you want to go to jail?

844
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,200
As you wish.

845
01:12:59,622 --> 01:13:00,581
All right.

846
01:13:01,832 --> 01:13:03,584
I will release you on bail...

847
01:13:03,834 --> 01:13:07,713
...of 100 rupees
until I reach a sentence.

848
01:13:10,632 --> 01:13:12,842
I refuse to pay 100 rupees.

849
01:13:23,227 --> 01:13:25,187
Then I will grant release on bail...

850
01:13:25,437 --> 01:13:29,191
...without payment
until I reach a decision.

851
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:56,591
Gandhiji! Gandhiji!

852
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:04,390
We are from Bihar.

853
01:14:04,932 --> 01:14:07,142
We received a cable
from an old friend...

854
01:14:07,351 --> 01:14:09,061
...who was at Cambridge with us.

855
01:14:09,269 --> 01:14:10,604
His name is Nehru.

856
01:14:10,854 --> 01:14:12,898
- I believe you know him.
- Indeed.

857
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:16,568
He tells us you need help,
and we have come to give it.

858
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:23,199
I want to document coldly, rationally,
what is being done here.

859
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:24,783
It may take months.

860
01:14:25,034 --> 01:14:26,577
We have no pressing engagements.

861
01:14:26,827 --> 01:14:29,454
You will have to live
with the peasants.

862
01:14:30,038 --> 01:14:31,748
There will be risks.

863
01:14:50,724 --> 01:14:52,601
I don't know what
this country's coming to.

864
01:14:52,851 --> 01:14:53,893
But good God, man!

865
01:14:54,144 --> 01:14:57,939
You yourself raised the rent simply
to finance a hunting expedition.

866
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:02,485
And some of these others:
beatings, illegal seizures...

867
01:15:02,735 --> 01:15:04,778
...demanding services without pay.

868
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:07,364
Even refusing them water.

869
01:15:07,906 --> 01:15:09,324
In India!

870
01:15:09,574 --> 01:15:12,118
Nobody knows what it is to try
to get these people to work.

871
01:15:12,494 --> 01:15:14,496
You've made this half-naked
whatever-he-is...

872
01:15:14,746 --> 01:15:16,331
...into an international hero.

873
01:15:17,373 --> 01:15:21,460
"One lone man, marching dusty roads,
armed only with honesty...

874
01:15:21,711 --> 01:15:25,172
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle
with the British Empire."

875
01:15:25,422 --> 01:15:28,675
At home, children are
writing essays about him.

876
01:15:30,427 --> 01:15:33,054
What do they want?

877
01:15:33,305 --> 01:15:34,514
Gareth!

878
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:37,225
Yes, sir.

879
01:15:37,475 --> 01:15:39,644
There's a rebate on rents paid.

880
01:15:40,186 --> 01:15:42,563
They're to be free to grow crops
of their own choice.

881
01:15:43,064 --> 01:15:47,234
And a commission, part Indian,
to hear grievances.

882
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,615
That would satisfy him?

883
01:15:54,115 --> 01:15:55,617
And His Majesty's government.

884
01:15:56,493 --> 01:15:59,037
It only needs your signature
for the landlords.

885
01:16:08,253 --> 01:16:10,589
It'll be worth it
to see the back of him.

886
01:16:14,092 --> 01:16:15,593
Thank you, sir.

887
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:19,680
- We're too damned liberal.
- Perhaps.

888
01:16:20,723 --> 01:16:24,768
At least this has made the government
see some sense about what men...

889
01:16:25,019 --> 01:16:28,605
...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed,
and what they should be denied.

890
01:16:43,536 --> 01:16:45,412
Where is Mr. Gandhi?

891
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:48,457
He said he preferred to walk, sir.

892
01:16:48,707 --> 01:16:52,502
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.

893
01:16:53,003 --> 01:16:55,004
He came third class.

894
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,549
God, give me patience.

895
01:17:03,512 --> 01:17:05,347
My house is honoured.

896
01:17:05,598 --> 01:17:07,141
The honour is ours.

897
01:17:07,349 --> 01:17:10,060
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.

898
01:17:10,268 --> 01:17:14,397
He's interested in flowers. I told
him he could wander your garden.

899
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:17,859
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.

900
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,610
Thank you.

901
01:17:23,656 --> 01:17:26,200
Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.

902
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:28,785
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

903
01:17:29,036 --> 01:17:31,121
Mr. Patel you know.

904
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:33,957
Maulana Azad, my colleague
and a fellow Muslim...

905
01:17:34,165 --> 01:17:37,001
...and just recently
released from prison.

906
01:17:38,878 --> 01:17:40,254
Mr. Kripalani.

907
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:44,633
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.

908
01:17:45,509 --> 01:17:47,761
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

909
01:17:48,011 --> 01:17:50,097
Please sit down. Do sit down.

910
01:17:50,347 --> 01:17:54,726
Gentlemen, I've asked you to come
here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...

911
01:17:54,934 --> 01:17:57,770
...because I've had the chance
to see the legislation.

912
01:17:57,979 --> 01:18:00,148
And it is exactly as was rumoured.

913
01:18:00,565 --> 01:18:03,901
Arrest without warrant,
and automatic imprisonment...

914
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:06,695
...for possession of materials
considered seditious.

915
01:18:07,112 --> 01:18:10,449
And your writings
are specifically listed.

916
01:18:10,991 --> 01:18:12,993
So much for helping them
in the Great War.

917
01:18:13,201 --> 01:18:16,829
There is only one answer:
Direct action on a scale...

918
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,831
...they can never handle.

919
01:18:19,832 --> 01:18:21,292
I don't think so.

920
01:18:21,751 --> 01:18:25,296
Terrorism would only justify
their repression.

921
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:28,632
And what kind of leaders
would it throw up?

922
01:18:29,967 --> 01:18:32,719
Are they men that we'd want
at the head of our country?

923
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:36,014
I too have read
Mr. Gandhi's writings...

924
01:18:36,264 --> 01:18:39,892
...but I'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.

925
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:42,478
And I don't intend to submit
to that kind of law.

926
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,813
I must say, it seems to me...

927
01:18:45,064 --> 01:18:49,901
...that it's gone beyond remedies
like passive resistance.

928
01:18:50,777 --> 01:18:52,028
If I may...

929
01:18:52,237 --> 01:18:55,740
...l, for one, have never
advocated passive anything.

930
01:18:58,284 --> 01:18:59,160
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.

931
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:01,746
We must never submit to such laws...

932
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,456
...ever.

933
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:09,628
And I think our resistance must be
active and provocative.

934
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,923
May I?

935
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:18,928
I want to embarrass all those
who wish to treat us as slaves.

936
01:19:20,638 --> 01:19:22,014
Thank you.

937
01:19:25,434 --> 01:19:27,019
All of them.

938
01:19:27,686 --> 01:19:29,938
- Forgive my stupid illustration.
- Allow me.

939
01:19:30,188 --> 01:19:31,857
No, please.

940
01:19:32,065 --> 01:19:34,192
But I want to change their minds...

941
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:37,862
...not kill them
for weaknesses we all possess.

942
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:43,033
And what resistance would you offer?

943
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:47,454
The law is due
to take effect from April 6.

944
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,623
I want to call upon the nation...

945
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:53,668
...to make that a day of
prayer and fasting.

946
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:55,003
A general strike?

947
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:59,048
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

948
01:19:59,298 --> 01:20:02,760
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.

949
01:20:03,761 --> 01:20:05,012
No trains.

950
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:06,680
No factories.

951
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:07,890
No administration.

952
01:20:09,725 --> 01:20:11,435
The country would stop.

953
01:20:12,894 --> 01:20:15,438
My God, it would terrify them!

954
01:20:16,314 --> 01:20:18,483
350 million people at prayer?

955
01:20:19,192 --> 01:20:21,902
Even the English newspapers
would have to report that...

956
01:20:22,278 --> 01:20:23,946
...and explain why.

957
01:20:24,196 --> 01:20:26,740
- But could we get people to do it?
- Why not?

958
01:20:27,658 --> 01:20:29,993
Champaran stirred the whole country.

959
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:33,121
Thank you.

960
01:20:33,622 --> 01:20:35,540
They're calling you "Mahatma."

961
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:37,917
"Great Soul."

962
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:43,130
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where I live.

963
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:48,385
I think if we all worked
to publicize it...

964
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,845
...all of congress...

965
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,180
...every avenue we know...

966
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:56,893
I could get articles printed in most
of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.

967
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:10,655
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?

968
01:21:10,864 --> 01:21:13,742
Of course, the army will
always be loyal.

969
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,828
I'll have you know,
we've got 500 troops.

970
01:21:20,122 --> 01:21:23,918
They'll be damn hungry by morning,
I'll tell you that.

971
01:21:30,924 --> 01:21:32,342
Mr. Kinnoch.

972
01:21:33,051 --> 01:21:35,011
Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.

973
01:21:36,095 --> 01:21:37,388
Nothing's working, sir.

974
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:40,308
The buses, the trains, the markets.

975
01:21:40,683 --> 01:21:43,436
There's not even any ordinary
civilian staff here, sir.

976
01:21:43,769 --> 01:21:46,230
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

977
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,691
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.

978
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:51,943
The army had to take over
the telegraph...

979
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:55,947
...or we'd be cut off from the world.

980
01:22:01,827 --> 01:22:03,454
I can't believe it.

981
01:22:03,662 --> 01:22:06,248
He's going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay, sir.

982
01:22:06,498 --> 01:22:09,876
They've called for a parade
on Victoria Road.

983
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:11,586
Arrest him.

984
01:22:18,926 --> 01:22:21,345
He's to go to the visitors' room.

985
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:40,821
Bapu.

986
01:22:41,864 --> 01:22:43,449
You too?

987
01:22:44,783 --> 01:22:47,828
It seems less formal than Mahatma.

988
01:22:56,211 --> 01:22:59,547
Since your arrest,
the riots have hardly stopped.

989
01:23:00,214 --> 01:23:02,633
Not big, but they keep breaking out.

990
01:23:02,883 --> 01:23:04,385
I run to stop them.

991
01:23:05,135 --> 01:23:09,306
And Patel and Kripalani,
they're never at rest.

992
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:14,102
But some English civilians
have been killed.

993
01:23:17,105 --> 01:23:20,066
And the army is attacking
crowds with clubs.

994
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,611
Sometimes worse.

995
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:31,409
Maybe I'm wrong.

996
01:23:32,118 --> 01:23:34,454
Maybe we're not ready yet.

997
01:23:35,663 --> 01:23:38,082
In South Africa,
our numbers were small.

998
01:23:43,379 --> 01:23:46,632
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.

999
01:23:47,341 --> 01:23:49,968
They're more afraid
of terrorism than of you.

1000
01:23:50,469 --> 01:23:54,806
The viceroy's agreed to your release
if you will speak for nonviolence.

1001
01:23:57,767 --> 01:24:00,561
I've never spoken for anything else.

1002
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,753
England...

1003
01:24:28,086 --> 01:24:29,755
...is so powerful.

1004
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,840
Its army...

1005
01:24:32,048 --> 01:24:33,258
...and its navy...

1006
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:36,052
...all its modern weapons...

1007
01:24:37,178 --> 01:24:39,305
But when a great power like that...

1008
01:24:40,264 --> 01:24:42,350
...strikes defenceless people...

1009
01:24:43,142 --> 01:24:46,020
...it shows its brutality...

1010
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:47,312
...its own weakness.

1011
01:24:47,563 --> 01:24:50,399
Especially when those people
do not strike back.

1012
01:25:19,383 --> 01:25:21,552
Fighting back will not work.

1013
01:25:21,802 --> 01:25:24,013
And that is why the Mahatma...

1014
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:27,808
...begs us to take
the course of nonviolence.

1015
01:25:59,003 --> 01:26:01,756
Back away! Back away!

1016
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:13,016
But if we riot...

1017
01:26:13,642 --> 01:26:15,226
...if we fight back...

1018
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:18,646
...we become the vandals...

1019
01:26:18,896 --> 01:26:20,314
...and they become the law.

1020
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:25,944
If we bear their blows,
they are the vandals.

1021
01:26:27,196 --> 01:26:29,573
God and His law are on our...

1022
01:26:59,892 --> 01:27:02,436
Front rank, kneel in position!

1023
01:27:05,731 --> 01:27:07,232
We...

1024
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:09,985
...must have the courage...

1025
01:27:10,235 --> 01:27:12,445
...to take their anger.

1026
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:27,501
Should we issue a warning, sir?

1027
01:27:29,836 --> 01:27:31,630
They've had their warning:

1028
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:34,132
No meetings.

1029
01:27:38,177 --> 01:27:39,011
Fire!

1030
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:13,918
Take your time!

1031
01:28:35,647 --> 01:28:36,814
Corporal!

1032
01:28:37,231 --> 01:28:38,608
To your left.

1033
01:29:27,152 --> 01:29:28,612
General Dyer...

1034
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:32,532
...is it correct that you ordered
your troops to fire...

1035
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:35,118
...at the thickest part of the crowd?

1036
01:29:35,702 --> 01:29:37,495
That is so.

1037
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:45,377
1516 casualties with...

1038
01:29:46,962 --> 01:29:50,507
...1650 bullets.

1039
01:29:50,924 --> 01:29:52,592
My intention was
to inflict a lesson...

1040
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:55,887
...that would have an impact
throughout all India.

1041
01:30:01,225 --> 01:30:02,351
General...

1042
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:07,773
...had you been able to
take in the armoured car...

1043
01:30:08,398 --> 01:30:10,859
...would you have opened fire
with the machine gun?

1044
01:30:15,321 --> 01:30:16,781
I think, probably, yes.

1045
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:24,580
General, did you realize there were
children and women in the crowd?

1046
01:30:25,956 --> 01:30:27,374
I did.

1047
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:31,044
But that was irrelevant
to the point you were making?

1048
01:30:31,294 --> 01:30:32,921
That is correct.

1049
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:43,389
Could I ask you what provision
you made for the wounded?

1050
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:49,728
I was ready to help any who applied.

1051
01:30:52,105 --> 01:30:54,858
General, how does a child...

1052
01:30:55,358 --> 01:30:57,902
...shot with a.303 Lee-Enfield...

1053
01:30:58,736 --> 01:31:00,905
...apply for help?

1054
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:57,282
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you must understand...

1055
01:31:57,866 --> 01:32:02,537
...that His Majesty's government
and the British people repudiate...

1056
01:32:02,787 --> 01:32:07,082
...both the massacre and
the philosophy that prompted it.

1057
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,917
Now...

1058
01:32:09,126 --> 01:32:11,128
...what I would like to do...

1059
01:32:11,545 --> 01:32:15,966
...is to come to some compromise
over the new...

1060
01:32:16,174 --> 01:32:18,676
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...

1061
01:32:18,927 --> 01:32:22,096
...it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation.

1062
01:32:22,722 --> 01:32:24,390
We think it is time you recognized...

1063
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,726
...that you are masters
in someone else's home.

1064
01:32:29,812 --> 01:32:32,022
Despite the best intentions
of the best of you...

1065
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:36,276
...you must, in the nature of things,
humiliate us to control us.

1066
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:41,280
General Dyer is but an extreme
example of the principle.

1067
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:43,991
It is time you left.

1068
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,581
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...

1069
01:32:50,873 --> 01:32:52,958
...without British administration...

1070
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:55,210
...this country would be
reduced to chaos.

1071
01:32:55,544 --> 01:32:56,836
Mr. Kinnoch...

1072
01:32:59,005 --> 01:33:01,174
...I beg you to accept
that there is no people...

1073
01:33:01,424 --> 01:33:03,843
...who would not prefer
their own bad government...

1074
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:06,345
...to the good government
of an alien power.

1075
01:33:06,554 --> 01:33:09,348
My dear sir, India is British.

1076
01:33:09,598 --> 01:33:11,892
We're hardly an alien power.

1077
01:33:19,315 --> 01:33:24,278
Even if His Majesty could waive
all other considerations...

1078
01:33:24,528 --> 01:33:28,616
...he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects...

1079
01:33:28,866 --> 01:33:30,951
...who are a minority in this realm.

1080
01:33:31,201 --> 01:33:34,579
And experience suggests
that his troops...

1081
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:38,416
...and his administration
are essential...

1082
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:41,210
...in order to secure the peace.

1083
01:33:42,044 --> 01:33:45,381
All nations contain
religious minorities.

1084
01:33:45,589 --> 01:33:48,717
Like other countries,
ours will have its problems.

1085
01:33:49,009 --> 01:33:50,677
But they will be ours...

1086
01:33:51,053 --> 01:33:52,220
...not yours.

1087
01:33:53,388 --> 01:33:55,473
How do you propose
to make them yours?

1088
01:33:56,558 --> 01:33:59,018
You don't think we're just
going to walk out of India.

1089
01:33:59,769 --> 01:34:00,603
Yes.

1090
01:34:01,813 --> 01:34:02,688
In the end...

1091
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:04,398
...you will walk out...

1092
01:34:04,899 --> 01:34:08,444
...because 100,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control...

1093
01:34:08,652 --> 01:34:11,363
...350 million Indians
if those Indians refuse...

1094
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:13,240
...to cooperate.

1095
01:34:13,448 --> 01:34:15,909
And that is what
we intend to achieve.

1096
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:20,455
Peaceful, nonviolent
noncooperation...

1097
01:34:21,706 --> 01:34:24,375
...till you yourself
see the wisdom of leaving...

1098
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,544
...Your Excellency.

1099
01:34:29,505 --> 01:34:32,382
I said to him, "You don't
expect us just to walk out."

1100
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:34,468
And he said, "Yes."

1101
01:34:34,843 --> 01:34:37,429
What an extraordinary little man,
isn't he?

1102
01:34:37,637 --> 01:34:39,889
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."

1103
01:34:40,098 --> 01:34:43,100
For a moment, I was afraid they were
actually going to do something.

1104
01:34:43,351 --> 01:34:47,897
Yes, but I think it would be wise
to be very cautious for a time.

1105
01:34:48,314 --> 01:34:50,941
The Antiterrorist Act
will remain on the statutes...

1106
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:54,611
...but on no account
is Gandhi to be arrested.

1107
01:34:55,153 --> 01:34:57,322
Whatever mischief he causes...

1108
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:00,575
...I have no intention
of making a martyr of him.

1109
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:07,456
But now something worse is happening.

1110
01:35:07,665 --> 01:35:09,958
When Gandhiji and I were growing up...

1111
01:35:10,626 --> 01:35:13,462
...women wove their own cloth.

1112
01:35:14,546 --> 01:35:17,424
But now there are millions
who have no work...

1113
01:35:18,174 --> 01:35:23,095
...because those who can,
buy all they need from England.

1114
01:35:24,347 --> 01:35:26,557
I say with Gandhiji:

1115
01:35:27,224 --> 01:35:30,310
There is no beauty
in the finest cloth...

1116
01:35:30,561 --> 01:35:34,564
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.

1117
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,886
My message to you...

1118
01:36:08,762 --> 01:36:12,307
...is the message I have given
to your brothers everywhere.

1119
01:36:13,183 --> 01:36:15,518
To gain independence...

1120
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:17,896
...we must prove worthy of it.

1121
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:24,193
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.

1122
01:36:29,698 --> 01:36:30,532
Second:

1123
01:36:31,742 --> 01:36:35,287
No Indian must be treated
as the English treat us.

1124
01:36:35,537 --> 01:36:37,914
We must remove untouchability...

1125
01:36:38,123 --> 01:36:41,000
...from our hearts and from our lives.

1126
01:36:46,889 --> 01:36:48,223
Third:

1127
01:36:48,932 --> 01:36:51,601
We must defy the British.

1128
01:37:08,575 --> 01:37:12,829
Not with violence
that will inflame their will...

1129
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,500
...but with a firmness that will
open their eyes.

1130
01:37:18,126 --> 01:37:20,753
English factories make the cloth...

1131
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:23,464
...that makes our poverty.

1132
01:37:24,215 --> 01:37:27,217
All those who wish to
make the English see...

1133
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:32,305
...bring me the cloth from Manchester
and Leeds that you wear today...

1134
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:35,558
...and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi...

1135
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,311
...and in London.

1136
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:40,021
And if...

1137
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,189
...like me...

1138
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,110
...you are left with only
one piece of homespun...

1139
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:51,239
...wear it with dignity.

1140
01:38:34,446 --> 01:38:36,447
Thank you very much.

1141
01:38:37,115 --> 01:38:39,158
No, thank you, I can manage.

1142
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:42,620
Don't destroy my good intentions.

1143
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:44,872
I'm already feeling guilty
about travelling second class.

1144
01:38:45,122 --> 01:38:46,999
You've earned a few indulgences.

1145
01:38:47,249 --> 01:38:49,876
Perhaps, but Maulana's made
of sterner stuff.

1146
01:38:50,127 --> 01:38:51,753
Our trains met in Bombay.

1147
01:38:51,962 --> 01:38:55,089
And there he is, back in
that lot, the model disciple.

1148
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,216
There's another passenger.

1149
01:38:57,508 --> 01:39:01,262
A Miss Slade from London. She's
been writing to Gandhiji for years.

1150
01:39:01,554 --> 01:39:03,889
She's the daughter
of an English admiral.

1151
01:39:05,766 --> 01:39:07,601
What do you think the daughter
of an English admiral...

1152
01:39:07,809 --> 01:39:09,478
...proposes to do in our ashram?

1153
01:39:09,686 --> 01:39:12,731
- Sink us?
- From the looks of the luggage, yes.

1154
01:39:13,023 --> 01:39:16,568
She wants to make her home with us.
And Gandhiji has agreed.

1155
01:39:16,818 --> 01:39:18,403
Miss Slade!

1156
01:39:19,112 --> 01:39:20,696
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

1157
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:24,158
And you would be Miss Slade?

1158
01:39:24,533 --> 01:39:26,994
I prefer the name
Gandhiji has given me:

1159
01:39:27,202 --> 01:39:28,495
Mirabehn.

1160
01:39:34,459 --> 01:39:38,421
Don't pull it so fast.
You'll break it again.

1161
01:39:45,177 --> 01:39:48,430
Leave it. Leave it.

1162
01:39:48,722 --> 01:39:50,766
God gave you 10 thumbs.

1163
01:39:51,016 --> 01:39:52,183
Eleven.

1164
01:39:56,521 --> 01:39:58,231
Sardar!

1165
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,030
Mirabehn!

1166
01:40:12,619 --> 01:40:14,287
Come, come.

1167
01:40:15,997 --> 01:40:18,249
You will be my daughter.

1168
01:40:20,209 --> 01:40:21,711
But then...

1169
01:40:21,961 --> 01:40:24,046
...some rioting broke out...

1170
01:40:24,255 --> 01:40:27,090
...between Hindus and Muslims.

1171
01:40:28,008 --> 01:40:30,552
Violent, terrible.

1172
01:40:32,053 --> 01:40:33,805
Whether it was provoked...

1173
01:40:34,305 --> 01:40:36,182
...I don't know.

1174
01:40:37,016 --> 01:40:40,937
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal.

1175
01:40:42,688 --> 01:40:45,232
Some of the things
the military have done...

1176
01:40:45,607 --> 01:40:47,651
Is the campaign weakening?

1177
01:40:47,943 --> 01:40:51,029
The marches and protests are bigger,
if anything.

1178
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:53,156
But with the censorship here...

1179
01:40:53,907 --> 01:40:55,200
...they know more in England...

1180
01:40:55,825 --> 01:40:57,660
...than we do.

1181
01:40:57,869 --> 01:41:01,205
It saps the courage to think you
may be suffering alone.

1182
01:41:02,123 --> 01:41:03,707
They are not alone.

1183
01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:08,420
And martial law only shows
how desperate the British are.

1184
01:41:12,716 --> 01:41:14,968
Is that homespun?

1185
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:18,721
I sent for it from here.

1186
01:41:19,096 --> 01:41:20,014
I dyed it myself.

1187
01:41:24,435 --> 01:41:26,603
What do the workers in England
make of what we're doing?

1188
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:28,605
It must have produced hardship.

1189
01:41:28,814 --> 01:41:30,190
It has...

1190
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:33,151
...but you'd be surprised.
They do understand.

1191
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,569
Good.

1192
01:41:37,697 --> 01:41:40,032
Ba will have to teach you
to spin too.

1193
01:41:40,283 --> 01:41:42,284
- I'd rather march.
- First, spin!

1194
01:41:43,827 --> 01:41:46,246
Let the others march for a time.

1195
01:41:47,164 --> 01:41:49,833
I'll teach you all our foolishness.

1196
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:51,835
And you must teach me yours.

1197
01:42:00,301 --> 01:42:04,138
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!

1198
01:42:10,977 --> 01:42:14,939
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1199
01:42:28,619 --> 01:42:32,622
British rule must go!
British rule must go!

1200
01:42:39,378 --> 01:42:41,505
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!

1201
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:44,842
Help us!

1202
01:42:45,217 --> 01:42:47,386
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.

1203
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:49,763
Go on your way. On your way!

1204
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:51,765
Come back!

1205
01:42:54,184 --> 01:42:56,227
Help us! Help us!

1206
01:42:58,896 --> 01:43:00,773
Help! Help!

1207
01:44:32,107 --> 01:44:34,526
That's one bit of news
they haven't censored.

1208
01:44:38,154 --> 01:44:40,406
Now it's all over the world.

1209
01:44:40,656 --> 01:44:43,576
India's "nonviolence."

1210
01:44:45,661 --> 01:44:47,246
What can we do?

1211
01:44:47,829 --> 01:44:49,539
We must end the campaign.

1212
01:44:52,876 --> 01:44:56,462
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.

1213
01:44:56,713 --> 01:45:01,300
An eye for an eye only ends up
making the whole world blind.

1214
01:45:01,801 --> 01:45:04,220
Do you know the sacrifices
people have made?

1215
01:45:04,428 --> 01:45:06,805
We'd never get the same
commitment again, ever.

1216
01:45:07,014 --> 01:45:09,975
The whole of India is on the move!

1217
01:45:10,183 --> 01:45:12,435
Yes, but in what direction?

1218
01:45:12,727 --> 01:45:16,606
If we obtain our freedom by murder and
bloodshed, I want no part of it.

1219
01:45:20,276 --> 01:45:22,903
You are the father of the nation.

1220
01:45:23,154 --> 01:45:26,281
Today, I see no ground in that
for anything but shame.

1221
01:45:29,451 --> 01:45:31,995
This was one incident.

1222
01:45:32,245 --> 01:45:35,123
Tell that to the families of
the policemen who died.

1223
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:44,298
The whole nation is marching.

1224
01:45:44,673 --> 01:45:47,801
They wouldn't stop,
even if we asked them to.

1225
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:52,097
I will ask.

1226
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:57,185
And I will fast as a penance
for my part in arousing such emotions.

1227
01:45:57,393 --> 01:46:00,021
And I will not stop until they stop.

1228
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,940
But...

1229
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:06,485
God! You can be sure
the British won't censor that.

1230
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:08,779
They'll put it on every street corner.

1231
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,950
People are aroused.

1232
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:15,910
They won't stop!

1233
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:20,581
If I die, perhaps they will stop.

1234
01:46:59,951 --> 01:47:02,828
I must get ready for morning prayers.

1235
01:47:03,078 --> 01:47:05,080
Mirabehn is here.

1236
01:47:51,665 --> 01:47:53,875
I've brought your drinking water.

1237
01:48:06,678 --> 01:48:09,890
There's a little lemon juice in it.
That's all.

1238
01:48:22,693 --> 01:48:25,779
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.

1239
01:48:26,363 --> 01:48:28,156
There was a telegram.

1240
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:31,451
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.

1241
01:48:31,868 --> 01:48:33,703
When it is everywhere...

1242
01:48:35,163 --> 01:48:37,832
...then my prayers will be answered.

1243
01:48:41,794 --> 01:48:43,921
Do you find me stubborn?

1244
01:48:44,755 --> 01:48:46,006
I don't know.

1245
01:48:47,007 --> 01:48:49,134
I know that you are right.

1246
01:48:49,593 --> 01:48:52,053
I don't know that this is right.

1247
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:56,432
May I turn you?

1248
01:49:10,028 --> 01:49:12,155
When I despair...

1249
01:49:12,656 --> 01:49:16,159
...I remember that
all through history...

1250
01:49:17,035 --> 01:49:21,247
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1251
01:49:23,207 --> 01:49:26,126
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1252
01:49:26,335 --> 01:49:30,464
...and, for a time,
they can seem invincible.

1253
01:49:30,672 --> 01:49:33,842
But in the end, they always fall.

1254
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:36,928
Think of it.

1255
01:49:38,513 --> 01:49:40,223
Always.

1256
01:49:42,141 --> 01:49:45,602
Whenever you are in doubt that
that is God's way...

1257
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:48,772
...the way the world is meant to be...

1258
01:49:48,981 --> 01:49:50,524
...think of that...

1259
01:49:51,942 --> 01:49:55,236
...and then try to do it His way.

1260
01:49:58,406 --> 01:50:02,952
And now, could I have
another feast of lemon juice?

1261
01:50:06,872 --> 01:50:08,373
Panditji!

1262
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,178
Jinnah...

1263
01:50:23,053 --> 01:50:24,221
...Patel...

1264
01:50:24,805 --> 01:50:28,934
...all of congress has called
for the end of noncooperation.

1265
01:50:29,184 --> 01:50:32,854
There's not been one demonstration.

1266
01:50:33,855 --> 01:50:38,609
All over India, people are praying
that you will end the fast.

1267
01:50:39,068 --> 01:50:40,653
They're walking in the streets...

1268
01:50:40,861 --> 01:50:43,614
...offering garlands to the police...

1269
01:50:45,699 --> 01:50:47,117
...and British soldiers.

1270
01:50:50,037 --> 01:50:52,372
Perhaps I have overdone it.

1271
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,227
- Good morning, Bapu.
- Good morning.

1272
01:51:16,519 --> 01:51:19,772
Don't let him go.
If he bumps me, I'm done for.

1273
01:51:19,981 --> 01:51:21,899
Don't worry, I won't let him go.

1274
01:51:50,717 --> 01:51:52,344
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...

1275
01:51:52,552 --> 01:51:54,095
...but you're under arrest.

1276
01:51:54,429 --> 01:51:56,097
On what charge?

1277
01:51:56,347 --> 01:51:57,724
Sedition.

1278
01:51:58,224 --> 01:52:00,142
You can't be serious.

1279
01:52:00,518 --> 01:52:02,228
This man has just stopped
a revolution.

1280
01:52:02,478 --> 01:52:03,687
That's as may be.

1281
01:52:03,938 --> 01:52:05,814
I only know what
I am charged to perform.

1282
01:52:06,065 --> 01:52:07,482
I don't believe it!

1283
01:52:07,733 --> 01:52:10,110
Even the British can't be that stupid.

1284
01:52:11,027 --> 01:52:11,903
Help me, please.

1285
01:52:12,988 --> 01:52:15,865
Mira, you must look after Ba.

1286
01:52:20,453 --> 01:52:24,581
If there is one protest, one riot,
a disgrace of any kind...

1287
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:26,208
...I will fast again.

1288
01:52:26,542 --> 01:52:27,751
Herman.

1289
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:30,337
I have been on many trips.

1290
01:52:30,921 --> 01:52:31,755
Monda.

1291
01:52:32,839 --> 01:52:34,799
This is just another trip.

1292
01:52:35,675 --> 01:52:37,552
I am at your command.

1293
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:46,351
I know we are not ready
for my kind of independence.

1294
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,730
If I'm sent to jail,
perhaps that is the best protest...

1295
01:52:49,938 --> 01:52:52,190
...our country can make at this time.

1296
01:52:53,191 --> 01:52:58,029
And if it helps India, I've never
refused His Majesty's hospitality.

1297
01:53:06,203 --> 01:53:08,372
Call the prisoner to the bar.

1298
01:53:54,372 --> 01:53:57,291
"Noncooperation has one aim:

1299
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,710
The overthrow of the government.

1300
01:54:00,002 --> 01:54:02,421
Sedition must become our creed.

1301
01:54:03,005 --> 01:54:04,923
We must give no quarter...

1302
01:54:05,174 --> 01:54:08,051
...nor can we expect any."

1303
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:10,512
- Do you deny writing it?
- Not at all.

1304
01:54:11,471 --> 01:54:13,390
And I will save the court's time...

1305
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:16,142
...my lord, by stating
under oath that, to this day...

1306
01:54:16,392 --> 01:54:18,686
...I believe noncooperation
with evil is a duty...

1307
01:54:18,895 --> 01:54:21,188
...and that British rule
of India is evil.

1308
01:54:22,231 --> 01:54:24,817
The prosecution rests, my lord.

1309
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:31,531
I presume you are conducting
your own defence.

1310
01:54:32,907 --> 01:54:35,577
I have no defence, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.

1311
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:38,496
And if you truly believe
in your system of law...

1312
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:43,459
...you must inflict on me
the severest penalty possible.

1313
01:54:54,636 --> 01:54:58,347
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you're in a different category...

1314
01:54:58,556 --> 01:55:01,559
...from any person
I have ever tried...

1315
01:55:02,393 --> 01:55:04,478
...or am likely to try.

1316
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:07,481
Nevertheless, it is my duty
to sentence you...

1317
01:55:07,689 --> 01:55:11,484
...to six years' imprisonment.

1318
01:55:21,744 --> 01:55:25,748
lf, however, His Majesty's government
should, at some later date...

1319
01:55:26,498 --> 01:55:29,543
...see fit to reduce the term...

1320
01:55:31,878 --> 01:55:34,798
...no one will be
better pleased than I.

1321
01:56:02,531 --> 01:56:04,825
Yes, I'm sure that's exactly
what they hoped:

1322
01:56:05,117 --> 01:56:08,370
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.

1323
01:56:09,037 --> 01:56:11,122
Maybe they could even subdue him.

1324
01:56:11,998 --> 01:56:14,000
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.

1325
01:56:14,209 --> 01:56:16,669
And as soon as he got out,
he was back, tramping the countryside...

1326
01:56:16,878 --> 01:56:20,464
...preaching nonviolence and
demanding a free India.

1327
01:56:21,882 --> 01:56:24,843
Everyone knows
another showdown's coming.

1328
01:56:26,595 --> 01:56:29,181
How does an American journalist
in Central America...

1329
01:56:29,389 --> 01:56:32,142
...learn that Gandhi was born
in Porbandar anyway?

1330
01:56:32,517 --> 01:56:34,352
I've been aware of him
for a long time.

1331
01:56:34,561 --> 01:56:36,562
He certainly makes good copy.

1332
01:56:36,896 --> 01:56:41,525
The other day, Winston Churchill
called him a half-naked Indian fakir.

1333
01:56:43,235 --> 01:56:44,445
I met him once.

1334
01:56:44,695 --> 01:56:46,363
- What, you mean Gandhi?
- Yeah.

1335
01:56:46,613 --> 01:56:48,907
South Africa, a long time ago.

1336
01:56:49,408 --> 01:56:51,326
I wonder if he'll recognize me.

1337
01:56:51,576 --> 01:56:52,619
What was he like?

1338
01:56:52,869 --> 01:56:55,079
He had a full head of hair then.

1339
01:56:55,496 --> 01:56:58,416
We were a bit like college students,
trying to figure everything out.

1340
01:56:58,624 --> 01:57:01,460
Well, he must have found
some of the answers.

1341
01:57:07,966 --> 01:57:11,803
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.

1342
01:57:12,053 --> 01:57:14,055
Helpmate.

1343
01:57:15,181 --> 01:57:19,852
Take the fourth step,
that we may be ever full of joy.

1344
01:57:21,145 --> 01:57:23,606
I will ever live devoted to you...

1345
01:57:23,856 --> 01:57:28,443
...speaking words of love
and praying for your happiness.

1346
01:57:29,778 --> 01:57:32,113
Take the fifth step...

1347
01:57:32,364 --> 01:57:34,115
...the walking around a fire...

1348
01:57:36,743 --> 01:57:39,829
...that we may serve the people.

1349
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:42,748
I will follow close behind you...

1350
01:57:42,957 --> 01:57:45,542
...and help to serve the people.

1351
01:57:47,252 --> 01:57:49,129
Take the sixth step...

1352
01:57:50,338 --> 01:57:53,883
...that we may follow
our vows in life.

1353
01:57:54,259 --> 01:57:58,679
I will follow you
in all our vows and duties.

1354
01:57:59,805 --> 01:58:01,932
Take the seventh step...

1355
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:07,896
...that we may ever
live as friends.

1356
01:58:10,023 --> 01:58:12,651
You are my best friend...

1357
01:58:13,777 --> 01:58:15,778
...my highest guru...

1358
01:58:16,696 --> 01:58:19,115
...and my sovereign lord.

1359
01:58:23,244 --> 01:58:26,246
And then I put a sweetened
wheat cake in her mouth.

1360
01:58:26,497 --> 01:58:29,041
And I put a sweetened
wheat cake in his mouth.

1361
01:58:29,291 --> 01:58:31,835
And with that, we were pronounced...

1362
01:58:32,127 --> 01:58:33,712
...man and wife.

1363
01:58:35,964 --> 01:58:38,508
We were both 13.

1364
01:58:50,852 --> 01:58:52,479
It's beautiful.

1365
01:58:54,022 --> 01:58:55,982
Even as a boy...

1366
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:57,692
...I thought so.

1367
01:58:59,735 --> 01:59:01,237
Thank you.

1368
01:59:02,321 --> 01:59:05,616
Trying to keep up with you
is like chasing a jackrabbit.

1369
01:59:07,492 --> 01:59:11,204
You've come because you think
something is going to happen.

1370
01:59:12,539 --> 01:59:13,498
Is it?

1371
01:59:14,249 --> 01:59:15,625
Perhaps.

1372
01:59:16,542 --> 01:59:18,503
I've come here to think about it.

1373
01:59:22,298 --> 01:59:24,383
Do you remember much
of South Africa?

1374
01:59:24,591 --> 01:59:27,094
Oh, yes. A great deal.

1375
01:59:29,471 --> 01:59:31,348
I've travelled so far...

1376
01:59:31,973 --> 01:59:34,184
...and thought so much.

1377
01:59:38,396 --> 01:59:42,525
As you can see,
my city is a sea city.

1378
01:59:43,859 --> 01:59:46,195
Always full of Hindus...

1379
01:59:46,403 --> 01:59:47,946
...Muslims...

1380
01:59:48,155 --> 01:59:50,365
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.

1381
01:59:52,826 --> 01:59:55,870
My family's sect was the Pranami.

1382
01:59:56,287 --> 01:59:57,580
Hindu, of course.

1383
01:59:57,789 --> 02:00:01,042
But in our temple,
the priest used to read...

1384
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:03,502
...from the Muslim Koran...

1385
02:00:03,711 --> 02:00:06,547
...and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other...

1386
02:00:06,755 --> 02:00:09,299
...as if it mattered not
which book was read...

1387
02:00:09,508 --> 02:00:11,384
...as long as God was worshipped.

1388
02:00:15,096 --> 02:00:16,347
When I was a boy...

1389
02:00:16,931 --> 02:00:19,058
...I used to sing a song
in the temple.

1390
02:00:22,561 --> 02:00:26,857
A true disciple
Knows another's woes

1391
02:00:27,065 --> 02:00:29,276
As his own

1392
02:00:29,776 --> 02:00:30,986
He bows to all...

1393
02:00:31,194 --> 02:00:33,405
...and despises none.

1394
02:00:34,697 --> 02:00:35,865
Like all other boys...

1395
02:00:36,074 --> 02:00:37,617
...I sang the words...

1396
02:00:38,284 --> 02:00:42,371
...not thinking what they meant
or how they might influence me.

1397
02:00:45,958 --> 02:00:48,001
I've travelled so far.

1398
02:00:49,294 --> 02:00:51,755
And all I've done is come back...

1399
02:00:52,547 --> 02:00:53,840
...home.

1400
02:01:04,058 --> 02:01:04,892
Wait a minute.

1401
02:01:06,518 --> 02:01:08,061
You know what you're going to do,
don't you?

1402
02:01:08,312 --> 02:01:09,688
It would have been uncivil of me...

1403
02:01:09,896 --> 02:01:12,649
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

1404
02:01:14,859 --> 02:01:16,778
- Where are you going?
- Come.

1405
02:01:18,613 --> 02:01:20,865
- Where are we going?
- Back to the ashram.

1406
02:01:21,115 --> 02:01:23,075
Then to prove to the new viceroy...

1407
02:01:23,325 --> 02:01:26,245
...that the king's writ
no longer runs in India.

1408
02:01:26,678 --> 02:01:27,721
Salt?

1409
02:01:27,929 --> 02:01:31,891
Yes, sir. He's going to march
to the sea and make salt.

1410
02:01:33,977 --> 02:01:37,355
There's a royal monopoly
on the manufacture of salt.

1411
02:01:37,563 --> 02:01:42,109
It's illegal to make it or sell it
without a government license.

1412
02:01:42,568 --> 02:01:44,778
All right, he's breaking the law.

1413
02:01:45,028 --> 02:01:48,323
What will that deprive us of?
Two rupees of salt tax?

1414
02:01:48,532 --> 02:01:50,075
It's not a serious attack
on the revenue.

1415
02:01:50,325 --> 02:01:53,244
Its primary importance is symbolic.

1416
02:01:53,453 --> 02:01:55,622
Don't patronize me, Charles.

1417
02:01:59,917 --> 02:02:03,212
In this climate, nothing lives
without water or salt.

1418
02:02:03,462 --> 02:02:07,549
Our absolute control of it is
a control on the pulse of India.

1419
02:02:08,383 --> 02:02:12,137
And that's the basis of
this declaration of independence?

1420
02:02:12,345 --> 02:02:13,596
The day he sets off...

1421
02:02:13,847 --> 02:02:17,850
...everyone is supposed to
raise the flag of "Free India."

1422
02:02:18,559 --> 02:02:23,272
And then he walks some 240 miles
to the sea and makes salt.

1423
02:02:27,526 --> 02:02:29,569
I say ignore it.

1424
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:32,280
Let them raise their damned flags.

1425
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:33,490
Let him make his salt.

1426
02:02:34,699 --> 02:02:37,785
It's only symbolic
if we choose to make it so.

1427
02:02:40,162 --> 02:02:41,831
He'll arrive at the sea...

1428
02:02:42,039 --> 02:02:45,167
...on the anniversary
of the Massacre of Amritsar.

1429
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:56,803
General Edgar is right.
Ignore it.

1430
02:02:57,220 --> 02:03:00,056
Mr. Gandhi will find
it takes a great deal more...

1431
02:03:00,306 --> 02:03:04,101
...than a pinch of salt
to bring down the British Empire.

1432
02:03:58,359 --> 02:04:01,237
You've done me a great service.

1433
02:04:01,487 --> 02:04:02,696
Not at all, sir.

1434
02:04:02,947 --> 02:04:07,034
It would be uncivil of us to let you
make such a long trip for nothing.

1435
02:04:21,922 --> 02:04:23,132
We'll go.

1436
02:04:23,382 --> 02:04:26,969
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1437
02:04:49,573 --> 02:04:51,449
Is it over if they arrest you now?

1438
02:04:51,658 --> 02:04:52,784
Not if they arrest me...

1439
02:04:53,034 --> 02:04:55,453
...or 1000 or 10,000.

1440
02:04:55,703 --> 02:04:59,624
It's not only generals
who know how to plan campaigns.

1441
02:05:00,291 --> 02:05:02,918
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?

1442
02:05:03,168 --> 02:05:04,461
Something for your notebook:

1443
02:05:04,878 --> 02:05:08,256
The function of a civil resister
is to provoke response.

1444
02:05:08,548 --> 02:05:10,258
And we will continue to provoke...

1445
02:05:10,467 --> 02:05:13,803
...until they respond
or they change the law.

1446
02:05:14,053 --> 02:05:17,181
They are not in control.
We are.

1447
02:05:17,807 --> 02:05:20,851
That is the strength
of civil resistance.

1448
02:05:25,522 --> 02:05:26,899
Vince!

1449
02:05:27,816 --> 02:05:31,444
- What did he say?
- He said he's in control.

1450
02:05:53,423 --> 02:05:55,466
Do you intend to walk all the way?

1451
02:05:55,717 --> 02:05:58,010
It's the only way
I can get the story.

1452
02:05:58,261 --> 02:06:00,679
Besides, my name is Walker.

1453
02:06:01,305 --> 02:06:03,599
"My name is Walker."

1454
02:06:57,773 --> 02:07:00,526
My dear Mrs. Nehru!

1455
02:07:54,993 --> 02:07:56,994
Man needs salt...

1456
02:07:57,203 --> 02:07:59,872
...as he needs air and water.

1457
02:08:00,414 --> 02:08:04,376
This salt comes
from the Indian Ocean.

1458
02:08:04,626 --> 02:08:08,505
Let every Indian claim it
as his right.

1459
02:08:10,048 --> 02:08:12,926
And so, once more,
the man of nonviolence...

1460
02:08:13,176 --> 02:08:16,429
... has challenged the might
of the British Empire.

1461
02:08:31,735 --> 02:08:34,696
They're making it everywhere, sir.
Mobs of them.

1462
02:08:34,946 --> 02:08:36,072
Publicly.

1463
02:08:36,322 --> 02:08:39,659
Congress leaders are selling it
on the streets of Delhi.

1464
02:08:40,201 --> 02:08:41,577
We're being made fools of, sir...

1465
02:08:41,827 --> 02:08:43,245
...around the world.

1466
02:08:43,495 --> 02:08:45,664
Isn't there any instruction
from London?

1467
02:08:45,914 --> 02:08:49,292
We're required to stop it.
And stop it we will!

1468
02:08:49,543 --> 02:08:51,961
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!

1469
02:08:53,004 --> 02:08:55,840
Arrest anyone, any rank,
except Gandhi.

1470
02:08:56,924 --> 02:08:59,135
We'll cut the strength
from under him.

1471
02:09:00,302 --> 02:09:03,639
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.

1472
02:09:21,155 --> 02:09:23,741
Jump to it!
Clear this beach!

1473
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:00,149
Don't hit back!

1474
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:01,942
No violence!

1475
02:10:12,077 --> 02:10:16,372
There must be 100,000 under arrest.
And it still goes on.

1476
02:10:16,622 --> 02:10:19,709
- Who's leading them?
- I don't know. Nehru, Patel...

1477
02:10:19,917 --> 02:10:24,129
...most congress officials are in jail.
And their wives and children.

1478
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:27,174
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.

1479
02:10:29,509 --> 02:10:31,469
Has there been any violence?

1480
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:34,556
In Peshawar,
the deputy police commissioner...

1481
02:10:34,764 --> 02:10:38,017
...lost his head and opened fire
with a machine gun.

1482
02:10:39,226 --> 02:10:42,229
But he's facing disciplinary court.

1483
02:10:42,479 --> 02:10:44,606
You can't expect things
like that not to happen.

1484
02:10:44,815 --> 02:10:49,486
The question was intended to discover
if there was any violence on their side.

1485
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,448
No, sir.

1486
02:10:53,698 --> 02:10:55,742
I'm afraid not.

1487
02:10:56,034 --> 02:10:59,912
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might...

1488
02:11:03,207 --> 02:11:05,792
He's addressed this letter
directly to you, has he?

1489
02:11:06,001 --> 02:11:07,169
Yes, sir, he has.

1490
02:11:07,419 --> 02:11:08,587
The usual thing:

1491
02:11:08,795 --> 02:11:11,006
"India's salt belongs to India."

1492
02:11:11,256 --> 02:11:12,257
Then he says flatly...

1493
02:11:12,507 --> 02:11:16,844
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow
on the Dharasana Salt Works.

1494
02:11:18,137 --> 02:11:19,972
Thank him for his letter...

1495
02:11:20,389 --> 02:11:22,224
...and put him in jail.

1496
02:11:23,976 --> 02:11:24,810
Yes, sir.

1497
02:11:27,521 --> 02:11:29,147
It'll be my pleasure.

1498
02:11:29,397 --> 02:11:31,650
- And Fields?
- Sir?

1499
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:34,319
Keep that salt works open.

1500
02:11:34,611 --> 02:11:36,404
Yes, sir.

1501
02:11:41,992 --> 02:11:43,035
I'm sorry, sir.

1502
02:11:43,243 --> 02:11:46,705
My orders are to allow regular staff
only through these gates.

1503
02:11:46,914 --> 02:11:48,290
Very well.

1504
02:11:50,333 --> 02:11:51,668
...in his name.

1505
02:11:51,876 --> 02:11:56,672
And for his sake,
we will not raise a hand.

1506
02:11:56,923 --> 02:12:00,092
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!

1507
02:12:02,344 --> 02:12:04,346
Long live Gandhiji!

1508
02:12:08,183 --> 02:12:09,976
We are ready!

1509
02:12:17,108 --> 02:12:19,193
I want firmness and discipline.

1510
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:42,298
- All right, take up your positions.
- Yes, sir.

1511
02:12:49,221 --> 02:12:51,514
To your mark. Forward!

1512
02:13:02,191 --> 02:13:04,318
Last night at midnight...

1513
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:06,737
...they took Gandhiji from us.

1514
02:13:08,238 --> 02:13:10,574
They expect us to lose heart...

1515
02:13:10,782 --> 02:13:12,492
...or to fight back.

1516
02:13:13,243 --> 02:13:15,411
We will do neither!

1517
02:13:46,815 --> 02:13:48,191
On your guard!

1518
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,583
No, sir.
The gate is closed!

1519
02:15:25,823 --> 02:15:27,032
"They walked...

1520
02:15:27,574 --> 02:15:29,618
... both Hindu and Muslim alike...

1521
02:15:30,619 --> 02:15:32,579
... with heads held high...

1522
02:15:33,037 --> 02:15:34,914
... without any hope of escape...

1523
02:15:35,415 --> 02:15:37,208
... from injury or death.

1524
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:40,795
It went on and on into the night."

1525
02:15:41,003 --> 02:15:42,004
Stop.

1526
02:15:42,213 --> 02:15:46,466
"Women carried the wounded
and broken bodies from the road...

1527
02:15:46,675 --> 02:15:49,177
...until they dropped
from exhaustion."

1528
02:15:49,386 --> 02:15:50,303
Stop.

1529
02:15:50,512 --> 02:15:54,015
"But still, it went on and on.

1530
02:15:55,808 --> 02:16:00,521
Whatever moral ascendancy
the West held...

1531
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:02,606
...was lost here today.

1532
02:16:03,399 --> 02:16:05,484
India is free...

1533
02:16:05,692 --> 02:16:10,572
... for she has taken all
that steel and cruelty can give...

1534
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:14,909
... and she has neither
cringed nor retreated. "

1535
02:17:25,349 --> 02:17:29,936
I am aware that I must have given
you much cause for irritation...

1536
02:17:30,145 --> 02:17:31,438
...Your Excellency.

1537
02:17:31,688 --> 02:17:34,691
I hope it will not stand
between us as men.

1538
02:17:39,236 --> 02:17:40,446
Mr. Gandhi...

1539
02:17:41,197 --> 02:17:44,533
...I am instructed to request
your attendance...

1540
02:17:44,742 --> 02:17:46,994
...at an all-government
conference in London...

1541
02:17:47,953 --> 02:17:52,832
...to discuss the possible
independence...

1542
02:17:53,041 --> 02:17:54,500
...of India.

1543
02:18:05,385 --> 02:18:07,763
Only recently released from prison...

1544
02:18:07,971 --> 02:18:11,933
... Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay
on the SS Rajputana...

1545
02:18:12,142 --> 02:18:14,978
... to attend the conference
on Indian independence...

1546
02:18:15,228 --> 02:18:19,482
... called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.

1547
02:18:20,608 --> 02:18:23,652
Mr. Gandhi, the sole
Indian Congress Party delegate...

1548
02:18:23,902 --> 02:18:26,363
... is staying at Kingsley Hall
in London's East End...

1549
02:18:26,572 --> 02:18:28,240
... for the duration of the talks.

1550
02:18:28,698 --> 02:18:30,909
He's seen here
amongst local cockneys...

1551
02:18:31,117 --> 02:18:33,077
... who have taken him
to their hearts.

1552
02:18:33,328 --> 02:18:34,996
Besides attending the conference...

1553
02:18:35,204 --> 02:18:38,165
... he has found time to meet
political and religious leaders...

1554
02:18:38,374 --> 02:18:40,334
... like Mr. Lloyd George...

1555
02:18:40,584 --> 02:18:43,796
... the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Bernard Shaw...

1556
02:18:44,004 --> 02:18:45,881
... and Charlie Chaplin.

1557
02:18:48,341 --> 02:18:50,719
He journeyed last week
from Kingsley Hall...

1558
02:18:50,927 --> 02:18:55,181
... to accept an invitation to tea
from King George and Queen Mary...

1559
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:58,851
... at Buckingham Palace
before attending the conference.

1560
02:18:59,101 --> 02:19:02,646
And I would emphasize
that I think our first duty...

1561
02:19:02,855 --> 02:19:07,067
...is to recognize
that there is not one India...

1562
02:19:07,859 --> 02:19:09,277
...but several.

1563
02:19:10,028 --> 02:19:11,946
A Hindu India...

1564
02:19:12,197 --> 02:19:14,407
...a Muslim India...

1565
02:19:14,616 --> 02:19:17,201
...and an India of princely states.

1566
02:19:17,451 --> 02:19:20,287
And all these must be respected...

1567
02:19:20,496 --> 02:19:22,081
...and cared for.

1568
02:19:22,331 --> 02:19:23,707
Not just one.

1569
02:19:48,897 --> 02:19:50,732
Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...

1570
02:19:50,982 --> 02:19:54,068
... the London Round Table Conference
on Indian Independence...

1571
02:19:54,277 --> 02:19:56,904
... journeyed north
to visit a cotton mill.

1572
02:19:57,446 --> 02:19:59,907
Although not dressed
for the Lancashire climate...

1573
02:20:00,116 --> 02:20:02,993
... Mr. Gandhi received
a warm welcome from mill workers...

1574
02:20:03,911 --> 02:20:05,454
... before heading back south...

1575
02:20:05,704 --> 02:20:08,290
... for a final meeting
with Mr. MacDonald.

1576
02:20:08,749 --> 02:20:13,586
The prime minister said the talks
were both constructive and frank.

1577
02:20:16,672 --> 02:20:19,050
So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.

1578
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:21,886
And bon voyage!

1579
02:20:23,929 --> 02:20:26,390
So the truth is,
after all your travels...

1580
02:20:26,598 --> 02:20:28,266
... after all your efforts...

1581
02:20:28,517 --> 02:20:32,395
...they've stopped the campaign
and sent you back empty-handed.

1582
02:20:32,812 --> 02:20:36,107
They're only clinging
to old dreams...

1583
02:20:36,357 --> 02:20:39,193
...and trying to split us
in the old way.

1584
02:20:39,902 --> 02:20:41,695
But the will has gone.

1585
02:20:41,946 --> 02:20:44,990
Independence will fall
like a ripe apple.

1586
02:20:45,199 --> 02:20:47,784
The only question is, when and how.

1587
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,953
Well, I say, when is now!

1588
02:20:52,205 --> 02:20:54,582
And we will determine how.

1589
02:20:54,932 --> 02:20:56,601
Precisely.

1590
02:20:57,018 --> 02:20:59,020
Bapu, she is limping again.

1591
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,938
It's only a sprain.

1592
02:21:01,397 --> 02:21:04,775
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.

1593
02:21:06,068 --> 02:21:08,737
Go. I won't be a moment.

1594
02:21:12,323 --> 02:21:14,325
They are preparing for war.

1595
02:21:15,159 --> 02:21:16,452
I will not support it.

1596
02:21:16,661 --> 02:21:20,498
But I do not intend to take
advantage of their danger.

1597
02:21:20,748 --> 02:21:23,125
That's when you take advantage.

1598
02:21:23,459 --> 02:21:26,295
That is just another way
of hitting back.

1599
02:21:27,546 --> 02:21:29,673
We've come a long way together
with the British.

1600
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:32,884
When they leave, we want to
see them off as friends.

1601
02:21:33,134 --> 02:21:38,097
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there is something I must attend to.

1602
02:21:44,353 --> 02:21:45,520
Mud packs.

1603
02:21:57,907 --> 02:21:59,825
Mr. Gandhi, sir.

1604
02:22:00,034 --> 02:22:03,704
I've been instructed to inquire as to
the subject of your speech tonight.

1605
02:22:03,912 --> 02:22:07,082
The value of goat's milk
in daily diet.

1606
02:22:09,125 --> 02:22:12,754
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.

1607
02:22:13,421 --> 02:22:15,006
Sorry, that can't be permitted.

1608
02:22:15,214 --> 02:22:16,257
Corporal!

1609
02:22:21,220 --> 02:22:22,471
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.

1610
02:22:22,721 --> 02:22:26,183
I have orders to return with you
and your companion to the ashram.

1611
02:22:26,933 --> 02:22:30,603
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.

1612
02:22:56,169 --> 02:22:57,962
Hold it a second, will you?

1613
02:22:59,588 --> 02:23:02,591
It was the Aga Khan's palace
before they turned it into a prison.

1614
02:23:02,841 --> 02:23:05,802
They're holding Gandhi
and congress politicians there.

1615
02:23:06,678 --> 02:23:10,181
Pandit Nehru and the others
are up at Ahmednagar Fort.

1616
02:23:11,975 --> 02:23:13,643
Not bad for a prison, eh?

1617
02:23:13,851 --> 02:23:16,354
I guess no place is good
if you're locked in.

1618
02:23:16,562 --> 02:23:18,606
Your timing's pretty lucky.

1619
02:23:18,856 --> 02:23:20,816
They had him cut off from the press.

1620
02:23:21,025 --> 02:23:24,820
But his personal secretary died,
so they let up on restrictions.

1621
02:23:29,950 --> 02:23:32,869
Yes, I have heard of Life magazine.

1622
02:23:33,119 --> 02:23:37,081
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.

1623
02:23:37,331 --> 02:23:41,252
But I don't know why either
should be interested in an old man...

1624
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:43,921
...sitting alone in prison...

1625
02:23:44,171 --> 02:23:47,632
...while the rest of the world
is blowing itself to pieces.

1626
02:23:48,466 --> 02:23:52,178
Well, you're the only man I know
who makes his own clothes.

1627
02:23:54,430 --> 02:23:58,309
But for me, that's not
much of an accomplishment.

1628
02:24:04,231 --> 02:24:08,151
No, prison is rather agreeable to me.

1629
02:24:08,485 --> 02:24:12,113
And there is no doubt that
after the war...

1630
02:24:12,363 --> 02:24:14,532
...independence will come.

1631
02:24:14,866 --> 02:24:15,992
My only worry...

1632
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:18,661
...is what shape it will take.

1633
02:24:18,911 --> 02:24:20,663
- Jinnah has...
- Stop!

1634
02:24:21,205 --> 02:24:24,541
I'm sorry, but...
Could you come forward, please?

1635
02:24:25,209 --> 02:24:27,419
- Come, come.
- Just up to the railing.

1636
02:24:27,669 --> 02:24:29,254
Thank you very much.

1637
02:24:31,673 --> 02:24:33,049
Now, sorry.

1638
02:24:33,258 --> 02:24:35,468
Go on. "What shape it will take..."

1639
02:24:35,676 --> 02:24:37,178
Jinnah has what?

1640
02:24:38,846 --> 02:24:42,474
Jinnah has cooperated with the British.

1641
02:24:42,683 --> 02:24:46,895
It has given him power
and the freedom to speak.

1642
02:24:47,145 --> 02:24:49,689
And he's filled
the Muslims with fears...

1643
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:52,108
...of what will happen to them...

1644
02:24:52,317 --> 02:24:55,278
...in a country that
is predominantly Hindu.

1645
02:24:55,987 --> 02:24:58,906
And that I find hard to bear...

1646
02:24:59,156 --> 02:25:00,824
...even in prison.

1647
02:25:01,033 --> 02:25:02,743
Mr. Gandhi?

1648
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:13,378
It's hard for me to see this as a
cure for the 20th century's problems.

1649
02:25:14,128 --> 02:25:16,714
I have friends who keep telling me...

1650
02:25:16,923 --> 02:25:20,885
...how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

1651
02:25:22,636 --> 02:25:27,307
But I know happiness
does not come with things...

1652
02:25:27,557 --> 02:25:29,184
...even 20th century things.

1653
02:25:29,434 --> 02:25:34,105
It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

1654
02:25:35,106 --> 02:25:38,025
India lives in her villages...

1655
02:25:38,275 --> 02:25:41,153
...and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed...

1656
02:25:41,362 --> 02:25:44,740
...if their local skills
can be revived.

1657
02:25:45,157 --> 02:25:48,160
Poverty is the worst form
of violence.

1658
02:25:48,910 --> 02:25:51,329
And a constructive program
is the only...

1659
02:25:51,538 --> 02:25:54,832
...nonviolent solution
to India's agony.

1660
02:25:55,541 --> 02:25:58,210
It will not necessarily be
progress for India...

1661
02:25:58,419 --> 02:26:02,715
...if she simply imports
the unhappiness of the West.

1662
02:26:05,342 --> 02:26:08,887
Do you really believe you could
use nonviolence against Hitler?

1663
02:26:10,889 --> 02:26:14,142
Not without defeats and great pain.

1664
02:26:15,351 --> 02:26:18,020
But are there no defeats in this war?

1665
02:26:18,729 --> 02:26:19,647
No pain?

1666
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:22,941
What you cannot do...

1667
02:26:23,192 --> 02:26:25,861
...is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

1668
02:26:26,069 --> 02:26:29,197
You must make the injustice visible.

1669
02:26:29,406 --> 02:26:33,034
Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

1670
02:26:36,454 --> 02:26:39,248
Is this what I'm meant to
end up with here?

1671
02:26:40,749 --> 02:26:42,835
That's what you get
for distracting me.

1672
02:26:43,043 --> 02:26:45,128
What do you expect
when you talk like that?

1673
02:26:45,337 --> 02:26:49,924
I expect you to show
as much patience as I am now.

1674
02:26:50,842 --> 02:26:54,137
Turn slowly and pull it gently.

1675
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:02,394
And that includes the life of women.

1676
02:27:03,062 --> 02:27:05,856
Bapu has always said...

1677
02:27:06,064 --> 02:27:08,900
...there were two kinds
of slavery in India:

1678
02:27:09,317 --> 02:27:13,071
One for women,
one for the untouchables.

1679
02:27:13,613 --> 02:27:16,908
And he has always fought against both.

1680
02:27:19,618 --> 02:27:22,871
Does it rankle,
being separated in this way?

1681
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:28,752
In Hindu philosophy...

1682
02:27:29,586 --> 02:27:31,046
...the way to God...

1683
02:27:31,254 --> 02:27:34,007
...is to free yourself
of possessions...

1684
02:27:34,966 --> 02:27:36,384
...and of passions.

1685
02:27:37,301 --> 02:27:41,680
Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

1686
02:27:45,434 --> 02:27:49,604
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

1687
02:27:52,232 --> 02:27:54,942
Four times he tried...

1688
02:27:55,693 --> 02:27:57,153
...and failed.

1689
02:27:58,904 --> 02:28:00,906
But then he took a solemn vow.

1690
02:28:03,742 --> 02:28:04,952
And he's never broken it?

1691
02:28:08,497 --> 02:28:09,664
Not yet.

1692
02:28:27,597 --> 02:28:30,934
- I've got permission to move her.
- I'm very sorry, sir.

1693
02:28:31,142 --> 02:28:33,978
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.

1694
02:28:34,228 --> 02:28:35,813
She'll never survive the trip.

1695
02:28:36,022 --> 02:28:38,983
It's better if we just
keep her here and hope.

1696
02:29:26,526 --> 02:29:29,362
It's time for my walk.

1697
02:29:31,781 --> 02:29:33,366
I won't be long.

1698
02:31:51,326 --> 02:31:52,160
Guard...

1699
02:31:52,619 --> 02:31:54,662
...present arms!

1700
02:32:10,510 --> 02:32:14,514
We have come to crown victory
with friendship.

1701
02:32:16,641 --> 02:32:19,852
To assist at the birth of
an independent India...

1702
02:32:20,102 --> 02:32:21,604
...and to welcome her
as an equal member...

1703
02:32:21,812 --> 02:32:24,231
...in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.

1704
02:32:25,524 --> 02:32:28,527
I am here to see that I am
the last British viceroy...

1705
02:32:28,735 --> 02:32:32,572
...ever to have the honour
of such a reception.

1706
02:32:45,042 --> 02:32:47,794
I am not concerned about
the independence of India.

1707
02:32:48,044 --> 02:32:50,255
I'm concerned about
the slavery of Muslims.

1708
02:32:50,505 --> 02:32:52,590
Please, Mr. Jinnah.

1709
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:55,426
I won't watch the mastery
of the British...

1710
02:32:55,635 --> 02:32:57,928
...replaced by
the mastery of the Hindus.

1711
02:33:04,434 --> 02:33:08,480
Muslim and Hindu are the right
and left eye of India.

1712
02:33:09,064 --> 02:33:11,858
No one will be master, no one slave.

1713
02:33:12,108 --> 02:33:14,402
The world is not made of
Mahatma Ghandis.

1714
02:33:14,652 --> 02:33:16,320
I'm talking about the real world.

1715
02:33:16,571 --> 02:33:18,155
- How the...
- The real India has...

1716
02:33:18,406 --> 02:33:22,284
...Muslims and Hindus
in every village and every city.

1717
02:33:23,702 --> 02:33:25,037
How will you separate them?

1718
02:33:25,579 --> 02:33:28,623
Where there is a Muslim majority...

1719
02:33:28,957 --> 02:33:30,750
...that will be Pakistan.

1720
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,586
The rest is your India.

1721
02:33:33,795 --> 02:33:34,796
My dear Jinnah...

1722
02:33:35,421 --> 02:33:39,341
...the Muslims are in a majority
on two different sides of the country.

1723
02:33:39,592 --> 02:33:43,637
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.

1724
02:33:43,887 --> 02:33:44,972
Gentlemen...

1725
02:33:45,222 --> 02:33:47,349
...I think perhaps
we should recommence.

1726
02:34:01,612 --> 02:34:05,407
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!

1727
02:34:32,891 --> 02:34:34,892
Thank God, they've stopped.

1728
02:34:38,354 --> 02:34:40,147
Manu. Abha.

1729
02:34:47,946 --> 02:34:49,489
I'm your granduncle...

1730
02:34:49,739 --> 02:34:53,076
...but I can still walk
either of you into the ground.

1731
02:34:53,284 --> 02:34:55,787
I don't need to be pampered
in this way.

1732
02:34:55,995 --> 02:34:58,247
Finish your quota of spinning.

1733
02:35:42,788 --> 02:35:44,540
Bapu, please don't do it.

1734
02:35:44,748 --> 02:35:47,459
What do you want me not to do?

1735
02:35:47,751 --> 02:35:49,794
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

1736
02:35:51,588 --> 02:35:53,590
I am a Muslim...

1737
02:35:53,923 --> 02:35:54,924
...and a Hindu...

1738
02:35:55,466 --> 02:35:57,551
...and a Christian and a Jew.

1739
02:35:58,386 --> 02:36:00,846
And so are all of you.

1740
02:36:03,015 --> 02:36:05,809
When you wave those flags and shout...

1741
02:36:06,143 --> 02:36:09,312
...you send fear into the hearts
of your brothers.

1742
02:36:09,521 --> 02:36:11,523
That is not the India I want.

1743
02:36:11,773 --> 02:36:12,857
Stop it!

1744
02:36:13,107 --> 02:36:16,068
For God's sake, stop it.

1745
02:36:33,626 --> 02:36:35,378
If you've finished your prayers...

1746
02:36:35,586 --> 02:36:38,381
...perhaps we could begin
our business.

1747
02:36:42,634 --> 02:36:45,596
My dear Jinnah...

1748
02:36:45,846 --> 02:36:48,723
...you and I are brothers...

1749
02:36:48,932 --> 02:36:53,144
...born of the same mother India.
If you have fears...

1750
02:36:53,353 --> 02:36:56,439
...I want to put them at rest.

1751
02:36:56,689 --> 02:36:59,650
Begging the understanding
of my friends...

1752
02:37:00,192 --> 02:37:03,779
...I am asking Panditji
to stand down.

1753
02:37:04,238 --> 02:37:08,241
I want you to be
the first prime minister of India...

1754
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:11,411
...to name your entire cabinet...

1755
02:37:11,619 --> 02:37:15,456
...to make the head of every
government department a Muslim.

1756
02:37:34,098 --> 02:37:36,267
For me and the rest...

1757
02:37:36,517 --> 02:37:38,644
...if that is what you want...

1758
02:37:38,853 --> 02:37:41,146
...we will accept it.

1759
02:37:42,514 --> 02:37:44,766
But out there...

1760
02:37:45,517 --> 02:37:47,143
...already there is rioting...

1761
02:37:47,352 --> 02:37:51,481
...because Hindus fear you are
going to give too much away.

1762
02:37:52,273 --> 02:37:54,358
If you did this...

1763
02:37:54,984 --> 02:37:57,445
...no one would control it.

1764
02:37:58,028 --> 02:37:59,488
No one.

1765
02:38:15,211 --> 02:38:16,879
It is your choice.

1766
02:38:18,255 --> 02:38:22,426
Do you want an independent India
and an independent Pakistan...

1767
02:38:22,801 --> 02:38:25,303
...or do you want civil war?

1768
02:39:02,129 --> 02:39:05,132
Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!

1769
02:41:38,397 --> 02:41:41,900
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,
was a miracle.

1770
02:41:42,317 --> 02:41:43,860
Miracle.

1771
02:41:44,361 --> 02:41:46,655
But millions are on the move...

1772
02:41:46,863 --> 02:41:48,990
...and no one can count the dead.

1773
02:41:51,242 --> 02:41:55,121
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.

1774
02:41:56,872 --> 02:42:00,501
The Muslims rose
and there was a bloodbath.

1775
02:42:01,585 --> 02:42:03,962
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.

1776
02:42:05,380 --> 02:42:06,881
If we can't stop it...

1777
02:42:07,090 --> 02:42:10,176
...there'll be no hope
for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

1778
02:42:11,427 --> 02:42:14,472
An eye for an eye,
making the whole world blind.

1779
02:42:16,807 --> 02:42:18,392
Aren't there any troops to spare?

1780
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:21,019
Nothing.

1781
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:26,233
Nothing.

1782
02:42:30,612 --> 02:42:33,531
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi
can hardly keep the peace now.

1783
02:42:33,781 --> 02:42:38,160
And each fresh bit of news creates
another wave of madness.

1784
02:42:38,369 --> 02:42:40,704
We could cut all news off.

1785
02:42:41,288 --> 02:42:42,873
Bapu, please, where are you going?

1786
02:42:43,457 --> 02:42:44,958
I don't want to hear more.

1787
02:42:46,418 --> 02:42:48,169
We need your help.

1788
02:42:48,712 --> 02:42:51,130
There is nothing I can give.

1789
02:42:54,175 --> 02:42:55,426
Where are you going?

1790
02:42:58,804 --> 02:43:00,139
Calcutta.

1791
02:43:43,428 --> 02:43:47,515
If I had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...

1792
02:43:47,724 --> 02:43:49,767
...nor would you be concerned for me.

1793
02:43:49,976 --> 02:43:51,936
But, sir, please.

1794
02:43:52,186 --> 02:43:54,605
I don't have the men to protect you...

1795
02:43:54,814 --> 02:43:57,566
...not in a Muslim house,
not this quarter.

1796
02:43:57,775 --> 02:44:00,903
I'm staying with the friend
of a friend and...

1797
02:44:01,111 --> 02:44:05,073
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1798
02:44:06,575 --> 02:44:08,743
Why are you staying
at the home of a Muslim?

1799
02:44:08,993 --> 02:44:10,161
They are murderers!

1800
02:44:10,411 --> 02:44:11,621
They killed my family!

1801
02:44:11,871 --> 02:44:13,831
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!

1802
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:16,834
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1803
02:45:05,629 --> 02:45:06,796
Prime Minister.

1804
02:45:11,801 --> 02:45:14,679
Why must I read news
like this in the paper?

1805
02:45:19,767 --> 02:45:22,352
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.

1806
02:45:22,895 --> 02:45:24,062
We will go Friday.

1807
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:26,064
Four days, sir?

1808
02:45:59,887 --> 02:46:02,431
Sardar, you have gained weight.

1809
02:46:02,681 --> 02:46:04,891
You must join me in the fast.

1810
02:46:05,100 --> 02:46:07,519
If I fast, I die.

1811
02:46:08,144 --> 02:46:12,315
If you fast, people go to
all sorts of trouble...

1812
02:46:12,523 --> 02:46:13,733
...to keep you alive.

1813
02:46:15,209 --> 02:46:16,836
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.

1814
02:46:17,419 --> 02:46:19,546
I could have come earlier...

1815
02:46:19,755 --> 02:46:22,215
...but your fast has helped.

1816
02:46:22,799 --> 02:46:26,511
These last days, people's minds
have begun to turn to this bed...

1817
02:46:26,761 --> 02:46:28,763
...and away from the atrocities.

1818
02:46:28,972 --> 02:46:29,847
But now...

1819
02:46:30,932 --> 02:46:31,974
...it is enough.

1820
02:46:34,644 --> 02:46:38,939
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.

1821
02:46:42,609 --> 02:46:46,237
Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...

1822
02:46:46,446 --> 02:46:47,655
...of all ages...

1823
02:46:47,906 --> 02:46:51,617
...are marching here,
in Calcutta, for peace.

1824
02:46:52,326 --> 02:46:55,955
And 5000 Hindu students
are marching with them.

1825
02:46:57,039 --> 02:46:58,832
I'm glad.

1826
02:46:59,666 --> 02:47:02,586
But it will not be enough.

1827
02:47:18,267 --> 02:47:21,687
You are not so young anymore.

1828
02:47:22,145 --> 02:47:23,688
Don't worry for me.

1829
02:47:25,065 --> 02:47:29,694
I cannot watch the destruction
of all that I've lived for.

1830
02:48:38,966 --> 02:48:40,509
Death to Gandhi!

1831
02:48:40,801 --> 02:48:43,095
Who dares say such things?!

1832
02:48:43,470 --> 02:48:44,763
Who?!

1833
02:48:46,056 --> 02:48:48,808
You kill me first!

1834
02:48:49,851 --> 02:48:51,019
Come!

1835
02:48:53,896 --> 02:48:55,314
Where are you?!

1836
02:48:56,232 --> 02:48:57,983
Kill me first!

1837
02:49:00,903 --> 02:49:02,237
Where are you?

1838
02:49:12,705 --> 02:49:16,333
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.

1839
02:49:31,848 --> 02:49:34,600
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

1840
02:49:34,892 --> 02:49:38,771
It was he who called
on the Muslims to rise.

1841
02:49:39,063 --> 02:49:40,564
He is now telling them...

1842
02:49:41,106 --> 02:49:43,608
...to go back to their homes...

1843
02:49:43,859 --> 02:49:45,777
...to lay down their arms.

1844
02:49:58,247 --> 02:50:00,415
Think what you can do by living...

1845
02:50:00,749 --> 02:50:03,877
...that you cannot do by dying.

1846
02:50:13,469 --> 02:50:15,846
What do you want?

1847
02:50:19,266 --> 02:50:22,060
That the fighting will stop.

1848
02:50:22,269 --> 02:50:24,813
That you make me believe...

1849
02:50:27,732 --> 02:50:30,568
...that it will never start again.

1850
02:50:39,910 --> 02:50:41,078
Sometimes...

1851
02:50:41,286 --> 02:50:45,040
...it is when you are
quite without hope...

1852
02:50:45,749 --> 02:50:48,835
...and in utter darkness...

1853
02:50:49,544 --> 02:50:52,755
...that God comes to the rescue.

1854
02:50:54,632 --> 02:50:56,050
Gandhiji...

1855
02:50:56,509 --> 02:50:58,093
...is dying...

1856
02:50:59,970 --> 02:51:02,639
...because of our madness.

1857
02:51:04,558 --> 02:51:07,143
Put away your revenge.

1858
02:51:07,477 --> 02:51:12,023
What good will come of more killing?

1859
02:51:12,273 --> 02:51:14,608
Have the courage to do...

1860
02:51:14,817 --> 02:51:18,237
...what you know is right.

1861
02:51:18,737 --> 02:51:20,656
For God's sake...

1862
02:51:21,281 --> 02:51:25,285
...let us embrace like brothers.

1863
02:51:39,173 --> 02:51:40,966
It's our promise.

1864
02:51:41,717 --> 02:51:42,968
We stop.

1865
02:51:45,637 --> 02:51:47,597
Hindu swords.

1866
02:51:48,932 --> 02:51:50,558
It's a promise.

1867
02:51:53,728 --> 02:51:55,146
Go.

1868
02:51:56,897 --> 02:51:58,315
God be with you.

1869
02:52:11,285 --> 02:52:12,745
Here, eat!

1870
02:52:14,246 --> 02:52:15,206
Eat!

1871
02:52:16,916 --> 02:52:18,459
I'm going to hell...

1872
02:52:18,876 --> 02:52:21,545
...but not with your death on my soul.

1873
02:52:22,129 --> 02:52:25,465
Only God decides who goes to hell.

1874
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:27,717
I killed a child.

1875
02:52:29,344 --> 02:52:32,138
I smashed his head against a wall.

1876
02:52:33,889 --> 02:52:35,182
Why?

1877
02:52:37,351 --> 02:52:39,144
They killed my son.

1878
02:52:42,230 --> 02:52:43,607
My boy.

1879
02:52:45,900 --> 02:52:48,153
The Muslims killed my son!

1880
02:52:53,074 --> 02:52:56,785
I know a way out of hell.

1881
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:00,539
Find a child.

1882
02:53:00,831 --> 02:53:05,835
A child whose mother and father
have been killed.

1883
02:53:06,211 --> 02:53:10,631
A little boy about this high...

1884
02:53:12,300 --> 02:53:14,969
...and raise him as your own.

1885
02:53:18,597 --> 02:53:21,934
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...

1886
02:53:23,727 --> 02:53:26,896
...and that you raise him as one.

1887
02:53:54,630 --> 02:53:55,464
Go.

1888
02:53:56,882 --> 02:53:57,716
Go.

1889
02:53:59,802 --> 02:54:01,345
God bless you.

1890
02:54:28,077 --> 02:54:29,037
Bapu?

1891
02:54:35,668 --> 02:54:37,962
There's been no fighting...

1892
02:54:38,587 --> 02:54:39,588
...anywhere.

1893
02:54:41,006 --> 02:54:42,466
It's stopped.

1894
02:54:43,258 --> 02:54:45,844
The madness has stopped.

1895
02:54:49,931 --> 02:54:51,516
It's foolish...

1896
02:54:51,724 --> 02:54:55,352
...if it's just to save
the life of an old man.

1897
02:54:55,603 --> 02:55:00,607
No. In every temple and mosque...

1898
02:55:00,983 --> 02:55:03,068
...they have pledged to die...

1899
02:55:03,318 --> 02:55:06,321
...before they lift a hand
against each other.

1900
02:55:08,823 --> 02:55:10,575
It is true, Bapu.

1901
02:55:18,749 --> 02:55:20,542
Everywhere.

1902
02:55:55,199 --> 02:55:57,534
Maulana, my friend...

1903
02:55:59,578 --> 02:56:02,122
...could I have some orange juice?

1904
02:56:09,003 --> 02:56:10,672
Then you and I...

1905
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:13,758
...will take a piece
of bread together.

1906
02:56:43,994 --> 02:56:46,204
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

1907
02:56:54,670 --> 02:56:56,505
That is how you eat muli.

1908
02:56:57,381 --> 02:57:00,008
I'm not sure that I want
to be remembered that way.

1909
02:57:00,217 --> 02:57:02,344
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.

1910
02:57:02,552 --> 02:57:06,181
No, he will be remembered
for tempting fate.

1911
02:57:07,348 --> 02:57:09,183
Mickey Mouse!

1912
02:57:10,393 --> 02:57:12,395
You're really going to Pakistan?

1913
02:57:17,274 --> 02:57:19,151
You are a stubborn man.

1914
02:57:21,236 --> 02:57:23,196
I'm simply going to prove...

1915
02:57:23,405 --> 02:57:25,991
...to Hindus here and Muslims there...

1916
02:57:26,241 --> 02:57:29,452
...that the only devils
in the world are those...

1917
02:57:29,702 --> 02:57:32,163
...running around in our own hearts.

1918
02:57:32,747 --> 02:57:36,208
And that is where all our battles
ought to be fought.

1919
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:48,636
So, what kind of warrior have you
been in that warfare?

1920
02:57:50,263 --> 02:57:52,014
Not a very good one.

1921
02:57:52,223 --> 02:57:54,934
That's why I have
so much tolerance...

1922
02:57:55,142 --> 02:57:58,395
...for the other scoundrels
of the world.

1923
02:58:02,816 --> 02:58:03,733
Sardar?

1924
02:58:04,651 --> 02:58:08,154
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

1925
02:58:14,618 --> 02:58:16,829
- Enough!
- One more.

1926
02:58:17,162 --> 02:58:19,873
- You're a temptress!
- Just an admirer.

1927
02:58:20,124 --> 02:58:22,250
Nothing's more dangerous...

1928
02:58:22,501 --> 02:58:24,669
...especially for an old man.

1929
02:58:34,136 --> 02:58:36,347
There's a sadness about him.

1930
02:58:37,890 --> 02:58:39,475
He thinks he's failed.

1931
02:58:39,725 --> 02:58:41,143
Why?

1932
02:58:41,393 --> 02:58:44,855
If anything's proven him right,
it's these last months.

1933
02:58:46,564 --> 02:58:49,108
I may be blinded by my love for him...

1934
02:58:49,859 --> 02:58:51,152
...but I believe...

1935
02:58:51,402 --> 02:58:53,571
...when we most needed it...

1936
02:58:53,779 --> 02:58:56,949
...he offered the world
a way out of madness.

1937
02:58:59,660 --> 02:59:00,994
But he doesn't see it.

1938
02:59:01,954 --> 02:59:03,872
Neither does the world.

1939
02:59:37,361 --> 02:59:39,530
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

1940
02:59:42,324 --> 02:59:44,117
Oh, God!

1941
02:59:44,910 --> 02:59:46,870
Oh, God.

1942
03:00:25,572 --> 03:00:27,574
When I despair...

1943
03:00:27,866 --> 03:00:29,784
... I remember...

1944
03:00:30,118 --> 03:00:32,370
... that all through history...

1945
03:00:32,578 --> 03:00:37,082
... the way of truth and love
has always won.

1946
03:00:38,917 --> 03:00:42,504
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1947
03:00:42,754 --> 03:00:45,799
... and for a time,
they can seem invincible...

1948
03:00:46,007 --> 03:00:49,427
... but in the end, they always fall.

1949
03:00:51,137 --> 03:00:52,680
Think of it.

1950
03:00:54,432 --> 03:00:56,058
Always.
