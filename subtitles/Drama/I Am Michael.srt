00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:04,969
Hi, I'm Michael.

2
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,664
Paul.

3
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:12,674
I hear you're
having some trouble.

4
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:17,683
It's okay.

5
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:20,516
It's okay.

6
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,616
I just...

7
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:26,592
Don't understand...

8
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:29,991
Why god made me like this.

9
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:32,054
He didn't.

10
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:34,123
Trust me.

11
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:37,242
Let me tell you something.

12
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:39,235
You should never
define yourself

13
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:41,667
by your choices
or your desires.

14
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:47,273
Gay doesn't exist.
It's a false identity.

15
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:51,378
This isn't my choice.
Why would I choose this?

16
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:54,092
You always have a choice.

17
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:58,952
You wanna go to heaven, right?

18
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:00,056
Yes.

19
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,727
If you're
a moral person,

20
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:05,155
then you'll choose
heterosexuality

21
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:07,962
in order to be with god.

22
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:43,734
Hey.

23
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:44,693
Hey. Hey.

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,770
Where you going?

25
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:48,138
I'm gonna make us breakfast.

26
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:48,767
No.

27
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:49,561
Yeah, come on.

28
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:52,402
Breakfast
is the most important part
of the day.

29
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,147
I'll have muffins
at my meeting.

30
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,643
Muffins?

31
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,714
Yeah, muffins.

32
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,113
Blueberry.

33
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:02,385
Mmm, blueberry.

34
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:05,414
Okay, then we'll
do lunch, okay?

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,250
Mmm, morning breath.

36
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:11,695
Oh, stop it!
Get off!

37
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,106
It's so cool
that you work at<i> XY.</i>

38
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,800
Yeah. Yeah, it's rad.

39
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:59,101
You guys are like
the only cool gay magazine
out there right now.

40
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,275
Oh, yeah, sort of.

41
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:29,258
Hey, listen up, queens.

42
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:32,297
<i> XY</i> magazine is taking over!

43
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,544
It's our time to shine!

44
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,732
<i> Matthew Shepard</i>
<i> was an openly gay man.</i>

45
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:08,145
<i> When he went to a laramie,</i>
<i> Wyoming bar last week,</i>

46
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,539
<i> these two suspects</i>
<i> lured him outside,</i>

47
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,571
<i> pretending to be gay.</i>

48
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:13,915
<i> Now they're charged</i>
<i> with a vicious attack</i>

49
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,681
<i> that left Shepard</i>
<i> hanging on this fence</i>

50
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,148
<i> for 18 hours</i>
<i> in freezing temperatures.</i>

51
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:21,318
<i> Shepard remained on</i>
<i> life support until this morning</i>

52
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,317
<i> when he passed away.</i>

53
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:25,188
<i> Shepard's family</i>
<i> is grateful for support</i>

54
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,218
<i> from around the world.</i>

55
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,299
They killed him
because they were afraid,

56
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:42,702
and they were afraid
because of what
their churches tell them

57
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:45,365
and because of what
they see in movies.

58
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,604
It's fucking ridiculous.

59
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:47,938
I hope they get
the death penalty.

60
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:50,753
You're against
the death penalty.
Not in this case.

61
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:51,906
That's like being
for free speech

62
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:54,644
until someone tells you
something that pisses you off.

63
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,450
He died a slow death

64
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,720
after being tied to a fence
and tortured.

65
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,419
Exactly, a slow death
is way more painful.

66
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:01,561
They should spend the rest
of their lives in prison.

67
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:04,527
Okay, look, we need
to move away from labels

68
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,526
because they segment
and they lead to persecution.

69
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,699
People don't wanna be
perceived as gay because...

70
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,700
They're afraid
they'll end up like Matthew.

71
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:16,372
But we are a gay magazine.

72
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,510
Identifying as gay
is being part of a community.

73
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:19,906
It's recognition,
it's progress...

74
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:23,777
We've been telling the kids
in the magazine to come out,
to be proud to be gay.

75
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:25,448
They should be proud
to be themselves.

76
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:28,946
Gay and straight
are just social constructs.

77
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,950
Ugh. God,
you and your queer theory.

78
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:34,692
Class is in session
with professor Michael glatze.

79
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:35,659
Shut up.

80
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:36,886
Okay, okay, look.

81
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:38,261
We need to put out the message

82
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,729
that being attracted
to the same sex

83
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:44,367
doesn't define who you are.

84
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:54,906
Hey.

85
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:58,742
Have you been smoking?

86
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,378
Just one.

87
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,450
Small one.

88
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:03,618
It was a small cigarette.

89
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:07,617
Busted.

90
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:10,882
Letters to the editor.

91
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,799
Ninety percent
are some poor teen
with religious parents.

92
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:19,693
Fucking Christian
fundamentalists
should burn in hell.

93
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,595
Uh, okay.

94
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,940
In the meantime,
there is a design competition

95
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:29,008
for the halifax
international airport.

96
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,308
I don't wanna move
to halifax.

97
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,849
I know, but my father
wants me to head up
the bid committee.

98
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:34,816
It's huge.

99
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:36,643
Halifax is so boring.

100
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,589
Your hometown is boring.

101
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,514
It's not.

102
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:40,288
Olympia?
Yeah.

103
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:44,355
It's all trees
and fog and coffee.

104
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:45,955
And the birthplace
of the riot grrrl movement

105
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:49,957
and where Kurt cobain
wrote most of<i> nevermind.</i>

106
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,591
Oh, well...

107
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,396
Yeah.
In that case...

108
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,038
But it's
unsustainable here,

109
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,693
unless you're in
the dot-com movement,

110
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:01,571
and I don't wanna live
in a studio on mission street

111
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:02,672
when we're 50.

112
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,534
Well, we won't be.

113
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:07,811
We'll be in a big mansion
on a hill. Duh.

114
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:12,443
<i> May 21st, 2000.</i>

115
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,679
<i> I used to imagine myself</i>
<i> growing old</i>

116
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:18,025
<i> while living in a house</i>
<i> atop a hill in the Castro,</i>

117
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:19,481
<i> but what's more important to me</i>

118
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,749
<i> is growing old</i>
<i> with the love of my life:</i>

119
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,489
<i> Bennett.</i>

120
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:25,593
<i> So I'm leaving San Francisco</i>

121
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:27,635
<i> to live in halifax, Canada.</i>

122
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:30,361
<i> Although I'm sad</i>
<i> to leave</i> XY<i> magazine,</i>

123
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,537
<i> I'm excited to finally accept</i>
<i> the speaking offers</i>

124
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:35,107
<i> I've been receiving</i>
<i> this past year,</i>

125
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:38,505
<i> thanks to my work</i>
<i> as a writer and activist.</i>

126
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,607
What a lot of people
aren't aware of

127
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:43,509
is that the terms "heterosexual"
and "homosexual"

128
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:47,012
were only introduced
about a hundred years ago.

129
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:50,486
<i> As my mother</i>
<i> used to always say,</i>

130
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:51,656
<i> "when you help others,</i>

131
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:53,084
<i> you're helping yourself</i>
<i> as well."</i>

132
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,689
We often read about
more sexually...

133
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,521
<i> My goal is to thread a needle</i>

134
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:59,366
<i> through the fabric</i>

135
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:03,932
<i> and stitch together the lives</i>
<i> of gay kids everywhere.</i>

136
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:04,803
I know a lot of you

137
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,730
are balancing religion
and sexuality,

138
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:08,876
but I mean, come on,

139
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,440
what god would punish you
for finding love?

140
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:09,187
This is where I spread
my mom's ashes.

141
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:25,976
Oh, my god.

142
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,748
She's still here.

143
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:45,233
Mom, I'm gonna
stay here with you.

144
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,060
No.

145
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:46,894
Don't be stubborn.

146
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:50,528
You are not skipping
a semester to be with me.

147
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,035
I can help you through this.

148
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:56,037
I'm gonna be fine.
I told you.

149
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,611
I feel better.

150
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,180
Really, Michael.

151
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:05,616
I am so proud of you.

152
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:08,716
I love you so much.

153
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,659
Hmm. I love you.

154
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,593
I should've stayed.

155
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,068
Everyone kept saying,

156
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:30,709
"don't worry, we're praying
for her, don't worry."

157
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,949
Everyone's gonna die.

158
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,649
No amount of praying
is ever gonna change that.

159
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:03,563
You're not getting up yet.
Five minutes more.

160
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:07,072
<i> I can't believe I'm approaching</i>

163
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,189
<i> The people are friendly</i>

00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,717

165
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:25,652
<i> I have some big plans</i>
<i> to really make an impact.</i>

166
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,570
What's wrong with you?

167
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,004
Nothing.

168
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:44,744
Look, I have to find
something else to do.

169
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:48,715
I'm just not cut out
for administrative work.

170
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,586
Give it some time?

171
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,185
I have things
i wanna do.

172
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,886
I want my own magazine.
I want something bigger.

173
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,589
I want...
I want to influence people.

174
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,820
I can't do that here.
You're being such a shit.

175
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,165
We made the decision
to leave San Francisco together.

176
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:01,991
No, we didn't.

177
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:03,225
I mean,
you had to take this job.

178
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,689
Just like you had
to take the job
that took us to San Francisco.

179
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:11,199
Which is how you got
your job at<i> XY,</i>
so you should be thanking me.

180
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:13,732
Is this...

181
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,870
This is supposed to be
Mexican food?

182
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,815
Why don't you go to the store
and make your own food?

183
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:19,372
Maybe I will.

184
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,979
You'll have to ask me
for money, though,

185
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:24,281
'cause you don't have any,
remember?

186
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,066
Thanks.

187
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,261
Hey.

188
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:12,064
Hey.

189
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:14,293
You're Mike, right?

190
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:16,202
Uh, yeah.

191
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,040
The<i> XY</i> survivor guide
really helped me out.

192
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,241
Are you stalking me
or something?

193
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,415
Tyler.

194
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,410
Hi.

195
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:28,081
Hi.

196
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,678
I just...
I wanted you to know

197
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:32,451
I agree with everything
that you say

198
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:35,119
about gay identity
and sexuality.

199
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:39,918
I don't wanna be
put into a box
just because I'm gay.

200
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:41,893
You don't wanna be in a box?

201
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:44,162
No, I don't wanna be in a box.

202
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:48,399
You're so fucking cute.

203
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,258
Can I buy you a drink?

204
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,297
Don't you have a boyfriend?

205
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:57,341
Hmm...
He'll think you're cute, too.

206
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:47,292
It's a galaxy.

207
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,318
Uh, actually it's a spiral.

208
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,753
It's the only symbol
that means anything.

209
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,259
It's infinite,
no beginning, no end.

210
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,501
There's a beginning
and there's an end.

211
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,427
All right, well, there's
a more complicated one

212
00:15:58,432 --> 00:15:59,772
that has no beginning
and no end,

213
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:02,467
but I can't do it
on my pancakes, okay?

214
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:08,208
How did you guys meet?

215
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,138
How did we meet?

216
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:11,204
Uh, San Francisco.

217
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,911
We volunteered at this
aids prevention organization.

218
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:18,444
And we both got arrested
protesting this
Christian coalition event.

219
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:22,021
Which is how I knew
it was true love.

220
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:24,191
Awesome.

221
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,430
How about you?
What's your deal?

222
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,397
Who are you?

223
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:31,396
Uh...

224
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:33,397
I'm a physics student.

225
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,269
Really?
Yeah.

226
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:36,068
Physics.
Science.

227
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:41,278
Yeah. I wanna be an astronaut,
but that's probably a long shot.

228
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:45,904
Oh, god. I'd be terrified
to go into space.

229
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:47,542
It's just, to me,

230
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:51,016
earth is just this,
like, tiny speck
in the universe.

231
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:56,056
And humans have only
been around for just
a speck of that timeline.

232
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,214
So it's just...

233
00:16:57,222 --> 00:17:03,422
There has to be more to life
than just this, don't you think?

234
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:08,036
Totally.

235
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,437
Totally.

236
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,080
So Tyler
was really cute, huh?

237
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:18,546
Interesting.
Mm-hmm.

238
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,842
It is interesting, isn't it?

239
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:21,575
Very interesting.

240
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,849
You know why?

241
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:26,618
Because I love you so much.

242
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,881
And I really feel like
we're at a place
in our relationship

243
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:32,887
where there's more
than enough love to go around.

244
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:35,394
And I know that
I'm not afraid of that

245
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:37,222
and I don't think
that you are either.

246
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,098
Mm-mm. Maybe I am afraid.

247
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:41,337
Well, you shouldn't
be afraid

248
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:45,002
because I'm here
to protect you.
Why?

249
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:54,071
Carrot thief.

250
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:59,909
Here's our very uncool
soccer mom Van.

251
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,256
Whoo!

252
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,621
Who are these guys?

253
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:07,151
<i> July 23rd, 2002.</i>

254
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:08,256
Road trip.
Road trip.

255
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:11,668
<i> I'm driving across America</i>
<i> with Bennett and Tyler</i>

256
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:16,230
<i> for an exciting new project</i>
<i> I'm working on.</i>

257
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:17,231
I guess both beds are taken.

258
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:19,962
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep.

259
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:24,128
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

260
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:30,014
This is the most fun
I've ever had in my whole life.

261
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:32,242
Really?
No.

262
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:34,581
<i> We are making a documentary</i>

263
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,113
<i> about queer youth in America,</i>

264
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:40,178
<i> because discrimination</i>
<i> against lgbt youth</i>

265
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:41,688
<i> must be eliminated.</i>

266
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,289
<i> I just wish people could see</i>
<i> that these kids have faces,</i>

267
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:50,094
<i> names, and voices</i>
<i> that need to be heard.</i>

268
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:55,197
Growing up in the church
and realizing that you're gay

269
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,632
is very difficult.

270
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:00,637
You know, your family
has never talked about it.

271
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:01,671
I mean, I'm 13

272
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:03,346
and it's the first time
I've heard the word.

273
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:07,514
And when I heard the word
and knew what it was,

274
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:11,085
then it was like,
"hey, I know that.

275
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:14,624
I understand that.
That's me."

276
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,221
My mom, she's trying.

277
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,622
She's like really in the closet
about it.

278
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,394
She won't mention it to anybody
or anything like that.

279
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,432
Like, she tries to still act
like I'm straight

280
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,728
and expects me to act like
I'm straight along with her

281
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:25,661
when I'm not like that.

282
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,275
And this was
probably more overwhelming

283
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:32,038
when I tried
to kill myself, uh...

284
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,238
But I felt so invisible

285
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,282
to everyone around me
who was straight.

286
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,678
There are times when I realize

287
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:49,421
that I'm just as much a creation
of god as everyone else.

288
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:54,292
Olympia, Washington.

289
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,693
This is kind of somber.

290
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,634
But even though I grew up here,

291
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:05,241
because both my parents
don't live anymore,

292
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,667
it feels like this place
is a part of a past

293
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,743
that doesn't exist anymore.

294
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,111
And I wasn't gay here.

295
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,111
I mean, you couldn't be.

296
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,582
There was this kid that everyone
just thought was gay

297
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:22,591
and he had to leave school
'cause he got picked on so much.

298
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:33,425
What's it like here?

299
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,701
Liberty is falwell territory.

300
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:40,168
So as you can imagine,
it's not very gay-friendly.

301
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:45,378
So why do you stay?

302
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,735
Uh...

303
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:50,478
Well, I...

304
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,680
I don't know. I, um...

305
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:54,281
I didn't come out
to friends and family

306
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,514
until last year.

307
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,389
And I have another year
before I graduate.

308
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,290
I'm a Christian.

309
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,362
So...

310
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,630
Which a lot of people
think is impossible,

311
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:07,699
but I think that's
just as ridiculous

312
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:11,166
as the anti-gay right, so...

313
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,406
Just a second.

314
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:17,471
Hey, sof.

315
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:20,303
Do you want us
to call them for you?

316
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:24,177
We're just gonna...
We're gonna wait with you
until he comes, okay?

317
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,620
Her mother just passed.
Do you mind not filming us?

318
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:30,348
So awful.

319
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:33,212
Here, let's pray.
Let's pray for her, okay?

320
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:34,412
All right, turn it off.

321
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:35,483
We just wanna ask, father,

322
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:36,860
that you would
just give her the strength

323
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:40,528
to get through this
incredibly difficult time

324
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:43,398
and we pray that you
would just fill us all

325
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:45,738
with the compassion to know
what she must be going through

326
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:49,403
because it would be impossible
for us to fully comprehend.

327
00:21:49,404 --> 00:21:51,804
Just show her yourself, father,
during this time

328
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:55,346
and look to you right now,
father...

329
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,721
Hey.

330
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:18,893
Babe.

331
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:21,369
We gotta go.
We gotta be there at 9:30.
You ready?

332
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:24,568
Yeah.
All right.
See you in the car.

333
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,241
<i> I didn't come out</i>
<i> to friends and family</i>

334

341
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,830
<i> I felt lost, alone,</i>

342
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:59,374
<i> I never even told my mother,</i>
<i> my best friend, that I was gay</i>

343
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:01,902
<i> because I was afraid</i>

344
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:04,347
<i> That's why</i>

345
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:08,542
<i> To let gay kids know</i>

346
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:12,287
<i> And you know what?</i>
<i> I learned a lot as well.</i>

347
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,814
<i> Because we met</i>
<i> so many amazing people</i>

348
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:16,649
<i> who've heard their parents</i>
<i> or pastors</i>

349
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:19,655
<i> tell them they're wrong</i>
<i> and yet they've come</i>

350
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:22,388
<i> to the realization</i>
<i> that they're beautiful,</i>

351
00:23:22,394 --> 00:23:26,834
<i> blessed, and that god</i>
<i> loves them just as they are.</i>

352
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:31,331
<i> I mean, people who believe</i>
<i> that homosexuality is wrong</i>

353
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:37,475
<i> are gonna change their minds</i>
<i> thanks to this next generation.</i>

354
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:44,701
The sky is fucking beautiful.

355
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,039
What is this, babe?

356
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,535
Hmm?

357
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:53,477
Oh, it's stupid.

358
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,852
Just somebody gave it to me
on the street.

359
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:59,490
"Where will we go
when we die?"

360
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:01,957
Baby.

361
00:25:01,956 --> 00:25:04,556
You guys,
where will we go
when we die?

362
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,498
In 2012, the world
is supposed to end.

363
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:10,456
Is that a real thing?

364
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:11,924
I hope not.

365
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:13,632
Everyone knows this.

366
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:16,794
It's what they drew
on the Mayan calendar.

367
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:19,304
You know,
the Mayan calendar thing.

368
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:22,707
That's what they drew.
It was the moon and the sun.

369
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:18,666
What? I'm curious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

370
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,994
We wanna know. Please.
We wanna know. Please.

371
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,069
I don't think
they wanna know.

372
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,688
Mike.

373
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,522
You guys go on.
I'll meet you at home.

374
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:50,496
You okay?

375
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:51,725
Yeah, I'm fine.

376
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:53,998
Where are you going?

377
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,467
Michael?

378
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:01,539
What's that about?
I have absolutely
no earthly idea.

379
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:45,616
Baby.

380
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:50,857
I was worried about you today.
What's going on?

381
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,727
It's stupid.

382
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:01,495
Baby, nothing's stupid.
Tell me what.

383
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:09,831
Do you think when we die,

384
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:14,898
we just disappear
like we never existed?

385
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:21,084
No, I don't think that.

386
00:28:21,547 --> 00:28:25,247
Because I know that
we'll always be together.

387
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,090
Baby.

388
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:37,158
Baby.

389
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:40,834
Baby, you're okay.
I'm here.

390
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:01,619
Let's pray for her.
Let's pray.

391
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,629
Bennett!

392
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:17,770
Bennett!

393
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:21,765
I'm really lightheaded.

394
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:27,713
It's okay. It's okay.
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

395
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:42,055
Okay.

396
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,659
Your heartrate
seems to have returned
back to normal.

397
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:48,795
Can you check again?

398
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,669
Just because your father had hcm
does not mean that you have it.

399
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:57,139
We followed
our chest pain protocol
and there's nothing abnormal.

400
00:29:57,141 --> 00:30:00,911
You had a panic attack. Okay?

401
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:04,746
Where's Bennett?

402
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:05,678
He's in the lobby.

403
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:09,793
As soon as you're checked out,
you can see him.

404
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
All right?

405
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:12,892
Thank you.

406
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:18,897
<i> I was 13 years old,</i>

407
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:21,025
<i> walking along the beach</i>
<i> with my father,</i>

408
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,030
<i> when he suddenly collapsed</i>
<i> and died</i>

409
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:26,372
<i> from an unexpected</i>
<i> heart condition.</i>

410
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:31,107
<i> If I've inherited his disease,</i>

411
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:34,377
<i> the same thing</i>
<i> could happen to me.</i>

412
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:37,277
What's wrong, baby?

413
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,950
It's happening again.
I can feel it.

414
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:43,888
The tests confirmed that--
they don't know.

415
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,815
They don't care.

416
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:50,325
<i> Now I'm having</i>
<i> heart palpitations</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

417
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:53,655
<i> And contrary to what</i>
<i> the doctors keep saying,</i>

418
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:57,722
<i> I just know</i>
<i> they aren't panic attacks.</i>

419
00:30:57,932 --> 00:30:59,762
<i> After months of fighting</i>
<i> with my insurance,</i>

420
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:02,068
<i> I was finally allowed</i>
<i> to see a specialist</i>

421
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,310
<i> who could definitively test</i>
<i> whether or not</i>

422
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:07,836
<i> I inherited</i>
<i> my father's condition.</i>

423
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:10,949
<i> Now I have to wait</i>
<i> for the results.</i>

424
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:14,675
Michael,
just calm down.
Calm down!

425
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:15,812
Do you know
what this disease means?

426
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:19,856
It means
i could die any minute,
just drop dead!

427
00:31:19,854 --> 00:31:21,814
You calm down!

428
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:01,975
Dr. Williams?

429
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:03,337
Hi.

430
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,596
Thank you, god.

431
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:33,612
Thank you, god.

432
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,839
<i> The test confirmed</i>

433
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:41,075
<i> that I did not inherit</i>
<i> my father's heart condition.</i>

434
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:45,221
<i> Although it's</i>
<i> a massive sigh of relief,</i>

435
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,289
<i> I keep thinking to myself...</i>

436
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:51,287
<i> If I was really</i>
<i> just having panic attacks,</i>

437
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,631
<i> then what's wrong with me?</i>

438
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:56,427
<i> What am I afraid of?</i>

439
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,872
<i> All I know is that when</i>
<i> faced with your own death,</i>

440
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,470
<i> it reminds you</i>
<i> of what's important in life.</i>

441
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:11,382
<i> And for me,</i>
<i> that's helping other people.</i>

442
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,077
Okay.

443
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,919
<i> So I've decided</i>
<i> to start my own magazine.</i>

444
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:20,016
<i> I'm calling it</i> yga.

445
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:20,989
Young gay Americans.

446
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:25,017
<i> It's gonna be the biggest</i>
<i> and most sophisticated magazine</i>

447
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:29,654
<i> aimed at improving the lives</i>
<i> of lgbt youth.</i>

448
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:18,206
Hmm.

449
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,737
What is this?

450
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:49,506
What is this?

451
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:53,045
Oh, my god! Hi!

452
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,642
You didn't.

453
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,314
I know you
wanted one, baby.

454
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:58,141
Oh, my god!

455
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:06,522
Ooh.

456
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:09,321
What are we gonna call you?

457
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:11,294
What are we gonna call you?

458
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:15,661
Olly. Olly, heel.

459
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,130
I've been thinking
about the next issue of<i> yga.</i>

460
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:22,604
I think we need to address
this whole christianity thing.

461
00:37:22,604 --> 00:37:23,574
What do you mean?

462
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:26,702
Well, people think that gays
and christians are enemies.

463
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:32,517
We've met so many people
who've managed to balance
their faith and their sexuality.

464
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:35,413
But we've also met
so many people whose parents

465
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:38,016
and churches tell them
they're gonna burn in hell.

466
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:41,049
Yeah, which is why
we should address it
in the magazine.

467
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:44,655
I mean, the whole "you're gay,
you're going to hell" myth

468
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:49,688
was started by mistranslations
and misinterpretations
of the Bible.

469
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:54,167
I mean, god doesn't care
what your sexual orientation is.

470
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:59,037
And the one thing
that the gay movement
doesn't understand

471
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,199
that I think christianity does

472
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:07,146
is that not everyone
wants to be a part
of the subculture.

473
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:10,809
I'm sorry,
what did you do
with my boyfriend?

474
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:12,247
Shut up.

475
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:15,122
I'm not gonna write like...

476
00:38:16,488 --> 00:38:20,518
Gospel according to Michael
or something.

477
00:38:23,195 --> 00:38:26,304
<i> It might seem strange</i>
<i> for a gay youth magazine</i>

478
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:30,098
<i> to dedicate an entire issue</i>
<i> to religion,</i>

479
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,542
<i> but it's too important</i>
<i> to ignore.</i>

480
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:38,168
<i> When my parents died,</i>
<i> I blamed god.</i>

481
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:39,137
<i> When I came out,</i>

482
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:43,084
<i> I distanced myself even further</i>
<i> from religion.</i>

483
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:48,222
<i> You see, I thought I was</i>
<i> too smart to believe in god,</i>

484
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,420
<i> that he was only</i>
<i> for the needy.</i>

485
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,415
<i> But after</i>
<i> a recent health scare,</i>

486
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:58,634
<i> I felt this nudging</i>
<i> in the back of my mind:</i>

487
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:01,659
<i> The presence of god.</i>

488
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:03,626
<i> And you know what?</i>

489
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:07,104
<i> I was no longer afraid.</i>

490
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:08,501
Aah!

491
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:11,306
<i> Some religious figures</i>
<i> spout hateful rhetoric</i>

492
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:15,209
<i> and try to force</i>
<i> a monopoly on the truth.</i>

493
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:18,683
<i> But the only truth is love.</i>

494
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:23,192
<i> The only sin is denying love.</i>

495
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:25,486
<i> Stop hating.</i>

496
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,819
<i> Start loving.</i>

497
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,897
You gonna join us?

498
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:42,543
Uh, yeah, just one second.

499
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,150
What?

500
00:39:49,146 --> 00:39:52,445
Uh, you're really combing
through that thing,
aren't you?

501
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:57,648
Look, my whole life,
i thought the Bible
was full of hate...

502
00:39:57,653 --> 00:39:58,883
And it's not.

503
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:00,618
There's a lot of love in here.

504
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:05,423
So your interest in the Bible
is more than just research?

505
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:10,167
Well, there's a lot
of Christian roots
in my family,

506
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:12,796
my mom, my aunt and...

507
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:13,541
Just curious.

508
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,166
Your aunts disowned you
when you came out.

509
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:18,803
That's not family.

510
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,706
I'm all for curiosity but--

511
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:24,878
i-i just feel like
something saved me,

512
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:27,879
shook me and woke me up.

513
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:32,249
And that someone is god?

514
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:39,356
Mike, he didn't save you
because you were never dying.

515
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:43,928
Okay.

516
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,263
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

517
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:52,578
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

518
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,550
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

519
00:40:57,544 --> 00:41:03,414
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

520
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:05,649
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

521
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:10,282
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

522
00:41:15,795 --> 00:41:19,864
Don't see many people
flaunting that out in the open.

523
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:20,895
Oh.

524
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,230
I've seen you
reading out here before

525
00:41:23,236 --> 00:41:26,836
and I thought maybe you'd
wanna come to my church.

526
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,379
Any Sunday,
just to check it out.

527
00:41:31,377 --> 00:41:34,977
See what the mormon religion
has to offer.

528
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:41,453
The gospel teaches us
that we are the spirit children

529
00:41:41,454 --> 00:41:42,824
of heavenly parents.

530
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:49,661
Now, many people ask,
are we like other christians?

531
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,761
Why of course we are.

532
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:53,833
We believe in Jesus Christ

533
00:41:53,832 --> 00:41:57,262
and we believe
in life after death.

534
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:01,769
And everyone is welcome
at the lds church.

535
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:05,643
Christ's atonement
allows mankind to be saved
from their sins...

536
00:42:05,644 --> 00:42:10,444
And to return to live with god
and their loved ones in heaven.

537
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:13,618
Did you grow up
with any kind of faith?

538
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:14,818
Not really.

539
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:15,708
My mother was Christian,

540
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,519
but she didn't really take
me or my sister to church,

541
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:22,893
and my father
was a Berkeley hippie,

542
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:26,333
kind of agnostic
or even atheist.

543
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,760
They were very good people

544
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:32,435
and I know
I'll see them again in heaven.

545
00:42:32,436 --> 00:42:35,306
My mom passed away as well.

546
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:37,076
So I know how hard that is.

547
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:42,044
I was so afraid and angry,
you know?

548
00:42:42,046 --> 00:42:43,616
Yeah, me, too.

549
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:45,643
It's really hard
to deal with death

550
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:48,778
when you don't know
where you're going.

551
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:52,048
But once you do,
then you have peace

552
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:55,695
and you realize
that god's not to blame.

553
00:42:55,692 --> 00:42:58,592
Right.
Yeah.

554
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:00,928
Catherine.

555
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:04,632
It was nice to meet you.

556
00:43:04,634 --> 00:43:06,004
You, too.

557
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,870
She's single, fyi.

558
00:43:11,874 --> 00:43:13,643
Fyi?

559
00:43:13,642 --> 00:43:15,412
What, you think
she likes me?

560
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,610
Yeah. Yeah,
it seemed like it.

561
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:23,082
But I mean, don't worry.
There's plenty of single ladies
looking for a husband.

562
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:26,995
I wasn't even thinking
about that kind of thing.

563
00:43:26,988 --> 00:43:30,788
Oh, well, maybe it's something
you should start thinking about.

564
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:34,732
I can get you in touch with her
if you want.

565
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:36,856
Oh, um...

566
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:39,435
If you're interested.

567
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,498
Sure. I don't know.

568
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:45,143
Yeah?
Okay. Whatever.
Yeah, okay.

569
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,509
All right.
Okay, thanks.

570
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:49,777
Embarrassing me
a little bit.

571
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,770
<i> Welcome back to new beginnings</i>

572
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:18,969
<i> and thank you for listening</i>
<i> to our continued conversation</i>

573
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:20,612
<i> about the truth path to heaven.</i>

574
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,637
<i> Doctor, how would you respond</i>
<i> to other christians</i>

575
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:25,874
<i> who disagree with your angle?</i>

576
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:29,519
<i> Look, all I'm trying</i>
<i> to do is help people.</i>

577
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:33,416
<i> It just pains me so much when</i>
<i> I hear so-called christians</i>

578
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,960
<i> side with the left on issues</i>
<i> such as homosexuality.</i>

579
00:44:36,956 --> 00:44:40,055
<i> Now, I'm not condoning hate.</i>

580
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:42,428
<i> In fact, this is about love.</i>

581
00:44:42,428 --> 00:44:44,898
<i> Choosing a gay identity</i>
<i> will condemn you</i>

582
00:44:44,897 --> 00:44:46,727
<i> to an eternity of suffering.</i>

583
00:44:46,732 --> 00:44:49,102
<i> And I wanna save people</i>
<i> from that.</i>

584
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:51,871
<i> Whether it's abortion</i>
<i> or adultery</i>

585
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,870
<i> or accepting religions</i>
<i> other than christianity,</i>

586
00:44:55,874 --> 00:44:57,534
<i> you must obey god's law</i>

587
00:44:57,543 --> 00:45:01,743
<i> or you will not be allowed</i>
<i> into his kingdom.</i>

588
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:42,816
I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying
that it's wrong.

589
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:45,989
I'm just saying
that over the course
of thousands of years,

590
00:45:45,989 --> 00:45:49,599
people with an agenda
have made christianity
what it is today.

591
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:56,093
Yeah, but the original message
is still the same,
it's about love.

592
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:01,536
You know, I would've never
pegged you as a Buddhist.

593
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:01,968
Why?

594
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:05,002
What, 'cause I don't look
a certain way?

595
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:06,177
No, I...

596
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:08,675
I don't know why
i just said that.

597
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:10,647
I'm just kidding you.

598
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:11,176
Meditation.

599
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,580
People get weird in their head
about meditation.

600
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:14,982
They think it's weird
or hippie.

601
00:46:14,984 --> 00:46:18,954
I think it's about
developing mindfulness.

602
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:20,854
You know, it's about
living moment to moment.

603
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:25,026
And in a deeper level,
it's about knowing yourself.

604
00:46:25,027 --> 00:46:28,767
That's why I started
volunteering at
the Buddhist center.

605
00:46:28,764 --> 00:46:31,094
They have classes on Friday.
You should come.

606
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,099
Oh, I have to go out of town
for this speaking thing.

607
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:38,034
What kind of speaking thing?

608
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:41,069
It's about gay youth
in America.

609
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:43,945
No way. That's awesome.

610
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:26,324
Welcome to our very first panel

611
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,880
on being young and gay
in America.

612
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:30,889
Joining us is Judy Shepard,

613
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:33,890
president of
the Matthew Shepard foundation,

614
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,923
dedicated to
working towards causes

615
00:47:35,928 --> 00:47:39,598
championed by her son Matthew
during his life.

616
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,999
Thank you for joining us.

617
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:49,267
Michael glatze,
former editor of<i> XY</i> magazine,

618

as well as lambda's

participant in the
award-winning documentary

622
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,190
<i> Jim in bold,</i>

and co-founder
of<i> young gay Americans,</i>

624
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,760
which is now
a full-fledged magazine.

625
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:16,734
What does being gay
mean to you?

626
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:22,304
<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

627
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:25,907
<i> And it's more important now</i>
<i> than ever</i>

628
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:29,140
<i> to make allies</i>
<i> and make alliances</i>

629
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:33,746
<i> both inside</i>
<i> and outside the gay community.</i>

630
00:48:37,086 --> 00:48:42,886
<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

631
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:44,793
<i> It's not about--</i>

632
00:49:19,027 --> 00:49:20,457
hey.

633
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:24,301
No.

634
00:49:26,168 --> 00:49:28,467
I have to walk the dog.

635
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,880
Hey.

636
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:14,512
What are you doing?

637
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:18,745
I need some space.

638
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,059
Mike--
look, I just...

639
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,755
I need some time
to figure this out,

640
00:50:22,757 --> 00:50:25,356
to see where this
is taking me.

641
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:29,298
Why can't you come to me
for help?

642
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:31,465
We have to talk about this
before--

643
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:33,024
look, I just...

644
00:50:33,032 --> 00:50:36,262
I need to get away
from this life.

645
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:39,102
Our life?
Yes.

646
00:50:39,238 --> 00:50:43,508
And what exactly is it
about our life that you need
to get away from, being gay?

647
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,150
I don't know.

648
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:46,245
I don't know!

649
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:51,086
Okay, uh, are you
attracted to women?

650
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:52,814
Because if that's the case,
then fine, go explore.

651
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:57,058
I just wanna be with my parents
in heaven. Is that so hard
to understand?

652
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:58,925
Can you even hear yourself
right now?

653
00:50:58,924 --> 00:51:01,554
What happened
to the misinterpretation
of the Bible?

654
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,790
It's a fucking book, Mike!

655
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:05,495
I read the Bible the same way
i read anything else,

656
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:06,967
with an open mind
and an open heart.

657
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:07,995
Oh, is that what
you call this?

658
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,800
'Cause the way you're talking
doesn't exactly sound
very fucking open-minded.

659
00:51:11,804 --> 00:51:18,144
This relationship
has just developed
into something unhealthy.

660
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,913
What does that even mean?

661
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:23,115
Tyler?

662
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:26,344
You were just as
interested in that as I was.

663
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,050
No.

664
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:28,211
I just wanted you
to be happy

665
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,149
because I was afraid
you were gonna leave.

666
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:31,924
I was never
gonna leave, Mike.

667
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:32,553
I've stood by you.

668
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:35,027
I've held your hand while you
were so terrified of dying

669
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:38,596
that you created illnesses
that didn't even exist.

670
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,996
The truth is that
i was living a lie.

671
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:48,331
The truth is that god loves us--
shut the fuck up!

672
00:51:52,274 --> 00:51:53,614
Okay.

673
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,170
Wait.

674
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,120
Please don't go.

675
00:52:10,993 --> 00:52:14,163
Where are you going?

676
00:52:20,435 --> 00:52:25,405
The thing
that will really kill you...

677
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:30,177
Is repressing
who you truly are.

678
00:52:30,311 --> 00:52:34,051
That's what you
should really be afraid of.

679
00:53:42,615 --> 00:53:47,014
So he just left this here
out in the open?

680
00:54:33,664 --> 00:54:38,094
<i> I have come to a decision</i>
<i> that will be shocking</i>

681
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:41,263
<i> to anyone I used to relate to.</i>

682
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:47,146
<i> The presence of god</i>
<i> has grown strong in my life.</i>

683
00:54:47,144 --> 00:54:50,244
<i> He told me</i>
<i> that my panic attacks</i>

684
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:55,417
<i> were caused by my shallow,</i>
<i> sinful lifestyle.</i>

685
00:54:56,186 --> 00:55:01,326
<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that identifying as gay</i>

686
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:05,795
<i> prevents you from finding</i>
<i> your true self within.</i>

687
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:08,066
<i> And we must be our true selves</i>

688
00:55:08,065 --> 00:55:12,065
<i> in order to join god</i>
<i> in his kingdom.</i>

689
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:16,134
<i> Therefore, I,</i>
<i> Michael glatze,</i>

690
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:19,809
<i> no longer identify</i>
<i> as gay.</i>

691
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:35,504
Why did you do it?

692
00:57:38,775 --> 00:57:40,945
"Gay activist goes straight"?

693
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:44,615
You gave the anti-gay right
the story of their dreams.

694
00:57:44,615 --> 00:57:46,555
I don't know why.

695
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:48,651
I don't know.

696
00:57:48,653 --> 00:57:50,453
Who pushed you?

697
00:57:50,454 --> 00:57:51,424
No one.

698
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:54,292
I just wanted
to tell my story.

699
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:56,292
Look, I think
this all happened

700
00:57:56,294 --> 00:57:58,564
because god needed
to teach me a lesson.

701
00:57:58,563 --> 00:58:03,203
That's why I'm here,
to make it better.

702
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:11,208
Meditation is a way
of slowing down

703
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:14,408
and developing kindness
towards yourself.

704
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:20,681
Through mindfulness practice,
we develop strength of mind.

705
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:22,724
We become more present

706
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,789
and we learn
to appreciate our world.

707
00:58:31,393 --> 00:58:34,962
<i> God works in mysterious ways.</i>

708
00:58:34,964 --> 00:58:36,554
<i> He has sent me to a place</i>

709
00:58:36,565 --> 00:58:39,395
<i> where I can get away</i>
<i> from the physical world</i>

710
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:42,641
<i> so that I can focus</i>
<i> on my true self--</i>

711
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:45,638
<i> a happier, healthier man,</i>

712
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:49,011
<i> free of unnatural desires.</i>

713
00:58:55,717 --> 00:59:00,957
<i> At first, I didn't understand</i>
<i> why god would send a Christian</i>

714
00:59:00,956 --> 00:59:03,355
<i> to a Buddhist retreat.</i>

715
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,428
<i> But I have faith</i>
<i> in his plan for me.</i>

716
00:59:13,935 --> 00:59:15,965
<i> Desire is powerful.</i>

717
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,970
<i> And god is testing me.</i>

718
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:24,443
<i> But I refuse to give in</i>
<i> to temptation.</i>

719
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:30,545
<i> I've come to the realization</i>

720
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:33,590
<i> that god wants me</i>
<i> to use meditation</i>

721
00:59:33,587 --> 00:59:38,627
<i> to rid myself</i>
<i> of abnormal desires.</i>

722
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:42,661
God gave Buddha the light
to be Buddha.

723
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:43,053
He did.

724
00:59:43,063 --> 00:59:45,363
Michael,
what are you talking about?

725
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:50,435
I just want us
to be on the right path
for our future,

726
00:59:50,437 --> 00:59:53,037
for our health,
for the afterlife.

727
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,710
I am on the right path, okay?
My path.

728
01:00:07,018 --> 01:00:09,918
Michael, i--
I'm sorry.

729
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:14,460
I'm sorry, Nico.

730
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:33,779
It's the same kind of strength

731
01:00:33,778 --> 01:00:36,718
that you need
to-to clear your mind.

732
01:00:36,715 --> 01:00:40,515
You know, we just, we need
to find that strength

733
01:00:40,518 --> 01:00:45,488
to fight what we both know
in our hearts is wrong.

734
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,950
We just have to fight it.

735
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:48,598
Stop, Michael. Stop.

736
01:00:48,593 --> 01:00:50,963
No, I mean...

737
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:00,572
Michael, you're confused.

738
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:05,601
You're very confused
and it's at my expense.

739
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:34,577
<i> People have been asking</i>
<i> how I am.</i>

740
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:36,430
<i> Some out of support.</i>

741
01:01:36,439 --> 01:01:38,839
<i> Others who think</i>
<i> I've reconsidered.</i>

742
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:44,011
<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that Bennett represents soul,</i>

743
01:01:44,013 --> 01:01:49,583
<i> Tyler represents body,</i>
<i> Nico represents mind.</i>

744
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:52,825
<i> Father, son, holy ghost.</i>

745
01:01:52,822 --> 01:01:56,021
<i> I guess god need me</i>
<i> to complete the Trinity</i>

746
01:01:56,024 --> 01:01:58,464
<i> in order to move on.</i>

747
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,460
<i> So I'm ready to set</i>
<i> the record straight.</i>

748
01:02:00,462 --> 01:02:05,602
<i> I was a heterosexual person</i>
<i> with a homosexual problem,</i>

749
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,170
<i> and I took care</i>
<i> of that problem.</i>

750
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,770
<i> I have not reconsidered.</i>

751
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:15,539
A good number of people
have come forward

752
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:16,674
and expressed
their concern

753
01:02:16,678 --> 01:02:18,638
about your being involved
with this organization.

754
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:22,677
This center is supposed
to accept everyone.

755
01:02:22,684 --> 01:02:24,124
Yes, and we do.

756
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,548
We welcome people
of all beliefs,

757
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:29,454
but we don't tolerate hate.

758
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:31,487
I don't hate anybody.

759
01:02:31,492 --> 01:02:36,532
Michael, you've written
what some would call
very hateful things.

760
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:40,670
Those are my beliefs.

761
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:43,104
Are you okay?

762
01:02:43,103 --> 01:02:44,973
Yeah.

763
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:47,912
Are you okay?

764
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,140
I don't know...

765
01:02:50,144 --> 01:02:54,813
I don't understand
what has changed, but I, uh...

766
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:56,954
Here we practice compassion.

767
01:02:56,950 --> 01:03:01,720
And I'm just, I'm afraid
this isn't gonna work out.

768
01:03:01,721 --> 01:03:07,561
So, because I'm Christian
and I express my opinions...

769
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,890
I have to leave.

770
01:03:09,896 --> 01:03:14,126
That's so messed up.

771
01:03:50,635 --> 01:03:52,164
That's really everything?

772
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:55,139
Your whole life
is in that one bag?

773
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:57,979
Yeah.

774
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,310
Do you think
you'll stay here?

775
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:08,843
I mean, San Francisco
can't be the best place
for an...

776
01:04:08,853 --> 01:04:09,943
Ex-gay.

777
01:04:09,954 --> 01:04:15,884
I'm not an ex-gay.
I'm just me.

778
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,993
Honestly, I thought
you'd be happy.

779
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:21,595
I mean, you never
really approved.

780
01:04:21,598 --> 01:04:23,098
That's not true.

781
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:26,739
Then why haven't we been close?

782
01:04:26,736 --> 01:04:28,106
I mean, you're my sister.

783
01:04:28,104 --> 01:04:32,304
We're supposed to be there
for each other.

784
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:36,042
We can be close now.

785
01:04:36,046 --> 01:04:38,076
I'm glad you're here.

786
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:45,091
And I want you to be happy--
loving whomever.

787
01:04:46,188 --> 01:04:47,188
Yeah?

788
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:48,689
Yeah.

789
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:36,019
I'm sorry.

790
01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:37,388
No, I can't.
What?

791
01:06:37,396 --> 01:06:39,136
No, I'm sorry. Uh...

792
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:41,161
What happened?
I can't. Um...

793
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:45,836
It's not you, it's...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

794
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:36,778
Olly, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

795
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,160
<i> Hello?</i>

796
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,874
Michael?

797
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,370
<i> Bennett.</i>

798
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,012
Where are you?

799
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:04,554
<i> Are you okay?</i>

800
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:08,422
<i> Michael?</i>

801
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,876
I have to go.

802
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:13,385
<i> Wait, why did you call me,</i>
<i> Michael?</i>

803
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:27,571
To my friends who are trapped
in homosexuality:

804
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:30,199
I wanna thank you
for your kind comments

805
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:33,505
and keen observations
regarding my story

806
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:38,478
and my revelation that
i am no longer homosexual

807
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,249
and am now heterosexual.

808
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:44,947
The gay identity has been
packaged and fed to you,

809
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:49,322
and if you identify as gay
then you have eaten it,

810
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:51,823
preventing you
from further growth

811
01:08:51,826 --> 01:08:54,526
and understanding
of your true self.

812
01:08:54,528 --> 01:08:59,028
<i> But it's not too late</i>
<i> to save yourself.</i>

813
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:01,233
<i> If you follow my lead.</i>

814
01:09:01,235 --> 01:09:06,165
<i> I am confident.</i>
<i> I am blessed.</i>

815
01:09:06,173 --> 01:09:07,502
<i> I am strong.</i>

816
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:12,877
<i> I am ready to give up</i>
<i> my life for Christ</i>

817
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:17,319
<i> in order to find</i>
<i> my true self.</i>

818
01:10:25,348 --> 01:10:27,618
You sure you
don't want a coffee?

819
01:10:27,618 --> 01:10:31,328
I don't drink coffee anymore.

820
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,555
You're well?

821
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,390
Yeah. Why?

822
01:10:39,396 --> 01:10:42,296
Just asking.

823
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:48,531
I'm great.
I've never been better.

824
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:54,239
Well, I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

825
01:10:55,978 --> 01:10:58,548
So does Bennett.

826
01:10:59,281 --> 01:10:59,681
Hmm.

827
01:10:59,683 --> 01:11:03,552
I wish I could understand
what you're going through.

828
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:08,296
I just don't want to be
perceived as gay

829
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:11,220
for the rest of my experiences.

830
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:14,496
It's that simple.

831
01:11:16,364 --> 01:11:19,964
Are you still
with Bennett?

832
01:11:19,969 --> 01:11:20,699
No.

833
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:27,543
I'm, uh, going to Europe
to study space science.

834
01:11:27,543 --> 01:11:29,313
That's great.

835
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:31,440
I'm going
to Bible school.

836
01:11:31,446 --> 01:11:34,716
God told me
to become a pastor.

837
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:47,360
I don't want to open
old wounds or anything,

838
01:11:47,362 --> 01:11:54,632
but I also don't know when
I'll ever see you again.

839
01:11:55,469 --> 01:11:59,099
I want you to know
how much you meant to me.

840
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:08,510
I know you don't care anymore.

841
01:12:08,515 --> 01:12:12,255
But I needed to say it.

842
01:12:12,252 --> 01:12:15,352
For closure.

843
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:22,329
This whole thing...

844
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:26,199
It broke my heart.

845
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,029
Tyler...

846
01:12:30,036 --> 01:12:33,366
I'm sorry.

847
01:12:33,372 --> 01:12:37,472
But I need to live
for myself now.

848
01:12:40,412 --> 01:12:41,652
Okay.

849
01:12:46,584 --> 01:12:48,094
Okay.

850
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:51,161
Take care.

851
01:13:40,236 --> 01:13:43,766
Now, sometimes somebody's
gonna ask you what you believe.

852
01:13:43,774 --> 01:13:46,304
They're gonna say,
"you're a Christian,

853
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,150
all right,
what do you believe?"

854
01:13:48,145 --> 01:13:52,315
Maybe they're an atheist
or a agnostic or a Muslim

855
01:13:52,316 --> 01:13:55,585
or a Buddha, you know,
who knows what they are?

856
01:13:55,585 --> 01:13:58,555
And you better be ready
to tell 'em.

857
01:13:58,554 --> 01:14:01,484
We believe the Bible
is the word of god,

858
01:14:01,491 --> 01:14:07,901
the supreme, final authority
in life and in our faith.

859
01:14:07,897 --> 01:14:10,867
We believe in one god,

860
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:13,767
eternally existing
in three persons:

861
01:14:13,769 --> 01:14:16,509
The father,
the son, and the holy spirit.

862
01:14:16,506 --> 01:14:20,136
And we believe
the sole condition

863
01:14:20,143 --> 01:14:22,503
for receiving
everlasting life

864
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:30,611
is belief and faith alone
in the lord Jesus Christ.

865
01:15:15,495 --> 01:15:15,925
Thank you.

866
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:18,630
I'll have one
of those, please.

867
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:32,910
Hi, I'm Michael.

868
01:15:32,912 --> 01:15:35,812
Uh, hi, I'm Rebekah.

869
01:15:36,715 --> 01:15:40,555
Guess we like
all the same things.

870
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:44,458
I love it here.

871
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,627
I mean, I never though
I'd end up in Wyoming,

872
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:50,366
but I feel like I've
finally found my niche.

873
01:15:50,363 --> 01:15:53,662
Where'd you think
you'd end up?

874
01:15:54,799 --> 01:15:57,459
That's a good question.
I don't know.

875
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:01,469
All I know is that I've
always wanted to help people,

876
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:05,313
because some people
struggle so much

877
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,780
when the solution
is actually very simple.

878
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,980
It's right there
in Matthew 10:

879
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:15,323
The road may not be easy,
but if we give up our lives

880
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:21,889
for Christ, then we'll find
our true selves.

881
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:30,801
Where did you
go to college?

882
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,271
Dartmouth.

883
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,300
Wow.

884
01:16:33,304 --> 01:16:34,644
And you majored in music?

885
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:37,839
In creative writing
and English literature,

886
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:41,482
but I minored
in music theory
and composition.

887
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:45,379
That must've kept you busy.

888
01:16:45,383 --> 01:16:47,053
What kind of stuff
did you write?

889
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:51,890
Well, my thesis
was all poetry, actually.

890
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:54,488
Can I read some?

891
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:56,021
Oh, I don't have it anymore.

892
01:16:56,026 --> 01:17:00,456
My poetry
is from a different life.

893
01:17:00,463 --> 01:17:01,033
But I, um...

894
01:17:01,031 --> 01:17:06,071
I'm so interested in music now
because it transcends language.

895
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:09,999
You know, it's like people
don't have to argue about it

896
01:17:10,006 --> 01:17:12,506
or judge it
or misinterpret it.

897
01:17:12,509 --> 01:17:13,809
They can just listen.

898
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:17,439
You know, I just play
and they just listen.

899
01:17:17,446 --> 01:17:17,936
You know?

900
01:17:17,946 --> 01:17:20,346
I don't know if I do,
to be honest,

901
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:23,479
but the way you say it,
i want to.

902
01:17:23,485 --> 01:17:25,685
I'm sorry, I'm just blabbing.
What about you?

903
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:30,018
No, don't be sorry!
You're not blabbing. Um...

904
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:31,585
I majored in theater.

905
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:32,633
Theater? Really?
Yeah.

906
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:37,498
Yeah, it was really fun,
but it's not like
it's a real job.

907
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:40,929
I actually stage managed
a little bit after college,

908
01:17:40,936 --> 01:17:44,766
but I don't know,
i felt adrift.

909
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:50,542
So I came here,
hoping to figure out my path.

910
01:17:50,545 --> 01:17:52,875
Me, too.

911
01:18:42,562 --> 01:18:45,001
I can't believe
you've never had Sushi.

912
01:18:44,997 --> 01:18:48,767
Who hasn't had Sushi?
It's crazy.

913
01:18:48,768 --> 01:18:50,698
Mm.

914
01:18:50,703 --> 01:18:51,903
Oh, no.

915
01:18:52,705 --> 01:18:53,905
You don't like it.

916
01:18:53,906 --> 01:18:54,706
I'm sorry.

917
01:18:54,707 --> 01:18:56,937
Oh, I'm so sorry.

918
01:18:56,942 --> 01:18:58,502
Oh...
I'm sorry.

919
01:18:58,511 --> 01:19:01,881
No, I used to hate it
when my ex did that.

920
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:03,981
Always making decisions.

921
01:19:03,983 --> 01:19:06,643
We can go somewhere else.
No.

922
01:19:06,652 --> 01:19:08,812
No, no, no.
No, it's okay.

923
01:19:08,821 --> 01:19:09,761
Are you sure?

924
01:19:09,755 --> 01:19:14,184
Yes. Yeah.
You like it. It's fine.

925
01:19:17,428 --> 01:19:23,138
Uh, how, um, how long ago
was the ex you mentioned?

926
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:26,664
Oh. It was a long time ago.
It was, uh...

927
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:29,201
I don't know why
i brought that up.

928
01:19:29,207 --> 01:19:30,937
It was stupid.

929
01:19:30,942 --> 01:19:33,642
Well, um, was it serious?

930
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:36,715
Were you gonna marry her?

931
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:43,217
It was serious,
but, um, no, not marriage.

932
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,050
What about you?

933
01:19:47,057 --> 01:19:48,527
Oh, no, I've...

934
01:19:48,525 --> 01:19:51,155
I've never been in
a serious relationship.

935
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:55,891
My parents are very,
very conservative.

936
01:19:55,899 --> 01:19:58,139
Do you think
they'd approve of me?

937
01:19:58,135 --> 01:20:02,235
The future pastor
i met at Bible school?

938
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:05,079
Yes, I think they'd approve.

939
01:20:41,242 --> 01:20:42,872
Rebekah.

940
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:44,671
Hi.

941
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:46,939
Hi.

942
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:49,848
What?

943
01:20:49,851 --> 01:20:51,011
I just...

944
01:20:51,019 --> 01:20:54,049
Since when do you
wear shirts like that?

945
01:20:54,055 --> 01:20:57,925
What? It's not inappropriate
and it's hot out.

946
01:20:57,926 --> 01:21:03,996
You're here to serve our lord,
not distract our men.

947
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:08,197
I don't think
I'm distracting anyone.

948
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:09,632
Is this about Michael?

949
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:14,037
We are not letting what we have
get in the way of our studies.

950
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:17,871
Besides, the lord
brought us together.

951
01:21:18,177 --> 01:21:20,907
It's about his past.

952
01:21:20,915 --> 01:21:22,815
What about it?

953
01:21:23,616 --> 01:21:26,786
You really don't know?

954
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:30,190
Know what?

955
01:21:50,876 --> 01:21:52,136
Rebekah.

956
01:21:52,145 --> 01:21:53,285
Oh. Hi.

957
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:54,739
Are we still meeting?

958
01:21:54,747 --> 01:21:58,317
Yeah, just let me finish this.
I'll be right there.

959
01:21:58,318 --> 01:22:02,088
Okay.
I'll be in the cafeteria.

960
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:04,088
Okay.

961
01:22:22,907 --> 01:22:26,207
I have something
i have to tell you.

962
01:22:29,614 --> 01:22:32,754
You already know,
don't you?

963
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:39,089
Are you still
attracted to men?

964
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,260
No.

965
01:22:41,258 --> 01:22:44,658
It's in the past.

966
01:22:44,662 --> 01:22:45,762
Okay, I...

967
01:22:45,763 --> 01:22:47,263
God showed me the light.

968
01:22:47,264 --> 01:22:49,094
He showed me the truth.

969
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:53,840
A lot of people have pasts
they're not proud of,

970
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:58,168
but god forgives, right?

971
01:22:58,642 --> 01:23:02,282
My life has changed so much
since I've met you.

972
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:05,318
And my feelings for you
are real.

973
01:23:05,315 --> 01:23:09,085
My feelings for you
are real, too.

974
01:23:09,085 --> 01:23:15,685
But I feel like we should
just keep hanging out
and see what happens.

975
01:23:15,692 --> 01:23:20,202
Maybe not settle on
anything too specific.

976
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:23,066
If that's okay.

977
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,399
Okay.

978
01:23:53,127 --> 01:23:56,867
Hi, I'm Michael.

979
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:37,463
Now, I wanna tell you
a little secret

980
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:42,471
about a great gift from god.

981
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:45,179
This gift is a human emotion

982
01:24:45,178 --> 01:24:50,518
and considered destructive
by the enemies of god.

983
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,950
Fear.

984
01:24:55,956 --> 01:25:02,025
You can never, never,
never stop

985
01:25:02,027 --> 01:25:04,867
fearing yourself.

986
01:25:04,864 --> 01:25:08,964
We are our own worst enemies.

987
01:25:08,968 --> 01:25:16,308
And we must fear ourselves till
the day we meet god himself.

988
01:25:16,808 --> 01:25:22,918
God didn't put us here to live
our lives in constant fear.

989
01:25:22,915 --> 01:25:23,815
No, of course not.

990
01:25:23,816 --> 01:25:27,815
And then he scolded me
for asking questions.

991
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:29,279
Well, that's not fair.

992
01:25:29,287 --> 01:25:30,157
We're here to learn

993
01:25:30,155 --> 01:25:31,385
and we learn in part
by asking questions.

994
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:34,789
No, we're here to serve god,
not to identify

995
01:25:34,793 --> 01:25:40,063
as the exact kind of christians
they want us to be.

996
01:25:41,098 --> 01:25:42,428
I'm sorry.

997
01:25:42,433 --> 01:25:43,333
Don't be.

998
01:25:43,334 --> 01:25:48,844
You know what's best
because that's god
speaking through you.

999
01:25:55,311 --> 01:25:58,411
You wanted to see me?

1000
01:25:58,815 --> 01:26:01,415
Now, you've been rallying
the students against us

1001
01:26:01,418 --> 01:26:06,488
as though you're
being controlled
by the devil himself.

1002
01:26:08,124 --> 01:26:11,494
I've learned a lot
about the Bible here,

1003
01:26:11,495 --> 01:26:12,935
and for that I thank you.

1004
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:19,170
But I refuse to be controlled
by anyone other than god.

1005
01:26:19,169 --> 01:26:20,469
I follow my own path.

1006
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:24,199
Yeah, and you want others
to follow you.

1007
01:26:24,906 --> 01:26:27,606
Perhaps it's best
if we mail you your diploma

1008
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:31,480
and that you not attend
the ceremony.

1009
01:26:35,851 --> 01:26:39,051
I don't know if i
can stay here anymore.

1010
01:26:39,055 --> 01:26:41,625
Oh. Where will we go?

1011
01:26:43,391 --> 01:26:45,121
We?

1012
01:26:46,361 --> 01:26:51,131
Uh, I've been praying about it.

1013
01:26:51,133 --> 01:26:53,502
About us.

1014
01:26:53,501 --> 01:27:01,011
I told god how I feel about you
and how much you mean to me.

1015
01:27:01,009 --> 01:27:02,939
And you know what?

1016
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:08,580
I was consumed
with nothing but peace.

1017
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:11,923
Pure peace.

1018
01:27:15,123 --> 01:27:17,463
I love you.

1019
01:27:17,459 --> 01:27:20,059
I love you, too.

1020
01:27:52,925 --> 01:27:55,125
And be not conformed
to this world:

1021
01:27:55,128 --> 01:27:59,368
But be you transformed
by the renewing of your mind,

1022
01:27:59,365 --> 01:28:05,165
that you may prove
that good, glorious,

1023
01:28:05,171 --> 01:28:08,211
and perfect will of god.

1024
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:13,545
That you may know that good,
acceptable,

1025
01:28:13,546 --> 01:28:16,276
and perfect will of god.

1026
01:28:45,109 --> 01:28:52,318
- Which would you prefer to have?
- Frosted flakes or fruit loops?

1027
01:28:52,316 --> 01:28:54,146
Well, obviously fruit loops.

1028
01:28:54,151 --> 01:28:55,381
Why? Why obviously?

1029
01:28:55,386 --> 01:28:58,156
Well, you're a fruit loop.

1030
01:29:17,706 --> 01:29:19,576
There you are.

1031
01:29:19,576 --> 01:29:21,646
Are you okay?

1032
01:29:22,344 --> 01:29:25,174
Yeah, I'm fine.

1033
01:29:29,785 --> 01:29:31,215
Okay, got 'em.

1034
01:29:34,623 --> 01:29:36,353
You get everything?

1035
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:37,729
Mm-hmm.

1036
01:29:40,062 --> 01:29:43,492
These are going to storage.

1037
01:29:49,337 --> 01:29:53,777
Well, so you can have
a little more room
for your shoes?

1038
01:29:53,776 --> 01:29:54,446
Shut up.

1039
01:29:54,443 --> 01:29:57,473
I have never seen anyone
with more shoes than you.

1040
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:00,439
You can never have
too many shoes.

1041
01:30:12,093 --> 01:30:14,363
Get those out of here.

1042
01:30:33,513 --> 01:30:34,543
Hello?

1043
01:30:34,549 --> 01:30:36,349
<i> Hi.</i>

1044
01:30:40,788 --> 01:30:43,287
Hi.

1045
01:30:45,091 --> 01:30:46,561
<i> How are you?</i>

1046
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,690
Good.

1047
01:30:48,695 --> 01:30:50,765
I finished school.

1048
01:30:50,764 --> 01:30:54,604
But I'm no longer
on their path.

1049
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:59,774
<i> So what path</i>
<i> are you on now?</i>

1050
01:30:59,773 --> 01:31:00,743
My own.

1051
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:05,210
<i> I'm going to be the pastor</i>
<i> of my own church.</i>

1052
01:31:09,316 --> 01:31:12,155
Why are you calling?

1053
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:13,451
Um...

1054
01:31:14,752 --> 01:31:16,422
I, uh...

1055
01:31:16,422 --> 01:31:18,752
I got the picture
you sent of olly.

1056
01:31:18,757 --> 01:31:21,817
<i> I know it was months ago,</i>
<i> but I didn't respond.</i>

1057
01:31:21,827 --> 01:31:24,727
<i> So how is she?</i>

1058
01:31:25,798 --> 01:31:28,158
Oh, she's getting old.

1059
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:29,497
But she's okay.

1060
01:31:29,502 --> 01:31:30,302
She has this

1061
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:33,172
<i> stuffed animal that she</i>
<i> carries around with her now</i>

1062
01:31:33,172 --> 01:31:36,212
<i> everywhere she goes</i>
<i> like it's her baby.</i>

1063
01:31:42,212 --> 01:31:43,312
Bennett...

1064
01:31:43,314 --> 01:31:47,454
I should tell you
before someone else does.

1065
01:31:47,452 --> 01:31:49,452
I'm engaged.

1066
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:54,320
To a...
Really amazing woman.

1067
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:57,291
Now, I know
what you're thinking because

1068
01:31:57,295 --> 01:31:59,725
<i> I asked myself the same thing--</i>

1069
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:01,161
<i> am I really in love with her</i>

1070
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:05,796
<i> or am I only doing this</i>
<i> to be right in god's eyes?</i>

1071
01:32:05,803 --> 01:32:11,342
<i> And I'm truly</i>
<i> in love with her, Bennett.</i>

1072
01:32:12,308 --> 01:32:15,948
God went to the root
of my same sex desires

1073
01:32:15,946 --> 01:32:17,646
and he uprooted them.

1074
01:32:17,648 --> 01:32:21,648
He demonstrated
that they were abnormal.

1075
01:32:21,652 --> 01:32:22,452
<i> Michael...</i>

1076
01:32:22,452 --> 01:32:27,292
<i> I'm really glad</i>
<i> you think you're happy.</i>

1077
01:32:28,758 --> 01:32:30,388
And I wish you all the best.

1078
01:32:30,394 --> 01:32:32,954
I really do.
I think you know that.

1079
01:32:32,963 --> 01:32:37,603
<i> But I have no idea</i>
<i> why you would call me up</i>

1080
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:40,470
<i> and use words like "abnormal."</i>

1081
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:46,210
<i> I'm so sorry for the way</i>
<i> that things went down.</i>

1082
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:49,409
<i> But just because we don't</i>

1083
01:32:49,412 --> 01:32:50,312
share certain beliefs,

1084
01:32:50,313 --> 01:32:55,513
it doesn't mean that
we can't still be friends.

1085
01:32:57,719 --> 01:33:00,659
I'll always be your friend.

1086
01:33:02,257 --> 01:33:05,897
<i> And I really hope</i>
<i> that this path</i>

1087
01:33:05,895 --> 01:33:08,994
<i> takes you where you wanna go.</i>

1088
01:33:10,364 --> 01:33:13,464
But I also hope that...

1089
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:16,538
As you're setting out
to help other people...

1090
01:33:16,538 --> 01:33:21,238
<i> That you really take some time</i>
<i> to help yourself.</i>

1091
01:33:23,944 --> 01:33:26,774
<i> I-i am. I...</i>

1092
01:33:26,781 --> 01:33:30,291
<i> I'm not gonna sit here</i>
<i> and say that I know</i>

1093
01:33:30,285 --> 01:33:33,855
<i> I'll be this way</i>
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

1094
01:33:33,855 --> 01:33:37,524
We're always changing, evolving.

1095
01:33:37,524 --> 01:33:40,894
And I'm open to that.

1096
01:33:45,733 --> 01:33:47,893
Then...

1097
01:33:47,901 --> 01:33:52,371
I guess nothing's
really changed.

1098
01:33:52,373 --> 01:33:55,573
<i> Yeah.</i>

1099
01:33:55,775 --> 01:33:59,045
<i> You take care</i>
<i> of yourself, okay?</i>

1100
01:34:01,514 --> 01:34:04,344
Goodbye, Michael.

1101
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:08,619
Bye.

1102
01:34:53,799 --> 01:34:55,699
Here they come.
