- FINALE -

29
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,418
Everything that has happened today

30
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,044
was just a big joke.

31
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:02,671
I cannot do it.

32
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,387
The person I love most

33
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:06,857
is only you.

34
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:10,698
Jia Di.

35
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,232
Did you have a nightmare?

36
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:14,056
Don't be scared.

37
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:15,570
Mom's here.

38
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,250
Mom!

39
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,503
Don't be scared.

40
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:02,914
I'm here to tell you

41
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,367
that the reason for me leaving the country,

42
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,211
specifically New York,

43
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:07,662
was to handle the investment problem in the company

44
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,148
together with Uncle Yang.

45
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:10,837
Now your father's company

46
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,225
is fine.

47
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,474
Thank you.

48
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:16,992
I didn't know

49
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,758
that you have always been caring

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,309
and helping with my family matters.

51
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:21,415
So...

52
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:23,714
You don't need a stabilizer anymore.

53
00:03:23,714 --> 00:03:25,030
Please let go of Huo Da.

54
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,351
So in your heart,

55
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,867
I am that kind of person.

56
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,389
You can't be serious? You really love Huo Da?

57
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:43,463
The only person I love is you.

58
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,382
I love him,

59
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,884
so he chose me.

60
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:51,976
So it's like that.

61
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:54,800
Then, please tell

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,188
the person inside

63
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,953
that Jia Di was waiting for him the whole night,

64
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:01,628
wondering the same question over and over again.

65
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,831
If she cannot stop loving Huo Da,

66
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:06,157
what can she do?!

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,004
I also want to know

68
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,565
what I can do.

69
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:19,365
What else can I do?

70
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,302
Who is it?

71
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,523
General Manager.

72
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:40,708
Auntie,

73
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:42,224
I'm here to look for Jia Di.

74
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:44,770
Thank you.

75
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,538
General Manager is with you now,

76
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:51,878
so I'll go out to handle other matters.

77
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,649
Okay, go do your thing.

78
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:54,566
I'm fine.

79
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:56,792
Bye bye.

80
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:29,022
Everyone must think that I'm really thick-skinned.

81
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,119
I split myself in half.

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,372
One half of me

83
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:38,905
also thinks that.

84
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:40,725
Then what about the other half?

85
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,408
The other half of me

86
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:47,257
believes Huo Da would not do that.

87
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,113
I don't know how to explain it,

88
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,304
but I just believe in him.

89
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,458
Actually,

90
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,918
there's also a part of me that

91
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,353
still believes

92
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,586
that Huo Da will make you sad and cry,

93
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:07,814
but the other half of me

94
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:10,410
also believes in him, like you do.

95
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:12,344
Anyway,

96
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,703
no matter what, I will still believe that you,

97
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:17,130
even if the situation worsens,

98
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,690
will be able to carry on.

99
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:27,095
Even if

100
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:29,098
I can only chase after his shadow,

101
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:30,635
I will not give up.

102
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:35,318
I will use all my strength to run foward.

103
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,551
I will definitely catch up to him.

104
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,195
NT $7000?!

105
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:57,368
You want to steal?

106
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:58,701
What Master and his Angel?

107
00:06:58,941 --> 00:06:59,616
Who are you?

108
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:00,801
No manners at all!

109
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:02,957
I am your Master.

110
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:03,817
Hurry and get over here!

111
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:06,428
It's the Devil!

112
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,785
I'm dead!

113
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:10,072
Starting tomorrow,

114
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:11,257
she's the angel,

115
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:13,097
you're the master.

116
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:14,130
To me,

117
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,411
this is a fun game.

118
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,350
The goal of this game is to

119
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,811
try my best to

120
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:22,242
harass you, bully you.

121
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:36,647
Leave my things here.

122
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,134
Take your things and leave,

123
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:39,170
thief!

124
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,757
And you...

125
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,164
are really horrible, really horrible, really horrible!

126
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,257
Look carefully!

127
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:50,181
The things I'm taking now,

128
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,168
are all mine!

129
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:54,630
Eating with the right person

130
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,758
is not torture,

131
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:56,665
not forced,

132
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:57,945
it's happiness.

133
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:59,619
You're such a pitiful loser that you won't

134
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:01,008
understand it in a lifetime!

135
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,604
Empty exchange coupons,

136
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:05,867
or the ones that I haven't thought of yet.

137
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:07,384
Can all these

138
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,544
be used as my rent?

139
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,343
Lend your handkerchief to me.

140
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:14,067
I don't have such girly things like handkerchiefs.

141
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,954
But...

142
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:18,437
I can lend you my hands.

143
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,368
Do you believe when people die,

144
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:26,335
they'll become stars?

145
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:28,305
I believe so.

146
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:30,943
When I want to cry,

147
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:33,444
the stars in the sky

148
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:35,104
are just like my dad's eyes.

149
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,150
It's just like he's saying to me,

150
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,992
Jia Di, you have to keep going!

151
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:41,230
Don't cry. You have to be brave.

152
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,007
You only know how to make me mad

153
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,320
and upset.

154
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,677
Crying for a person like you is such a waste!

155
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:50,215
But how come I still don't want to lose you?

156
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,606
If...

157
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:54,633
I have 100 dislikes of you,

158
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,681
later on, without noticing,

159
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:00,225
they'll automatically exchange for 100 likes.

160
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,023
I want to continue dating you.

161
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:31,219
You're really moving...

162
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,076
to go live with that fox?!

163
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:37,478
Hey!

164
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:38,681
You're leaving just like that?!

165
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:40,828
It's really unfair to treat Jia Di this way!

166
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:43,181
You're despicable!

167
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:45,105
This kind of method

168
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:46,451
is the most despicable I've ever heard!

169
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,228
Go apologize to her!

170
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:51,340
Hey!

171
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:53,778
You've really changed your heart?

172
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,533
If you still take me as your brother,

173
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,809
then listen to me!

174
00:09:58,186 --> 00:09:59,557
Huo Da stays!

175
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:20,873
How come you've turned into this kind of person?!

176
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,677
What do you take Jia Di for?!

177
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,687
That princess wants your brother; not you.

178
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:29,220
Then, you went for Jia Di.

179
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,874
Princess couldn't get your brother, so she came back for you,

180
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,155
so you're dumping Jia Di!

181
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,356
You're an ass!

182
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:36,653
Cold-blooded!

183
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:37,811
Heartless!

184
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:43,706
Bo Zi,

185
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,996
have you yelled enough?

186
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:48,471
If you have,

187
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:50,044
can I go now?

188
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:07,143
Asshole!

189
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:16,653
Yan Shu,

190
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,482
sorry.

191
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:21,715
I've let everyone misunderstand you.

192
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:22,901
I'm terribly sorry.

193
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:26,002
During this time,

194
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:28,356
the most unfair thing is

195
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,433
I want to try my best

196
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,716
to make Jia Di and everyone else hate me,

197
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,092
but

198
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,621
I've brought you down with me.

199
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:38,339
It has nothing to do with you,

200
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,092
yet you have to carry this burden.

201
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:43,731
How can it be not related to me?

202
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,799
Huo Da,

203
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,831
In your time of pain,
 
204
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,602
I am who you chose to trust.

205
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,338
It is a very

206
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,137
treasured feeling.

207
00:11:58,862 --> 00:11:59,966
Yan Shu...

208
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,530
Even though misunderstanding is a must,

209
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,510
it's not important.

210
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,250
The thing that's most important right now

211
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,026
is taking you to the hospital.

212
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,762
What you owe me is the truth.

213
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,529
Wait until you recover,

214
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:15,810
then repay me.

215
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:20,433
Before going to the hospital,

216
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:23,408
I still have something to do.

217
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,438
Please come in.

218
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:35,825
What is it?

219
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:38,248
Huo Da wants you to meet him.

220
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:40,128
He has something to tell you in person.

221
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,825
If you don't want to listen,

222
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:47,283
I won't force you.

223
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:16,282
If it wasn't for Jia Di,

224
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,798
I wouldn't want to speak with you

225
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,140
nor see you at all.

226
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:22,362
I know.

227
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:25,656
I've been wanting to know

228
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,014
out of curiously,

229
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,454
why did you have to do that?

230
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,391
Because you've always loved Jia Di.

231
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,266
I've never denied to that point,

232
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,490
but that definitely isn't

233
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,767
the reason you hurt Jia Di.

234
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,661
I don't want to hurt her either.

235
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:47,583
I know that you don't want to intentionally hurt Jia Di,

236
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,532
so don't mess with Yan Shu anymore.

237
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:50,757
Return to Jia Di,

238
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,144
and everything can still be resolved.

239
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:54,898
But my heart

240
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:56,197
cannot leave Yan Shu.

241
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,491
Then what were you doing before?

242
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:00,178
Wanting to deceive her, because you were lonely?

243
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:02,008
Or was it a fun joke to you?

244
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:04,650
Probably all of the above.

245
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:08,496
Huo Da, you're too selfish.

246
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:09,977
If you love Yan Shu,

247
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:11,685
why did you make Jia Di love you?

248
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:15,088
What you want to ask is

249
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,146
how come I had to ruin the relationship between Taiwan Ah Xin and you.

250
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,038
Is there meaning to that question anymore?

251
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,259
It's not important what I want.

252
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,101
What you should do is apologize to Jia Di!

253
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,493
Is she alright?

254
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,119
Could she be?

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,337
She cried uncontrollably,

256
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,417
then used all her strength to eat,

257
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,147
and then prepared to start anew

258
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:40,414
and get you back.

259
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,556
She's really old-fashioned.

260
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,900
Other girls would have given up already,

261
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,706
yet she's still there and so strong-willed.

262
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,462
That's her cutest

263
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:52,935
and most captivating point.

264
00:14:58,178 --> 00:14:58,953
Before,

265
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:00,140
when there wasn't Yan Shu,

266
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:02,329
I was also very captivated.

267
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:04,836
But just awhile back,

268
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,360
when Yan Shu got in a car accident,

269
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,175
there was a chance for her and me to reconcile.

270
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,786
Jia Di or Yan Shu?

271
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,224
I'm not sure.

272
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,599
Because your decisions

273
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,320
will hurt both of them.

274
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,701
You have already hurt Jia Di,

275
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,131
but what if you have regrets?

276
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:27,576
Are you going to hurt Yan Shu then?

277
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:29,414
So

278
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:30,832
there must be a conclusion.

279
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:32,548
This time, we'll leave it to fate.

280
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:36,677
Pick one.

281
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,094
What is it?

282
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,768
Taiwan Ah Xin's clever exchange coupons had her

283
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,018
forced to live at my place,

284
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:42,799
and the exchange coupons that she used to pay the rent.

285
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:44,644
I have already written down the exchange item.

286
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:46,136
Pick.

287
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:48,253
What's it say on it?

288
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,506
One is

289
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:51,993
an exchange coupon to give her happiness.

290
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,365
What about the other one?

291
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,411
An exchange coupon to wish her happiness.

292
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,539
~Give her happiness~

293
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:46,026
Since fate has given us the answer,

294
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:47,698
you have to give her happiness.

295
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,044
It means that

296
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:50,719
I wish her happiness.

297
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:52,635
I give you guys my best wishes.

298
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:56,511
Can she still be happy

299
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:57,946
without you?

300
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,869
Tong Jia Di's happiness is your responsibility.

301
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:02,152
Can you do it?

302
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,544
She loves you.

303
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,436
There won't be me in the future.

304
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:08,421
Only you.

305
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,514
You're so handsome,

306
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,377
and you're serious about her.

307
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:14,872
I believe Jia Di knows.

308
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:16,472
Huo Da, don't regret thia.

309
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:18,453
I will use all my ability to pursue Jia Di.

310
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,124
Very good.

311
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,059
You and Jia Di.

312
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,437
Yan Shu and I.

313
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:25,691
It must be all God's preperation.

314
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,014
Jia Di really loves you!

315
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:10,445
Let me see the other exchange coupon!

316
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,108
Take it out.

317
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,155
~Give her happiness~

318
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,781
You have seen through me.

319
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,511
Yes. I've deceived you.

320
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,150
Both of them are the same.

321
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:34,782
You would've definitely picked

322
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,448
the 'Give her Happiness' exchange coupon,

323
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,213
and I could smoothly

324
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:40,031
push Taiwan Ah Xin to you.

325
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,789
Cut all ties between her and me.

326
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:44,839
Is Huo Da worried

327
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,529
that no one will replace him in taking care of Jia Di?

328
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,530
You have to act so despicably

329
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,423
just to ditch Jia Di?

330
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:54,228
Just go along with the play.

331
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:55,592
Isn't it more touching?

332
00:18:58,216 --> 00:18:59,363
At least like this,

333
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:01,294
I won't have to face the crying Ah Xin.

334
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
She gets more annoying by the minute.

335
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,621
I've toleranced enough of

336
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,838
her childlike behavior!

337
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,477
Huo Yan! Stop!

338
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,412
From now on,

339
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,446
I will use all my capabilities to protect Jia Di.

340
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,151
Don't forget...

341
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:47,400
Give her happiness.

342
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:57,279
Why did you do that?

343
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:00,825
Why did you give Jia Di to Huo Yan?

344
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:05,278
Are you preparing for the aftermath?

345
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,496
Are you giving your last words?

346
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,156
You believe you're going to die for sure?!

347
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:17,269
Are you giving up?!

348
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:21,563
I don't want to give up either.

349
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,102
But God

350
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,707
seems like He has given up on me.

351
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,237
Death...

352
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:37,941
is something that I've never thought about.

353
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:43,194
Before, when I've experienced a few crashes,

354
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,286
not once was I scared.

355
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,161
But this time,

356
00:20:50,277 --> 00:20:51,618
I'm really scared.

357
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,958
Scared that unknowingly,

358
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:57,725
I'll be tricked by God.

359
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,726
No way. It doesn't matter how scared you are,

360
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,320
you still have to fight.

361
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,132
I won't allow you give Jia Di's happiness

362
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:10,823
to Huo Yan.

363
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,082
You have no right to wave the white flag to Hell.

364
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:21,585
Let's go. Take me to the hospital.

365
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:04,225
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

366
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:06,013
Leave your message after the beep.

367
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,763
Jia Di, mom's back!

368
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:23,538
Jia Di!

369
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:31,738
Jia Di!

370
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:32,947
Sister-in-law!

371
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:34,472
I'm telling you...

372
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,079
Right now,

373
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,222
I'm changing my career to insurance.

374
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,033
I think

375
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:39,188
that this plan

376
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:40,610
will suit you.

377
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,813
Also, right now it's on sale.

378
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:42,891
I'm telling you,

379
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:43,985
I'm not in the mood to talk to you about this.

380
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:45,002
If you want to drink something, get it yourself.

381
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:45,757
I need to use the phone.

382
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:10,176
How come no one's picking up?

383
00:23:12,564 --> 00:23:14,768
Jia Di wouldn't be in trouble, would she?

384
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:35,614
Hello?

385
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,708
Hello, General Manager.

386
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,989
I am Jia Di's mom.

387
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:39,615
Is Jia Di with you?

388
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:40,879
Auntie,

389
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,554
Jia Di is not here.

390
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:45,973
I thought she was resting at home,

391
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:46,787
but when I came back

392
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:48,347
she wasn't here.

393
00:23:48,347 --> 00:23:50,113
Yesterday, Huo Da hurt her so badly,

394
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:51,880
where would she go?

395
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,550
I called her cellphone just now,

396
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,318
but she didn't pick up.

397
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:57,957
Then... I know she's a very earnest child,

398
00:23:57,957 --> 00:23:59,505
so she won't do silly things,

399
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,508
but... I'm still very worried.

400
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:02,883
Auntie,

401
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:04,654
I think I know where Jia Di is.

402
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,364
Mr. Huo,

403
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,741
have you been sleeping well lately?

404
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,540
Not that well.

405
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:13,411
Not that well. Okay.

406
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,522
What about eating? Normal?

407
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:19,150
I don't have much of an appetite.

408
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:06,112
Wear it.

409
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:07,551
Don't catch a cold.

410
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:10,377
Auntie is very worried about you.

411
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:11,957
She told me to find you.

412
00:25:15,954 --> 00:25:17,083
Don't forget.

413
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,098
There are still a lot of people

414
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:20,034
who will be sad if you get hurt.

415
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,228
They don't seem to be back yet.

416
00:25:27,147 --> 00:25:29,049
I want to stay here and wait for them to come back.

417
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:33,209
I want to know why he changed so drastically.

418
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,368
You may see things

419
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,669
that might make you even sadder.

420
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:44,457
At least I can work harder, right?

421
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:50,714
Maybe we just didn't have a good talk.

422
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:53,323
Or maybe he has something to tell me,

423
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:56,621
but I spent too much time arguing with him.

424
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,996
So I didn't give him a chance to talk.

425
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:00,620
At least like this,

426
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,106
I won't have to face a crying Ah Xin.

427
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,959
She gets more annoying by the minute.

428
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,294
I've tolerated enough of

429
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:07,668
her childlike behaviour!

430
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,824
Don't wait anymore.

431
00:26:11,824 --> 00:26:13,247
I'll take you back.

432
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:16,110
I want to wait for him.

433
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,283
Based on Huo Da's personality,

434
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:28,812
if he doesn't want to turn back,

435
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:31,218
I'm scared that you'll be hurt even deeper.

436
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:36,113
You're scared that the Devil will think that I'm too scared to stand up,

437
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:38,004
will use an even more despicable attitude towards me,

438
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,752
and push me away, right?

439
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:44,319
Actually, I know

440
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,429
that if he speaks one more harsh sentence

441
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:49,710
I won't be able to take it.

442
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,866
But in my heart,

443
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:52,774
there has always been a voice

444
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54,997
telling me

445
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:57,841
that when the Devil's very harsh on the outside,

446
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:03,026
it means that his heart is at its most vulnerable.

447
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:05,420
Since you know that you could

448
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,825
be hurt until you can hurt no more,

449
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,156
and becoming shriveled up and blank space,

450
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:09,625
you won't give up?

451
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:14,735
All I really wanna know is why.

452
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:18,864
I just want to know why.

453
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:20,499
Even if he doesn't return to me,

454
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:22,157
it's all right.

455
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:24,453
I know that you'll get hurt,

456
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:26,876
but is watching you get hurt the only thing I can do?

457
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:29,782
Is my character's position only like that?

458
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:40,233
Exchange coupon for a 'Gold Fist.'

459
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:42,406
If one day, Jia Di gets tired,

460
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:44,847
you can exchange with the 10th Guy.

461
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:46,499
Exchange what?

462
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,421
Now that his fist has recovered,

463
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:49,725
his hands are strong,

464
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:52,827
he can exchange with you, 'Heaven-sent hands.'

465
00:27:58,238 --> 00:27:59,954
I have said before

466
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:02,173
that every part of me will believe in you.

467
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:03,657
Even if you hurt deeper,

468
00:28:03,657 --> 00:28:05,531
you'll be able to bring yourself up again.

469
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,472
But don't just depend on one person,

470
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:10,593
I have my 'Gold Fist' that will also support you.

471
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:17,438
10th Guy,

472
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:19,017
thank you.

473
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,176
I'm so lucky to have you as my friend.

474
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,627
Miss Yan Shu!

475
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,037
Miss Yan Shu!

476
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,192
Please let me see Huo Da.

477
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:54,940
No way.

478
00:28:55,898 --> 00:28:58,178
I won't let you see Huo Da anymore.

479
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:04,129
Since he has chosen me already,

480
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:06,832
I don't want to be by myself.

481
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:09,768
Jia Di.

482
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:11,473
Don't wish me happiness,

483
00:29:11,473 --> 00:29:13,741
but please face reality.

484
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,130
Don't come anymore.

485
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,357
Don't be like this.

486
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,938
Why are you still angry with me?

487
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:25,872
Isn't this the ending you want?

488
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,826
I'm not like you.

489
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:31,717
I rather see her happy

490
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:34,296
than force her to stay by my side.

491
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:36,112
Whatever.

492
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:47,743
Come back tomorrow.

493
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:48,632
Jia Di,

494
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,844
if you continue, you won't be able to take it.

495
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:55,743
You think your determination

496
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,196
can break through his steel heart?

497
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:03,082
I believe that one day, he'll soften.

498
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:16,424
Yang Yan Shu,

499
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:18,956
don't think of anything else.

500
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:21,814
You can only be be Huo Da's accompaniment.

501
00:30:21,814 --> 00:30:25,986
When things get cleared up,

502
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,177
you and Huo Da

503
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:29,833
probably will have lost our loved ones.

504
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,331
Even if it turns out like that,

505
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:35,315
you can't weaver.

506
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:42,708
Sister-in-law, this insurance...

507
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,138
How come General Manager

508
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,834
hasn't brought Jia Di back yet?

509
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,429
It's been so long already.

510
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:55,804
Sister-in-law,

511
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:58,380
isn't Jia Di dating that second young master?

512
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,489
How come she's with that General Manager?

513
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:02,160
Who's with who?!

514
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,534
It's because the Devil had a change of heart

515
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,358
and went back to Yang Yan Shu again.

516
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:10,307
It's better this way!

517
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:12,260
What's so good about that?

518
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:15,326
It is good!

519
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,760
Look, no matter who Jia Di chooses

520
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,534
she has to choose the General Manager

521
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:21,995
and not a sick person!

522
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:24,699
Sick?

523
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,151
Hello, Auntie.

524
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,216
Sorry,

525
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:35,025
I can't convince Jia Di to go home.

526
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:37,663
Please let me talk with Jia Di.

527
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:44,933
Jia Di,

528
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:46,683
your mom is asking for you.

529
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:52,586
Mom,

530
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:56,821
I know what I'm doing is very stubborn,

531
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:59,442
but please don't stop me.

532
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,235
Jia Di,

533
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:03,520
don't wait anymore.

534
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,238
You won't be able to see him.

535
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,455
He's sick.

536
00:32:07,764 --> 00:32:13,300
He has Wilson's Disease...

537
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:17,712
Jia Di!

538
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:40,365
If there's another person who's always in my heart, how can I continue dating you?

539
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:42,959
Even if I do have a future wife in my heart

540
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:44,960
It won't be Taiwan Ah Xin.

541
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:46,668
I can't do it.

542
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:49,773
Everything that happened today has been a joke.

543
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:50,990
To prevent hurting Jia Di,

544
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,960
I definitely cannot marry her.

545
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,973
Because since beginning, the one that I love most is you Yan Shu.

546
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:03,429
I want to be with you.

547
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,273
I want to be with you in your most dangerous moments.

548
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:07,511
In your darkest moments,

549
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:09,273
I want to be with you waiting for daylight.

550
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:35,265
Devil

551
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:45,571
Devil

552
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,795
I saw him in so much pain.

553
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:03,749
It was only a nightmare,

554
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,204
don't be afraid.

555
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:09,768
He must be really scared all alone.

556
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:38,690
Hello?

557
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:41,438
Really, you've found the Devil?!

558
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,654
Okay, got it!

559
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:44,338
Mom!

560
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,117
The General Manager said that he found the Devil.

561
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,169
I have to go find him quickly.

562
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,458
Jia Di,

563
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:54,739
he must of had his reasons for not telling you he was sick.

564
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,679
He's afraid of seeing you sad.

565
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,153
I know I'll definitely be really sad, but...

566
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:03,519
You don't understand.

567
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:07,209
You don't know how much that kind of sadness hurts.

568
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:11,988
When your father was sick in hospital,

569
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,159
I also thought I was really strong and really brave.

570
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,674
But then I realized that

571
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,742
I was more and more afraid of walking into the ward.

572
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:22,627
I was afraid of seeing him get thinner and thinner.

573
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:24,593
Seeing him talk less and less.

574
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,763
I was afraid of seeing him getting closer and closer to death.

575
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:30,386
Getting further and further away from me.

576
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,306
So I won't stop you from going to see him,

577
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,024
but you must be prepared.

578
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:39,803
A person doesn't fight a disease alone,

579
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:42,266
he does it with all those who love him.

580
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:45,712
If you want to see him,

581
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:47,765
you must be stronger than him.

582
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,972
I will be very strong.

583
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:53,617
Mom.

584
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:00,318
Huo Yan.

585
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:06,231
Yan Shu,

586
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,047
when you were little, you used to help Huo Da cover up everything.

587
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,005
Helping him write repentence letters.

588
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,539
Pretending to be his parent and calling the school when he got in trouble.

589
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,102
It's not like I didn't know.

590
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,650
But this,

591
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:20,565
how could you hide it from everyone,

592
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:22,630
and help him lie to us?

593
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:25,527
Don't blame Yan Shu.

594
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:28,058
It's because of me that everyone hates her now.

595
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:29,372
It's all my fault.

596
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,434
It was me who asked her to bear these grievances.

597
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:35,487
I'll leave now.

598
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:36,434
You two can talk.

599
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:55,464
You're a General Manager, but do you want to become a Private Investigator instead?

600
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:00,153
Don't laugh.

601
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:03,809
You mean you want me to cry?

602
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:07,903
Hiding your disease, lying to everyone.

603
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:09,029
Don't laugh.

604
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,833
Please don't tell Jia Di.

605
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,215
So this is the way you protect her?

606
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,466
I'm not that great, I just don't feel like...

607
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:30,717
seeing her cry.

608
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:34,155
Then there's no problem.

609
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,000
No problem?

610
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:41,958
She's Tong Jia Di,

611
00:37:42,673 --> 00:37:43,764
the bravest girl.

612
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:46,193
Have you forgotten?

613
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:50,438
The first time you met, she was willing to believe in you,

614
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,353
and risked her life to help you finish that stunt.

615
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:57,728
Don't worry about her.

616
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,071
She won't cry.

617
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:03,122
You picked an exchange coupon to give her happiness.

618
00:38:03,645 --> 00:38:05,211
You can't be so unreliable.

619
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:07,556
Giving her happiness

620
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,006
is your responsibility!

621
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,022
I can't give it to her.

622
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:13,513
Even until the day I die,

623
00:38:13,513 --> 00:38:15,193
I can't make her happy.

624
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:17,106
The one who's going to die isn't you.

625
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,295
Of course you can say it so easily!

626
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:28,932
Go give her happiness.

627
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,323
Go love her.

628
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:32,237
Go.

629
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,101
I asked you to go love her.

630
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:38,426
Don't let her go through so much pain for me.

631
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:40,896
Listen...

632
00:38:44,513 --> 00:38:46,103
When you were cruel to her,

633
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:47,414
she didn't give up on you.

634
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:48,958
She still chose to believe in you.

635
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,397
Where did your courage go?

636
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:53,147
Are you the type to just give up?

637
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,175
Listen to me.

638
00:38:57,344 --> 00:39:01,484
If you really love her, then for her sake, you must live on.

639
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:24,737
Yan Shu,

640
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,766
I'm sorry

641
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:29,546
and...

642
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:30,863
thank you.

643
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:34,724
I was only helping Huo Da

644
00:39:35,669 --> 00:39:37,223
to get Jia Di to give up on him,

645
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,642
to let him not have any last regrets,

646
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:44,359
and willingly stay in the hospital for treatment.

647
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:47,538
I didn't want to hide it from you and Uncle Huo.

648
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,792
I'm sorry,

649
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:53,401
I blamed you wrongly

650
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:55,973
and said those things to you.

651
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:03,704
All the grievances in face of death are nothing.

652
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:07,422
I just hope that Huo Da will live.

653
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,089
He definitely will.

654
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:10,369
We have to believe.

655
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:13,994
With you here to face it with me,

656
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:15,237
of course I can believe.

657
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,385
Actually,

658
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:20,334
I really wanted to tell you the truth.

659
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:27,296
Especially after seeing Jia Di waiting outside my house.

660
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,547
Jia Di already knows about Huo Da's illness.

661
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,595
A person doesn't fight a disease alone,

662
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,442
he does it with all those who love him.

663
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,982
If you want to see him,

664
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,253
you must be stronger than him.

665
00:41:53,827 --> 00:42:01,232
I'm so happy that God gave me this chance to let me have what I wanted.

666
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:08,043
I didn't want to leave you with pain.

667
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:10,264
What right do you have to make that decision by yourself?

668
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,953
It was you who barged into my circle.

669
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:17,859
I always let you do what you wanted,

670
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,053
but only this time I won't let you.

671
00:42:21,865 --> 00:42:23,021
I'm probably going to die.

672
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:25,631
You don't have to die.

673
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,861
I will!

674
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:33,349
Everybody will die.

675
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:38,012
There are a lot of people who have already left us.

676
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:39,701
My dad,

677
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:40,640
your mom,

678
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,607
Auntie Qin,

679
00:42:43,505 --> 00:42:45,607
but their love won't leave us.

680
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,594
So, even if you're going to die, you can't push me away.

681
00:42:52,013 --> 00:42:54,741
In this world there are so many unexpected deaths.

682
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:58,765
I don't want us to lose the chance to love each other because of fear.

683
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:07,358
I don't want to lose you.

684
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,641
Then live on.

685
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:18,358
I will live.

686
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,062
I will.

687
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:23,231
Me too.

688
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:27,192
Every minute and every second, I will do my best to live on.

689
00:43:47,112 --> 00:43:48,049
Dad...

690
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:07,508
Why am I stuck here?

691
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:13,547
Why am I not at the racing grounds,

692
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:19,861
not in school, not at the Huo departmental store.

693
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,501
Why am I here?

694
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,016
Everyday it feels like I'm waiting to die.

695
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:40,113
You're waiting to recover.

696
00:44:45,478 --> 00:44:47,941
Only now do I know

697
00:44:49,863 --> 00:44:53,488
why my dad is always angry with me.

698
00:44:54,688 --> 00:45:00,766
Why, whenever Huo Yan sees me, he will lecture me.

699
00:45:01,218 --> 00:45:02,193
Why?

700
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,870
The person I used to be

701
00:45:17,806 --> 00:45:19,681
was really too wasteful.

702
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:24,953
I always thought that

703
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,225
I still had

704
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:30,600
a lot of time ahead of me to waste.

705
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:38,010
But now, without expecting it,

706
00:45:40,016 --> 00:45:43,778
in a moment, I suddenly seem to have

707
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,254
no more time left.

708
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:53,911
You finally realized

709
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:58,630
one of the three biggest sins in my life is to waste.

710
00:46:00,076 --> 00:46:00,818
Don't worry,

711
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,855
you've already confessed,

712
00:46:02,855 --> 00:46:04,354
Heaven will forgive you.

713
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:17,557
He'll give me another chance, right?

714
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:22,302
All my wastefulness in the past,

715
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,538
He will fix it.

716
00:46:27,226 --> 00:46:28,023
Right?

717
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:38,179
Definitely.

718
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:00,203
Your son has Wilson's Disease.

719
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,848
His liver is about to die from the damage,

720
00:47:03,077 --> 00:47:04,469
and we still can't find a donor.

721
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,265
So his life will most likely be in danger.

722
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:08,985
I hope you understand.

723
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:28,726
What happened?

724
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:32,357
One who falls sick should be around my age.

725
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:33,605
Why is it my son?

726
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:38,053
Why is it like this?

727
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:47,363
Director.

728
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:11,304
You...

729
00:49:13,525 --> 00:49:15,136
How do you feel?

730
00:49:26,435 --> 00:49:27,801
Don't be scared.

731
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:31,688
I will get you the best doctors.

732
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:37,215
If this hospital isn't good enough, I will have someone find another one.

733
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:39,362
We'll definitely find the best hospital and doctors.

734
00:49:43,404 --> 00:49:44,954
Here is great.

735
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,011
No matter how much money we spend,

736
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,344
we have to save him.

737
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:51,146
I know.

738
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:54,918
What else...

739
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:56,990
What else can I do?

740
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:00,270
Dad...

741
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,334
I'll do whatever needs to be done.

742
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:02,267
Don't worry.

743
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:03,612
Of course I'm worried.

744
00:50:05,237 --> 00:50:08,236
My son is sick, yet I can't do anything.

745
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,642
So what if I'm Huo Zheng Hao?

746
00:50:14,392 --> 00:50:17,198
So what if I'm a force to be reckoned with in business?

747
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:21,397
In the end, I'm still a helpless father.

748
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,570
Dad,

749
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:42,965
I read...

750
00:50:43,184 --> 00:50:45,006
mom's diary.

751
00:50:48,198 --> 00:50:49,852
She said...

752
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,996
She loved you.

753
00:50:58,846 --> 00:50:59,346
So

754
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,143
giving birth to me

755
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:09,266
was mom's greatest satisfaction.

756
00:51:13,777 --> 00:51:21,059
For that reason alone, it's worth it to live on for her.

757
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:26,500
It's me.

758
00:51:27,956 --> 00:51:33,001
I didn't take care of your mother's well being.

759
00:51:40,658 --> 00:51:45,502
I was mom's greatest satisfaction.

760
00:51:49,283 --> 00:51:50,003
But...

761
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:59,597
my contributions to you are so bad.

762
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,954
I forced you to retreat,

763
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,602
gave you high blood pressure,

764
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:09,544
embarrassed you,

765
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:12,901
lost you money,

766
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,869
that...

767
00:52:15,246 --> 00:52:17,501
...was all me.

768
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:22,378
The one who helped you earn money,

769
00:52:23,012 --> 00:52:25,487
who gave you pride,

770
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:31,086
I also feel so thankful for you.

771
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:33,755
Good thing...

772
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,597
you brought Huo Yan back.

773
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:40,584
That

774
00:52:41,344 --> 00:52:43,505
was all done by him.

775
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:49,673
It doesn't matter if there's Huo Yan,

776
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:53,877
my expectations for you are the same.

777
00:52:55,396 --> 00:52:56,376
But you...

778
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:59,251
I only know how to make you angry.

779
00:53:02,897 --> 00:53:04,623
I'm angry,

780
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:09,689
but I can't truly be angry at you because...

781
00:53:13,946 --> 00:53:15,478
I know

782
00:53:17,265 --> 00:53:19,184
I let your mother down.

783
00:53:21,872 --> 00:53:24,014
And all my actions,

784
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:25,840
without fail,

785
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:27,997
remind you of that fact.

786
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:31,393
Yes.

787
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:36,180
So...

788
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:44,654
So I don't know

789
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:47,198
how to face you.

790
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,159
Dad...

791
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:03,411
Even though we think differently,

792
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:09,100
your willingness to say it

793
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:14,579
makes me very happy.

794
00:54:17,243 --> 00:54:18,868
At least,

795
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:23,258
in your world,

796
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,650
I'm not just the empty air.

797
00:54:33,557 --> 00:54:35,678
You are my son.

798
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,681
Huo Yan too.

799
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,178
You both are.

800
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:43,312
I cannot lose either of you.

801
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,385
I promised your mom...

802
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:51,005
To leave the best for you.

803
00:54:58,025 --> 00:54:58,745
Dad...

804
00:55:02,205 --> 00:55:04,329
Thank you.

805
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:33,718
Mom,

806
00:55:33,718 --> 00:55:35,912
next time I go to the hospital, I'll be back late.

807
00:55:36,173 --> 00:55:37,858
Go to bed, don't wait up for me.

808
00:55:38,141 --> 00:55:39,639
Don't worry about me.

809
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:42,313
Is Xiao Da okay?

810
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:45,056
I believe he'll get better.

811
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:47,118
I believe he'll get better too.

812
00:55:51,235 --> 00:55:54,087
So you were acting mean on purpose?

813
00:55:54,514 --> 00:55:55,149
Devil,

814
00:55:55,149 --> 00:55:56,714
why are you so pitiful?

815
00:55:57,307 --> 00:55:58,104
So, all along,

816
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,590
we've been wrongly accusing you?

817
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:04,803
And I also said all of those words, cursing you to the eighteenth level of hell.

818
00:56:04,803 --> 00:56:06,163
I didn't mean it!

819
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:09,903
Devil,

820
00:56:09,903 --> 00:56:12,224
your love for Jia Di is really too great!

821
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:14,471
I'm really touched.

822
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:16,106
You're too exaggerated.

823
00:56:22,025 --> 00:56:25,313
Could you please not tell Bo Zi and the rest?

824
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,540
Why?

825
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,169
Bo Zi said that he wanted to cut all ties with you.

826
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:29,343
I'm going to go tell him right now.

827
00:56:30,204 --> 00:56:33,076
I don't want to let this affect them.

828
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:39,386
I don't know if it's right to say this, but I feel since there's a problem,

829
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:40,825
why don't you explain it clearly to everyone?

830
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:54,105
The Devil just left like that. He really isn't a good friend.

831
00:56:54,105 --> 00:56:55,229
Stop talking about that person!

832
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:57,135
From now on, we aren't brother's anymore!

833
00:56:57,441 --> 00:56:58,324
Bo Zi...

834
00:56:58,723 --> 00:57:01,795
I just can't stand the way he treats Good Family's Virgin Girl. It's really low.

835
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:03,130
I forbid you to talk about him like that.

836
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:04,828
What?

837
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,075
Aren't you unhappy with him too?

838
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,172
Bo Zi...

839
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:13,060
I don't want to hide it from you guys anymore.

840
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:16,021
The Devil...

841
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:20,474
He's about to die.

842
00:57:24,585 --> 00:57:25,992
What?

843
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,034
I want to donate my liver!

844
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:37,724
Me too!

845
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:38,664
Me too!

846
00:57:40,492 --> 00:57:41,658
Big mouth.

847
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:42,486
Devil,

848
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:43,783
you're sick? Why didn't you tell us?

849
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:45,001
Aren't we brothers?

850
00:57:45,001 --> 00:57:45,863
You're so selfish!

851
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:46,817
Really a bastard!

852
00:57:46,817 --> 00:57:47,806
Keeping secrets?!

853
00:57:47,806 --> 00:57:49,375
Being that kind of friend really pains us.

854
00:57:49,627 --> 00:57:51,377
Yeah! Aren't your problems our problems?

855
00:57:51,741 --> 00:57:52,975
What is it with not telling us anything?

856
00:57:53,286 --> 00:57:54,852
Letting us misunderstand you, does it feel really good?

857
00:57:54,852 --> 00:57:55,552
You're too noisy!

858
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:00,377
Stop nagging!

859
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:02,129
Now we're together, listen to me.

860
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:02,896
I want to donate my liver!

861
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,256
I want to donate too!

862
00:58:04,256 --> 00:58:06,242
We know how you feel,

863
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:09,059
but a liver transplant

864
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,078
can only be from a relative.

865
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,276
What relatives?!

866
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,419
He's my brother!

867
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,291
Why can't I donate?

868
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:34,806
Stop crying you little girl!

869
00:58:43,295 --> 00:58:44,985
The situation now is very depressing.

870
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:47,536
His liver is just about to fail from the damage.

871
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:51,513
You mean...

872
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:56,762
If we still can't get a liver, the patient will be in serious danger.

873
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,763
I hope you are prepared.

874
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:15,384
The situation now is very depressing.

875
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,709
His liver is just about to fail from the damage.

876
00:59:20,288 --> 00:59:21,946
You mean...

877
00:59:23,804 --> 00:59:25,462
If we still can't get a liver,

878
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:26,896
the patient will be in serious danger.

879
00:59:28,456 --> 00:59:30,019
I hope you are prepared.

880
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:36,867
Jia Di,

881
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:38,307
don't be discouraged.

882
00:59:43,618 --> 00:59:44,778
I'm not discouraged.

883
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,616
I still have a lot of things to do.

884
00:59:54,617 --> 00:59:55,524
Please...

885
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:56,852
One will do... just one.

886
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:04,802
Good, thanks.

887
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:09,982
Even in the hospital

888
01:00:10,295 --> 01:00:13,604
Jia Di still uses her Taiwan Ah Xin spirit

889
01:00:14,098 --> 01:00:18,379
to try her best and not let Huo Da lose his fighting spirit against the illness.

890
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:23,662
Only she knows how to pass through Huo Da's walls.

891
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:25,504
Uglier, okay?

892
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:26,513
It's to make him laugh.

893
01:00:26,801 --> 01:00:27,982
One, Two, Three.

894
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,451
Thanks!

895
01:01:10,471 --> 01:01:11,285
Director,

896
01:01:11,616 --> 01:01:12,720
I am Tong Jia Di.

897
01:01:19,366 --> 01:01:20,316
Is that really my dad?

898
01:01:21,691 --> 01:01:23,226
He always has a poker face,

899
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:24,899
but to make you happy

900
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:27,287
he's done such an embarrassing thing.

901
01:01:28,979 --> 01:01:33,163
Huo Yan has told me about what's going on between you and him.

902
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,976
I know

903
01:01:36,355 --> 01:01:38,139
I don't live up to the expectations the Director has in his heart,

904
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:41,701
but

905
01:01:42,037 --> 01:01:44,078
I really want to thank you for allowing me to be with Huo Da.

906
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:50,515
Thank you for taking care of Huo Da

907
01:01:52,505 --> 01:01:53,482
as well as Yue Hua

908
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:54,520
and Huo Yan.

909
01:02:02,114 --> 01:02:03,202
Chairman,

910
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:05,427
it's something

911
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:07,548
that is totally unsuitable for your status and position,

912
01:02:08,237 --> 01:02:09,061
but

913
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:10,657
it will make Huo Da happy.

914
01:02:12,548 --> 01:02:13,803
Will you try it once?

915
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,592
I never thought that my dad

916
01:02:29,592 --> 01:02:31,153
would actually have some talent for making faces.

917
01:02:32,493 --> 01:02:33,576
Next time when you miss everyone

918
01:02:33,803 --> 01:02:35,513
and feel bored in the hospital,

919
01:02:35,513 --> 01:02:36,725
you can look at the photographs.

920
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:38,212
Then you won't be so lonely.

921
01:02:49,163 --> 01:02:50,090
Taiwan Ah Xin,

922
01:02:51,273 --> 01:02:52,163
thank you.

923
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:54,380
Do you know

924
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:55,852
how much I miss everyone

925
01:02:56,396 --> 01:02:57,415
while I'm in the hospital?

926
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:00,493
I miss the days

927
01:03:00,992 --> 01:03:02,218
when I could fool around with everyone.

928
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:44,676
How do you feel today?

929
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,574
It feels worse and worse everyday.

930
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,943
When I open my eyes in the morning

931
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:54,880
I rejoice...

932
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,446
because Heaven has let me live one more day.

933
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,696
Don't say such disheartening words.

934
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:09,350
Yan Shu,

935
01:04:10,489 --> 01:04:12,012
all along you're the most practical

936
01:04:12,869 --> 01:04:13,899
and the most calm.

937
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:19,185
Everyone who knows I'm sick says

938
01:04:20,864 --> 01:04:23,147
now that medicine is so advanced

939
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,645
and I'm so young,

940
01:04:26,746 --> 01:04:28,301
I'll definitely be able to make it.

941
01:04:31,086 --> 01:04:32,913
Everyone seems to have been hypnotised

942
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:35,444
saying the same words.

943
01:04:39,014 --> 01:04:40,043
Now it seems like

944
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,396
I'm the only one accepting reality.

945
01:04:46,993 --> 01:04:50,383
I could be dead tomorrow,

946
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:54,203
but no one wants to say it.

947
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,636
Jia Di has done so much

948
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:01,947
for me.

949
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:05,542
The more she does now

950
01:05:06,317 --> 01:05:07,852
shows

951
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,897
how much

952
01:05:10,897 --> 01:05:12,325
she is unable to face reality.

953
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:14,614
She has confidence in you.

954
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:20,229
This body is mine.

955
01:05:21,037 --> 01:05:22,243
I clearly understand.

956
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,507
Now all I think about

957
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,481
is how to

958
01:05:30,396 --> 01:05:32,040
lessen the sadness

959
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:33,961
after I leave.

960
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,744
Though at that time,

961
01:05:38,744 --> 01:05:40,922
I won't be able to see her anymore.

962
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:42,968
But

963
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,685
once I think about her impending pain,

964
01:05:45,685 --> 01:05:47,065
I already...

965
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:51,968
feel really heartbroken.

966
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:56,093
No matter what answer God gives you...

967
01:05:56,093 --> 01:05:57,374
I'll be fine.

968
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,176
Just obediently go for your treatment,

969
01:06:00,176 --> 01:06:01,440
what's the use of caring about other things?

970
01:06:02,815 --> 01:06:04,220
You don't have to worry about me at all.

971
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,301
Have you forgotten

972
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:07,921
that I am the undefeatable Tong Jia Di?

973
01:06:14,814 --> 01:06:15,758
I'll be going back now.

974
01:06:20,065 --> 01:06:20,858
I'll go after her.

975
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:22,185
Let her go.

976
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:30,986
She wants to cry.

977
01:06:33,921 --> 01:06:35,424
She needs to vent her emotions.

978
01:06:39,422 --> 01:06:40,892
In front of me

979
01:06:41,486 --> 01:06:42,889
she keeps acting strong.

980
01:06:44,907 --> 01:06:46,404
She's already under so much pressure.

981
01:06:49,148 --> 01:06:51,644
I don't want her to suppress herself,

982
01:06:53,266 --> 01:06:56,051
but to thoroughly and freely cry.

983
01:07:08,675 --> 01:07:09,704
Jia Di!

984
01:07:42,756 --> 01:07:44,862
Even though he walks towards life's end,

985
01:07:45,303 --> 01:07:46,952
to be able to have a love like this,

986
01:07:47,717 --> 01:07:49,279
I still envy Huo Da.

987
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:01,783
Did you go do

988
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:03,201
the test for the liver transplant?

989
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:07,685
You can't.

990
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:10,762
You know you aren't suitable for it.

991
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:15,078
The results aren't out yet.

992
01:08:15,749 --> 01:08:17,255
For all you know I have Hepatitis B.

993
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,128
You don't have to wait for the results.

994
01:08:20,156 --> 01:08:21,575
You have to promise me now

995
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:22,967
that you definitely will not do

996
01:08:22,967 --> 01:08:24,140
the liver transplant operation.

997
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:28,192
Other than dad,

998
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:30,403
I am the only one who is a family member.

999
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,457
So what?

1000
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:32,921
Your heart

1001
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:34,675
cannot take the stress of the transplant operation.

1002
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:36,816
Yan Shu,

1003
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,341
we all know

1004
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:40,484
that Huo Da doesn't have time to wait.

1005
01:09:01,687 --> 01:09:02,563
This

1006
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:04,568
seems to be Jia Di's old house.

1007
01:09:07,422 --> 01:09:08,719
We really have to be thieves?

1008
01:09:09,163 --> 01:09:10,048
The Devil asked us to.

1009
01:09:10,048 --> 01:09:11,422
It really wasn't anything good.

1010
01:09:12,059 --> 01:09:13,391
I'm very useless.

1011
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:15,565
If I remember correctly,

1012
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:16,546
Jia Di said,

1013
01:09:16,768 --> 01:09:17,324
at that time,

1014
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:18,268
she and her dad

1015
01:09:18,268 --> 01:09:20,155
hid it under the big tree in the garden.

1016
01:09:36,898 --> 01:09:37,978
There's a guard dog inside!

1017
01:09:37,978 --> 01:09:38,731
It's a dog...

1018
01:09:38,731 --> 01:09:40,150
There are thieves!

1019
01:09:40,366 --> 01:09:41,914
Don't bite me...

1020
01:09:41,914 --> 01:09:42,846
Help!

1021
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:49,423
Mr Huo,

1022
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:51,738
after doing the match test,

1023
01:09:52,147 --> 01:09:53,307
you are the only one suitable

1024
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:54,706
to do the liver transplant.

1025
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:56,426
However,

1026
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:58,782
I don't recommend that you do the operation.

1027
01:09:59,551 --> 01:10:00,962
I think you know very clearly

1028
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:02,658
that you have a history of heart problems,

1029
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,787
and unsuitable for organ donation operations.

1030
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:06,615
Your body

1031
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:09,221
must be able to handle the extraction of your liver.

1032
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:10,437
The risk is too great.

1033
01:10:11,228 --> 01:10:13,266
When your whole body is put under anaesthesia

1034
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:14,898
during the operation,

1035
01:10:14,898 --> 01:10:16,301
once your heart stops

1036
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,203
or other side effects happen,

1037
01:10:18,644 --> 01:10:19,863
your life will be in danger.

1038
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:24,225
I am willing to sign that I have understood

1039
01:10:24,225 --> 01:10:26,223
and will bear all medical risks,

1040
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:28,047
as well as all the legal responsibilties.

1041
01:10:28,483 --> 01:10:29,737
As long as I can save him.

1042
01:10:32,578 --> 01:10:33,515
Doctor,

1043
01:10:33,515 --> 01:10:35,077
can we have the operation as soon as possible?

1044
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:36,502
Mr. Huo,

1045
01:10:36,502 --> 01:10:38,062
I request you wait another 3 days.

1046
01:10:38,346 --> 01:10:39,719
If during that time

1047
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,921
another donor appears,

1048
01:10:41,921 --> 01:10:43,658
then you don't have to risk your life.

1049
01:10:44,483 --> 01:10:45,640
After all, this is an operation

1050
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,953
that the hospital should not be undertaking.

1051
01:10:53,752 --> 01:10:54,642
Dad,

1052
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:56,770
I have already persuaded the doctor

1053
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,626
to let me help Huo Da

1054
01:10:58,626 --> 01:10:59,819
and go for the liver transplant.

1055
01:11:02,457 --> 01:11:03,755
This operation

1056
01:11:06,565 --> 01:11:08,923
is as good as you risking your life.

1057
01:11:12,749 --> 01:11:14,295
If the operation is not successful,

1058
01:11:15,733 --> 01:11:17,504
please don't blame the operating team.

1059
01:11:18,224 --> 01:11:19,578
They have already tried their best.

1060
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:23,655
I asked them to use my liver,

1061
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,945
but they said that I was too old

1062
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:27,312
and contracted Hepatitis before.

1063
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:29,472
I couldn't be the donor.

1064
01:11:31,046 --> 01:11:32,018
I know.

1065
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,249
The both of us want to save Huo Da,

1066
01:11:34,785 --> 01:11:36,205
but if the operation isn't done soon

1067
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:37,767
there won't be enough time.

1068
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:41,583
I can't let you go.

1069
01:11:45,498 --> 01:11:46,795
But I...

1070
01:11:48,217 --> 01:11:50,140
I can't let you not go.

1071
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,985
I will do my best

1072
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:58,408
to force myself to live on.

1073
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:00,889
But if it really is not successful,

1074
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,626
I have something

1075
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:06,771
I should say to you first.

1076
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:08,499
Dad,

1077
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:10,796
thank you for taking care of me.

1078
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,879
God,

1079
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,829
it's my fault.

1080
01:12:38,657 --> 01:12:40,721
I let their mothers down.

1081
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,065
If there was retribution,

1082
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:44,162
it should be put on me.

1083
01:12:46,016 --> 01:12:46,766
Why

1084
01:12:47,468 --> 01:12:50,594
do you have to let both my sons suffer?

1085
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,161
Does this mean that

1086
01:12:56,911 --> 01:12:58,202
I have to use one son

1087
01:12:58,202 --> 01:13:00,295
in exchange for the other?

1088
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,379
Devil,

1089
01:13:29,379 --> 01:13:30,938
what do you want the box for?

1090
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:42,569
Because Taiwan Ah Xin told me

1091
01:13:44,043 --> 01:13:45,881
this was the agreement between her father and her.

1092
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:49,047
This box of secrets

1093
01:13:49,586 --> 01:13:50,637
was supposed to be

1094
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:53,762
for her future boyfriend.

1095
01:13:55,069 --> 01:13:56,132
I'll tell you something,

1096
01:13:56,427 --> 01:13:58,024
I have an old box at home.

1097
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,294
It contains all my secrets.

1098
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,592
What secrets?

1099
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:05,054
I can't say!

1100
01:14:06,201 --> 01:14:07,257
My dad said,

1101
01:14:07,257 --> 01:14:09,787
only when I meet someone I like

1102
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:12,380
can I open the box to let him know.

1103
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:18,055
I'm afraid that, in the future,

1104
01:14:18,055 --> 01:14:19,274
I wouldn't have a chance to see it.

1105
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:21,230
So...

1106
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:24,681
I had to ask you to become thieves.

1107
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,365
Sorry.

1108
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:27,461
Don't talk rubbish!

1109
01:14:33,085 --> 01:14:34,942
I don't want to give this privilege

1110
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:36,224
to anyone else.

1111
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,005
Thank you

1112
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:42,821
for fulfilling my wish.

1113
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,292
Thank you.

1114
01:15:02,771 --> 01:15:03,816
Uncle Tong,

1115
01:15:04,723 --> 01:15:06,289
I am Jia Di's boyfriend.

1116
01:15:07,363 --> 01:15:08,412
But...

1117
01:15:09,177 --> 01:15:10,785
I'm afraid that I won't be able

1118
01:15:10,989 --> 01:15:12,538
to give Jia Di happiness.

1119
01:15:13,684 --> 01:15:14,978
I'm unable to replace you

1120
01:15:15,573 --> 01:15:17,069
by continuing to cherish and love her.

1121
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:20,006
Thank you

1122
01:15:20,006 --> 01:15:22,085
for leaving behind these precious memories.

1123
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,664
Allowing me to love

1124
01:15:24,664 --> 01:15:26,380
the Jia Di in the past,

1125
01:15:27,133 --> 01:15:30,000
which I was unable to be a part of.

1126
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:34,739
The future Jia Di

1127
01:15:35,084 --> 01:15:36,371
is still the same.

1128
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:37,413
Really kind,

1129
01:15:37,676 --> 01:15:38,883
very strong.

1130
01:15:39,582 --> 01:15:40,849
Even her faces

1131
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:43,493
are still the same as when she was little.

1132
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:44,817
Really cute.

1133
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:47,240
Uncle Tong,

1134
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:48,746
do you also want to see

1135
01:15:48,746 --> 01:15:51,691
Jia Di in a wedding gown?

1136
01:15:52,825 --> 01:15:54,847
Jia Di, as a mom?

1137
01:15:56,456 --> 01:15:57,464
Those moments...

1138
01:15:57,834 --> 01:16:00,208
for all I know, I'll be seeing them

1139
01:16:01,035 --> 01:16:02,879
in Heaven with you.

1140
01:16:07,704 --> 01:16:08,735
Let's write down

1141
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:10,346
things that we want to exchange.

1142
01:16:12,891 --> 01:16:14,954
After 10 years, we'll meet here again

1143
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:16,393
and see each other's secret.

1144
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:29,757
This last blank exchange coupon.

1145
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:32,533
What I want to exchange is

1146
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:35,970
to meet you in our next lives.

1147
01:16:39,273 --> 01:16:40,955
If there really is a next life...

1148
01:16:41,987 --> 01:16:43,190
Jia Di,

1149
01:16:44,078 --> 01:16:46,037
you can only exchange it with me.

1150
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:51,018
~Don't get stolen from me~

1151
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:05,048
~Be with me forever~

1152
01:17:24,277 --> 01:17:25,401
Jia Di,

1153
01:17:26,259 --> 01:17:27,417
no matter what answer

1154
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:29,244
God gives...

1155
01:17:30,433 --> 01:17:32,512
I will still be really thankful

1156
01:17:34,123 --> 01:17:36,246
that in my wasteful life,

1157
01:17:37,346 --> 01:17:38,555
he let me meet you.

1158
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,569
I won't be scared.

1159
01:17:43,128 --> 01:17:43,628
If...

1160
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,490
you leave me first,

1161
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:47,340
I will remember

1162
01:17:47,677 --> 01:17:50,037
the stars represent you saying "I love you".

1163
01:17:50,316 --> 01:17:52,559
The light breeze is your yearning.

1164
01:17:53,388 --> 01:17:55,837
The warmth on my skin from the sun

1165
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:57,085
is that...

1166
01:17:57,085 --> 01:17:59,753
you opened your arms to embrace me.

1167
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:23,659
Mr. Huo Da,

1168
01:18:23,659 --> 01:18:24,941
we have already arranged

1169
01:18:24,941 --> 01:18:26,471
for you to do the organ transplant.

1170
01:18:27,487 --> 01:18:28,705
Really?

1171
01:18:32,737 --> 01:18:33,776
Really?

1172
01:18:34,705 --> 01:18:35,971
I finally got one after waiting?

1173
01:18:37,034 --> 01:18:38,067
Who is it?

1174
01:18:38,284 --> 01:18:39,268
It's your brother.

1175
01:18:55,556 --> 01:18:56,475
Mr. Huo Da,

1176
01:18:56,711 --> 01:18:57,830
we have already arranged

1177
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,553
for you to do the organ transplant.

1178
01:19:00,228 --> 01:19:01,722
Really?

1179
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:06,458
Really?

1180
01:19:07,455 --> 01:19:08,705
I finally got one after waiting?

1181
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:10,665
Who is it?

1182
01:19:11,161 --> 01:19:12,174
It's your brother.

1183
01:19:17,396 --> 01:19:18,347
Mr. Huo Yan

1184
01:19:18,347 --> 01:19:19,206
agreed today

1185
01:19:19,206 --> 01:19:20,865
to the liver transplant operation.

1186
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:23,393
I refuse.

1187
01:19:52,342 --> 01:19:53,607
I know you hate me,

1188
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,809
but no matter what reason do you have...

1189
01:19:55,809 --> 01:19:57,039
you have to listen to me this time.

1190
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:58,414
I DON'T WANT TO!

1191
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:00,188
You don't have time to wait anymore.

1192
01:20:00,188 --> 01:20:01,202
Stop talking nonsense!

1193
01:20:01,949 --> 01:20:02,948
I don't need you to make

1194
01:20:02,948 --> 01:20:03,993
such a huge sacrifice for me.

1195
01:20:03,993 --> 01:20:05,342
You want me to watch you die

1196
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:06,514
as a bystander, doing nothing?

1197
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:07,845
If it was you, would you be able to do it?

1198
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:08,575
For me,

1199
01:20:08,575 --> 01:20:09,900
you are doing this at the risk of your life.

1200
01:20:10,728 --> 01:20:11,870
If you die,

1201
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,460
because you wanted to save me?

1202
01:20:13,883 --> 01:20:15,133
Is it worth it?

1203
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:21,464
It's worth it.

1204
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:24,399
So what does that mean?

1205
01:20:26,777 --> 01:20:28,952
You want me to live the rest of my life

1206
01:20:28,952 --> 01:20:30,449
in guilt that I caused your death?

1207
01:20:31,073 --> 01:20:32,774
Using your life in exchange for mine,

1208
01:20:33,277 --> 01:20:34,509
then I'd rather die!

1209
01:20:37,695 --> 01:20:39,305
I am the only person on this earth

1210
01:20:39,305 --> 01:20:40,633
with the power

1211
01:20:40,984 --> 01:20:42,625
and the capability to give you a liver.

1212
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:44,492
This also proves one point

1213
01:20:45,745 --> 01:20:46,931
that on this earth,

1214
01:20:47,293 --> 01:20:49,011
I am your brother.

1215
01:20:58,159 --> 01:20:59,588
We are family

1216
01:21:00,587 --> 01:21:02,369
joined by the blood running through our veins.

1217
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:03,945
This sort of blood relation

1218
01:21:03,945 --> 01:21:05,899
is something no one can replace.

1219
01:21:06,447 --> 01:21:07,858
You can't deny that.

1220
01:21:09,478 --> 01:21:10,716
You are my brother.

1221
01:21:11,336 --> 01:21:12,789
I want to save you.

1222
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,994
Even if I have to give up everything, I will still do it.

1223
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,297
I'm actually not

1224
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,011
afraid of owing my life to you.

1225
01:21:35,163 --> 01:21:36,623
If it's between the both of us

1226
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:39,060
and only one can live,

1227
01:21:44,758 --> 01:21:45,980
I hope it's you.

1228
01:21:57,117 --> 01:21:58,499
Even though

1229
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:00,681
I really don't want to admit it,

1230
01:22:03,945 --> 01:22:05,352
I really

1231
01:22:06,525 --> 01:22:07,916
admire you a lot.

1232
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,071
So you should believe

1233
01:22:12,071 --> 01:22:13,546
that my decision is right even more now.

1234
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:16,137
No way.

1235
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,853
I must do this.

1236
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:20,715
I have to do this.

1237
01:22:23,017 --> 01:22:24,143
So...

1238
01:22:26,116 --> 01:22:27,789
Leave the outcome to fate.

1239
01:22:29,975 --> 01:22:31,253
Just promise me,

1240
01:22:31,921 --> 01:22:33,630
if only one can live between us,

1241
01:22:34,424 --> 01:22:35,532
the one who survives

1242
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:38,493
must live for the both of us.

1243
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:40,680
And together

1244
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,145
live a full life.

1245
01:22:54,423 --> 01:22:56,094
Brother...

1246
01:23:24,565 --> 01:23:26,158
The operation is tomorrow.

1247
01:23:26,991 --> 01:23:28,927
Don't get snatched away from me.

1248
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:32,031
You must get better.

1249
01:23:54,042 --> 01:23:55,529
Unless I get possessed by a pig,

1250
01:23:55,968 --> 01:23:57,223
I will never,

1251
01:23:57,223 --> 01:23:59,247
in my whole life, like a guy like you.

1252
01:24:02,418 --> 01:24:04,326
<I like you.>

1253
01:24:05,947 --> 01:24:07,853
<I like you.>

1254
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:11,561
<I like you.>

1255
01:24:22,542 --> 01:24:23,559
Huo Yan, you...

1256
01:24:23,774 --> 01:24:24,587
Don't worry.

1257
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,280
I've never done anything for my brother.

1258
01:24:29,652 --> 01:24:31,385
To be able to use a part of my body

1259
01:24:31,385 --> 01:24:32,711
to save his life,

1260
01:24:33,837 --> 01:24:34,726
it's worth it.

1261
01:24:36,339 --> 01:24:37,555
You must hang on.

1262
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:39,797
I'll pray for the safety of both of you.

1263
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,290
We will live on together.

1264
01:25:54,965 --> 01:25:56,927
Miss Yan Shu,

1265
01:25:56,927 --> 01:25:58,509
Huo Da will be fine.

1266
01:25:59,259 --> 01:26:01,968
That's why I'm more worried about Huo Yan.

1267
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:06,009
What do you mean, I don't understand.

1268
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,310
Huo Yan has had heart problems since he was young.

1269
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:14,011
You have to be under total anaesthesia.

1270
01:26:14,848 --> 01:26:17,483
If his heart stops during the operation,

1271
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:19,598
his life will be in danger.

1272
01:26:26,113 --> 01:26:27,769
Doctor Chen.

1273
01:27:15,326 --> 01:27:16,749
There are some pacts

1274
01:27:16,749 --> 01:27:19,452
that seem as though they have been burned into life with gold.

1275
01:27:19,815 --> 01:27:22,252
They make one perservere for the rest of their lives.

1276
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:25,328
My pact with the Devil was for 10 years.

1277
01:27:25,919 --> 01:27:26,826
But...

1278
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:28,937
Maybe I was influenced too deeply by him.

1279
01:27:29,672 --> 01:27:30,575
In my mind,

1280
01:27:30,575 --> 01:27:32,794
the thought of breaking that pact kept appearing.

1281
01:27:33,484 --> 01:27:34,939
Even though the time is not right,

1282
01:27:35,379 --> 01:27:36,985
but I really want to know

1283
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:38,662
what was the secret was

1284
01:27:38,662 --> 01:27:39,690
that he left for me.

1285
01:28:08,779 --> 01:28:09,889
Taiwan Ah Xin,

1286
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:11,188
even if you haven't dated before,

1287
01:28:11,188 --> 01:28:12,662
you should have watched romance films.

1288
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:14,380
At this point, the female lead

1289
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,576
should already be running up

1290
01:28:15,576 --> 01:28:16,583
to hug the male lead.

1291
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,810
Life is a period where you use your own life

1292
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:43,381
to meet other's.

1293
01:28:44,587 --> 01:28:47,147
By meeting the Devil,

1294
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:49,210
my life was never the same again.

1295
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:51,949
It's impossible for me to only be in my circle,

1296
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:54,132
because in everyone's story,

1297
01:28:54,383 --> 01:28:56,521
there's also someone else's story.

1298
01:28:57,358 --> 01:28:59,648
Taiwan Ah Xin and Devil's story

1299
01:28:59,886 --> 01:29:02,228
is also Bo Zi and Xiao Nan's...

1300
01:29:04,069 --> 01:29:04,923
Stupid Bo Zi!

1301
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:05,708
What are you doing?

1302
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:06,501
Don't run away!

1303
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:07,725
Sorry!

1304
01:29:07,725 --> 01:29:09,116
Don't run away!

1305
01:29:09,406 --> 01:29:10,185
Stop there!

1306
01:29:10,185 --> 01:29:11,108
What are you doing?

1307
01:29:11,108 --> 01:29:12,046
Help!

1308
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:13,641
- Don't run away!
- Another beautiful circle.

1309
01:29:13,868 --> 01:29:15,319
Their lives' stories

1310
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:17,692
are each launching into a new journey.

1311
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:19,839
This place is your favourite

1312
01:29:19,839 --> 01:29:21,090
in all of Taipei.

1313
01:29:21,844 --> 01:29:23,105
I don't know when,

1314
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:25,126
but it also became mine.

1315
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,309
In the past,

1316
01:29:32,655 --> 01:29:35,662
the Huo Family as well as the Huo Department Store

1317
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,660
were like a prison made of gold

1318
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:41,207
in my eyes.

1319
01:29:41,801 --> 01:29:43,636
I only saw it locking me in

1320
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,415
and never saw its beauty.

1321
01:29:45,707 --> 01:29:46,882
It's you who reminded me

1322
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:50,677
it's your own knot that untied.

1323
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:55,097
People always like going after what they don't have.

1324
01:29:57,178 --> 01:29:59,099
Once I finish my studies,

1325
01:29:59,619 --> 01:30:01,382
I must really relax.

1326
01:30:03,005 --> 01:30:05,334
Once my business is up and running,

1327
01:30:05,724 --> 01:30:07,926
I must go out of the country for a holiday

1328
01:30:07,926 --> 01:30:10,476
to enjoy myself, and broaden my horizons.

1329
01:30:12,148 --> 01:30:14,373
Once I earn money,

1330
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:16,927
I must be fillial to my parents

1331
01:30:17,224 --> 01:30:18,691
and let them have many good days.

1332
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:22,550
Once I buy a house,

1333
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:25,835
I will stop my hurried pace

1334
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:27,692
and enjoy life.

1335
01:30:30,567 --> 01:30:32,115
And what I said was,

1336
01:30:32,787 --> 01:30:34,472
once I leave this family,

1337
01:30:34,785 --> 01:30:36,442
I will find my true self.

1338
01:30:39,116 --> 01:30:40,570
That idea was really stupid.

1339
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:42,942
In the past, I thought

1340
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:44,865
the one who was wasting life was Huo Da,

1341
01:30:45,551 --> 01:30:46,877
but actually it was me.

1342
01:30:49,851 --> 01:30:52,432
Good thing you came out of the operation unscathed.

1343
01:30:55,478 --> 01:30:57,444
Now we don't have to wait until

1344
01:30:57,689 --> 01:30:59,117
our lives are perfect

1345
01:30:59,117 --> 01:31:01,428
to know how to enjoy the best things in it.

1346
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:04,307
Because it's not in the distance,

1347
01:31:05,533 --> 01:31:06,770
but in what you already have

1348
01:31:07,149 --> 01:31:08,632
and how you cherish it.

1349
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:13,689
Then I'll be leaving now.

1350
01:31:18,096 --> 01:31:19,820
The beautiful and strong Yan Shu,

1351
01:31:20,426 --> 01:31:22,162
you'll definitely be able to find

1352
01:31:22,162 --> 01:31:24,394
the happiness you deserve to cherish and possess.

1353
01:31:24,942 --> 01:31:26,821
This time it is really goodbye.

1354
01:31:27,126 --> 01:31:28,133
Huo Yan,

1355
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:30,581
everything I once gave to you

1356
01:31:30,581 --> 01:31:33,409
are the happiest times in my life.

1357
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,223
Mom,

1358
01:31:36,441 --> 01:31:37,612
why didn't you call me to tell me when you were going to set up?

1359
01:31:37,612 --> 01:31:38,383
There's no need.

1360
01:31:38,383 --> 01:31:39,674
Didn't I say that I was on leave today?

1361
01:31:39,979 --> 01:31:41,128
I'll do it...

1362
01:31:42,007 --> 01:31:43,815
You don't have to wait until life is perfect

1363
01:31:44,069 --> 01:31:46,301
to enjoy the sweet things in life.

1364
01:31:46,939 --> 01:31:48,549
If your closest family is able

1365
01:31:48,549 --> 01:31:49,829
to be united,

1366
01:31:49,829 --> 01:31:51,050
support each other,

1367
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,430
and face difficulties together,

1368
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:54,331
that is the warmest moment.

1369
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:18,456
Didn't we say that only after 10 years

1370
01:32:18,456 --> 01:32:19,563
would we open the box?

1371
01:32:20,469 --> 01:32:21,674
I didn't mean to sneak a peek!

1372
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,724
What did you write inside?

1373
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:34,752
Why are you still standing there?

1374
01:32:34,752 --> 01:32:35,893
Chase after it, it's my secret!

1375
01:32:36,476 --> 01:32:37,235
Secret!

1376
01:32:37,235 --> 01:32:37,970
Come back!

1377
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,051
Secret!

1378
01:32:40,887 --> 01:32:42,634
Jump a bit higher, I can't reach it!

1379
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:43,544
Secret!

1380
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:45,121
It's there!

1381
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:46,433
Here!

1382
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:47,635
It's here!

1383
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:50,480
My secret!

1384
01:32:54,397 --> 01:32:58,844
<i>Spring is aproaching us slowly.</i>

1385
01:32:59,623 --> 01:33:04,129
<i>I start to imagine the feeling of happiness.</i>

1386
01:33:05,229 --> 01:33:09,822
<i>In the field in front of the merry go round.</i>

1387
01:33:10,574 --> 01:33:14,442
<i>Love starts to blossom.</i>

1388
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:19,640
<i>Thinking of you, I become breathless.</i>

1389
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:24,974
<i>My lips curl into a smile unknowingly.</i>

1390
01:33:26,177 --> 01:33:31,022
<i>Are these the symptoms of blissfulness?</i>

1391
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:36,004
<i>I become breathless, again.</i>

1392
01:33:37,484 --> 01:33:39,837
<i>Dreams that cannot be moved.</i>

1393
01:33:40,225 --> 01:33:46,922
<i>Even if there is no applause, I won't be hurt.</i>

1394
01:33:48,064 --> 01:33:50,684
<i>I won't let go of my belief.</i>

1395
01:33:51,026 --> 01:33:58,247
<i>My heart pumps furiously when I'm next to you.</i>

1396
01:33:58,704 --> 01:34:02,992
<i>Thinking of you, I become breathless.</i>

1397
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:08,207
<i>My lips curl into a smile unknowingly.</i>

1398
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:14,428
<i>Are these the symptoms of blissfulness?</i>

1399
01:34:14,853 --> 01:34:19,418
<i>My heart starts to pound.</i>

1400
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:25,529
<i>I become breathless, again.</i>

1401
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:31,778
<i>Thanks for watching the show!</i>
