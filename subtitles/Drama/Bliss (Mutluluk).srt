1
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:57,892
My friend N. J.
Once told me there are

2
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:00,561
seven defining
moments in a person's life. 

3
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,216
The challenge is figuring out
which ones they are. 

4
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:15,943
You know, I know you. 

5
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,114
I feel like I know you too. 

6
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:26,453
We're... connected
or something. 

7
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:31,041
Well, I know I know you, but... 

8
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,962
... But not from today. 

9
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:41,152
Mmm... not from now
and all this. 

10
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:42,469
Before today?

11
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,456
Five times. 

12
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,707
Um... 

13
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,311
You married?

14
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,581
No, that's my mother. 

15
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,933
Oh. 

16
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:58,336
Why is the picture so old?

17
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:02,306
She died when I was a... kid. 

18
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,692
People do that, I guess.
Dying, I mean. 

19
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:06,527
My grandmother did. 

20
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,513
Made the post, actually,
the way she died. 

21
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:11,164
She accidentally hung herself
opening her front door. 

22
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:15,153
Wow, I remember that.
That... was your grandmother?

23
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,854
So she... ? 

24
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:19,524
Yeah, she wore her keys on a
shoestring around her neck. 

25
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:20,992
Wow!

26
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:23,077
Did you read all of these?

27
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,947
Is your last name, like, Barnes & Noble
or something?

28
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:29,083
Wait... five times. What do you
mean... we've met five times?

29
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,418
Five times. 

30
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,087
Oh, I know this guy!

31
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,555
We studied him in school. 

32
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:37,708
He's from, like, Britain
or England or somewhere. 

33
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,210
You study Ruskin in school?

34
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,761
Yes. 

35
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,297
We study a lot of
different stuff, so... 

36
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,133
Why not this guy, right?
I mean, he's famous. 

37
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:48,302
He... liked little girls. 

38
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:49,570
I mean really little girls. 

39
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,722
That's what my teacher
said, younger than me. 

40
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:54,025
He stopped loving them
when they started to grow. 

41
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,510
He died a virgin. 

42
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,282
Well, I didn't say
that he loved them

43
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,100
the same way
that you just did me. 

44
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,105
You know... 

45
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:10,107
Some girls in my class shave. 

46
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,742
Do you think that
I should shave?

47
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:22,687
What? You don't want me now?

48
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,339
It's just...
It's time for you to go. 

49
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:28,075
Go? I don't have to go.
It's only four!

50
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,479
Ohh! What's with the map?

51
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,331
It's nearly six. 

52
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,799
What were the five times?

53
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,268
Whoops. 

54
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,570
Stefani, you have to go. 

55
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,276
What are the pins for?

56
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:48,479
They're all places I've gone. 

57
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:49,946
Really?

58
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:53,317
You've been
to all those places?

59
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,768
No, not yet. 

60
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,604
They're places I plan to go. 

61
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,724
Oh. 

62
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:03,627
Spain. Why Spain?

63
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:04,929
Homage to Catalonia. 

64
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,467
Cata-who?

65
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,018
Catalonia. 

66
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,936
It's, uh, George Orwell. 

67
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:19,543
And here?

68
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,864
Prince Edward Island.
Anne of Green Gables. 

69
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,174
Sheltering Sky, Paul Bowles. 

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,133
You've really gotta go. 

71
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,471
How 'bout you buy me cigarettes

72
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,174
because I don't have any money. 

73
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:51,642
No. 

74
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:52,977
No cigarettes. 

75
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,780
Hey. 

76
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,782
Mmm. Really, you gotta go. 

77
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:00,184
Daddy's comin' home. 

78
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:01,903
Daddy?

79
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,154
Danny. 

80
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,940
My father's name is Danny,
he lives with me. 

81
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,375
Does he tuck you in at night?

82
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,076
Shake your pee-pee
when you're done tinkling?

83
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:12,512
You gotta go. 

84
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:16,867
I was just funning with you. 

85
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,286
It's what couples do, you know?

86
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,756
They fun with each other. 

87
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:37,654
It was outside that comic
book shop, Forbidden Planet. 

88
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,106
What was?

89
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,740
First time I saw you. 

90
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,978
When?

91
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,880
That one time
I was with my dad. 

92
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,283
Your dad?

93
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,818
Yep. You guys were, like,
best friends in high school. 

94
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,560
Best friends... me and your dad?

95
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:01,795
Stephen Jouseski. 

96
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,998
Stephen Jousesk?

97
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:09,837
Yeah. He yelled,
"hey, Twisted Bliss, "

98
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,722
and then you raced
into the store. 

99
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:16,227
Jetski? Your Jetski's daughter?

100
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,812
Well, his last name's Jouseski. 

101
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,864
It's mine too. Also my mom's. 

102
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,350
Buy me cigarettes. 

103
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:24,185
He's your dad?

104
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:25,252
Cigarettes. 

105
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,161
Jetski?

106
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,946
What's that for?

107
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:37,665
Cigarettes. 

108
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,333
Oh, I need you to
buy them for me. 

109
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:41,502
I thought you said you were 18. 

110
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,437
Well, I am, it's just
I don't have any I. D. , 

111
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,208
and those Deli guys are
assholes about carding. 

112
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:51,779
It's time to go. 

113
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,521
You know what I don't like?

114
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:01,588
Shoes, please. 

115
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,861
I don't like the fact
that you're so old. 

116
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,031
It's gonna be kind of hard
having a boyfriend

117
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,499
who's so much older than me. 

118
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,800
By the time I'm 21
and we can go to bars together, 

119
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:16,870
you'll be... I don't even know. 

120
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,906
But you'll still be
a lot older. 

121
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:20,791
Boyfriend?!

122
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,295
Is that daddy?

123
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,513
Danny. 

124
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:27,681
And, yeah, that's why
you need to go. 

125
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,570
What?

126
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:35,739
You afraid that daddy
won't be happy to see me?

127
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:40,642
Danny, and, yeah, I'm mean... . 

128
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:45,949
No. I don't think right now is
the best time to introduce you. 

129
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,021
- He's older.
- Oh, older. Older than you?

130
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:53,023
Ooh. He's one of those
200-year-old guys

131
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:56,827
you've got to carry around and
bathe and feed and stuff?

132
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,796
Does he wear one of
those giant diapers?

133
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,498
Stephanie, really,
you've got to go. 

134
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,386
Wait! Are you coming with me?

135
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:08,889
Yeah? It's me. Let me in. 

136
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,725
Listen, go to the Bodega around the
corner right here on First Avenue. 

137
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,627
Mr. Charlie's
is the name of the place, 

138
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,629
is the name of the guy
behind the counter, 

139
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,297
and tell him
Mr. Charlie sent you, 

140
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:19,299
and he'll sell you cigarettes. 

141
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:21,101
Wait. You want me
to tell Mr. Charlie

142
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,770
that Mr. Charlie sent me?

143
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,722
Charlie's, with an "s. "

144
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:26,189
Time to go. 

145
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,759
Wait. No. 

146
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,360
When am I gonna see you again?

147
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,196
Because this weekend
is awful for me. 

148
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,364
Um... 

149
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,317
I don't know, maybe Monday?

150
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,919
Stromboli pizza, after school?

151
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:41,205
Okay. Don't play with me. 

152
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,774
And call me?

153
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:46,193
- Call me often.
- Okay. I will. 

154
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:49,213
Tell me you love me. 

155
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,681
Stephanie, come on. 

156
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:52,449
Tell me. 

157
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:54,484
Okay. I love you. 

158
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:59,039
And you're sorry for...
being so crabby. 

159
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,642
I'm sorry I was crabby. 

160
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,427
Now, give me a kiss. 

161
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,612
A real one. 

162
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:07,448
Mmmm. 

163
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,782
'Kay. 

164
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,250
Better. 

165
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:12,919
Ahh... oh! And I
left you a present!

166
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:14,388
A-a surprise. 

167
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,956
Surprise? What is it?

168
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,341
Oh, can I keep the change?

169
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:19,343
Change? Yeah, sure. Keep it. 

170
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:22,646
- What... what's the surprise?
- Monday, stromboli pizza. Don't forget. 

171
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:28,635
Surprise?

172
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,604
Hey, daddy, how was your day?

173
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,606
What the hell have you
been doing in here?

174
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:08,792
I buzzed and I buzzed you. 

175
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,461
I was in the bathroom. 

176
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:22,756
Now, what I'm smelling here... 

177
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:24,924
I mean, you had
all day to do that, 

178
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:27,761
and you wait till
I'm coming home. 

179
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:31,098
Well, if you hadn't
lost your keys. Again. 

180
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,984
Besides, I had that interview. 

181
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:37,821
Yeah, so... When do you start?

182
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,940
We're still working out
the details. 

183
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,742
Soon, though, I hope. 

184
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,861
Good. 'Cause I can't keep
giving you an allowance. 

185
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:50,450
Did you take care of
those things

186
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:52,453
that I asked you
to take care of?

187
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,154
Some. 

188
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,508
Did you get the groceries?

189
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,710
Well, no. 

190
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,296
Mail the letters?

191
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:03,681
Not yet. 

192
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:06,783
Well, please tell me that you
got the keys made for me. 

193
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,769
At least tell me you did that. 

194
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,854
It's on my to-do list. 

195
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,723
What the hell have you
been doing all day, 

196
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:14,791
aside from stinking
the place up?

197
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:16,293
I had the interview,
daddy, I told you. 

198
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,220
Mmm. 

199
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,059
Well?

200
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,895
Right. Let me go
take care of that stuff. 

201
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,354
What are you waiting for?

202
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:03,240
Well, the thing is, I kind of
spent the money you gave me. 

203
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,442
"Kind of spent it"?

204
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:06,910
I spent it. 

205
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,529
On what?

206
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,031
Well, I had the job interview, 

207
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,117
and I spent it. 

208
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,318
Hmm. 

209
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,932
And the groceries?

210
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,781
Okay, then. Uh, thanks daddy. 

211
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,700
Should have seen
what I just saw. 

212
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,236
Yeah? What's this?

213
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:51,905
- Clear shot.
- Clear shot?

214
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,423
Standing at the top
of the stairs, 

215
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:56,076
all sexy and smart-ass-ish. 

216
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:57,243
Hm-hm. 

217
00:13:57,245 --> 00:14:00,914
Had a clear shot
of her womanhoodliness. 

218
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,249
No panties. 

219
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:05,285
She called me daddy. 

220
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,422
"Hello, daddy. "

221
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:09,840
Wow. 

222
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,508
Wow is right. 

223
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,977
Got a good smell of her
as she passed by. 

224
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,295
Wow. 

225
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:20,267
I'm gonna go take care of
those keys before they close. 

226
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,534
Yeah, do that. 

227
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,106
Ah, Mr. Charlie's!

228
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:29,109
- Hello! Hello!
- Hey! Has a woman... ? 

229
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,444
No!

230
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:33,012
- I haven't even asked you...
- Ah, yes, I know. 

231
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,450
- Well, did she... ?
- No!

232
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:41,255
- When did she... ?
- No, Mr. Charlie's. The girl. No problem. 

233
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:44,424
I tell her come any time,
all the time. 

234
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:49,195
A friend of Mr. Charlie's
is a friend of Mr. Charlie's. 

235
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:51,815
She's your daughter, yes?

236
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:53,817
Daughter? She's a... 

237
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,552
No, she's not my daughter. 

238
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:58,672
Ohh. Understand. 

239
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:00,941
Understand!

240
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,359
I'm sure you do. 

241
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,394
Uh... never mind. 

242
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:05,729
Mr. Charlie's no shop?

243
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:07,948
Uh, no, not right now. Later. 

244
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,165
Ah, yes, later, Mr. Charlie's. 

245
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,983
That'll be $5. 75, Morris. 

246
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,978
Right. 

247
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,413
Thanks.
I can never find my key. 

248
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,327
Right. Trouble getting it in?

249
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,162
What?

250
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,665
Happens a lot. Sometimes
just doesn't want to go in. 

251
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,602
Oh, uh, no. It's new. 

252
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:27,254
I usually don't have trouble. 

253
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,005
Right. Well, maybe some lube. 

254
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,474
- Excuse me?
- The lock. 

255
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:34,911
Right. 

256
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,746
Hey, is that a good magazine?

257
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:39,049
Well, the makeup tips and
sex advice are all wrong, 

258
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,517
but the hairstyles and how-to-lose-weight
articles are pretty good. 

259
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,353
"Bananas cure everything

260
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,821
from PMS to menopause. "

261
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:46,656
I didn't know that.
Did you know that?

262
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:48,325
No, I didn't. I was
actually talking about

263
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,793
the travel magazine, though. 

264
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,963
Oh. Oh, right. 

265
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,464
It's my husband's, George's. 

266
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:56,466
He never reads it. 

267
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,301
Oh, here, have it. 

268
00:17:58,303 --> 00:17:59,802
I don't even know
why we get it. 

269
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,804
You travel much?

270
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,974
Uh, yeah, I travel. A lot. 

271
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:06,476
Or... I plan to travel. 

272
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:08,144
I haven't been anywhere
yet. Soon, though. 

273
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:10,947
Right. What are you doing
Sunday at five P. M. ? 

274
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,933
Nothing... I can think of. 

275
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:14,401
Great. Um... 

276
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,336
Uh, let me ask you,
do you, uh... 

277
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:18,738
Do you eat that...
what's that stuff called?

278
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,407
- What stuff?
- That Mexican stuff. 

279
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,743
- Tacos?
- No, no. Tomatoes and onions. 

280
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:25,745
- Comes in a bottle. It's all chopped up.
- Salsa. 

281
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:27,480
Yeah, right. Salsa.
You eat salsa?

282
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,916
Not often...
But, yeah, I eat it. 

283
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:31,384
Oh. Well, great. 

284
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:34,271
You want to make 125 bucks?

285
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:35,905
Mmm... what do I have to do?

286
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,774
Nothing!

287
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,242
Oh, well, next to nothing. 

288
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,944
I need you for a focus
group for a new salsa. 

289
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,947
You just have to look at some
print ads and make some comments. 

290
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:47,016
Sure, yeah, I could do that. 

291
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:48,485
Right, right. 

292
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,320
Um... 

293
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:51,621
Troy, right?

294
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:54,991
Morris. 

295
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:57,277
Uh, Morris Bliss. 

296
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,945
Bliss. 

297
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,280
Right. 

298
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,072
... With wings and feathers, 

299
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:13,643
birds can travel almost
anywhere they want. 

300
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:16,562
What drives them to migrate?

301
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,732
Survival. 

302
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:21,902
What guides their path?

303
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:24,571
Instinct. 

304
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:28,675
Without their instincts,
they would be lost, 

305
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:30,926
blown off course, 

306
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,912
but, fortunately, 

307
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:36,265
their instincts
are strong and... 

308
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:11,110
Mmmm. 

309
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,543
Yep?

310
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:28,795
We need to talk. 

311
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:30,263
Stephanie?

312
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:31,698
I'm outside. 

313
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:40,540
Geez. What, do you
sleep in your clothes?

314
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,359
Yep. I do. 

315
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,315
What's up?

316
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:50,483
Don't worry, I'm not pregnant. 

317
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,273
I realize things. 

318
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,775
Now that I'm 18,
I realize things. 

319
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:02,279
I realize that...
I like you a lot. 

320
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:06,283
I really like this Morris and
Stephanie thing that we have, 

321
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:12,121
but I realize that this,
our you-and-me, 

322
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,424
is not gonna work out. 

323
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:16,626
I have plans, you know?

324
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,879
You just aren't part of 'em. 

325
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,131
I'm not a part of your plans?

326
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,885
Nope. 

327
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,053
What kind of plans
are you talking about?

328
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,757
Owning my own Subway
sandwich shop, for one. 

329
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,458
Be... be serious. 

330
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,943
I am being serious. 

331
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:35,745
This boy in my class,
Flabby Robbie, 

332
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:38,448
his dad owns a Subway
on 23rd and 7th Avenue, 

333
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,949
and it makes a ton of money. 

334
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:43,019
He actually gets them delivered
to school for lunch. 

335
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:45,622
That's how he makes
friends... free sandwiches. 

336
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,174
That's the only reason, actually,
why people like Robbie. 

337
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:50,193
He's kind of sickening.
His hands are always sticky

338
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:52,162
like he just sneezed
in them, or worse. 

339
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,329
Oh, Christ!

340
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,098
What? A rat!

341
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,200
Is that a rat? Oh, my God!
I think that's a rat!

342
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:59,703
- Where?
- Kill it, kill it, kill it!

343
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,504
Stephanie, get off me!

344
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,840
Oh, my God!

345
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,542
It ran down that way.
I saw it run. 

346
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:07,811
Oh, God. 

347
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:09,278
I hate rats. 

348
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,081
Worse than horny cousins,
you know... 

349
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,449
- The way you've got to fight 'em off.
- Right. 

350
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:16,102
We had this rat once in
our apartment building. 

351
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,903
Used to hang out
in front of the door. 

352
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:20,873
Used to look through the peephole
to make sure I wasn't watching. 

353
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,860
It was like he smelled the frozen
pizzas that my dad was cooking up. 

354
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,729
The super wouldn't do
anything about it, 

355
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:29,482
so my dad, he had to put
out those sticky traps, 

356
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:31,801
and then the other ones,
you know, 

357
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:33,302
the kinds that snap. 

358
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:36,239
But rats are smart. This one was
smart, because nothing worked. 

359
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:39,208
So, one day, the rat
is scratching at the door. 

360
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,110
My dad got so angry
that he grabbed a mop

361
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:42,845
and he went and he
killed it himself. 

362
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,914
He killed it with a mop?

363
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,866
Well, he tried to. 

364
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:49,302
He was naked
except for his underwear, 

365
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:53,156
and the rat was sitting there with
this "what do you want?" Look. 

366
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:55,091
My dad went and hit it
with the mop, 

367
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,643
but it was one of
those sponge mops, 

368
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,661
so it didn't really
hurt the rat that much, 

369
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:01,330
and the rat went
running down the hallway. 

370
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:03,933
My dad chased after it,
and he... 

371
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:08,337
Gave it a good wallop,
you know, real hard. 

372
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,107
I guess the rat got
hooked on to the mop. 

373
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:14,511
The tail or something got
wrapped around the handle, 

374
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:17,113
and so, as my dad
yanked at the mop, 

375
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:22,418
the rat went flying up in the air,
doing flips and twists and... 

376
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,789
I guess, for a split second, 

377
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,723
for a tiny split second, 

378
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:30,442
that rat came
face level with my dad. 

379
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,465
Came up right here.
Looked him dead in the eye. 

380
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:38,467
My dad says he's never
seen so much evil

381
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:41,271
as he saw in that rat's eyes. 

382
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:44,106
And then the rat, like,
fell down the bannister

383
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:48,194
and was hitting his head,
bang-bang-bang. 

384
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:52,247
When my dad went to go
look, the rat was gone. 

385
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,604
Wow. 

386
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:05,127
I probably don't mean
that much to you, do I?

387
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,797
Just... another girlfriend, 

388
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,766
one of probably three
zillion that you've had. 

389
00:25:10,768 --> 00:25:13,903
Three zillion's
on the high end. 

390
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,905
So... 

391
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:18,974
What other plans do you have?

392
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,810
Oh, I have lots of plans. 

393
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,445
None that I fit in. 

394
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:23,763
No. 

395
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:28,367
It's just... You don't seem. 

396
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,136
I don't seem what?

397
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:32,138
You know, you just don't seem. 

398
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,606
What does that mean,
"I don't seem"?

399
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:35,642
Before I forget, 

400
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:37,510
I got you something, a gift. 

401
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:42,115
You got me Brie?

402
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,917
No, it's cheese. French, I think.
It's expensive stuff. 

403
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,520
Where'd you get it?
Mr. Charlie's. 

404
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:49,204
You bought this
at Mr. Charlie's?

405
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:52,041
Well, I didn't exactly buy it. 

406
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,460
You stole it?

407
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:54,677
Yeah. But it was because

408
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,679
he didn't give me change for
that 20 that you gave me. 

409
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,681
He kept saying, "problems,
problems, no change. "

410
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,467
Mr. Charlie's never has change. 

411
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:02,552
No change? Yeah, well,
I went in there, you know. 

412
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:04,386
I made up for it. I did
a little extra shopping. 

413
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:06,556
He knows who you are.
He knows I know you. 

414
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:08,558
So? He stole from me first. 

415
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,545
And besides, it's not like we're
gonna go back there again. 

416
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:16,182
Okay?

417
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:18,150
Okay what?

418
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:20,119
I don't know. Just okay. 

419
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:23,539
Give me a kiss. 

420
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,358
Sure, that fits
into your plans. 

421
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,193
I don't want
to ruin your plans. 

422
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,712
No, no, no. I'll make you fit. 

423
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,915
- Where you going?
- Guess what I'm thinking. 

424
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:52,018
What are you thinking?

425
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,521
I'm thinking... That... 

426
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:56,255
Maybe my plans have changed. 

427
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:59,091
I'm thinking that
maybe you're part of them. 

428
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:01,060
May 23rd. 

429
00:27:01,062 --> 00:27:02,695
What's may 23rd?

430
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:04,197
Prom. Monday, stromboli pizza. 

431
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,599
After school. Don't forget. 

432
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:12,588
Who's the girl, man?

433
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:17,209
Where you been all week?

434
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,447
What's with the bad tux?
You gettin' married?

435
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,585
No, man. And that's a blessing. 

436
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:26,936
A pure blessing. 

437
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,505
Buy me a beer?

438
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,259
I been riskin'
my life all week. 

439
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:34,310
One beer. 

440
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,948
Mama's, man. 

441
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,535
Saved my life. 

442
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,271
What the hell's a "Mama's"?

443
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:47,156
It's what saved me
from the Cindi. 

444
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:48,557
Saved you from the what?

445
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:53,062
Help yourself. 

446
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,301
It's all about economics, man. 

447
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,837
How people spend money. 

448
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,404
What they spend it on. 

449
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:05,341
It's all about the way people
spend other people's money. 

450
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:07,076
The way I'm always
buying you a beer

451
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:08,511
'cause you're always broke?

452
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,580
I'm not broke, man,
just frugal. 

453
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:14,083
You keepin' a tab?

454
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:16,085
Like Medusa in a mirror, 

455
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:19,288
the economics of Mama's
broke the curse of the Cindi. 

456
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,607
I have no idea
what you're talking about. 

457
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:23,092
Mama's is a buffet
up in Harlem. 

458
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:24,927
The Cindi was my fiancée. 

459
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:26,428
Your fiancée?

460
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,064
Why do you think
I got the tux, man?

461
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,616
I was getting married today. 

462
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:31,183
You were getting married, and
you didn't even tell me?

463
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:32,685
It all happened so quick, man. 

464
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,153
You could have called. 

465
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:36,789
You could have said, "Morris,
I'm getting married. "

466
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,458
I've known the Cindi
since Sunday. 

467
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,959
I met her at church. 

468
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:41,961
Six days ago?

469
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,629
I like to think of it
as a week, man. 

470
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:45,131
A week can be a long time. 

471
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,933
Rome was ravaged in less. 

472
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:51,137
The seven days' war changed the
landscape of the middle east. 

473
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:52,605
Yeah. Lot of destruction. 

474
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,624
It was the six days' war that
happened in the middle east. 

475
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:56,025
God created the world
in a week. 

476
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,527
What's important...
it didn't happen. 

477
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,028
I was saved.
I didn't get married. 

478
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,898
We had a 4:00 appointment with
the judge today to get married. 

479
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,650
The hottest thing man. 

480
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:06,252
Cindi and I,
really into each other, 

481
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:09,588
like plaid on polyester,
morning, noon, night. 

482
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,058
Her place is in Harlem,
so we go to Mama's for lunch, 

483
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,526
a pre-wedding meal. 

484
00:29:13,528 --> 00:29:15,662
Mama's, best buffet
in the city, 

485
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,163
$4. 25 a pound buffet, 

486
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:19,048
except chitlins, which cost more.
Great stuff. 

487
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,751
So... at the buffet, 

488
00:29:21,753 --> 00:29:23,753
she loads up on rice and beans. 

489
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:25,254
Rice and beans, nothing else. 

490
00:29:25,256 --> 00:29:27,089
Not the ribs, not the greens,
not the pulled pork, nothing. 

491
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:28,891
Just the cheap,
heavy stuff, man. 

492
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,394
Her meal ended up
costing seven bucks, 

493
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,346
all for a plate
of rice and beans, 

494
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:36,432
and I'm the one paying for it. 

495
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:38,768
'Bout to get married
in less than three hours, 

496
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,438
and suddenly I saw it all. 

497
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,275
Saw the true colors
of the Cindi. 

498
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:48,277
I broke it off then and there. 

499
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,246
I mean, how could I marry a
woman who has no problem

500
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,948
paying seven and change,
all for beans and rice?

501
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,603
Get two more?

502
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:59,605
So, uh... 

503
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:03,075
Who's the 15-year-old girl I saw you with?
Is she stalking you?

504
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:05,611
Eighteen. Stalking? No. 

505
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:06,795
Why?

506
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:09,015
'Cause this turning
into a gift or a threat. 

507
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,467
- Remember Jetski?
- Jetski?

508
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:12,935
Guy from high school. 

509
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,620
- Kid with the harelip. Spit when he talked.
- No, no, no. 

510
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:16,422
Oh, I know who you mean.
Yeah, Jetski. 

511
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:18,324
The guy's an asshole.
He used to work at

512
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:20,827
the movie theater
on 12th street. 

513
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:23,079
He tried to sell me popcorn
he swept off the floor. 

514
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:24,580
The guy's a real asshole, man. 

515
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:26,516
Well, that girl you saw
is Jetski's daughter. 

516
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:28,451
Your girlfriend
is Jetski's daughter?

517
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,986
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Thank God for that. 

518
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:32,505
Why?

519
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:34,306
Because if she was, I'd have
to tell you to dump her, man. 

520
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:36,025
My advice would be
to dump her, quick. 

521
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,303
So, you're not dating her?

522
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,305
- No, I'm not dating her.
- But you slept with her?

523
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,772
Look, I just met her today. 

524
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:52,441
Yes or no, man,
did you sleep with her?

525
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:54,110
Yes, I slept with her, but
it's not like you're thinking. 

526
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:56,512
- Really?
- Really. Listen. 

527
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:59,482
I was looking for
a present for daddy. 

528
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:00,733
Dad. 

529
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,138
You have something
on your face. 

530
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,626
Other side. 

531
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,582
Hey, have you listened
to these guys?

532
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:19,852
They rock, but I want to show
you something even better. 

533
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,774
She came on to you. 

534
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:27,210
Yeah, but just let me finish. 

535
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:42,959
Uh... 

536
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:48,831
I want to see your place. 

537
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,299
I don't know you. 

538
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:53,152
My name's Stephanie. Stephanie!

539
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:55,254
But... I don't know
who you are. 

540
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:58,457
You don't like me?
Why don't you like me?

541
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,761
Oh, I like you, I like you,
I just don't know you. 

542
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:03,229
I know you. 

543
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:05,664
I know you, I know
you, I know you. 

544
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:10,285
Dump her, man.
Tell her it was a mistake, 

545
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:12,070
tell her it was an oversight. 

546
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:13,555
You make it sound
like it requires

547
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,057
a congressional investigation. 

548
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,409
Basically, man, you had sex. 

549
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,144
Two fancy animals
doing what animals do. 

550
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,879
An act of nature. I'd get out

551
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,647
before emotions get tangled. 

552
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:25,417
End it before it gets messy. 

553
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,464
Morris?

554
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,467
Yeah, it's me, daddy. 

555
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:43,819
No shit, it's you. 

556
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:45,154
Come here, Morris. 

557
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:52,561
What the hell are you
doing out so late?

558
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:54,246
I was out with N. J. 

559
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,248
Did you buy the groceries, 

560
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,800
or did you take
the money I gave you

561
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:00,853
and spend it on
something useless again?

562
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,087
I'll get 'em. 

563
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,422
No, whoa, whoa, whoa. 

564
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:16,135
How old are you, Morris?

565
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:17,303
35. 

566
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,972
Know what I was doing
when I was 35?

567
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,160
I had a son, 

568
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:26,211
a wife, 

569
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,782
an apartment of my own. 

570
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:32,417
A job. 

571
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:34,286
See what I'm saying?

572
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:36,004
Not really. 

573
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:38,124
I was living. 

574
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:39,508
I understand, daddy. 

575
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,060
Oh, no, I don't think you do. 

576
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,413
I made choices. 

577
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:47,750
Each and every step of the way, 

578
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:50,486
I made a choice. 

579
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,805
It wasn't made for me. 

580
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:54,840
I make choices. 

581
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:57,142
Hmm. 

582
00:33:57,144 --> 00:34:00,179
I wonder what your mother would
think about your choices. 

583
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,388
Stephanie, listen. 

584
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,573
It's... 

585
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:16,041
Hi, Stephanie. 

586
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:17,909
It's... 

587
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:20,912
Hey, Stephanie, it's me. 

588
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:23,615
This is ridiculous. 

589
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,556
Hey, Stephanie!

590
00:37:31,558 --> 00:37:33,925
- Twisted Bliss!
- Ah! You missed me, huh?

591
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:34,926
Jetski, Jetski. 

592
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:36,996
I ought to wax
your tugboat, Bliss!

593
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:38,697
- I've missed you too.
- Jetski!

594
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,083
- What are you doing?
- Jetski?

595
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:42,751
Sweet baby Judas, Bliss!

596
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:45,421
No one calls me Jetski anymore. 

597
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:47,506
I ought to take you
down for that, man. 

598
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:49,241
You know I hate that nickname!

599
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:50,809
Shit!

600
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,812
Twisted Bliss!

601
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,413
How you doin', buddy?

602
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:56,065
Good. 

603
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah? This is a reunion, Bliss. 

604
00:37:58,002 --> 00:38:00,035
This is great. 

605
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:03,138
How... how you been?
How's things? Things good?

606
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,191
Yeah. 

607
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,076
Well, it's good seeing you. 

608
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,894
Oh, man, it's good
seeing you too, man. 

609
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,780
You know... You know what?

610
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:13,799
We should go out
for some beers sometime. 

611
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:16,268
Or, better yet, maybe you could
come over and meet the family. 

612
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,738
You'd love my daughter!

613
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:22,774
What... what are you doing here?

614
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:25,911
Oh, man, this renovation... 

615
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:27,996
my show. 

616
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:30,932
I'm the foreman, in charge
of this whole project, 

617
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,551
which is already screwed, 

618
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:34,920
and we haven't
even begun, but... 

619
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:39,308
that's life, I guess. You
make plans, and life happens. 

620
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,576
But... you've got
to get it done, right?

621
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:43,078
You've got to push through. 

622
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,746
Right. You've got
to push through. 

623
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:47,733
Do you remember
the Bloody Eagle brigade?

624
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:51,737
I tell my wife and daughter
that story all the time, man!

625
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:53,255
No, I don't. 

626
00:38:53,257 --> 00:38:55,173
Aw, come on, Bliss,
the Bloody Eagles!

627
00:38:57,495 --> 00:39:00,579
Remember? You and me,
all the hijinks?

628
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:03,515
You, Morris the Professor,
coming up with the plan. 

629
00:39:03,517 --> 00:39:06,385
Me, the Axe,
getting the job done. 

630
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,720
Remember all the shit
we used to pull?

631
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:12,141
Twisted Bliss and the
Bloody Eagle brigade. 

632
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,927
Man, we were
famous in high school!

633
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:16,061
Shit!

634
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:19,180
You remember the time
that we put the, uh, 

635
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:21,182
the black shoe polish
on the toilet seats

636
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,651
in the girls' locker room, 

637
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,253
or when you, the Professor, 

638
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,789
superglued Mr. Arnold's
chair to his desk?

639
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,257
- You remember that?
- No. 

640
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,925
Aw, come on, Bliss. 

641
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:33,027
Actually, no,
I really... I don't. 

642
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:34,613
The Bliss!

643
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:36,481
And Stevie J. !
The Bloody Eagles!

644
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,085
Remember?

645
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:44,106
- Sure.
- Oh, I miss that, you know?

646
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:47,609
All those times, you know?

647
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,428
But... 

648
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,114
Now's now, you know?

649
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:54,116
So, I have a wife,
teenage daughter. 

650
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:55,583
Right. 

651
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:58,520
I make good money, but... 

652
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,555
What do you do? Where... where...
where are you working?

653
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:03,024
I'm between jobs. 

654
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,893
Let's. Do. Brews. 

655
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:06,361
How 'bout tonight?

656
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,197
Let's get some cocktails
and catch up... 

657
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,499
- Tonight, bro!
- Tonight? Eh... 

658
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:12,501
Thing is, I gotta
watch my cash right now. 

659
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:15,254
Bliss! Why didn't you tell me?

660
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:16,721
I could have got you on here. 

661
00:40:16,723 --> 00:40:18,623
You should have
talked to me last week. 

662
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,292
You know what?

663
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,631
Tide over. 

664
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:31,136
Till you get goin' again. 

665
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,338
- Oh, no, I can't take this.
- No, no, no, no. 

666
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,307
Take that. 

667
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,409
One Bloody Eagle to another. 

668
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,001
So, you want to see
what this place looks like

669
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:48,270
before we tear
the shit out of it?

670
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:50,806
Sure. 

671
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:53,074
Bloody Eagle, baby! Yeah!

672
00:40:54,677 --> 00:40:56,511
Oh, yeah. 

673
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:59,013
I haven't been in here
in six months. 

674
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:01,283
Restrictions, permits, 

675
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:03,618
wife suing the husband
for cheating, 

676
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,788
husband's suing the wife
for being ugly. 

677
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,123
Man. 

678
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:13,261
Divorce.
I don't get it, you know?

679
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:17,299
I mean, when you say you're gonna
do something, you do it, right?

680
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,501
- You stick to it.
- Yeah, right. 

681
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:21,970
I mean, just... your word. 

682
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,306
- I don't understand these...
- Jesus. 

683
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:27,142
This is your one warning:

684
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:28,710
Leave or suffer. 

685
00:41:28,712 --> 00:41:30,145
Hey, who the hell are you?

686
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:32,781
You guys can't be in here.
This place is off limits. 

687
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,783
We've been breached. 

688
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:36,285
Excuse me?

689
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:37,786
Remember the Maine. 

690
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:40,071
It's the Alamo, dumb-ass!

691
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:43,409
- Let's just crack some heads.
- Ignition!

692
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:46,862
Ow! Ahh! Mother of God!

693
00:41:46,864 --> 00:41:48,163
I'm out of here, Jetski!

694
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:50,432
I hear you. Sweet baby Judas!

695
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,826
The place is gonna burn down. 

696
00:42:01,828 --> 00:42:03,328
Oh, no, they won't be so lucky. 

697
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,497
Burning to death would be a
blessing to those people. 

698
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:07,699
Be the only way to
get rid of the smell. 

699
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:10,435
Ohh! You know what?

700
00:42:10,437 --> 00:42:13,038
I'm calling the cops, get 'em
to crack down on this shit. 

701
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:16,775
Wait, Bliss. 

702
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:20,295
I have an idea. 

703
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,376
There's three kinds of trouble:

704
00:42:34,378 --> 00:42:35,794
There's regular trouble,
real trouble, 

705
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:38,029
and then there's the
trouble that you're in. 

706
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:40,081
No, you listen. I'm
not talking to you, 

707
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,533
but if I was talking to you, 

708
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,102
I would tell you how ridiculous
you look in this picture!

709
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:49,958
There is a reason muscle shirts
are called muscle shirts. 

710
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,710
It's because you're supposed
to have muscles to wear them. 

711
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:56,815
My grandmother had
bigger arms than you. 

712
00:42:56,817 --> 00:42:58,200
Where did you get this?

713
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:00,702
What do you mean,
where did I get it?

714
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,454
It's my dad's. 

715
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:05,940
You know... your old high
school buddy, remember?

716
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:08,660
Oh, by the way, my
mom is just thrilled

717
00:43:08,662 --> 00:43:10,045
that you're taking me to prom. 

718
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:13,832
You told her?
Of course I told her. 

719
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:15,834
I mean, I didn't tell her
who, but, yes, I told her. 

720
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:18,303
Prom is a big deal.
It's like... a wedding. 

721
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:20,806
But she said I couldn't go. 

722
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:22,874
Uh, well, that's unfortunate. 

723
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:25,043
Not until I ask my dad. 

724
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:27,012
Not really until they meet you. 

725
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:28,981
Which is kind of funny, 

726
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:33,051
being that you're friends
with my dad and all. 

727
00:43:33,053 --> 00:43:34,820
Do you like chicken?

728
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,654
That's all my mom
knows how to make. 

729
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,924
It might be better if you
just eat before you show up. 

730
00:43:40,793 --> 00:43:42,727
Look, Stephanie,
we need to talk. 

731
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:46,281
Okay. 

732
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:48,716
Well, I was talking
to my friend N. J. , and... 

733
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,288
- And... ?
- And he said I should... 

734
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,460
What?

735
00:43:58,462 --> 00:44:00,361
He said I should... 

736
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:05,934
That I should find out what color your
prom dress is gonna be so I could... 

737
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,135
pink. 

738
00:44:07,137 --> 00:44:09,705
Pink. It's my favorite color. 

739
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:11,272
Pink. 

740
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,709
There's a lot of things
you've got to learn about me. 

741
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,212
One of 'em is that... 

742
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:20,148
I get really pissed off when you
don't answer my phone calls. 

743
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,325
I gotta go. 

744
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:31,559
Trip. 

745
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:35,130
Monday. Stromboli.
Don't forget. 

746
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:36,465
Right. 

747
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,170
Monday. 

748
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:05,359
Damn it, Morris!

749
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:21,442
Whoa!

750
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:23,778
Ohh! It's me, daddy. 

751
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,281
Wah... I know it's
you, goddamn it. 

752
00:45:27,283 --> 00:45:30,118
You scared me.
Where are you... ? 

753
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:34,872
I don't want to know. 

754
00:45:34,874 --> 00:45:37,092
I'm helping out a friend. 

755
00:45:37,094 --> 00:45:38,309
Great. 

756
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:44,516
Making a choice. 

757
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,019
Stay low, Professor. 

758
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:49,437
Keep your head down. 

759
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:53,191
- Stephen, where are you?
- It's the Axe. Call me the Axe. 

760
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,228
- Axe?
- I'm over here. 

761
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,697
- Where?
- Here. 

762
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:06,003
Get down, Professor.
We're covert, remember?

763
00:46:10,242 --> 00:46:12,076
Oh, God, I hate heights. 

764
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,266
I'm having second thoughts
about this, Professor. 

765
00:46:18,268 --> 00:46:20,835
Maybe I should have
called the cops. 

766
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:23,771
We can do this, Axe. 

767
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,707
We're the Battle Eagles,
remember?

768
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:28,092
The Bloody Eagles. 

769
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:34,682
I'm freezing up, Professor. 

770
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:37,435
I don't know if I can
go through with this. 

771
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:40,072
You made a commitment. You've
got to follow through. 

772
00:46:40,074 --> 00:46:41,639
Just find your inner strength, 

773
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:43,641
just like that time you
killed that rat with a mop. 

774
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:45,376
You didn't freeze up
then, did you?

775
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:48,796
You followed through. 

776
00:46:48,798 --> 00:46:52,350
I told you about that?
I told you about the rat?

777
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:53,685
Let's go over the plan again. 

778
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:55,587
Wait. When did I
tell you about the rat?

779
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:57,889
Hey. We're the Bloody
Eagles, right?

780
00:46:59,908 --> 00:47:02,410
Right. Let's do this. 

781
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:05,146
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

782
00:47:05,148 --> 00:47:07,415
This is bullshit.
They're not coming!

783
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:11,886
Yeah, we've been waiting here for
something like 12 hours straight. 

784
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:14,539
- I'm hungry.
- No, they're coming. 

785
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,442
They're not coming.
They pussed out, the big... 

786
00:47:18,912 --> 00:47:20,745
What was that?

787
00:47:20,747 --> 00:47:22,213
It's them. 

788
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,382
No cops sound like that.
That sound was like... 

789
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,951
It sounds like revenge! Aahhh!

790
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:32,023
Professor, I'm down. 

791
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,449
Unh!

792
00:47:44,938 --> 00:47:46,003
Aah!

793
00:47:50,777 --> 00:47:53,378
Remember the Alamo, assholes!

794
00:47:57,783 --> 00:48:01,870
Goddamn it, Professor!
We did it!

795
00:48:04,406 --> 00:48:07,308
Bloody Eagle, baby!
Taste our talons!

796
00:50:35,141 --> 00:50:37,575
My wife was the first
woman I had sex with. 

797
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,947
Can you believe that,
Professor?

798
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,302
The first,
and probably the last. 

799
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,009
She got pregnant that
first time we did it, 

800
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:58,046
middle of senior year. 

801
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:00,348
What are the odds of that?

802
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,350
When I'm lucky... 

803
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:06,221
It's always with bad luck. 

804
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,112
Oh, man. 

805
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,047
You should see my daughter. 

806
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,085
She's a beauty, but... 

807
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,639
I just don't feel the same
about her anymore, you know?

808
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:27,008
It's like... 

809
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,462
It's like she's
all grown up, you know?

810
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:32,697
Right. 

811
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:37,218
Fathers and daughters. 

812
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,205
It's not the same as
fathers and sons. It's... 

813
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:47,145
Fathers and sons. 

814
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,886
You ever... 

815
00:51:57,005 --> 00:51:58,339
What?

816
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:03,211
You ever felt that
you were waiting?

817
00:52:04,446 --> 00:52:05,846
Waiting?

818
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,249
Waiting on what?

819
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:13,954
I don't know. Just... something.
Anything. 

820
00:52:17,793 --> 00:52:19,510
It's like at the end
of Moby Dick, 

821
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,779
when Ishmael is out there
in the middle of the ocean... 

822
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:25,550
with nothing. Just... 

823
00:52:27,653 --> 00:52:30,154
waiting for something
to come along and save him. 

824
00:52:33,475 --> 00:52:35,676
What the hell are you
talking about, Bliss?

825
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:38,596
I don't know, man. 

826
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:41,316
Just talkin'. 

827
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:46,137
So what happens?

828
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:47,972
When?

829
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:52,327
With this guy. 

830
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:54,913
The guy in the middle
of the ocean. I mean... 

831
00:52:54,915 --> 00:52:56,297
Is he saved?

832
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:59,133
Yeah, he's saved. 

833
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:01,336
By his best friend's Coffin. 

834
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:05,423
Damn, Bliss. 

835
00:53:10,095 --> 00:53:11,562
What's wrong with you?

836
00:53:15,268 --> 00:53:18,286
You know what you
need, Professor?

837
00:53:18,288 --> 00:53:20,405
- What?
- You need... 

838
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,624
Some woman action. 

839
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:25,192
You got a girlfriend,
Professor?

840
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:26,744
You need a girlfriend. 

841
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,034
I should get goin'. 

842
00:53:33,036 --> 00:53:34,919
You hungry? You want
to have breakfast with me?

843
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:36,755
You want to grab some breakfast?
I'd like to have breakfast with you. 

844
00:53:36,757 --> 00:53:38,456
I'd love to, but I can't. 

845
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,775
It's Sunday morning.
What do you got?

846
00:53:42,578 --> 00:53:43,995
Church. 

847
00:53:54,306 --> 00:53:55,873
Well, Stephen, it's been good. 

848
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,208
Hey. 

849
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,578
- It's Axe.
- Right. 

850
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,748
And no, Professor,
it's been great, man. 

851
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,083
It's been great!

852
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:13,324
You don't think
that shit matters?

853
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:16,077
You've got a lot to learn
about this business. 

854
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,580
Things don't happen
like you see on TV. 

855
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:21,432
Life isn't that pretty. 

856
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:24,285
Shit happens, and then
you're pushing 40, 

857
00:54:24,287 --> 00:54:26,587
some more shit happens,
and you're pushing 70, 

858
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:29,590
then some more shit happens
and you're dead!

859
00:54:29,592 --> 00:54:31,426
Most of this shit
is just shit... 

860
00:54:31,428 --> 00:54:34,411
day-to-day bullshit that doesn't
add up to much of anything. 

861
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:36,347
- You think... ?
- Forget it. 

862
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,350
Thank you all so much
for your comments. 

863
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:15,019
- I'm sure that our time...
- Even talking about salsa gives me cramps. 

864
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,638
Thank you. 

865
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,523
I'm available any time you need
me for one of these things, 

866
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:20,892
especially if we actually
get to eat some... 

867
00:55:20,894 --> 00:55:22,093
Thank you, Duly noted. 

868
00:55:22,095 --> 00:55:26,363
So, uh, Morris, um...
You gonna get some dinner?

869
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,068
Uh, no, I was just
gonna head home. 

870
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,585
Oh. Good. Me too. 

871
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:33,705
We can share a cab, right?

872
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:34,973
Sure. 

873
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,648
There you go.
And keep the change. 

874
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,251
I got it, I got it. 

875
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:21,585
Thanks. 

876
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,823
Uh, right, I was thinking, 

877
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:27,424
uh, I don't want
to go home yet. 

878
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,095
- Well...
- Drink, right?

879
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:33,765
Uh, sure. There's a
place right down there. 

880
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:34,966
Oh, right. 

881
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,809
Hey, I was wondering
if you could help me. 

882
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:54,552
You see, my friend Morris, 

883
00:56:54,554 --> 00:56:56,487
he lives in the building. 

884
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,425
Your friend?

885
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:04,379
Yeah, my friend. 

886
00:57:04,381 --> 00:57:07,181
Cheers. Thanks
for the focus group. 

887
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:19,743
Tell me something interesting, 

888
00:57:19,745 --> 00:57:21,812
something about yourself
that few people know. 

889
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:25,099
Well... I'm half Greek. 

890
00:57:25,101 --> 00:57:28,386
Mmm. I knew there was
a reason I liked you. 

891
00:57:28,388 --> 00:57:31,388
Mediterranean men know how
to handle women right. 

892
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:34,425
You have a way with women. 

893
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:36,944
Tell me something else.
Tell me a story. 

894
00:57:36,946 --> 00:57:38,762
Tell me about
your first concert. 

895
00:57:38,764 --> 00:57:42,433
My first concert? My first
concert was Liberace. 

896
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:45,036
Right, right. 

897
00:57:45,038 --> 00:57:46,403
No, really. 

898
00:57:46,405 --> 00:57:49,106
Really. Liberace, Bob
Hope, and Bruce Jenner, 

899
00:57:49,108 --> 00:57:50,942
all on one stage, one night. 

900
00:57:50,944 --> 00:57:53,861
Bruce Jenner... you mean the
guy from the wheaties box?

901
00:57:53,863 --> 00:57:55,195
The olympian. Him. 

902
00:57:57,632 --> 00:57:59,467
You almost had me!

903
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:00,934
I thought you were serious!

904
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,737
I am serious. My mother took me.
I was 12. 

905
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:05,739
I was too young to appreciate
the oddness of the whole thing. 

906
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:07,408
I had no idea
who these people were

907
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:10,161
or what it was
we were about to see. 

908
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:12,447
That, and I was angry
with my mother then. 

909
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,666
Oh, I can't think of a time I
wasn't angry with my mother, right?

910
00:58:15,668 --> 00:58:17,568
And she died, right?

911
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,636
Now I don't know
who to be angry with. 

912
00:58:19,638 --> 00:58:20,955
How'd she die?

913
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:25,092
How does anyone die?
Something stops. 

914
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:27,327
Something doesn't stop.
Cancer. A car wreck. 

915
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:28,762
Coronary. 

916
00:58:28,764 --> 00:58:30,081
But it's all good, right?

917
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,748
I'm not saying things are bad.
I'm not complaining. 

918
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,852
I just... wish things
could be clean and clear, 

919
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:36,203
with smooth edges. 

920
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:42,794
Right. Why can't I just bolt off
witty lines when I need to?

921
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:45,680
No, you speak well. 

922
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:46,814
Mmm. 

923
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,801
I speak well. 

924
00:58:49,803 --> 00:58:52,069
Right. 

925
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:56,107
But tell me something:

926
00:58:56,109 --> 00:59:00,043
Something you like about me. 

927
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,581
I like your, uh... 

928
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:08,219
Dress. 

929
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:12,756
And I like you, right?

930
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:15,642
I like you a lot. 

931
00:59:27,806 --> 00:59:30,474
Me and Georgie had a terrible,
terrible fight last night. 

932
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,377
I stormed out of
the house, right?

933
00:59:33,379 --> 00:59:35,562
I stayed with my friend who
lives on 88th and Lexington

934
00:59:35,564 --> 00:59:38,132
in this tiny little place
she claims is a one-bedroom

935
00:59:38,134 --> 00:59:40,467
but really is just
a glorified studio

936
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:42,586
with a Pullman kitchen. 

937
00:59:42,588 --> 00:59:44,271
I'm sorry. 

938
00:59:45,257 --> 00:59:46,923
You know what
frightens me the most?

939
00:59:50,111 --> 00:59:51,445
Not being appreciated. 

940
00:59:54,616 --> 00:59:57,251
At home, I don't
feel appreciated, right?

941
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,988
That, and turning shabby. 

942
01:00:03,108 --> 01:00:04,708
I don't want to be
like a couch. 

943
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:08,479
I don't want to get worn
and run down and lumpy. 

944
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:11,999
I don't want to wake up one
day and realize I look used. 

945
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:17,137
You know what happens
to shabby couches, right?

946
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:21,225
You... you've seen them,
right, on the street?

947
01:00:21,227 --> 01:00:22,442
They get junked. 

948
01:00:29,484 --> 01:00:31,985
We shouldn't be doing
this right here. 

949
01:00:31,987 --> 01:00:34,154
- I want to see your place!
- Nah, daddy's home!

950
01:00:34,156 --> 01:00:35,623
Daddy?!

951
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:38,125
I mean, Danny,
my father. He's home. 

952
01:00:38,127 --> 01:00:40,628
Oh. Kinky. I like it. 

953
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:43,163
It's just... mmm...
He's not well, so... 

954
01:00:43,165 --> 01:00:44,632
Oh, right. 

955
01:00:44,634 --> 01:00:47,485
Oh, that's so sweet of you,
taking care of him. 

956
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:51,338
Is he medicated?

957
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,408
- Yeah, he is.
- Maybe he won't notice!

958
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,910
No, it's just, um... 

959
01:00:55,912 --> 01:00:57,744
I... it's really tempting.
I just... 

960
01:00:57,746 --> 01:01:00,080
Oh, wait. Shh, shh, shh. 

961
01:01:00,082 --> 01:01:04,235
I think it's George. I swear
he's got a GPS on me. 

962
01:01:04,237 --> 01:01:05,853
Maybe you should go. 

963
01:01:05,855 --> 01:01:07,104
Mnh!

964
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:09,940
Right. 

965
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,129
Hey, I hope
your dad gets better. 

966
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:16,463
Yeah, thanks!

967
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,672
- N. J. ?
- I found it, man. 

968
01:01:24,674 --> 01:01:26,674
- Found what?
- The woman. 

969
01:01:26,676 --> 01:01:29,342
The one. My life, man.
The reason to go on. 

970
01:01:29,344 --> 01:01:31,478
Two days ago, you were getting married.
What happened to that woman?

971
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,647
That was years ago, man. Two
things happened since then, 

972
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:36,984
two important things, but I
gotta get running. I gotta go. 

973
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:39,452
I gotta get packed. Packed?
Where are you going?

974
01:01:40,588 --> 01:01:42,156
Montana, man. 

975
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:43,958
Montana? What's in Montana?

976
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,926
Me, and the one. The woman. 

977
01:01:45,928 --> 01:01:48,946
To think, she's... she's been in
your building this whole time. 

978
01:01:48,948 --> 01:01:52,499
- Who lived in my building?
- My Bliss, Bliss. 

979
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:54,668
Hattie. 

980
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,936
Hattie Rockworth. 

981
01:01:57,706 --> 01:01:59,373
Hattie Rockworth?

982
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,118
Morris. 

983
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,719
Morris, come on in here. 

984
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,362
Found these in the bathroom. 

985
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:23,948
Know they're not mine. 

986
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:25,866
You don't wear these, do you?

987
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:27,735
Surprise. 

988
01:02:27,737 --> 01:02:30,420
Please tell me
you don't wear these. 

989
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,525
Nope, they're not mine. 

990
01:02:36,477 --> 01:02:40,130
I'm not running a hot-sheet
hotel here, you know. 

991
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:42,783
This is not where my
money's been going, is it?

992
01:04:13,592 --> 01:04:15,559
She's not coming. 

993
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,061
Jesus!

994
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:18,529
Who's not coming?

995
01:04:18,531 --> 01:04:21,282
Shit! Yeah, right, who. 

996
01:04:21,284 --> 01:04:22,566
Stephanie. 

997
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,284
Sorry about the coffee. 

998
01:04:24,286 --> 01:04:27,271
Look, she's not coming.
She told me to tell you that, 

999
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:29,990
and to meet her tonight out front
of the Velvet Cigar Lounge, 

1000
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:31,742
7:00, okay?

1001
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:35,078
And she said you'd buy me a
pepperoni slice and a root beer. 

1002
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,681
I'm not buying you anything. 

1003
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:43,304
Personally, I think you
two are perfect together. 

1004
01:04:43,306 --> 01:04:44,989
You're both really gross!

1005
01:05:00,638 --> 01:05:03,407
What's up with the outfit,
you join the rodeo?

1006
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:04,741
When in Rome... 

1007
01:05:06,411 --> 01:05:07,928
What's that supposed to mean?

1008
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,763
Montana, man. 

1009
01:05:09,765 --> 01:05:11,332
It's what they wear in Montana. 

1010
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:14,268
It's what I'll be
wearing when I herd. 

1011
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:15,936
Herd what?

1012
01:05:15,938 --> 01:05:17,538
Buffali. 

1013
01:05:25,763 --> 01:05:27,897
Check this out. 

1014
01:05:27,899 --> 01:05:29,867
Hattie gave it to me. 

1015
01:05:29,869 --> 01:05:31,452
Is it a tapeworm?

1016
01:05:31,454 --> 01:05:32,820
It's a Red Thread. 

1017
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,575
I'm in the cartel. I'm in. 

1018
01:05:40,111 --> 01:05:42,946
Come on. I want
to show you something. 

1019
01:05:42,948 --> 01:05:44,348
Come on!

1020
01:05:47,785 --> 01:05:49,202
See?

1021
01:05:50,138 --> 01:05:52,306
So... what you're telling me

1022
01:05:52,308 --> 01:05:54,141
is there's a secret cartel... 

1023
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:56,143
Yeah, the Red Thread. 

1024
01:05:56,145 --> 01:05:58,562
... that controls the
world's energy resources

1025
01:05:58,564 --> 01:06:00,847
and runs an international
sex trade... 

1026
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:03,683
- And this Maddie woman...
- Hattie. 

1027
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:06,420
... Hattie, who you met yesterday
while waiting for me, 

1028
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:07,988
is now the new love
of your life, 

1029
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,990
who you're running
away to Montana with, 

1030
01:06:09,992 --> 01:06:11,491
introduced you to her father, 

1031
01:06:11,493 --> 01:06:14,728
who runs the North American chapter
of the cartel, the Red Thread. 

1032
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,563
Yeah. That's him. 

1033
01:06:16,565 --> 01:06:18,732
He's sponsoring you to become
a full-fledged member, 

1034
01:06:18,734 --> 01:06:20,851
which merely entails you
initiating a coup

1035
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:22,353
in some third-world country. 

1036
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:25,088
Yeah. 

1037
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,591
That's okay. It took me a few
minutes to digest it all too. 

1038
01:06:27,593 --> 01:06:29,059
But look at this. 

1039
01:06:29,061 --> 01:06:30,611
Yeah?

1040
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:32,279
Here. Look from here. 

1041
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,150
- And I'm looking at... ?
- Right over here. 

1042
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:42,472
"Sex street, tail market. "

1043
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:46,443
The highest-grossing sex
trade market in the states, 

1044
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:48,194
but we're getting
raided tonight, 

1045
01:06:48,196 --> 01:06:50,497
so we have to move operations. 

1046
01:06:51,616 --> 01:06:54,451
I gotta go. I wish you... 

1047
01:06:54,453 --> 01:06:55,686
Luck with it. 

1048
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,605
You don't believe me, do you?

1049
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:03,660
What? Of course I believe you. 

1050
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:11,251
Yeah, just like I believe you
went to Cuba last summer, 

1051
01:07:11,253 --> 01:07:13,086
or that Nigerian
terrorist training camp

1052
01:07:13,088 --> 01:07:14,989
you visited
two christmases ago, 

1053
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:18,091
or the time Bill Gates called
you to ask your opinion

1054
01:07:18,093 --> 01:07:20,594
on one of his products.
Of course, I believe you. 

1055
01:07:20,596 --> 01:07:23,030
Wait a minute, maybe I'm
being a little sensitive, 

1056
01:07:23,032 --> 01:07:26,617
but I think I'm detecting
some harshness in your tone. 

1057
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:28,602
- Really?
- Yeah. 

1058
01:07:28,604 --> 01:07:30,270
No. 

1059
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:35,425
N. J. , I love
to hear your stories. 

1060
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:36,760
It's fascinating. 

1061
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,764
It's hard to believe that
one guy could be so lucky

1062
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:43,166
to meet so many famous
people, travel the world, 

1063
01:07:43,168 --> 01:07:45,970
without ever leaving
the East Village. 

1064
01:07:45,972 --> 01:07:48,272
Oh, what about your little map, 

1065
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:49,773
all the places you plan to go. 

1066
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:52,009
'Least I've done
something, man. 

1067
01:07:53,011 --> 01:07:54,644
Yeah, lied. 

1068
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:01,467
You remember how we met?

1069
01:08:03,354 --> 01:08:06,039
I saved your life, man. 

1070
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,041
That day in the pool,
you were a rock

1071
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:10,177
and I was Mark Spitz. 

1072
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:13,146
I pulled you up, man!

1073
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,476
Shit!

1074
01:08:25,478 --> 01:08:27,978
Morrie, old buddy,
what are you doing here?

1075
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,680
You smoke cigars?

1076
01:08:29,682 --> 01:08:33,050
Oh, no. I'm just
waiting for... someone. 

1077
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:34,485
It's nice seeing you. 

1078
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:37,220
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

1079
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:40,256
Bloody, Eagles, baby.
We need to have that drink. 

1080
01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:42,593
Yeah, I'd love to, but
I'm waiting for someone. 

1081
01:08:42,595 --> 01:08:45,929
Oh, yeah? Waiting on a girl?

1082
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:47,397
Yeah, a girl. 

1083
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,567
Yeah, is she, like,
super fly, super hot?

1084
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:52,369
Yeah! Look,
I've got to take off. 

1085
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:53,804
Surprise!

1086
01:08:53,806 --> 01:08:55,772
Andrea.
What are you doing here?

1087
01:08:55,774 --> 01:08:57,207
Stalking you. 

1088
01:08:57,209 --> 01:08:59,176
- Really?
- Bliss!

1089
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:01,344
Where's your manners?
Who's this pretty little filly?

1090
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,681
So, after last night,
after our drinks

1091
01:09:03,683 --> 01:09:07,251
and all that...
Talking... we did, 

1092
01:09:07,253 --> 01:09:09,269
what you said
really sank in, right?

1093
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:11,772
- What'd I say?
- Right, like you've forgotten?

1094
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:14,608
No, really. It really
cut me to my soul, 

1095
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:17,144
so this morning I woke up and
thought, "you know, Andrea", 

1096
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:18,946
time for something new. "

1097
01:09:18,948 --> 01:09:22,566
An adventure, right?

1098
01:09:22,568 --> 01:09:25,035
Sounds like the Professor's
finally gotten tenure. 

1099
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:26,736
Uh, I'm the Axe. 

1100
01:09:26,738 --> 01:09:28,739
I'm sure the Professor's
told you all about me. 

1101
01:09:28,741 --> 01:09:30,540
So, I'd love to do
some more talking, 

1102
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,776
but George gets really jealous. 

1103
01:09:32,778 --> 01:09:35,428
- George is here?
- Yeah, he's just getting our coffee. 

1104
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,430
George, over here!

1105
01:09:37,432 --> 01:09:40,167
I bought him that
shirt as a joke, 

1106
01:09:40,169 --> 01:09:42,252
but he loves it.
He wears it all the time. 

1107
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:44,254
Ha ha ha!

1108
01:09:44,256 --> 01:09:46,807
- George, you remember Morris, right?
- No. 

1109
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:48,592
Yes, you do. I had drinks
with him last night. 

1110
01:09:48,594 --> 01:09:51,144
That's why I came home so late. 

1111
01:09:51,146 --> 01:09:53,680
- George was upset about that.
- This is the guy. 

1112
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:56,567
Yep. This is my little Bliss. 

1113
01:09:56,569 --> 01:09:58,435
His father's real sick. 

1114
01:09:58,437 --> 01:10:00,603
Professor! Your dad's sick?

1115
01:10:00,605 --> 01:10:02,522
- You didn't tell me that.
- This is the guy. 

1116
01:10:02,524 --> 01:10:06,110
Georgie, we talked about this. 

1117
01:10:06,112 --> 01:10:09,246
Um, so, uh, drinks again,
right, and more talk. 

1118
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,198
Drinks. Right. 

1119
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,533
And talk. 

1120
01:10:13,535 --> 01:10:16,969
Don't forget the talk. 

1121
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:18,956
Talk. Right. 

1122
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:21,258
All right, we've got to run.
Say goodbye, Georgie. 

1123
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,626
You're the guy. 

1124
01:10:26,297 --> 01:10:30,033
Mnh! Bloody Eagle, baby!

1125
01:10:30,035 --> 01:10:31,451
Heh heh heh!

1126
01:10:31,453 --> 01:10:33,786
Bet you gave her a taste
of your talon, huh?

1127
01:10:33,788 --> 01:10:34,954
Yeah. 

1128
01:10:34,956 --> 01:10:36,523
But be careful with
that one, Professor. 

1129
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:38,025
I know you're flying
high right now, 

1130
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:39,659
but little Georgie, 

1131
01:10:39,661 --> 01:10:41,161
he looks like he could
clip some wings. 

1132
01:10:41,163 --> 01:10:44,448
- You know what I'm saying?
- Hello, daddy. 

1133
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,798
What were you guys looking at?

1134
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:50,170
Um, Stephanie, um, you remember
my good friend Morris. 

1135
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:51,238
The Professor. 

1136
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,657
The Professor. 

1137
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:55,559
You teach. I'm having some
trouble in my classes. 

1138
01:10:55,561 --> 01:10:57,544
Maybe you could tutor me. 

1139
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:59,163
You're having trouble in your classes?
Why didn't you tell me, sweetie?

1140
01:10:59,165 --> 01:11:01,381
You didn't ask.
What do you teach, Professor?

1141
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:03,634
I'm not really a Professor. 

1142
01:11:03,636 --> 01:11:05,251
What are you, then?

1143
01:11:05,253 --> 01:11:06,753
He's a Bloody Eagle, Stephanie. 

1144
01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:08,755
I told you all
about him, remember?

1145
01:11:08,757 --> 01:11:10,590
I might need a reminder. 

1146
01:11:10,592 --> 01:11:12,759
We had this gang
in high school. 

1147
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:14,510
Oh, right, I remember. You were
best friends in high school. 

1148
01:11:14,512 --> 01:11:16,162
You did everything
together, everything. 

1149
01:11:16,164 --> 01:11:18,732
Who is that woman
that you were talking to?

1150
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:20,484
- Nobody.
- Nobody. 

1151
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:22,168
Nobody. 

1152
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,954
She didn't seem
like she was a nobody. 

1153
01:11:23,956 --> 01:11:26,657
She seemed like she was
probably a somebody. 

1154
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:29,660
Sweetie, here. Why don't
you take a few dollars

1155
01:11:29,662 --> 01:11:33,413
and go get yourself and your
friends some ice cream, 

1156
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:36,182
okay, sweetie?
'Cause the Professor and I, 

1157
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:38,985
we have some business
we need to talk about, okay?

1158
01:11:38,987 --> 01:11:40,353
Does mom know
you've been drinking?

1159
01:11:40,355 --> 01:11:42,673
You know she hates it
when you've been drinking. 

1160
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:44,391
Stephanie, I'm the adult here. 

1161
01:11:44,393 --> 01:11:47,610
Morris.
Morris is also an adult. 

1162
01:11:47,612 --> 01:11:49,713
Yes, the Professor
is also an adult. 

1163
01:11:49,715 --> 01:11:51,098
I'm just a child. 

1164
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,582
You are a child. Correct. 

1165
01:11:52,584 --> 01:11:55,385
But I won't always be a child. 

1166
01:11:55,387 --> 01:11:57,971
Stephanie, what's
gotten into you?

1167
01:11:57,973 --> 01:11:59,105
Morris... 

1168
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,359
It's been nice

1169
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,128
meeting you. 

1170
01:12:08,816 --> 01:12:10,250
Christ. 

1171
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,921
She's my own daughter, and I
don't even understand her. 

1172
01:12:14,923 --> 01:12:16,789
I mean, she's acting like... 

1173
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,292
- I don't know.
- A woman?

1174
01:12:18,294 --> 01:12:22,462
Exactly. She's
acting like a woman. 

1175
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:25,198
And pretty soon, she'll be
going out on dates with boys, 

1176
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,851
and... God, I don't even
want to think about

1177
01:12:27,853 --> 01:12:30,787
what happens after that. 

1178
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:33,123
Can you believe she has
a date to the prom?

1179
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:34,591
Some guy. 

1180
01:12:34,593 --> 01:12:37,060
She's bringing him over
for dinner tomorrow night. 

1181
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:39,796
- Really? Tomorrow?
- Yeah, and I will wax his tugboat... 

1182
01:12:39,798 --> 01:12:41,631
If he even thinks
about touching her. 

1183
01:12:41,633 --> 01:12:43,166
Right. 

1184
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:44,768
I mean... 

1185
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,137
She's a good-looking
girl, right, Professor?

1186
01:12:47,139 --> 01:12:49,623
I mean, you wouldn't kick
her out of bed, would you?

1187
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:53,160
Ah, sweet baby Judas,
what am I sayin'?

1188
01:12:53,162 --> 01:12:55,662
You're a Bloody Eagle. 

1189
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:58,448
But that would be...
Weird, right?

1190
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:01,285
- Yeah. Weird.
- Yeah. 

1191
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:03,253
Look... 

1192
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,088
Stephen. 

1193
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,858
Axe. Call me Axe. 

1194
01:13:10,077 --> 01:13:11,261
Axe. 

1195
01:13:14,615 --> 01:13:16,633
I've got to get going. 

1196
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:18,802
But what about that girl
you were waiting on?

1197
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:20,554
Yeah, well,
Bloody Eagles, right?

1198
01:13:20,556 --> 01:13:22,556
Ha ha! Bloody Eagle, baby!

1199
01:13:24,443 --> 01:13:26,143
- Stephanie...
- Your place. Now. 

1200
01:13:26,145 --> 01:13:28,611
Who are you dating,
me or my dad?

1201
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,080
And who is the tramp?

1202
01:13:30,082 --> 01:13:31,548
Not here. Come on. 

1203
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,151
Oh, wow, we're going up to your place?
What about daddy?

1204
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:39,289
Morris, have you seen my keys?

1205
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:41,041
Oh. Hi, daddy. 

1206
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:42,909
Oh, I see. 

1207
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,910
Not now. 

1208
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,966
Ow, you're hurting me. 

1209
01:13:48,968 --> 01:13:50,667
Sorry. 

1210
01:13:50,669 --> 01:13:52,652
It's okay. I kind of liked it. 

1211
01:13:52,654 --> 01:13:56,340
Look, Stephanie,
this isn't working. 

1212
01:13:56,342 --> 01:13:57,473
What isn't working?

1213
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,476
This. Us. 

1214
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:00,743
You and me. 

1215
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:03,430
Are you breaking up with me?

1216
01:14:03,432 --> 01:14:05,365
'Cause it sounds like
you're breaking up with me. 

1217
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:08,568
No, I mean, it wasn't...
It's just... it's not... 

1218
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:09,953
Did my dad put you up to this?

1219
01:14:09,955 --> 01:14:12,572
Jetski? Are you kidding me?
He can never know. 

1220
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:13,690
Why not?

1221
01:14:13,692 --> 01:14:15,759
It just wouldn't... 

1222
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:18,362
I don't think your dad
would understand. 

1223
01:14:18,364 --> 01:14:20,980
Look, I like you. I do. 

1224
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:24,117
You're fun, and... 

1225
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:25,452
And what?

1226
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:28,271
Stephanie, it was
a mistake, an oversight. 

1227
01:14:28,273 --> 01:14:29,756
We had sex. 

1228
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:32,391
Two fancy animals
doing what animals do. 

1229
01:14:32,393 --> 01:14:33,976
An act of nature. 

1230
01:14:33,978 --> 01:14:35,811
I think... 

1231
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:39,298
We should end the relationship
before the emotions get tangled. 

1232
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:43,136
Your emotions
are getting tangled?

1233
01:14:43,138 --> 01:14:45,271
Well, yeah, kind of. 

1234
01:14:46,974 --> 01:14:49,743
And when you see me, you can't
control the animal in you?

1235
01:14:51,896 --> 01:14:54,064
Something like that. 

1236
01:14:54,066 --> 01:14:55,198
It's okay. 

1237
01:14:58,469 --> 01:15:02,588
You know, you remind me
of this puppy I once had. 

1238
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,042
He'd always whine for me
when I left

1239
01:15:05,044 --> 01:15:08,077
and hump my leg
when I came home, but... 

1240
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:10,413
I always loved him

1241
01:15:10,415 --> 01:15:12,349
until he got ran over by a car. 

1242
01:15:14,268 --> 01:15:16,753
I don't think you're
understanding what I'm saying. 

1243
01:15:16,755 --> 01:15:18,221
Oh, no. I understand. 

1244
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:23,560
You took your map down. 

1245
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:26,179
Yeah, I just... It was time. 

1246
01:15:31,769 --> 01:15:33,803
Do you remember that
first time we met?

1247
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,524
Do you remember
the way I kissed you?

1248
01:15:37,526 --> 01:15:39,476
Do you remember
what we did after?

1249
01:15:41,446 --> 01:15:43,129
How can I forget?

1250
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,532
The sex. 

1251
01:15:46,968 --> 01:15:49,002
I feel like... 

1252
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:51,838
One of those
chocolate Easter Rabbits. 

1253
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,939
All hollow inside. 

1254
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,294
It's all part of
growing up, I guess. 

1255
01:16:01,732 --> 01:16:05,234
"Just two fancy animals
doing what they do. "

1256
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:10,206
Well. What doesn't kill you... 

1257
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:11,725
... only makes you stronger. 

1258
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:26,222
Nice knowing you, Professor. 

1259
01:17:06,313 --> 01:17:09,249
Keep the change,
and pop the trunk. 

1260
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:11,350
Thanks. Have a safe trip. 

1261
01:17:11,352 --> 01:17:12,886
Since when do you take cabs?

1262
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:16,623
I don't talk to strangers. 

1263
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:19,543
N. J. , come on. 

1264
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:20,877
Let me help. 

1265
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:29,419
Don't expect a tip, man. 

1266
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:32,322
So you're really going out to
the Wild West to herd buffalo?

1267
01:17:32,324 --> 01:17:34,424
Buffali, man, I told you. 

1268
01:17:34,426 --> 01:17:36,342
- Sorry, I forgot.
- Forgot?

1269
01:17:36,344 --> 01:17:38,010
How 'bout not believed?

1270
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:40,513
I believed. 

1271
01:17:40,515 --> 01:17:41,981
Come on, let me buy you a beer. 

1272
01:17:41,983 --> 01:17:43,616
Let's not leave on a bad note. 

1273
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,104
Okay, give me a minute. 

1274
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,744
Uh... 

1275
01:17:54,746 --> 01:17:56,346
I got it. 

1276
01:17:57,781 --> 01:17:59,916
Keep the change. 

1277
01:17:59,918 --> 01:18:01,934
Where the hell
did you get that?

1278
01:18:01,936 --> 01:18:05,405
Hattie's dad. Little
walking-around money. 

1279
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:06,739
Here. 

1280
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,011
Five hundred bucks?

1281
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:16,182
You have been keeping
a tab, huh?

1282
01:18:19,586 --> 01:18:20,754
Eight hundred dollars. 

1283
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:22,172
Don't get greedy on me, man. 

1284
01:18:22,174 --> 01:18:24,123
There's no way
I owe you more than that. 

1285
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,976
- This is all real?
- What's real is real, man. 

1286
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:32,749
So the guy who was always broke

1287
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,584
is now a member of
some big money cult. 

1288
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,052
Cartel, not cult. 

1289
01:18:36,054 --> 01:18:37,387
And not broke, just frugal. 

1290
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:42,125
It's real. I already told
you what the initiation is. 

1291
01:18:42,127 --> 01:18:44,461
I gotta prompt a coup in
some third-world country. 

1292
01:18:44,463 --> 01:18:46,529
If you can't pull it off?

1293
01:18:46,531 --> 01:18:49,265
Style counts for a lot. 

1294
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:52,235
A guy can get in
strictly on style. 

1295
01:18:52,237 --> 01:18:54,087
Guy's going for
initiation tonight. 

1296
01:18:54,089 --> 01:18:56,539
Knocking over Zambia.
Hattie will tell you. 

1297
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:58,324
Yeah, when do I get
to meet this Hattie?

1298
01:18:58,326 --> 01:19:00,326
You been sending her
checks every month, 

1299
01:19:00,328 --> 01:19:02,111
or at least your dad has.
She owns your building. 

1300
01:19:02,113 --> 01:19:03,579
She owns my building?

1301
01:19:03,581 --> 01:19:05,381
That and about
50 others in the city. 

1302
01:19:05,383 --> 01:19:08,317
Her family's got the kind of
money that other money stops... 

1303
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:09,919
And stares at. 

1304
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:14,791
I'm calling you out, Bliss!

1305
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:16,292
- Isn't that Jetski?
- Yep. 

1306
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,511
- He's calling you out, man.
- Thanks. I heard. 

1307
01:19:20,582 --> 01:19:22,648
I got a score
to settle with you!

1308
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,016
You gonna need help on this?

1309
01:19:24,018 --> 01:19:26,102
I don't think so. 

1310
01:19:26,104 --> 01:19:28,521
Got your number,
I'm gonna punch your ticket!

1311
01:19:28,523 --> 01:19:30,072
You sure? He seems
pretty pissed, 

1312
01:19:30,074 --> 01:19:31,741
but then again
I'd be pissed too

1313
01:19:31,743 --> 01:19:33,593
if you were screwing
my 15-year-old daughter. 

1314
01:19:33,595 --> 01:19:34,810
Eighteen. 

1315
01:19:35,913 --> 01:19:38,414
Hey, Bliss... 

1316
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,950
Dude, you coming out, or am I
gonna have to drag you out?

1317
01:19:46,423 --> 01:19:48,591
Thank you. 

1318
01:19:48,593 --> 01:19:50,226
One thing I learned
in Calcutta, 

1319
01:19:50,228 --> 01:19:52,896
if he takes a swing at
you, lean into the punch. 

1320
01:19:52,898 --> 01:19:55,297
When have you ever
been to Calcutta?

1321
01:19:58,468 --> 01:20:00,036
She told me everything, man. 

1322
01:20:01,772 --> 01:20:03,489
She told me all about
the two of you. 

1323
01:20:05,442 --> 01:20:07,793
You betrayed me, Bliss. 

1324
01:20:07,795 --> 01:20:11,431
A fellow Bloody Eagle,
and you betray me?

1325
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:12,898
You know what... ? 

1326
01:20:14,034 --> 01:20:15,768
She doesn't love you, Bliss. 

1327
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:19,171
Read it and weep, fellow Eagle. 

1328
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,780
Okay. 

1329
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,934
Excuse me? "Okay"? Okay what?

1330
01:20:31,936 --> 01:20:33,602
What's okay?! Just... just okay. 

1331
01:20:33,604 --> 01:20:35,938
You. Us. Stephanie. 

1332
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:39,325
Do not. Say. Her name. 

1333
01:20:39,327 --> 01:20:42,161
- I just meant...
- Don't try taking my daughter from me. 

1334
01:20:42,163 --> 01:20:44,630
- I haven't taken anything.
- You took her virginity, man. 

1335
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:46,065
I didn't take that. 

1336
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:51,587
Oh, okay. Okay,
you're calling her... 

1337
01:20:51,589 --> 01:20:53,989
I'm not calling her anything.
All I'm saying... 

1338
01:20:57,327 --> 01:20:58,994
Don't take her from me, Bliss.
You hear me?

1339
01:20:58,996 --> 01:21:00,296
Do not take my
daughter from me. 

1340
01:21:00,298 --> 01:21:02,198
Do not take my daughter
from me, Bliss. 

1341
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,666
Do not take her. 

1342
01:21:03,668 --> 01:21:06,269
- Stephen, I'm...
- Shut up!

1343
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:09,105
And stay away from
my family, man. 

1344
01:21:12,459 --> 01:21:14,126
Bloody Eagles!

1345
01:21:19,933 --> 01:21:21,267
That was weird, man. 

1346
01:21:24,121 --> 01:21:26,072
You got something on your face. 

1347
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:28,625
No. The other side. 

1348
01:21:34,297 --> 01:21:35,632
I'm bleeding. 

1349
01:21:35,634 --> 01:21:38,518
Why didn't you lean into
it, like I told you?

1350
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:43,673
Morris, this is Hattie.
Hattie, this is... 

1351
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,313
... Morris. 

1352
01:21:52,983 --> 01:21:55,050
Oh, your face is bleeding. 

1353
01:21:55,052 --> 01:21:57,687
Have we met

1354
01:21:57,689 --> 01:21:59,389
before?

1355
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:01,791
You... live in my building. 

1356
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:03,259
She owns your building, man. 

1357
01:22:03,261 --> 01:22:04,727
I own some things, 

1358
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:06,729
but my family,
they own other things. 

1359
01:22:06,731 --> 01:22:08,715
I know you, though. 

1360
01:22:08,717 --> 01:22:10,099
No, you don't. 

1361
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:11,834
Your face is still
bleeding, by the way. 

1362
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,605
Saturday, the construction
site, is how I know you. 

1363
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:21,360
I think you must have
gotten hit really hard. 

1364
01:22:21,362 --> 01:22:25,331
You've got me confused
with somebody else. 

1365
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:28,634
Yeah, you don't look
so good, man. 

1366
01:22:28,636 --> 01:22:31,070
Jetski did catch you
pretty bad, huh?

1367
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:32,955
Yeah, you're right. He did. 

1368
01:22:49,456 --> 01:22:52,725
I'll send you
some buffali hide. 

1369
01:22:58,314 --> 01:22:59,582
Keep safe. 

1370
01:22:59,584 --> 01:23:01,667
Yeah, you too. 

1371
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:29,612
Uh... 

1372
01:24:02,312 --> 01:24:05,565
Shit. 

1373
01:24:12,155 --> 01:24:15,508
- Andrea.
- Right. Oh, that looks like it hurt. 

1374
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:17,293
Listen, um... 

1375
01:24:17,295 --> 01:24:19,178
I was talking to
Georgie last night, 

1376
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:22,131
and... I told him everything. 

1377
01:24:22,133 --> 01:24:24,100
- Everything?
- Right. 

1378
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:26,519
And he was upset about it,
but I explained everything, 

1379
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:29,655
and he has something
he wants to tell you, so... 

1380
01:24:31,141 --> 01:24:32,274
George. 

1381
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,962
Like she said, I was pissed, 

1382
01:24:35,964 --> 01:24:38,047
and when I'm pissed,
I usually hit things. 

1383
01:24:38,049 --> 01:24:39,248
Look, George, I... 

1384
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,066
I'm talkin' here. 

1385
01:24:40,068 --> 01:24:42,118
Sorry. 

1386
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:45,454
Like I was sayin',
I was pissed, 

1387
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:49,125
but Angie explained it
all to me, and I wanted to... 

1388
01:24:51,978 --> 01:24:53,312
go ahead. 

1389
01:24:56,817 --> 01:25:00,053
I want to say... Thank you. 

1390
01:25:00,055 --> 01:25:02,288
You're welcome. 

1391
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:05,257
Good boy, Georgie. 

1392
01:25:06,593 --> 01:25:10,179
So, I-I was
explaining to Georgie

1393
01:25:10,181 --> 01:25:12,681
that I was telling you how I
was feeling unappreciated

1394
01:25:12,683 --> 01:25:16,269
and how you... 

1395
01:25:16,271 --> 01:25:20,439
encouraged me to...
express myself to him. 

1396
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:21,991
Right?

1397
01:25:21,993 --> 01:25:23,860
I certainly appreciated
it last night!

1398
01:25:23,862 --> 01:25:26,128
Just... stop!

1399
01:25:29,183 --> 01:25:32,434
I just wanted to say
thank you as well, 

1400
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:34,269
for listening... 

1401
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:35,738
And talking. 

1402
01:25:37,509 --> 01:25:38,907
Any time. 

1403
01:25:38,909 --> 01:25:41,527
Anyway, we've got
to run, right?

1404
01:26:01,398 --> 01:26:02,732
And a paper too. 

1405
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:11,407
This place is huge. 

1406
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,783
N. J. ! 

1407
01:26:24,587 --> 01:26:27,757
Ouch. Jetski did punch
your ticket, huh?

1408
01:26:27,759 --> 01:26:30,393
Fancy animals, right?

1409
01:26:30,395 --> 01:26:32,678
Well, at least your
face stopped bleeding. 

1410
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,913
Yeah, it did. 

1411
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:38,484
So this is it. 

1412
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:39,602
This is it. 

1413
01:26:42,205 --> 01:26:43,990
Hey, how's Mr. Charlie's?

1414
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:46,358
I don't know.
I went to the supermarket. 

1415
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,777
Hey. 

1416
01:26:47,779 --> 01:26:50,679
That first time we met, 

1417
01:26:50,681 --> 01:26:54,417
you were the rock.
I was Mark Spitz. 

1418
01:26:54,419 --> 01:26:56,068
Didn't I save you?

1419
01:26:57,637 --> 01:26:59,755
One thing I learned
in prison in Haiti, man... 

1420
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:00,756
Oh. 

1421
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:02,258
... keeping 100% true to a tale

1422
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,725
isn't what's important. 

1423
01:27:03,727 --> 01:27:05,727
What's important is the story, 

1424
01:27:05,729 --> 01:27:08,080
the moral, whether it
lingers and lives on

1425
01:27:08,082 --> 01:27:09,582
after it's been told. 

1426
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:12,234
That, man,
that's what's important. 

1427
01:27:12,236 --> 01:27:13,569
Yeah, it's important. 

1428
01:27:14,972 --> 01:27:16,472
Page 12. 

1429
01:27:16,474 --> 01:27:18,558
Huh?

1430
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,276
Page 12. 

1431
01:27:20,278 --> 01:27:21,944
Boom!

1432
01:27:25,999 --> 01:27:27,516
Giddyap. 

1433
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:38,161
Son of a bitch. 

1434
01:27:54,594 --> 01:27:57,430
Happy Birthday, dad. 

1435
01:27:57,432 --> 01:27:59,899
What the hell happened to you?

1436
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:02,235
I made a choice. 

1437
01:28:02,237 --> 01:28:04,186
Bad choice. 

1438
01:28:06,023 --> 01:28:07,756
You remembered. 

1439
01:28:12,896 --> 01:28:15,748
And... you finally
got the groceries. 

1440
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:17,984
Some things take time. 

1441
01:28:25,492 --> 01:28:27,376
Aren't you gonna open it?

1442
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:31,264
Sure. 

1443
01:28:59,108 --> 01:29:00,776
Oh, my God. 

1444
01:29:04,564 --> 01:29:06,232
Where did you find it?

1445
01:29:06,234 --> 01:29:08,251
You like it?

1446
01:29:08,253 --> 01:29:12,021
Your mother and I used to
listen to this all the time. 

1447
01:29:12,023 --> 01:29:14,490
I can't believe you remembered. 

1448
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:24,816
You okay, dad?

1449
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:29,921
Yeah. 

1450
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:33,926
I'm fine. 

1451
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:59,535
You, uh, you might be
interested in that. 

1452
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:03,906
It's your mother's. 

1453
01:30:06,476 --> 01:30:10,646
Letters I wrote to her
and she wrote to me, 

1454
01:30:10,648 --> 01:30:12,581
and pictures. 

1455
01:30:23,309 --> 01:30:24,643
I was, uh... 

1456
01:30:26,646 --> 01:30:29,347
I was about your age
when she died. 

1457
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,709
I'm... 

1458
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,079
I'm sorry. I... 

1459
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,716
I never really... 

1460
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:57,326
Your mother's death must
have been very hard on you. 

1461
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:59,962
You were... you were
just a child. 

1462
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:02,815
I was 14. 

1463
01:31:05,618 --> 01:31:07,787
I understood. 

1464
01:31:27,274 --> 01:31:29,274
Oh. 

1465
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:31,310
This was, uh... 

1466
01:31:31,312 --> 01:31:33,862
This was her last
hurrah, so to speak. 

1467
01:31:35,298 --> 01:31:37,600
Trip to her homeland. 

1468
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:42,821
Who's that in
the picture with mom?

1469
01:31:42,823 --> 01:31:45,474
Oh, it's your aunt Kristina. 

1470
01:31:45,476 --> 01:31:47,076
Whatever happened to her?

1471
01:31:47,078 --> 01:31:49,644
She got married, 

1472
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:51,347
had a kid, and... 

1473
01:31:51,349 --> 01:31:53,315
Went back to Greece. 

1474
01:31:55,152 --> 01:31:57,102
Do you have her number?

1475
01:32:42,466 --> 01:32:43,482
Thanks. 

1476
01:32:49,722 --> 01:32:51,056
I'm going. 

1477
01:32:56,479 --> 01:32:58,814
Got everything?

1478
01:32:58,816 --> 01:32:59,948
Think so. 

1479
01:33:01,968 --> 01:33:04,219
You need anything before I go?

1480
01:33:05,605 --> 01:33:07,606
I'm good. 

1481
01:33:09,275 --> 01:33:11,127
Okay, then. 

1482
01:33:11,129 --> 01:33:12,161
Okay. 

1483
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,748
Oh, Morris. 

1484
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:20,085
Have you seen my keys?
