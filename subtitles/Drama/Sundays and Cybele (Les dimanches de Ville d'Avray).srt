00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,635
This movie received two awards at the
Venice Film Festival in 1962

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,374
The Special Jury Award and the
Maschere Award

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,955
SUNDAYS AND CYBÈLE

4
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,633
Let go of me, please!

5
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,071
I don't want to go there!
Take me back to Granny. I'll be good.

6
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,952
That'll do now, be quiet.
Will you?

7
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,151
I don't want to go there!

8
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,276
Come along.
Are you going to come along?

9
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,035
Excuse me, sir, can you direct me
to the Convent of St. Margaret?

10
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,389
Yes, St. Margaret's School...
Don't you know where it is?

11
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,400
No... This is the Ville d'Avray.

12
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,910
Certainly, I know that!
But it's at Ville d'Avray.

13
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,075
Come, we'll ask someone
from round here.

14
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,748
No, Papa, I don't want to go there.

15
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,439
Now listen, I've already
explained to you. It's very nice.

16
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,518
You're going to have little friends. And
then everyone will be kind to you there.

17
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,757
And then on Sunday I'll come and
see you, and then if you're very good...

18
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,670
...at Christmas I'll give you a very
nice present, you know that doll...

19
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,509
- Why is she crying?
- It's nothing, it will pass.

20
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,994
She mustn't cry.

21
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,316
Excuse me, sir,
I know what I have to do.

22
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,670
Come along now, that's enough!

23
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,198
She mustn't cry.

24
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,432
Sir!

25
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,228
Take one.

26
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,472
Take one of them.

27
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,109
It's the piece of a star.

28
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,470
It fell from the sky.

29
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,432
No, thanks.

30
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,358
I can't.

31
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,710
But it was just a joke.

32
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,628
It's water.

33
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,436
Only water.

34
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,200
Excuse me, sir. Come.

35
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,957
Is she the little new girl?
You're bringing her very late, sir.

36
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,789
- Forgive me, Sister, I couldn't...
- Are you a relation of the child?

37
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,197
I'm her father.

38
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,232
Come, my child.
I'll take you to our Mother Superior.

39
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,317
You heard?

40
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,753
Come, my child. It's very late.

41
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,038
You'll come back, won't you?

42
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,435
You'll come back on Sunday?

43
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,395
Above all, be good.
You're a big girl now.

44
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,559
Goodbye, Sister.

45
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,752
Slam the gate, it's very heavy.

46
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,399
Hey. Sir.

47
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,318
Sir!

48
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,280
Why, I thought you had gone.

49
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,672
Did you see a man who was running?

50
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,518
When? Here, just now?
A fellow in a raincoat?

51
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,917
Another nut case was taking his ticket
when the train's just leaving.

52
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,235
"You'll wait for the next," I tell him.

53
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,158
"Out of the question, out of the
question! My plane goes in an hour.

54
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,794
I can't miss it, if I miss it,
it will be terrible, terrible. "

55
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,035
Second platform.

56
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,595
And he thrusts his ticket
under my nose.

57
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,030
"It's okay today, but I won't
let you do this next time. "

58
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,470
"No danger of that,
I'm leaving forever," he says to me.

59
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,511
Forever?

60
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,834
But, in fact... Do you know him?

61
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,993
He has gone... forever.

62
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,673
Ruined...
What does that mean, a ruined life?

63
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,512
A life in which one hasn't done
what one wanted to...

64
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,310
...in which one has had bad luck.

65
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,030
A life like mine.

66
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,272
Pierre.

67
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,476
Why do you say that?

68
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,555
Aren't you happy with me?

69
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,438
I'm nothing.

70
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,232
I'm nothing anymore.

71
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,477
Pierre, you're not being reasonable!

72
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,477
Listen...

73
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,874
Only a year ago you couldn't even
go out alone in the street.

74
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,117
You were still having
those horrible headaches.

75
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,555
Now you're a man again.

76
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,834
- My man!
- Now! I walk about, I wait.

77
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,951
I walk about and I wait!

78
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,958
And my memory doesn't come back.

79
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,633
Fortunately, there are the trees.

80
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,753
In the evenings, I go to the station...

81
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,951
...and I wait for you.

82
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,428
I'm unhappy, Madeleine.

83
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,435
I still don't know who I am.

84
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,352
And you...

85
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,915
...perhaps you know.

86
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,236
- And you don't want to tell me.
- Pierre, darling, don't be unkind.

87
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,471
You know quite well
you shouldn't look backwards.

88
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,310
- You know the doctor told you so.
- The doctor.

89
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,149
- The doctor's not inside my head!
- Pierre.

90
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,877
What happened today?

91
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,471
Nothing, nothing.
I was at the station and then...

92
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,352
That's all.

93
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,877
Quite sure?

94
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,912
Ask the guard. He'll tell you.

95
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,751
I believe you.

96
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,832
You'd better get undressed now,
my darling.

97
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,835
Do you still love me a bit?

98
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,758
Yes.

99
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,599
Are you going to Carlos'?

100
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,314
Yes. We've started on the cage
for the birds.

101
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,112
Another Sunday
I'm going to spend without you.

102
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,436
To think it's going on for six weeks.

103
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,995
Do you remember
how we used to go for walks?

104
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,395
But after Christmas
I'll be free every Sunday.

105
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,830
Won't that be marvellous?

106
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,233
Would you like a little more?
Because there's some left.

107
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,874
No, thanks, Carmela, this is fine.

108
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,229
How is Madeleine?

109
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,314
You can tell her
she is becoming quite a stranger.

110
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,478
Why, Pierre...

111
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,194
...look what I've found for the aviary.

112
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,238
Don't, Carmela!
Let us listen, can't you?

113
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,513
- You must listen very hard to this!
- You weren't even listening!

114
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,349
We were listening!
We were listening without seeming to.

115
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,234
We were listening,
but you'll never understand.

116
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,034
And, anyway, I don't mind.
I know it by heart.

117
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,310
No, be quiet!

118
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,959
Now it's the end of the ceremony.

119
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,639
They have encircled the universe.

120
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,911
It's in Tibet.

121
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,958
Well? You feel the "Forces. "

122
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,315
Suppose you heard that at night?

123
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,993
But come to think of it, you must
have heard things like that, before.

124
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,236
Does it remind you of anything?

125
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,116
No, nothing.

126
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,396
But I like it.

127
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,398
Help me.

128
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,434
Well, look, you put a wire here.
You pull.

129
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,956
And so on, right to the top.

130
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,116
Like that, it's quite steady.

131
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,317
There, pass me the pliers.

132
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,910
Yes, it's lovely.

133
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,116
Go along, Pierre, go for a walk.

134
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,788
Come back tomorrow
and we'll carry on.

135
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,479
But no going to the station again, eh?

136
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,398
Because your past
is not going to come back by train.

137
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,870
No. Look at the trees.

138
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,799
People hide themselves
behind their faces. They wear masks.

139
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,230
And you believe in them.

140
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,351
And then, you don't know
where you are anymore.

141
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,549
Goodbye, Pierre.

142
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,911
Say hello to Madeleine, and tell her
to come and see us a little more often.

143
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,075
Goodbye.

144
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,034
A tree is different. If you take time,
you can understand everything.

145
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,959
Trees... Yes. They help.

146
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,073
But if I look up for too long,
I feel bad.

147
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,713
- I get...
- Vertigo.

148
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,833
I'll tell you something. The day you
stop having vertigo, you'll be cured.

149
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,871
You must get used to it gradually.

150
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,158
It's the same with water.

151
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,835
If I look too long...

152
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,431
...I feel as if I were falling in
and I feel ill.

153
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,834
Don't be afraid, go on,
make yourself do it.

154
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,991
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go in, this is heavy!

155
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,715
- Delivering at this hour!
- I deliver when I can, Sister!

156
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,195
My driver is ill
and I have to do his work.

157
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,358
At 57. And with a weak heart
since Verdun!

158
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,597
- And you. What do you want?
- I came to fetch the little girl.

159
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,313
What?

160
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,873
I came to fetch the child,
over there.

161
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,152
- What have I done to deserve this?
- Go to confession, you may find out.

162
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,510
Then you're the father of the new girl?
I couldn't guess it.

163
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,075
You must come earlier next time!

164
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,351
Come here, child!
Someone's come to fetch you.

165
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,391
You've come to fetch me?

166
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,750
You recognise me?

167
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,596
But where is my father?

168
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,518
Are we going to meet him?

169
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,119
Yes, he sent me.

170
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,118
No later than 7 p. m.
Otherwise no more permission.

171
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,038
Those are the rules.

172
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,877
It doesn't surprise me that my father
asked you to take me out.

173
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,877
At my grandmother's
when he was supposed to do it...

174
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,672
...he was always putting it off.

175
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,236
My grandmother had only one idea,
to get rid of me.

176
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,670
When one thinks of it,
I really have no luck.

177
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,792
My mother ran away with a conjurer.

178
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,195
Perhaps because my father
never wanted to marry her.

179
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,470
And, in all,
I've seen my father three times.

180
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,433
All that isn't much fun... Is it?

181
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,358
Weren't you surprised when
Sister Opportune called me Françoise?

182
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,993
No. Why?

183
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,839
You know quite well
my real name's not Françoise.

184
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,996
My father did tell you my real name?

185
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,758
No.

186
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,035
The nuns made a great fuss
about my first name.

187
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,593
It's not Christian.

188
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,711
So they decided
to call me Françoise.

189
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,514
I don't mind that, you know.

190
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,392
- Tell me it.
- Guess.

191
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,875
It's very ancient,
because my grandmother is Greek...

192
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,308
...and it's after her.

193
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,158
Well, have you given
your tongue to the cat?

194
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,998
- What?
- You don't know?

195
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,795
- Yet it's very lovely.
- Tell me it, I'd like to know it.

196
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,956
No! That would be too easy. Look!

197
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,038
I'll tell you, if you'll get me
the cock from the steeple.

198
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,875
Don't you think it's very beautiful?

199
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,797
The other Sunday I had the feeling
I had seen you before.

200
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,074
And I thought that maybe you...
You could help me.

201
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,913
He has deserted me. I felt it coming.

202
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,629
The other day, on the train,
he was sad.

203
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,237
He talked of a journey
he was going to make.

204
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,356
When I asked him when,
he didn't answer.

205
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,519
I said to myself, this is it.

206
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,915
I'm going to find myself
all alone again.

207
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,359
I've dreaded it for a long time.

208
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,233
When you came to fetch me for him...

209
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,670
...I was glad.

210
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,396
Then time went by.

211
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,479
Just from the way you looked,
I saw you had something bad to tell me.

212
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,389
And that was it. I am left all alone!

213
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,517
And where has he gone?

214
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,631
I don't know.

215
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,789
He explains in a letter...

216
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,117
...that your grandmother
can't keep you any longer.

217
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,159
And that he has got to go away.

218
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,988
His life is ruined.

219
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,195
The letter is in there.

220
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,038
But when you came to fetch me,
what did you tell Sister Opportune?

221
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,673
Nothing.

222
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,952
She thought that I was your father.

223
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,754
She took you for my father?

224
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,516
All the same, it's very wrong
to have lied to me as you did!

225
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,278
You realise that for two hours...

226
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,596
...you've done nothing
but tell me stories!

227
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,033
No! It's true I wanted to know you.
So that you'd help me.

228
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,592
But...

229
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,790
It has come to nothing.

230
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,790
Well, it's too bad.

231
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,478
What should I tell the nuns?

232
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,957
Whatever you like,
it doesn't matter now.

233
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,957
I'll take you back.

234
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,998
What's going to become of me?

235
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,599
My grandmother
doesn't want me anymore.

236
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,950
My mother has already
abandoned me.

237
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,754
So I wonder
what's going to become of me.

238
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,596
Let me stay with you!
I don't want to go to the Council home.

239
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,749
- But I can't.
- Let me stay with you! I'll be good!

240
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,270
If I'm sent to the orphanage,
I won't have anyone anymore!

241
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,751
Will you let me stay?

242
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,636
But why can't you? Why?

243
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,990
My grandmother told me that if
my father didn't bother more with me...

244
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,634
...I'd be put in a Council Orphanage!

245
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,752
Be quiet.

246
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,838
Be quiet.

247
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,956
May I stay?

248
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,150
I've explained to you.

249
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,430
I'm no good for anything anymore.

250
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,428
You managed to take me out
this afternoon!

251
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,634
Yes, but if Madeleine knew,
it couldn't be done again.

252
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,549
Madeleine? Does she live here?

253
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,313
But why wouldn't she like it?
Because she is jealous?

254
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,192
Perhaps.

255
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,031
She loves you?

256
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,033
Yes.

257
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,958
And you?

258
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,317
But as you aren't married,
she hasn't the right to be jealous.

259
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
What if we don't tell her anything?

260
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,676
Then it should be possible...

261
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,872
...not to keep me here with you,
but to take me out on Sundays.

262
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,479
On Sundays?

263
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,716
Yes. Is she here other Sundays?

264
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,309
Not at present. She is on duty.

265
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,795
Then, listen, it's not difficult!

266
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,797
I agree to go back to the nuns.

267
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,275
I should have preferred not,
but it can't be helped.

268
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,917
And we'll keep everything a secret
from them and from Madeleine too.

269
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,032
Everyone will believe
that you're my father.

270
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,430
You'll see, it will be great fun.

271
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,678
I'll be nice
and I'll love you very much.

272
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,950
Don't leave me!

273
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,396
I'll come and fetch you.

274
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,395
You won't desert me?

275
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,751
Swear it on my head.

276
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,552
How?

277
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,793
Well, you put your hand on my head,
you say, "I swear it. "

278
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,309
And if you're lying, I die.

279
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,277
I swear it!

280
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,991
Daddy!

281
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,198
- Hello, Daddy.
- Sir.

282
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,437
Monsieur! Bring her back
at 7:00! Not later.

283
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,438
Leave the gates open, please.

284
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,835
You know, I called you Daddy
because of the nuns.

285
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,315
Yes, I quite understood!

286
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,430
Pierre, look!

287
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,156
Look at the circles!

288
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
There, we're in our own home.

289
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,234
We've entered the circle.

290
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,153
Come on!

291
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,359
Oh, look. Sir Magician, do you give me
that tree over there?

292
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,550
Pierre! What's the matter?

293
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,716
Vertigo.

294
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,076
Vertigo?

295
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,357
It's the water.

296
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,676
There are times...

297
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,317
It's as if I were at a great height
and I was falling.

298
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,192
It's a good thing
that you don't repair houses.

299
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,879
You'd be falling all the time!

300
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,390
One can only fall once.
Afterwards one is dead.

301
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,118
That depends. You fell,
and what's more, in an aeroplane!

302
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,438
Father is dead.

303
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,359
- What?
- My father is dead.

304
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,549
No...

305
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,877
He is, I tell you! That's how it is.
He's dead.

306
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,196
He won't come back ever again?
Isn't that true? Right.

307
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,356
So...

308
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,835
And I have even decided
that he was buried.

309
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,759
And that you are going
to show me his grave.

310
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,679
Come on, show me
where the body has been put.

311
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,634
Where? Here?

312
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,671
Tell me where.

313
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,314
There?

314
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,919
Yes.

315
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,116
Thank you, God.

316
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,158
In place of my father...

317
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,148
...you have given me a Pierre,
who is very much nicer!

318
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,277
Pierre, how old are you?

319
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,993
Probably 30.

320
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,033
Thirty and I'm 12, well nearly.

321
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,471
So... Twelve, 30.
Thirteen... Thirty-one.

322
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,433
Fourteen... thirty-two.
Fifteen... Thirty-three.

323
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,119
Sixteen, 17...

324
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,709
You'll be 36 when I'll be 18.

325
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,559
Thirty-six is not too old.

326
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,795
Listen. We'll get married when I'm 18.
Will you?

327
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,675
I should like that!
I can cook, you know.

328
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,472
And keep house.

329
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,513
At my grandmother's, it's I who used
to make her crystal ball shine.

330
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,719
Did I tell you my grandmother
was clairvoyant?

331
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,388
I used to polish her magic knife.

332
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,398
Why, there was something unusual.

333
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,990
My grandmother had a very
beautiful knife with an ivory handle.

334
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,835
And do you know what magicians do
in Africa with a knife like that?

335
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,874
They stick it in a tree and they listen
to the spirits talking! Think of that!

336
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,799
Was your grandmother unkind?

337
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,869
No, not really.

338
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,437
She used to say I was a mouth to feed,
but that I was nicer than my mother.

339
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,716
And your mother? You don't
remember anymore, of course.

340
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,395
It's really rather sad.
In fact, you're like a lost child.

341
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,828
Listen. If you had things
to say to your mother...

342
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,032
...you need only tell them to me.
Will you?

343
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,357
If you know how much I love you!

344
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,119
How handsome he is!

345
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,869
- The horse?
- Yes, its rider also!

346
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,073
How I wish he would take me
away on his horse.

347
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,555
With him, I shouldn't be afraid.

348
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,110
Pierre! Wait for me!

349
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,795
- Pierre! Why are you going away?
- I don't like the man on the horse.

350
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,911
Everyone has his own tastes!

351
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,111
And me, don't you like me
anymore now?

352
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,073
It's you who don't want
to stay with me anymore.

353
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,111
Are you crazy?

354
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,470
If you like, I won't ever
go back to the school...

355
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,318
...and I'll stay with you all the time!

356
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,636
I'm your fiancée, aren't I?

357
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,994
We'd better turn back
towards the houses...

358
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,519
...and you can buy me a fizzy drink.

359
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,358
I've no money.

360
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,630
Then we'll have to find
a way to manage.

361
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,149
Because you know,
one can't live without money.

362
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,874
And I'm still too young to earn any.

363
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,834
Oh no, Pierre, wait.

364
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,436
The other evening, it was my father
who didn't want me to take one.

365
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,709
Take them all!

366
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,751
No, thank you.

367
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,473
This one. I love it, it's beautiful.

368
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,671
Tell me, they aren't
bits of stars, are they?

369
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,838
- No.
- Where did you find them?

370
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,554
In the hand of a statue of Carlos'.

371
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,320
I thought them pretty,
so he gave them to me.

372
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,795
Carlos is an artist.

373
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,279
We wouldn't need
to hide from him, I feel sure.

374
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,354
Pierre, look!

375
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,796
- Pierre, what's the matter?
- I don't know.

376
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,069
Nothing.

377
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,759
Nothing?

378
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,833
- Perhaps I'm growing worse.
- Have you a headache?

379
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,759
No, it's something different.

380
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,231
I feel queer.

381
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,592
Since we came out,
I've forgotten to think about... before.

382
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,552
How do you mean?

383
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,913
Other days I keep turning over
in my head... Who was I?

384
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,758
Where do I come from?

385
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,030
What did I used to do?

386
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,118
And here, I'd forgotten
to think about it.

387
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,550
And that frightens me.

388
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,953
When I'm grown up, I'll study medicine,
and I'll make you better.

389
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,159
- Madeleine. Hello.
- Hello.

390
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,590
- By the way, how is Pierre?
- Fine.

391
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,518
One of my friends just got married.

392
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,950
We're having a party Sunday.
Will you and Pierre join us?

393
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,276
I'd like to, but I'm on duty Sunday.

394
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,313
Felicie or Marguerite
could stand in for you.

395
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,511
Good idea, will you fix it up
so I get my Sunday?

396
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,675
Rely on me, it's done.

397
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,749
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

398
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,195
...and of the Holy Spirit,
so be it.

399
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,593
You look like a calendar...

400
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,349
...by Hokusai.

401
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,390
It's jolly good!

402
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,955
You've done a fine job, you know!

403
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,277
Here! While I think of it, take this.

404
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,038
- It's for me?
- Of course.

405
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,232
If I had asked someone else,
I would have had to pay him.

406
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,234
It's wonderful how much better
you seem to me to be lately.

407
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,192
Get along with you now.

408
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,512
<i>It was not chance that we had arranged
to meet at the cemetery that Sunday...</i>

409
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,030
If the Sister Superior had been there,
we would have been sunk!

410
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,834
She is terrible, the Superior!
And curious.

411
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,679
She does nothing but ask questions!

412
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,270
You're such a bungler,
we would have been in a real mess!

413
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,268
In any event, you must fix it
so you never meet her, eh?

414
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,870
Sister Marie des Anges
is quite different. She is kind.

415
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,152
You saw, she was quite shy
because you were there.

416
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,271
I am sure she thought you
very handsome!

417
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,596
- Me?
- Oh, I feel easy.

418
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,438
She saw your eyes!

419
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,039
Why did she ask my address?

420
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,472
Why, that's quite natural
as she believes that you're my father.

421
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,430
That's it, Pierre.
We've entered our house.

422
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,790
I wondered if you were going
to forget our ceremony.

423
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,356
No, with you, I never forget anything.

424
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,072
Hello.

425
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,155
- It's Pierre, Madeleine's friend.
- Do you think it's his daughter?

426
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,469
How's the fishing?

427
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,751
Oh, Pierre, look.

428
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,468
Did you see
what that queer fellow is doing?

429
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,756
He has a nerve, I must say!
That's my tree!

430
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,996
He has no right!

431
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,155
Don't you like my picture?

432
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,873
Yet it's pretty, isn't it?

433
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,954
Besides, I really think
it's a good likeness!

434
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,277
That's not what I mean. It's my tree.

435
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,232
Someone whom I love gave it to me.

436
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,873
And I don't want it
to be taken away from me!

437
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,230
I'm not taking it from you,
I'm drawing it.

438
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,955
It's the same thing!
It's mine, my own!

439
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,197
Children are charming, but cruel.

440
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,712
However, Monsieur, when I see
something beautiful I have to paint it.

441
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,512
It's a need.

442
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,678
Unfortunately, for that, leisure
is necessary and I only have Sunday.

443
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,792
And if, moreover, I were to tell you
that my wife disapproves...

444
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,150
...she doesn't care for my passion.

445
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,430
- What's your name?
- Come, let's have fun.

446
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,473
- Come on, come on!
- Pierre!

447
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,671
And by saying "disapprove," I swear
to you it's much less than the truth.

448
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,111
Yes, Monsieur, that's how it is...

449
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,435
Pierre! Can I go and play
a game of Blindman's Buff?

450
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,631
Just one game! Do you mind?

451
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,956
- Come on, start counting.
- Quick. Come.

452
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,753
Come on, let's get warm.

453
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,118
You are it!

454
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,956
Come on, hide!

455
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,515
Who did, Charles?
Did that big man over there hit you?

456
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,597
Yes.

457
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,071
Why, you great brute,
aren't you ashamed?

458
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,431
Hold on, I'll call my husband.
Fernand! Fernand!

459
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,836
Dirty rotter!

460
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,515
- What is it, Mother? What happened?
- What has happened?

461
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,914
What has happened?
You dare ask me that!

462
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,872
When I could have been attacked,
your son killed...

463
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,559
without you lifting a little finger...

464
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,796
...on the excuse
that you were playing!

465
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,470
Pierre, you are wicked!

466
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,353
It's not done to hit someone
smaller than yourself!

467
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,359
Don't cry. No, don't cry anymore.

468
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,274
It was because he was annoying you.

469
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,791
It's not true!

470
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,597
You don't understand anything at all.
We were playing.

471
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,475
And you, you...

472
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,916
Even my grandmother, who is bad,
she never slapped me.

473
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,829
I'll never do it again. I promise you!

474
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,671
I hope not.

475
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,237
Because otherwise I shan't love you
anymore. And I'll never marry you...

476
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,795
...and you'll remain all alone!

477
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,760
Why do you look at him like that?

478
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,350
I feel sure that he would
never have hit a little boy!

479
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,994
But then he doesn't know you.

480
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,713
Pierre? Could you be jealous?

481
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,790
Would you like to be nice?
Carry me in your arms.

482
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,549
I was just having a dream.
It was Christmas...

483
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,348
There was a big fir tree
with stars and garlands.

484
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,199
I had given you
an extraordinary present.

485
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,915
And you had given me
the cock from the steeple!

486
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,479
And you were carrying me
round the tree in your arms, like now.

487
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,435
And I was looking
at the world upside down.

488
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,949
Like when one is dead.

489
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,074
If you knew how lovely it is
like that, Pierre.

490
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,635
I seemed to be flying.

491
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,671
No, no, don't stop. Go on, go on.

492
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,719
And then we had drunk
glistening champagne.

493
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,798
And I fell asleep in a big bed
next to my Pierre.

494
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,877
With my hand in yours.

495
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,874
Pierre, go on singing!

496
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,272
Madeleine...

497
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,237
Oh, Pierre, you were singing!
You're happy!

498
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,232
You know...

499
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,432
...I've heard you singing
several times now.

500
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,471
Oh, Pierre.

501
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,315
Why do you push me away?

502
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,910
Don't you want me anymore?

503
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,437
Madeleine...

504
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,951
Darling.

505
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,999
I understand, I understand.

506
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,276
I love you, Pierre.

507
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,712
I love you, the rest doesn't matter...

508
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,360
If you want me again...

509
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,114
...your slave will be there.

510
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,592
For the moment
she must make herself beautiful!

511
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,590
I haven't told you yet,
I've a surprise for you.

512
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:40,634
You're going to put on a white shirt,
a tie, your suit...

513
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,675
...and I'm going to put on my vamp's
dress, you know, the one which...

514
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,830
We are invited to a wedding,
to lunch of course!

515
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,190
You remember Bernard?

516
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,073
Thanks to him, I've got my Sunday.

517
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,273
And we are going to lunch at
a restaurant with one of his friends...

518
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,391
...who got married.

519
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,639
They are coming by car
to pick us up.

520
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,597
Are you pleased?

521
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,389
If you knew how happy I am to have
a whole Sunday with you at last!

522
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,553
I want to be very beautiful.

523
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,592
For you.

524
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,274
It's Bernard
who is going to be jealous.

525
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,954
I told you that at the start,
he was making up to me.

526
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,754
Oh, in friendly fashion of course.

527
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,110
But if I had wanted...

528
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,599
There are not many in the hospital
who can boast of having resisted him.

529
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,318
But I've my Pierre, and the rest...

530
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,518
Pierre?

531
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,791
Stop. It's Pierre!
Where's he going like that?

532
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,797
Pierre, hey.

533
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,838
Hey.

534
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,470
- It's the lad who lives with Madeleine.
- Hi, what are you doing here?

535
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,434
He had a plane crash. He was found
half dead in an outlandish village.

536
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,200
Come, come, we'll take you back.

537
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,917
That's how he came to the country
hospital where Madeleine was a nurse.

538
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,116
Madeleine. What's going on?

539
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,915
Bernard! Pierre has gone.

540
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,716
Pierre.

541
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,270
Where were you?

542
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,988
You'll drive me mad.

543
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,428
What got you in such a state?

544
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,949
We met him on the street, on his way
to your friend, the sculptor.

545
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,197
I wanted to tell Carlos
that we were invited.

546
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,597
But why leave like that
without saying anything?

547
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,152
I got into a terrible state.

548
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,079
You can't imagine all I thought!

549
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,269
- Madeleine, you think too much.
- Right.

550
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,393
Well, get dressed quickly and I'll try
to persuade the others to be patient.

551
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,796
We thought you would be ready.

552
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,113
Darling, are you dreaming?

553
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,878
Pierre?

554
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,157
No, I'm watching.

555
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,271
Aren't you hungry anymore?

556
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,917
Come closer to me.

557
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,517
- What time is it?
- Why, are you tired?

558
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,393
Here, Françoise, give me your glass.
Ah, don't drink it all.

559
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,875
To your love life, Monsieur Pierre!

560
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,319
It's here that Corot
used to come to paint.

561
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,149
Corot, his poetic charm,
the light and shade of his woods.

562
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,078
All that, it's here that he got it!

563
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,111
No, you shouldn't
have been a chemist.

564
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,799
What you should have been
is an art critic!

565
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,797
Don't get excited! He read all that
yesterday in the guidebook.

566
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,231
What about it, the guidebook is
an instrument of culture like any other.

567
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,034
Please, what time is it?

568
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,038
You don't drink champagne
like mineral water.

569
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,152
Well, now I'll tell you the story of the
acupuncture and the captive balloon!

570
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,998
Oh no, can't you keep quiet
for five minutes?

571
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,749
You are making a mistake,
it's a scream!

572
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,517
Françoise, I'm going to tell you one.
But it's a story without words.

573
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,554
I need a big spoon and a little one.

574
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:17,310
You accompany me by rubbing
the edge of a glass with a wet finger.

575
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,876
Right. Now try to understand.

576
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,350
<i>That's it, Pierre, we're home.</i>

577
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,710
<i>You know the blue stone
which you gave me? I've still got it.</i>

578
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,754
<i>When they put the light out in
the dormitory, I put it on my bolster...</i>

579
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,996
<i>...and I look at it.</i>

580
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,236
<i>I look at it as hard as my grandmother
looks at her magic ball, and I repeat:</i>

581
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,750
<i>"Pierre. Pierre. "</i>

582
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,030
<i>Until I see you.</i>

583
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,276
<i>Then I talk to you.</i>

584
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,869
<i>One night you kissed me.</i>

585
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,514
<i>And do you know how that was done?</i>

586
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,314
<i>The little blue stone
had rolled on the bolster...</i>

587
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,798
<i>...and had touched my shoulder,
lik e lips.</i>

588
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,310
<i>If I hadn't wok en up at that moment...</i>

589
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,311
<i>...I would never have known
if it were true or not.</i>

590
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,795
<i>You never kiss me.</i>

591
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,713
<i>I love you, Pierre. I love you.</i>

592
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,195
<i>Tak e me away, Pierre.</i>

593
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,512
<i>- Pierre!
- Françoise!</i>

594
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,835
Well, Pierre,
what's the matter with you?

595
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,792
What do you want?

596
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,877
Françoise.

597
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,229
What time is it?

598
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,278
Why? Have you got an appointment?

599
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,632
You ought to give him a watch,
Madeleine, he has no notion of time.

600
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,353
Or else he has too much!

601
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,759
It's not late darling, 4:00.

602
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,275
But if you are tired, we'll go home.

603
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,995
You never kiss me.

604
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,111
Miss!

605
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,390
Miss!

606
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,114
The bill, please.

607
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,474
Pierre, are you coming?
We are leaving.

608
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,631
Look, your face is all wet.

609
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,392
You'll catch cold
and you'll have a headache again.

610
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,798
What's he doing? Where's he going?

611
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,753
I want to go home.

612
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,996
- In a short while.
- At once!

613
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,634
But, Pierre, they want to visit
the fair. We can't refuse now.

614
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,479
- Anyway you'll see, it will be fun.
- No. There is too much noise!

615
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,070
Yes, come... To please me. Well then,
come at least out of courtesy.

616
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,953
During the whole of lunch
you were looking disagreeable.

617
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,798
Be a bit nice now for a change.

618
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,276
Well, are the lovers having a siesta?

619
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,039
I am sure there are among you
intelligent people...

620
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,959
...who are sure
that fate influences life!

621
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,354
Then don't hesitate!

622
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,835
With me you will learn
everything without deception.

623
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,600
The truth...
That is what I am offering you!

624
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,518
My dears, on a day like this,
we must go in.

625
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,119
No, no, out of the question!

626
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,476
Things like that frighten me!

627
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,478
You! Young man!

628
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,750
I read a great future in your face!

629
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,430
Oh, no! No! It's rather the past
which interests him.

630
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,870
I read the past just as well
as I read the future.

631
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,513
Go on in, Pierre,
it's you she has noticed!

632
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,156
Why of course! Second sight
to the rescue of amnesia!

633
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,239
Very funny, thanks.
And intelligent!

634
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,317
- Let's move on, are you coming?
- No, I want to go in.

635
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,999
No, Pierre it's idiotic!
Let's go home.

636
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,395
Madeleine, you are not going
to make a fuss. If he wants to...

637
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,795
...after all we are here
to enjoy ourselves.

638
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,035
Oh no, Madam!

639
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,958
The whole truth
but only to the one concerned.

640
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,435
You must take your turn.

641
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,150
You understand, young man,
daylight is no help to mystery!

642
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,191
Sit down.

643
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,910
The cards are 1500. That all right?

644
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,671
You are the generous one!

645
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,711
Give me your hands.

646
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,990
You have had an accident.

647
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,952
A serious one.

648
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,789
Yes. I see it, very serious.

649
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,037
Look at me. Look into my eyes,
otherwise I see nothing.

650
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,037
There. Good.

651
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,832
Wait.

652
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:51,478
I see... the sun, trees, the sea.

653
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,875
You have travelled.

654
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,992
Clouds... Wait.

655
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,513
You are fighting. I see fire... flames.

656
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,870
You know what I am talking about?

657
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,996
That's the hair of Hindu priestesses.

658
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,430
It's only for decoration.

659
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,998
- And that?
- That...

660
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,718
That's a magician's knife.

661
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,990
It comes from Africa.

662
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,079
You stick it in a tree
and put your ear against the handle.

663
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,192
And you commune with the spirits.

664
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,189
And shall I tell you what,
it's full of fluid!

665
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,430
Would you like to hear about romance?

666
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,756
Give me your hand.

667
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,719
No, not that one, the left.

668
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,314
How very much you are loved!

669
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,717
Wait. I see...

670
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,277
I see...

671
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,951
What did she tell you?

672
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,754
She said I was very much loved.

673
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,548
Bernard, have you your licence?

674
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,077
Serves you right!
Rotten road-hog!

675
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:04,433
Let him go. Let him go!

676
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,318
Clear the track, clear the track,
or I'll call the cops!

677
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,158
Well, children.

678
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,830
Well, your pal's the man for me!
A champion!

679
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,070
It's your fault, all this,
you made him drink.

680
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,919
Well, that's the limit!
It's my fault now!

681
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,588
Anyway, you won't get me again!
As far as I am concerned, loonies...

682
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,594
That'll do! Don't you think
things are bad enough?

683
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,789
Right. We'll carry him up to your place.

684
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,319
He'll be all right, he's strong,
but if you like I'll stay with you.

685
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,957
Thanks, but I don't need anyone
in order to look after him.

686
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,958
My love...

687
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,197
Forgive me, it's my fault.

688
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,956
I'm an idiot.

689
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,670
Excuse me, sir, it's about Françoise.

690
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,995
Come in.

691
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,509
Oh, no, no, it's not worthwhile.

692
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,948
Anyway, I am not alone.

693
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,310
One of our sisters is waiting
for me at the chemist's.

694
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,670
I mustn't be long.

695
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,438
What is it?

696
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,677
It's not serious, don't worry.
This is it.

697
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,474
Françoise is ill... Not really ill.

698
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,753
She's a very sensitive child and
you didn't come to get her on Sunday.

699
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,428
But you were to take her out,
weren't you?

700
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,915
You had promised her to?

701
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,832
That's the cause of the trouble.

702
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,156
She imagines
that you don't love her anymore...

703
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,794
...that her father is going
to desert her.

704
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,996
She's such an excitable child,
so extreme!

705
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,794
And as sick children
have a right to visitors...

706
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,197
...I took the liberty
of coming to fetch you.

707
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,472
Françoise, here is your papa.

708
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,830
I will leave you a minute.

709
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,668
I wanted to come last Sunday.
We were invited to a wedding.

710
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,236
It's not my fault
that I couldn't let you know.

711
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,555
Afterwards it was past 4. Too late.

712
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,948
You remember, the other Sunday?

713
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,880
You had a dream, for Christmas.

714
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,675
The tree, and the stars,
and the decorations.

715
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,276
I am going to do all that.

716
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,149
If you won't look at me, I am going.

717
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,830
No, stay!

718
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,589
Pierre, you deserted me.

719
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,230
- Who was she?
- Madeleine!

720
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,035
- She's your wife then?
- No.

721
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:23,950
Liar. Why did she kiss you like that?
Nice manners!

722
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,238
She certainly deserved
that you beat her...

723
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,271
...but you oughtn't to have done it.

724
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,150
It was awful, Pierre.

725
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,676
You frightened me.

726
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,356
Then you don't love me anymore?

727
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,509
Of course I love you!

728
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,873
What a business! I must say!

729
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,873
You said that you wanted
to do what at Christmas?

730
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,632
Do like in your dream!

731
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,239
Why, you're crazy!

732
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,839
And your wife?
What is she going to say?

733
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,156
She won't know anything.

734
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,751
I've been thinking about it,
and I have got it all worked out.

735
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,517
Have you seen Pierre?

736
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,793
Pierre? Well, he must be at the school.

737
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,230
I saw one of the nuns
on a bicycle stop at your place.

738
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,113
I wanted a kilo of oranges, please.

739
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,117
Tell me, Charles,
what should I give Mme. Madevil?

740
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,949
- Give her some of the Maltese.
- Fine, I'll choose them.

741
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,755
And a little later
he came out almost running.

742
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,428
Perhaps the little girl is ill?

743
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,518
- Little girl?
- I forgot the biscuits.

744
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,712
Please add them to my bill.

745
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,118
Don't get panicky,
it's probably not serious.

746
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,269
No, no, I am tired just now.

747
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,029
He went to see the child.

748
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,273
But he should have left me a note.

749
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,152
Thank you.

750
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,709
What did you say to her?

751
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,310
You remember the pretty little girl
we see on Sunday with him at the pond.

752
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,479
She does look upset.
What's the matter with her?

753
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,590
<i>It's not possible. Oh, Carlos...</i>

754
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,711
<i>He must have made the acquaintance
of a little girl from the school.</i>

755
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,037
<i>He managed to see her
again every Sunday.</i>

756
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,630
<i>That was why he told me
he was with you.</i>

757
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,238
<i>Or he was going to the station
to see the trains. He was lying.</i>

758
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,275
In our neighbourhood
people thought it was his daughter.

759
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,675
They believed I knew all about it.

760
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,238
But it's all very sweet!

761
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,278
No.

762
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,753
If he hid it from me it means trouble.

763
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,670
He's frightened of me.

764
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,475
And to think my only chance...

765
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,319
...was that he should have
absolute confidence in me.

766
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,670
So we could start a real life.

767
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,791
A normal one.

768
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,072
- Did he never speak to you?
- No.

769
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,670
But you are wrong to get excited
about it. It's not serious.

770
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,031
- Pierre loves you.
- No.

771
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,679
No, everything has changed.

772
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,272
To think I fancied
he was better lately.

773
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,993
I even heard him singing once.

774
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,548
Now I understand, Carlos.

775
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,310
Yesterday we went to the fair.

776
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,274
Already in the morning he had gone
out without saying anything to me.

777
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,518
It was to warn her
that he couldn't see her!

778
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,955
Yes, of course!

779
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,794
Now I remember exactly.

780
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,837
When we were on the Dodgem...

781
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,995
It was after having seen a little girl
from the school who was watching us.

782
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,314
Oh, Carlos, I could recognise her.

783
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,508
She had a way of looking at us.

784
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,913
And it was then that Pierre
seemed to become mad.

785
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,080
Hitting me like a brute.

786
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,396
It started a fight.

787
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,236
When he was taken home
he was delirious.

788
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,716
He kept saying the same words as
when he was brought to the hospital.

789
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,911
Half dead.

790
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,919
He was saying in English:
"Is she dead?

791
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,190
Did I kill her?"

792
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,676
No, you mustn't get
everything mixed up!

793
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,632
He's in love!

794
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,717
It's not more complicated than that.

795
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,354
When one is in love,
naturally one has secrets.

796
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,073
Oh, no, you're not going
to call that lies!

797
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,909
Be quiet! In love with a child!
And you consider that normal?

798
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,995
- Me? I consider it marvellous!
- Have you gone crazy?

799
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,310
What about it? What harm do you
think he can do with a little girl?

800
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,795
He's no Bluebeard!

801
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,871
No, listen.
Pierre is like a child himself.

802
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,356
And with the child he has found
a world cut down to size, a world...

803
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,471
...where he is happy.

804
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,475
Shall I tell you what,
I'd like to be in his place!

805
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,398
Oh, you! You've no idea of anything!

806
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,876
Reality isn't necessarily
like in your dreams!

807
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,591
After all, Carlos,
Pierre is no longer a child.

808
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,994
Don't listen to Carmela.

809
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,192
She's a good girl, but in love affairs
she reasons like an evening paper.

810
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,197
Listen to me well, Madeleine...

811
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,710
...I know what I am saying,
and if I say it, it is for your good.

812
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,070
And for Pierre's good too.

813
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,709
Come now,
have you seen Pierre's eyes?

814
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,878
Exactly, I have seen his eyes.
He hasn't normal eyes.

815
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,275
And it's not because he has amnesia
that he has that look.

816
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,075
No doubt he doesn't realise it himself,
but he may be dangerous.

817
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,199
That is the result of the full moon!

818
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,550
When it's the full moon
one woman in three becomes crazy.

819
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,035
And with Carmela it never fails!

820
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,673
Why not say at once
that Pierre is a sadist?

821
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,509
Why hide? If it is normal,
if he hasn't ideas...

822
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,032
And when you were a child,
did you tell your parents everything?

823
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,990
Try to understand him a little instead
of brooding over him like a mother hen.

824
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,031
Come now, Carlos,
it's not the same thing.

825
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,037
Anyway, Madeleine
must warn the nuns.

826
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,470
Why, of course!
And have a real sensation!

827
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,479
No, I'd stake my life that he loves
this child in a very pure way.

828
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,274
He is re-living his childhood,
you understand.

829
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,675
What is needed is for you
to arrange that he tells you himself.

830
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,199
Carlos, if I ask him, he...

831
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,278
Don't ask him. He'll freak out
and it will be pointless.

832
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,074
No. Get back his confidence
first of all.

833
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,955
You must make him feel that it is
not he that has need of you...

834
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,596
...but you who need him.

835
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,995
I am sure that at heart
he would like to talk to you about it.

836
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,079
I'd like to believe you, Carlos.

837
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,154
But I must get the matter cleared up.

838
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,998
Take great care.
Respect him, Madeleine.

839
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,195
You mustn't dirty something beautiful.

840
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,791
<i>You know Sunday...</i>

841
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,670
<i>...I hit you.
I didn't want to do that.</i>

842
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,354
I don't know what happened.

843
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,039
Perhaps it was the noise.

844
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,951
There was so much noise and...

845
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,871
It was the noise.

846
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,751
Yes, of course.

847
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,959
We were silly to take you there.

848
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,477
You know next Monday is Christmas.
I have a day off to take.

849
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,229
And I can choose between Sunday
and Tuesday. Which would you prefer?

850
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,317
Tuesday would be best.

851
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,399
I haven't been to Paris
for a long time.

852
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,396
Go. Go now.

853
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,955
Don't let Carlos wait.

854
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,272
We are home.

855
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,996
Listen.

856
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,480
What can I bring you?

857
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,317
Two warm Grenadines.

858
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,598
Two warm Grenadines?

859
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,437
Yes. No, no.

860
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,553
Two grogs. Yes.
One, two grogs.

861
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,149
Yes, two grogs, please.

862
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,991
Was it like this where you were?

863
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:05,273
No, it wasn't so nice,
but you could see the pond.

864
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,511
Is it true that you said nothing
about us two to your wife?

865
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,033
All the better.
Are your hands still cold?

866
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,390
I'm absolutely frozen!

867
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,193
Will you tell me
your real name one day?

868
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,873
And you, will you give me
the cock from the steeple one day?

869
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,475
Do you think this is a real café?

870
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,352
Why?

871
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,510
There's no one here.

872
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,796
Perhaps it is because it is very dear.

873
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,070
Will you have enough money?

874
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,557
Yes, I think so.

875
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,316
You know, if one day
you didn't come anymore...

876
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,795
...I think I would want to die.

877
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,833
- Die?
- Yes.

878
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,596
To close my eyes.

879
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,393
To become quite cold.

880
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,354
I'd be put in a coffin.

881
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,155
The lid would be nailed down.

882
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,754
On the grave
there would be no name.

883
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,553
Because no one would know
my real name.

884
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,037
Even if they wrote "Françoise"...

885
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,390
...it wouldn't mean anything.

886
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,077
I wouldn't exist anymore... at all.

887
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,629
I will always come.

888
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,039
And if I died, would you die?

889
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,071
Or would you
forget me with your wife?

890
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,356
You would forget me, eh?

891
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,993
Tell me.

892
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,435
Would you die too?

893
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,153
Yes.

894
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,516
Tomorrow is Monday.

895
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,757
But I don't care
because tomorrow is Christmas!

896
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,588
And you made me a promise!

897
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,108
No, Bertrand, really,
don't dazzle people!

898
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,993
Higher, higher!

899
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,316
The good Lord didn't exactly
favour you, my poor Bertrand!

900
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,193
Do you think all this old iron
looks nice on a Christmas Eve?

901
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,992
The cock!

902
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,430
The cock!

903
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,992
Papa!

904
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,359
Papa, Papa!

905
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,313
He's the one who hit me.

906
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,236
But how do you know that it's him?

907
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,954
And who else would do such a thing?

908
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,958
And then he nearly poked out
a neighbour's eye with the tree!

909
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,151
No, the thing that upsets me,
is for my little nephews.

910
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,759
And then the door! Look at it!

911
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,269
There was no need
to break it in like that!

912
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,511
I'm afraid.

913
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,549
Come now, you told me yourself that
you had understood, watching them.

914
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,919
But what's the matter?

915
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,831
Where are you off to?

916
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,077
But where are you going?

917
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,350
I don't know. To look for them!

918
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,629
I'll see to my little nephew...

919
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,671
...and then I'll call you during
the evening. We'll sort it out.

920
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,715
Can I telephone?

921
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,070
- Is it a Paris number?
- Yes.

922
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,629
You haven't a phone booth?

923
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,549
Here, no one has
any secrets from anybody.

924
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,229
<i>Ah, yes, my dear children...</i>

925
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,910
<i>...the loveliest day of the year for
children and grown-ups is Christmas.</i>

926
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,031
<i>Christmas is a celebration...</i>

927
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,037
A white wine.

928
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,598
Dry? House wine?

929
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,231
Dry.

930
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,590
Hello? Bernard?

931
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,313
Bernard, I don't know
what to do anymore.

932
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,796
Pierre hasn't come home.
He must be with the child.

933
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,516
He has taken a big Christmas tree
from Carlos'.

934
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,392
<i>- Excuse me?
- Happiness is a gift we all receive...</i>

935
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,636
No, I don't know.

936
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,555
But he must have gone to fetch her.

937
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,516
Telephoned where?
To the school?

938
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,269
No, suppose he's not with her,
suppose she is...

939
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:11,276
Come here. I'll wait for you, eh?
Be quick!

940
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,192
Hello?

941
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,636
Rue de Sevres.

942
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,434
Oh, yes, wait. What number is this?

943
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,108
Twenty-two, same as for the cops!

944
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:27,074
Twenty-two. How long will you be?

945
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,191
Right, hurry! I'll wait for you.

946
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:34,235
Bernard, he must be found.
Otherwise, I'll be the one to go mad!

947
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,431
<i>- Or play with electric trains.
Christmas:</i>

948
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:40,269
<i>Dolls with eyes that close,
preferably.</i>

949
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,157
<i>My dear children, Christmas is also...</i>

950
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:50,433
- How much do I owe you?
- Ninety-five with the telephone call.

951
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,469
You wouldn't have seen a man
with a Christmas tree?

952
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,830
I'll say, we've seen
a few go past today!

953
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,953
A big tree... All decorated.

954
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,435
What does he look like?

955
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,676
He's tall, blond.

956
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:11,429
With very short hair,
and very light eyes.

957
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,916
You don't mean the Satyr?

958
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,993
- Yes.
- It's a joke.

959
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,953
My wife and I call him that.

960
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,833
Because every Sunday
we see him go past near the lake.

961
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,519
We go there to fish.

962
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:30,271
So, you see, he is always with a kid.
They're like lovers.

963
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,519
In reality, it must be his daughter.
Only, as he looks a bit odd...

964
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,234
...we had christened him the Satyr.
Just a nickname!

965
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:42,594
<i>My dear little friends, never miss,
even if you have grown up...</i>

966
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,995
<i>...your appointment
with Father Christmas!</i>

967
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,154
I say, where did you get
all those big candles?

968
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,588
At church.

969
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,598
- They were given to you?
- Yes.

970
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,951
You really can't lie!

971
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:20,038
I hope no one saw you take them!

972
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,756
Wait, come and see.

973
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,478
Look.

974
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,113
You know, this is going to be
my first real Christmas.

975
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,435
The other times, I was always sent
to bed at 9, like any other evening.

976
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,590
What is it?
Oh, Pierre, you have cut yourself.

977
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,678
- It's broken.
- It doesn't matter, one will do us.

978
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,472
But let me see your finger.

979
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,078
Poor Pierre. You know, in such
cases, it needs to bleed a little.

980
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,038
There, it's over.

981
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:16,391
I know all your thoughts
now that I've drunk your blood.

982
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,593
You're going to
open the champagne?

983
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,836
Good. Well, while you're opening it,
I'll leave you a minute.

984
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,190
Mind you don't turn round!

985
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,797
You know, in such cases,
one should make a wish.

986
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:03,033
I would like to stay with you
forever and ever.

987
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,629
And then, next holidays,
we would go to the sea.

988
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,876
I have never been to the sea.

989
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,275
We would see fish that fly.

990
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,675
You laugh, but it's true, they exist.

991
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,189
There are fish that have wings.

992
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,868
I read that in a book.

993
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,389
How lovely that must be, mustn't it?

994
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,872
We must drink to that,
perhaps it would be best.

995
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,071
Your turn now.

996
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,634
Oh, that's enough.

997
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,354
Don't forget I'm a little girl.

998
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,597
And, anyway, you know, the main
reason I think it's so lovely...

999
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,190
...is because of the bubbles.
- Well, I am thirsty.

1000
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,195
Pierre, look.

1001
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,590
Undo it now.

1002
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,396
Cybèle.

1003
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,112
Do you like it?

1004
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,508
Cybèle.

1005
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:47,269
It's your name, your real name!

1006
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,472
It's lovely.

1007
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,194
<i>It sounds like si belle.
"So lovely!"</i>

1008
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,031
It's my name. It's me.

1009
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,829
It was the name of a goddess.

1010
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:03,199
The goddess of trees and earth.
So I was told.

1011
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,393
It's a very ancient name, you know.

1012
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,237
- What's the matter?
- Nothing...

1013
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,431
...but later on...

1014
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,200
...I'll have a surprise for you too.

1015
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:39,633
- I thought you were never coming!
- You've seen the traffic jams.

1016
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,475
And anyway,
I looked in to warn the police.

1017
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,318
We're going to your place now,
I gave your telephone number.

1018
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,714
- What did you do?
- It was the only thing to do.

1019
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,115
I phoned the school first.
He had already been to fetch the child.

1020
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,799
So I went to see the cops.

1021
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,595
I shouldn't have called you.
It's my fault. You don't understand.

1022
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:58,758
I saw them last Sunday.
They were like two happy children.

1023
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,632
And you, you've gone
and denounced Pierre like a criminal.

1024
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,193
It's possible, but we haven't
the right to take such a risk.

1025
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,118
But what risk?
What are you thinking?

1026
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,469
That he's going to kill her,
that he's going to rape her?

1027
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,795
Pierre is sick,
one can expect the worst.

1028
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,719
It's you who are sick -
you and Carlos' wife.

1029
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,195
All of you
who call yourselves normal!

1030
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,875
When you see somebody being happy
outside of your conventions...

1031
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,071
...then he is not normal
and you reject him. Why?

1032
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,714
Does sincerity embarrass you?

1033
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,956
Even I was getting ideas.

1034
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,590
Right. Listen, we're not going
to start getting sentimental.

1035
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,631
To me, it's simple.
Pierre is in a violent phase.

1036
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,115
Lf, in his subconscious he believes
he killed a little girl before...

1037
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,038
It's you who told me so.

1038
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,839
If he believes
he escaped punishment...

1039
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,508
...he could easily end by killing
another in order to be punished.

1040
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,393
Just to free himself
of his obsession.

1041
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,874
When the human brain
is deranged, one must...

1042
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,229
Oh, yes, one must,
one must, Bernard.

1043
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,749
You may have a lot of sense,
but no intuition.

1044
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,076
What must be done is to stop
the police from interfering in this.

1045
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,840
Pierre would never get over it.
You're going to phone them.

1046
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,951
Tell them anything,
that it was a joke...

1047
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:54,152
In any case, it's too late,
the nuns have lodged a complaint.

1048
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,872
The vertigo.

1049
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,868
I haven't vertigo anymore!

1050
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,397
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Pierre?</i>

1051
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,033
No. Who is speaking?

1052
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,832
<i>Carlos.</i>

1053
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,152
<i>Isn't Madeleine there?</i>

1054
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,438
<i>- Hello? Carlos?
- Well, what's happening?</i>

1055
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,194
It was Bernard who answered you.

1056
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,597
We're waiting.

1057
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,271
Bernard has called in the police.

1058
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,710
<i>The police! What for? You're crazy!</i>

1059
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,354
<i>What have you done?
Do you realise it?!</i>

1060
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,912
Listen to me, Madeleine,
for your own sake.

1061
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:22,395
This is no time for sentiment.

1062
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:25,877
You don't want the phone to be busy
just when they call to let us know.

1063
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,078
<i>Hello?</i>

1064
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,710
<i>Madeleine? We were cut off.</i>

1065
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:51,559
Yes. I hit it with my elbow.

1066
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,274
<i>I see. I don't know what can be done
now, but things mustn't stay lik e this.</i>

1067
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,391
<i>Wait for me, I'm on my way.</i>

1068
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,313
Hello? Yes, it's me.

1069
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,877
Ah, so they've been found?

1070
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,351
What? You have killed him?

1071
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,915
You can call it a real miracle!

1072
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:56,395
Two moments later
and we would have been too late.

1073
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,830
He had a dagger in his hand
and was slowly approaching the girl...

1074
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,718
...who was asleep.

1075
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,917
What are you called?

1076
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,676
What is your name?

1077
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,476
I have no name anymore.

1078
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,755
I have no name anymore.
I am nobody now!

1079
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,871
Nothing!
