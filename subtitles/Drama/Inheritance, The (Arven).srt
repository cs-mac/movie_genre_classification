[Episode 34]

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,760
I brought her to introduce her
to you formally.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,200
What?

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Mom, what's wrong with you?

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,760
How could he bring her here if he didn't
think of us as a bunch of morons?

7
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,760
Please stop.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,430
Please don't feel offended.

9
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,760
I believe you'd understand me
as a parent.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Of course.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,560
We have no excuse for this.
Our apologies.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,760
Seyoon didn't know you were
invited here tonight. That's why...

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,000
Excuse us unwelcomed guests
for leaving first.

14
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,000
Have a great time.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,030
Juri, let's go.

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,760
Are you in your right mind?

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,760
How dare you bring her here?

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,000
And how thoughtless she is
to come with you.

19
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,200
She didn't know about the occasion.

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,760
To tell you the truth,
I lied to her to bring her here.

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Darn it.
I can't even have dinner in peace?

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,430
Let's talk at home.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,700
I don't think we can have dinner here.
Let's go.

24
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,760
Why are you doing this to me?

25
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,400
Why do you make me feel
this miserable?

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Don't feel miserable.

27
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm by your side.

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
I'm sorry I surprised you.

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I know it's hard for you,
but we have to go through with this.

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,100
Let's win them through together.

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,100
All you have to do is hold onto me.

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,760
It won't take long.

33
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,760
Just be patient.

34
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,760
Okay?

35
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,760
Even though you're upset,

36
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,790
how could you slap his face
before his parents?

37
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,300
What would they think of me?

38
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,200
I don't care what they'll think of me.

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,760
I feel much better after slapping him!

40
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,500
You're really of no help.

41
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,760
Enough. From now on,

42
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,630
I will not dance to your tune.

43
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,760
You better get over him now,
completely.

44
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,730
You think I don't want
to forget about him?

45
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,760
But I just can't!

46
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:07,760
My. This is nuts.
She's driving me nuts.

47
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,760
Hongju.

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,760
Yes, Mother.

49
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,260
What's going on with your family?

50
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,760
Your mother promised our inroad
into Taesan homeshopping,

51
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,360
but she never followed up.

52
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:31,730
Yes or no?
She should respond whatsoever.

53
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,360
I'll call my mom.

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,830
You always say that.

55
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,230
Come on, make a call to her
in my presence.

56
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,160
Don't you think you're too much?

57
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,460
Well, I'm sorry
if you're offended but...

58
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,330
Can you make a call to her tomorrow?
No, no.

59
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:05,660
Can you arrange a lunch meeting
during this week?

60
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,130
Okay.

61
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,930
Darn it.

62
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,760
No one pleases me, not a single one.

63
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,330
Yes.

64
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,600
I see, Mr. Kim.

65
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,500
Please let me know
if there's any news.

66
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,260
Lady Hongju is anxious.

67
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,260
What did he say?
They signed the paper after all?

68
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,760
Yes.

69
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,200
This is no good.

70
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,760
What are you doing?

71
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,300
You sleep here. I'll sleep in the study.

72
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,790
Am I that disgusting?

73
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,760
It's not that. How can I put it...

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,760
There's no room in my heart.

75
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
What do you mean?

76
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,130
All the rooms in my heart
are filled with Chaewon,

77
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
so there's no room for you.

78
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
How sad.

79
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,430
Sorry.

80
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,860
Good night.

81
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,760
I hate to go home.

82
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Can you let me sleep
in one of the rooms tonight?

83
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
What?

84
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,760
I can't dare face my parents at home.

85
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
That's why you shouldn't
have done that.

86
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Then should I have hid you
in fear of my parents?

87
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,760
You don't want that, do you?

88
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,830
I'm not sure if I'm doing right.

89
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,760
If I were your parents,

90
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,760
I would also oppose you
dating a divorcee.

91
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,060
I feel I'm so shameless
to just listen to you.

92
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,860
What you have to do is to encourage me,
not to blame yourself.

93
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,230
We can make it up
to my parents later. Alright?

94
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,760
In that sense, let's charge up.

95
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Excuse me?

96
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,500
I saw you charge up your father
the other day and I really envied him.

97
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,400
What?

98
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,760
Come on, I'm low in battery.

99
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Ready? Click.

100
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Charged up.

101
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,000
No way. I'm only half charged.

102
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Charged up.

103
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,400
Thanks for charging me up.

104
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,730
Good night.

105
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,260
Wait.

106
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,760
Take the dress and the shoes.

107
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,760
You're supposed
to return them tonight.

108
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Wait here a moment.
I'll get changed quickly.

109
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
I already paid for them.

110
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,700
What?

111
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,600
You really have slow wits.

112
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,030
Can't believe I fell for
such an untactful woman.

113
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,760
What?

114
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,230
They say you shouldn't buy
your love a pair of shoes,

115
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,330
but I bought them for you
since I trust you.

116
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,760
Don't run away.

117
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,230
What are you looking at?
You're all smiles.

118
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,760
Father, it's very windy today.

119
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,560
Make sure to wear a safety suit.
Cheer up!

120
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,760
Seyoon texted this to me
this afternoon.

121
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,830
Didn't you say you didn't like him?

122
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,760
He's quite good.

123
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,400
I told you.

124
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:43,030
I liked him at first sight. Maybe I knew
he'd become my son-in-law.

125
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:51,760
We'll see. I'm worried Chaewon
might end up getting hurt again.

126
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,760
I dread to think of that.

127
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,800
How are you feeling?

128
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,760
Good.

129
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,860
Why don't you go to the hospital?

130
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:23,160
I can survive at least 10 more years.
Don't worry.

131
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,760
Aren't you sad to have
to quit your job?

132
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
No.

133
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,660
Actually, I've been thinking
about learning more about noodles.

134
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,760
That's reassuring.

135
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,300
I'm sure you'll become
a great artisan of noodles.

136
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,760
Yes. I will work hard.

137
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,630
Good.

138
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,700
Keeok, get up.

139
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Leave me alone.

140
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,560
We met Mr. Khang.

141
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,760
Why do you have to give him
such a hard time?

142
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,060
What is this?

143
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,230
The pledge in his blood
that he'll stay away from you.

144
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,760
He kept avoiding us
but we finally got this from him.

145
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,760
My. You're so cruel.

146
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Whatever. This is the least
safety device to protect you.

147
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,130
Now that the old gigolo
wrote a pledge in his blood,

148
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,430
all you have to do
is make up your mind.

149
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,730
He's not an old gigolo.

150
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,760
Look, he approached you for money.
That's a gigolo.

151
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
What did you say?

152
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,760
He isn't that kind of a person.
It wasn't for money.

153
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,960
Come on, he admitted it.

154
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,500
Did he say he approached me
for the $10 million?

155
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,460
Then do you think he's fallen for you?

156
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,830
If that's the case,
heaven will punish him.

157
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,760
You got him wrong.
He isn't that kind of a person.

158
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,630
Get a grip.

159
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,760
Otherwise, he would've refused
to write this.

160
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
You're so naive.

161
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,760
How could you be fooled by him?

162
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Can't believe you have no eye for men.

163
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,700
It's no use crying over spilt milk.

164
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,160
Let's put an end to this matter.

165
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,860
Think of your parents.

166
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,430
What will happen to them
if they find out?

167
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,100
They'll collapse from shock
and cross the bar.

168
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,400
Why are you whispering all day?

169
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,760
Something's fishy. What's going on?

170
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,560
Nothing.

171
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm so upset.

172
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,030
Keeok.

173
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,130
What's wrong with her?

174
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,760
Well. She's a bit stressed out.
Don't ask anymore.

175
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
She bailed on a date partner.

176
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,830
There's something fishy about her.

177
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,360
What's fishy?
Her mind wanders in spring.

178
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,600
What brings you here at this hour?

179
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,030
Are you okay?

180
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,330
This is nothing. I'm okay.

181
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,760
How sore it must be.

182
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,030
Don't worry. I'm okay.

183
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,200
I heard you were sick.
Are you alright?

184
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,530
Is this your earnest pledge?

185
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Is it true you approached me
for the money?

186
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,300
I'm sorry.

187
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,760
I harbored evil thoughts for awhile.

188
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,800
As you see, I'm living in need.

189
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,000
Your heart towards me was pure
but mine was not.

190
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,760
That's a lie.

191
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
It's not.

192
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:26,760
I thought my life will turn around
if you become an heiress to $10 million.

193
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:33,760
So I tried to hit on you.
But your sister-in-laws caught on.

194
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,930
You're lying to detach me.

195
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,860
You have feelings for me too.

196
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,060
Even before I brought up $10 million,
you had feelings for me.

197
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:53,730
What feelings?
I'm too old to feel love.

198
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,560
I'm sorry I had evil thoughts.

199
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,430
After the competition tomorrow,
I'll get out of your sight.

200
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,760
I thought we were of the same mind.

201
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,760
I didn't know you had such intent.

202
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm so disappointed.

203
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,630
Goodbye.

204
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:40,760
I'm too old and poor...
to confess my love to you.

205
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll keep you deep in my heart.

206
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,000
Schumann's Dedication?

207
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,460
Why did you bring her?

208
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,760
Is that a declaration of war
against us?

209
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,400
Should I fight with you again?

210
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,260
Seyoon!

211
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,760
Wasn't three years ago enough?

212
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,060
If she's an average woman,
I won't oppose you.

213
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,700
I'd say okay if she wasn't
worse than Eunseol.

214
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
But she's a divorcee!

215
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,760
I love her.

216
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Seyoon.

217
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,430
What else do I need?

218
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,560
She restored my heart to feelings of love
that I've once given up.

219
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,560
There are plenty of nice women
whom you can fall in love with.

220
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,860
That's what you think.

221
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,760
She is the only right woman for me.

222
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,760
What blinded your eyes
and closed your ears?

223
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Don't just think ill of her.
Accept her as she is. Please.

224
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Any interesting news?
Give me the newspaper.

225
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
There's nothing special.

226
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Hey. You're being presumptuous.

227
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,760
Why aren't you giving it to me?

228
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Just give me the newspaper!

229
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Huh?

230
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,760
What the heck is this?

231
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,030
Taesan CEO Youngchol Ma
Agrees to Divorce?

232
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,760
Hyesook Oh, the wife of Youngchol Ma,
the Taesan CEO,

233
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:04,530
filed a suit for divorce and division
of property on the 10th of this month

234
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,560
and then withdrew a suit.

235
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,960
A close Ma source revealed
that Oh was not paid alimony.

236
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,000
The suspicion around the causes and
process of divorce is becoming amplified.

237
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,700
What the heck is going on?

238
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,360
Hongju! Hongju!

239
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,230
Gosh! Can't you knock?

240
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,160
Shut up. Hongju, get up.

241
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,130
Talk to her later.
She's in a deep sleep.

242
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,230
Just get up!

243
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,760
I fell asleep using sleeping pills.
What's the matter?

244
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Why did you hide
your parents' divorce?

245
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,260
They got divorced?

246
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,130
Take a look.
It bannered the newspaper!

247
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,760
Is this why she kept putting off
the home shopping thing?

248
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,230
No. That's not important now.

249
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,760
They say your mother
wasn't paid a single alimony and...

250
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,660
Plastic bag.

251
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,330
One, two, three, inhale.

252
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,760
One, two, three, exhale.

253
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,200
One, two, three, inhale.

254
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
One, two, three, exhale.

255
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,400
Then what?

256
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,760
The home-shopping deal is off?

257
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,760
Is this Ms. Chaewon Minn's residence?

258
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,960
Yes, it is.

259
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,760
This is from Mr. Seyoon Yi.

260
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Congratulations on the first step
of the noodle artisan, Chaewon Minn.

261
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Had I known you'd be this moved,
I would've sent a truck of flowers.

262
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,760
Don't work too hard.
Take it easy, okay?

263
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
I'll call you after a meeting.

264
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,700
This is unacceptable!

265
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,760
You promised not to get in on the race,

266
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,760
but now even Chaewon joins the race?
This is absurd!

267
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,900
She's right.
Hyodong, this is too much.

268
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,760
I'm entering the competition to learn,
not to win $10 million.

269
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,260
Oh, come on.
You think we are fools?

270
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,760
By the way, you're strange.
Are you mute?

271
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,960
Why don't you say anything?

272
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,900
We'll follow your decision.

273
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,760
Yes. We'd like to take a step back
and look at the big picture.

274
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Why take a step back?

275
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,360
It's strange that you guys
are taking it without rebelling.

276
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,760
Did they get something on you?

277
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,260
What are you talking about? No!

278
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,760
Well, let's do this.

279
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,760
If my team wins the competition,

280
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,760
we'll give you $10 million,
the prize money.

281
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,800
You divide it into three equal parts.

282
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,760
Really?

283
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,360
Yes. We're not competing for money.
We'll do that.

284
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,700
How can we trust you?

285
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,800
We'll write a promise
and get it notarized, okay?

286
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,330
Are you sure?

287
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,760
We promise.

288
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,460
Don't take it too serious.

289
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,130
Pick the nearest taste
to what you tasted in the old days.

290
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,430
It's been a long time.
I'm not sure if I can recall it.

291
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,700
I'm sure you can.

292
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,760
Well, let's begin.

293
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,560
Okay.

294
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:21,760
Let me hear what made you
make that plate.

295
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Starting from you, Keemoon.

296
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,600
Yes. We made noodles
in tofu residue.

297
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,730
What's the reason?

298
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:42,760
I remember there was
a tofu manufacturer near our factory.

299
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Right, there was.

300
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,760
The owner used to give away
tofu residue for free.

301
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Her mother might've scrounged them
and made noodles in tofu residue soup.

302
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,360
Soy is rich in protein.

303
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,030
We assume that she often made this kind
of noodles for Myongsoon.

304
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,330
- Tasty, huh?
- It is!

305
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,430
Good.

306
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,760
Yum, tastes good.

307
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
It tastes really delicious.

308
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Makes sense.

309
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,760
Next, Keechoon.

310
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Yes. We made noodles
in fermented soybean soup.

311
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,200
In fermented soybean soup?

312
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,760
Jangdan Soybean
is a specialty of Paju, right?

313
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:41,830
The noodles Myongsoon tasted
must've been made of Jangdan soybean.

314
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:47,760
Right. Mother said there're patches
of Jangdan beans all around.

315
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
You have a point there.

316
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,460
Next, Keeok.

317
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,760
I made vinegar chicken noodles.

318
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
The reason?

319
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:04,300
My parents were from Pyongahn
Province, and so was her mother.

320
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,760
Pyongahn people love these noodles.
I ate it often when I was little.

321
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,930
You can never forget the taste
of homecooked food.

322
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:27,760
So we thought her mother might've made
these noodles of her hometown.

323
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:35,760
I didn't know my mom
fled from North Korea.

324
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:43,930
She suffered all sorts of hardships
since she fled at a young age.

325
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,300
Now, Choonhee.

326
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,430
Wait, it looks like...

327
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,330
Right. I made flake noodles.

328
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,760
Flake noodles?

329
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:04,960
I heard that Father gave offcut noodles
to his needy employees.

330
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,760
I could've mixed water to them
and made noodles,

331
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,130
but since my employees struggled,
I gave them away to them.

332
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:29,430
Her mother must've mixed it with water
and made flake noodles.

333
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,760
Right. She didn't have
a noodle machine at home.

334
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
The soup looks tasty.

335
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,400
Yes. We made noodles in perilla soup,
which is a temple food.

336
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,760
Grandma told me that Auntie Myongsoon
was ill when she was younger...

337
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,700
so her mother took her
to the temple...

338
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,200
and prayed to Buddha
since she had no money.

339
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,630
Smells delicious!

340
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:11,760
Since she had little to offer
to Buddha,

341
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,400
she might've brought flour dough
made of offcut noodles.

342
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:23,400
So we drew a conclusion
that the noodles in her memory...

343
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,860
must be flake noodles in perilla soup.

344
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,760
I can vaguely remember mom and I
used to eat noodles at the temple.

345
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,760
I didn't know she was that poor...

346
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,260
and led such a hard life.

347
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,760
They're gonna get cold.
Why don't you try some?

348
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Yes. This is it.

349
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,760
This is the taste of the noodles
my mom made for me.

350
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Poor girl....

351
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,600
Thank you.

352
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,160
Thank you for reminding me
of my memory with my mom.

353
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:37,100
A bowl of noodles
recalled her childhood memory.

354
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,860
Noodles are so valuable.

355
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Noodles aren't food
to stuff the stomach.

356
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,460
They contain memories and comfort.

357
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,830
Extramarital affair?

358
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:12,760
So you mean Mrs. Ma
had an affair with another man?

359
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,760
Yes.

360
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,760
My.

361
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,930
That's why she wasn't paid alimony.

362
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,060
That's not the only reason but...

363
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:33,760
Mr. and Mrs. Ma have had bitter feelings
about it and now they exploded.

364
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,860
That's no news
to their close associates.

365
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Ha. She always talked
as if she were some elegant lady.

366
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,960
So, who is her love child?

367
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,330
Who's the illegitimate child?

368
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,760
Isn't it the first son in charge
of Taesan Home Shopping?

369
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,760
It's a daughter.

370
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,130
Daughter? Who?

371
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,660
My daughter-in-law?

372
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,360
Yes.

373
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Yes?

374
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,030
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

375
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:41,760
Because it's not a pleasant topic,
so I didn't tell you.

376
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,100
What the.

377
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,760
What's wrong with you?

378
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,760
This is a fraudulent marriage!

379
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Please calm down.
Why are you doing this?

380
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,530
That's why they married her off
to your son.

381
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:16,060
Otherwise, why would she let her
marry your divored son?

382
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,760
You're shooting off your mouth!

383
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,260
Ms. Bhang, please calm down.
Calm down.

384
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,230
Calm down, please. Calm down.

385
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,760
What the heck is this?

386
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,760
What should I do? Oh no.

387
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
How are you feeling?

388
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,630
Did you speak with your mother?

389
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,760
Let's take a spin and dine out.

390
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Come on, get up.

391
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,760
Stop bugging me.

392
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,760
When you feel down, you should go out.
Staying home will make you feel worse.

393
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,760
Are you commiserating me now?

394
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
What?

395
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,660
You hated to look at me
or come near me.

396
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,560
Why did you become so nice?

397
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:39,430
Are you taking a pity on me
for my situation?

398
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,800
Why would I?

399
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,760
I don't need your darn sympathy!
So don't mind me!

400
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,960
Where are you going? Hey.

401
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,700
Hey!

402
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,660
That foul temper.

403
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,760
I came back.

404
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
You came back already?

405
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:10,760
She insisted she'd take a bus.

406
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,930
She's just like her mother and doesn't like
causing an inconvenience to others.

407
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm glad we treated her
with noodle soup.

408
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,760
You guys did a good job.

409
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Well, Mr. Uhm...

410
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:42,800
Because of a personal reason,
I can't continue to compete.

411
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,760
Guess you have an emergency.

412
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,830
Yes. I'm sorry.

413
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,760
Thank you for all your teachings.

414
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,830
Let me bow to you.

415
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,760
You don't have to...

416
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,760
Keeok.

417
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Goodbye, Keeok.

418
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,330
Why did you like to me?

419
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,760
It wasn't for the $10 million.

420
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,160
What are you talking about?

421
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,660
I told you enough yesterday.

422
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,760
Schumann's Dedication.

423
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,560
What?

424
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,160
Why did you play
Schumann's Dedication after I left?

425
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,200
Well...

426
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,760
It's the music Schumann
dedicated to his love, Clara.

427
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,900
Ms. Uhm.

428
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,760
Don't try to deceive me anymore.

429
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,760
You love me too.

430
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,830
What's this crap I'm hearing?

431
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,000
Keechoon.

432
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,760
He is an old, useless man...

433
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,030
How dare you.

434
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,460
How dare you covet my sister?
Did you lose your head?

435
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,760
Yeah, beat me up.

436
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,800
Beat me up to the pulp
so that I can come to my senses.

437
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,730
No problem. Follow me.

438
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,130
Stop there. Stop there!

439
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,030
He's gone off his head.
What should we do?

440
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,760
What should we do?

441
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,760
This is a big problem.

442
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Keemoon! Keemoon!

443
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
Keechoon, don't.

444
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,660
Last time you went into her room
and slept there. It was planned, eh?

445
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,760
Why don't you answer?
Are you ignoring me?

446
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
- Bastard!
- Please don't.

447
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,760
He is innocent.
If you want to hit him, hit me.

448
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,400
Step aside, silly girl!

449
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,260
Honey, calm down!

450
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,660
Ms. Uhm, are you okay?

451
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,000
- Get off of her!
- Stop!

452
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,760
- Just get off of her!
- Dang!

453
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,760
Are you okay?

454
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Where's Mr. Khang?

455
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,100
Can't believe this.

456
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,530
She's looking for him
as soon as she woke up.

457
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,960
Are you out of mind?
What do you lack that you...

458
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,330
Honey.

459
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,960
This isn't good for education.

460
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,760
Chaewon, take Boreum out.

461
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,760
Okay. Boreum, let's go out.

462
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Go take a walk.

463
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,560
What do you lack
that you like that old man?

464
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,760
I'm mistaken, right?
I really can't understand you.

465
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,260
Didn't you hear me?

466
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:34,760
I clearly heard her saying "I love you"
to that old gigolo.

467
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,760
Watch your mouth. Old gigolo?

468
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Stop beating my husband.

469
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,800
She's really crazy.

470
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
You're done.

471
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,960
Thanks, Hyodong. Thanks, Ms. Yang.

472
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,930
I knew you'd be on my side.

473
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:04,600
Well, since I helped you two
get married,

474
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,930
now it's your turn to support me.

475
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,760
Let's keep this friendship everlasting.

476
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I have no intention to support you.

477
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
How about you?

478
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,760
No one but a madman
would support him.

479
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,430
Act your age.
How could you act this dirty?

480
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,000
What? Dirty?

481
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,300
If my parents-in-law find out,

482
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,960
the whole family
will be turned upside down.

483
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,560
How quick to smell money.

484
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,060
You shouldn't act this way.

485
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,060
Why are they fighting again?

486
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,560
They're not fighting.
They only disagree with each other.

487
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,000
Sorry I didn't play with you often
these days.

488
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,760
Instead, I'll buy you a toy.

489
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,200
It's a Children's Day gift in advance.

490
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,960
Yeah!

491
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,760
Go ahead.

492
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,660
You want this?

493
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,760
I thought you liked robots.

494
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,700
Yes, Seyoon.

495
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,860
Where are you?

496
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,200
I'm at the mart. What about you?

497
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,400
I'm coming back
from a business trip.

498
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,760
Let's have dinner together.

499
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,760
Okay.

500
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,760
How can I help you?

501
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,760
Did you come to buy noodles?

502
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,460
Isn't this Ms. Chaewon Minn's house?

503
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,630
Yes. May I ask what this is regarding?

504
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,160
Are you her father?

505
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,000
I am.

506
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,700
I am Seyoon Yi's mother.

507
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,800
How do you do?

508
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,760
Please go in.

509
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,160
No.

510
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:40,200
Could I talk to you about something
at a nearby coffee shop?

511
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,760
Sure.

512
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,760
I apologize for my abrupt visit.

513
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,200
That's okay.

514
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,260
I think you can guess
why I came to see you.

515
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,730
Yes.

516
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:21,760
Both your daughter and my son
do not listen to me at all.

517
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:28,530
So I took the liberty
of coming to see you.

518
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:33,760
Say they are blinded by love.

519
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:41,100
Then we must guide them
onto the right path.

520
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:49,830
Seyoon broke off his engagement
after he met your daughter.

521
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:54,960
He's wild and out of control.

522
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:03,230
He is the 5th-generation son
and the heir of the company.

523
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:09,560
He needs a helpmate suitable
for his social status.

524
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,760
The world has changed, but still,
how dare a divorcee...

525
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,400
I'm sorry.

526
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,130
That's okay.

527
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,760
I can understand you.

528
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:34,560
However,

529
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:43,200
although Chaewon has
a poor background, she is upright.

530
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,230
Whatever she does,
it is always perfect.

531
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,930
I'm proud of my daughter and...

532
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:54,530
It's embarrassing
that you talk so naively.

533
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,230
If you were in my shoes,

534
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:05,200
would you want to have
a faulty daughter-in-law?

535
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
Where's Hongju?

536
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,760
She is in her room.

537
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,760
When we came back
from working our tails off,

538
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,160
she didn't even greet us
when she's loafing around?

539
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,760
Aren't we used to that?
What's the big deal?

540
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,530
Mom! Mom!

541
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,460
You think nothing of me
and your husband?

542
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:53,100
All you care about
is that darn puppy.

543
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,760
Way to screw things up!

544
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,760
You're scaring Coco. Stop yelling.

545
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,760
"You're scaring Coco."

546
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,760
How dare you interrupt
your mother-in-law?

547
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,630
Are you brain-dead or what?

548
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,200
Mom, stop.

549
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,430
Try to understand.
It's a terrible day for her.

550
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:19,300
Hey! Why didn't you tell me?

551
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,260
You and your mom
committed a fraud!

552
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,630
Fraud?

553
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,760
I know you're born out of wedlock.

554
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,760
Don't say that!

555
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:39,160
What would I fear in this situation?
All the newspapers bannered it.

556
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:50,760
You're just an illegitimate child but
how dare you act like you're high class?

557
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,260
Watch your language!

558
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,800
What?

559
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,760
Why should I when you cheated us?

560
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,800
She didn't cheat.
I already knew about it.

561
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,400
Shut up.
Don't try to cover up her crime.

562
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,760
Look at the way she behaves.

563
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,200
Please stop!

564
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,160
Calm down.

565
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,060
Calm down, Hongju.

566
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,760
Let go!

567
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,600
Don't stop her. Let her leave.

568
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,760
You wished to make a stake
using my background.

569
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,360
Sorry I threw a wet blanket.

570
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,260
Are you mocking me now?

571
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,900
How could I dare to mock you?

572
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,760
Next time when you need
a daughter-in-law, be more thorough.

573
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,760
So that you won't
pick out trash like me!

574
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,630
What?

575
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,000
Hongju, Hongju!

576
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,200
Seyoon.

577
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,100
You came back now?

578
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,960
Can we talk?

579
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,160
- Let me fill your glass.
- Yes.

580
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,460
I met your mother this afternoon.

581
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,660
My mother?

582
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,760
I don't need to tell you
what she said to me.

583
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,760
I don't wish for honor or riches.

584
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:29,760
I wish Chaewon would marry
an average Joe and live an ordinary life.

585
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,760
You are too good for her.

586
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,760
If she marries you,
she'll lead a difficult married life.

587
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,760
I can't let her go through with it again.

588
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,930
That will never happen.

589
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,800
Meeting with your mother...

590
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:06,060
...reminded me of the same situation
from three years ago.

591
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:14,760
Chaewon's ex-husband
said the same thing you just said.

592
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,960
Your feelings for her
will change some day.

593
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,760
When you have differences
and clashes,

594
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:31,630
your married life can end up in scars.

595
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,530
Forget about her at this point in time.

596
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,760
I'm not a fickle-minded man.

597
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,760
No one says he is fickle-minded.

598
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,760
We all say we'll never change.

599
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,000
What should I do
to make you believe me?

600
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,330
Will you believe me if I leave home
and everything I have?

601
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,760
Are you threatening me?

602
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,100
Father.

603
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:04,600
Till your parents approve,
don't try to see her.

604
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,500
I'll be honest with you.

605
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,760
I had a girlfriend three years ago.

606
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:28,760
I was in the same situation
as I am now.

607
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,700
On our way to win
my parents' approval,

608
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,760
my girlfriend died in a car accident.

609
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,760
I lost my love because of my parents.

610
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,830
And I'll never let that happen again.

611
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,760
You reek of booze.

612
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,860
Why did you drink so much?

613
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,260
I had a drink with him.

614
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,030
Him? Who? Seyoon?

615
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:08,160
Where are you going?

616
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,700
I need to make honey water for him.

617
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,760
Hey.

618
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,760
I'm your hubby you should take care of,
not Seyoon.

619
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,760
He isn't a stranger.
He's my son-in-law-to-be.

620
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,760
Do you like him that much?

621
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,600
Yes.

622
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,160
Though not as much as you,
I really like him.

623
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:39,760
I like his upright
and sincere personality,

624
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,760
but his parents
will strongly oppose them.

625
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:51,760
His mother came here this afternoon.

626
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,600
Mrs. Yi came to our house?

627
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Seyoon.

628
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Stay still.

629
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,760
Let's stay still for a minute.

630
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,300
You smell of liquor.

631
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,430
Did you drink soju thinking
it was water like last time?

632
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,430
No.

633
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,760
Then why did you drink so much?

634
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,700
I had a drink with your father.

635
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,630
With my dad?

636
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,760
He told me not to see you unless
I have my parents' approval,

637
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,760
so I begged him not to keep me
from seeing you.

638
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,330
I did well, right?

639
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,900
Why don't you answer?
Say I did well.

640
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,760
I did well, right?

641
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,760
Yes, you did.

642
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,830
Thanks.

643
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,760
Now that I heard you say that,
I feel better.

644
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,400
I really did well, right?

645
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,460
Why is it so quiet?

646
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,430
Mrs. Park!

647
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,330
Mrs. Park?

648
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,430
Mrs. Park!

649
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,000
Where is she?

650
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,960
Good morning, Cholgyu.

651
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:16,760
Why hit the bottle from the morning?

652
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:22,760
You kicked out a daughter-in-law
for the second time. Are you satisfied?

653
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,760
I didn't kick her out.

654
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,630
You saw her leaving the house
on her own.

655
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:35,830
You promised to be
the kindest mother-in-law.

656
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:38,760
How could you break your promise?

657
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:44,760
Look, I didn't know
Hongju was that awful.

658
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,830
I shouldn't have divorced Chaewon.

659
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,900
I shouldn't have let her go.

660
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:57,760
There you go again.

661
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,960
When will you ever get over her?

662
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,800
Never. I can never get over her.

663
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,430
You really can't live without her?

664
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:18,760
No. I cannot live without Chaewon!

665
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:24,200
This is a living hell.

666
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:34,760
I'm living in hell.

667
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,700
Juri, what are you doing?

668
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,000
You know Eunyoung?
I'll go stay with her.

669
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,760
Your friend who studies in Boston?

670
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,860
Yes.

671
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,760
I'll stay with her for some time.

672
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:06,260
Why would you go there?
And what about your work?

673
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:11,160
I'd rather die than see Seyoon
going out with Chaewon.

674
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:17,760
I won't come back till I get over him.

675
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,130
You really can't live without him?

676
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:30,730
How many times must I tell you? No!

677
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:42,760
Cholgyu can't live with Chaewon,

678
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:48,060
Juri can't live without Seyoon,

679
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:54,760
and Seyoon stands by Chaewon...

680
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:04,630
If I put her back to where she was...

681
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:09,430
both Cholgyu and Juri will be happy.

682
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,630
Like killing two birds with one stone.

683
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Sweetie.

684
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,930
What brings you here?

685
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,760
I'm sorry, sweetie.

686
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,200
Excuse me?

687
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:31,200
I've done so many bad things
to you until now.

688
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:38,760
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.
Please forgive me.

689
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,760
Please?

690
01:02:49,760 --> 01:03:14,760
