(Taps glass)

2
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,667
I'd just like to say thank you all
for being here for our first year,

3
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:58,463
all of our lovely residents,
all looking so smart,

4
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:04,283
and for choosing us here at Lark Hall,
and for having a bit of faith in us.

5
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,474
And Merry Christmas!

6
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:10,708
(All) Merry Christmas!

7
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:16,298
Merry Christmas.

8
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,157
Cheers.

9
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,058
And a Happy New Year.

10
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,922
When a man grows old

11
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:37,133
and his balls grow cold,

12
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:41,077
and the tip of his prick turns blue...

13
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,021
when it bends in the middle
like a one-stringed fiddle,

14
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:51,422
he can tell us a tale or two.

15
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,615
What did Father Christmas bring?

16
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,224
I don't believe in him.

17
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,769
I shan't see another Christmas.

18
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:09,047
Mind you, if I was like her,
I'd shove my head in the gas oven.

19
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:11,321
(Loud toot)

20
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:25,963
(Breathes heavily)

21
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,803
Uhhh...

22
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,475
Mummy!

23
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,580
Mum!

24
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:40,314
What? I'm busy!

25
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:44,964
Eugh!

26
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,990
Arnold's dead.

27
00:02:57,564 --> 00:03:00,338
Try and be careful!

28
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:03,528
Can I have my room back
now Arnold's dead?

29
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,867
No. But you can get in this sleeping bag
when he's finished with it.

30
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,850
Can we have a bit of respect, please?

31
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:13,854
Don't go in that room, Eddie!

32
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:36,233
'No, you bloody lift him,
you idle monkey!'

33
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:41,323
- I'm not Daley shitting Thompson!
- All right, Father, keep your hair on!

34
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,264
Set?

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,311

'I read it in The Daily Express'.

37
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,971
90% of small businesses go down
the tubes, apparently, in the first year.

38
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,557
I should stop you reading that paper.

39
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:06,937
Bloke in Scarborough hung himself
in his sporting goods shop.

40
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:10,149
Yeah, but people don't need
sporting goods.

41
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,487
They're always going to get old,
aren't they?

42
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:16,595
It's just teething troubles, Steve.

43
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:19,307
Kiss-kiss.

00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,367
'Uhhhhh. '

48
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,810
(Horn blares, brakes screech)

49
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:03,462
What do you think you're playing at?

50
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:05,924
I could have killed you!

51
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:08,866
Oi! Come here!

52
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:11,535
(Distant horn toots)

53
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:16,937
And on Boxing Day, we went to the top
of Skidby Windmill and I got badge.

54
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:19,586
No, you got "a" badge.

55
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,507
Edward?

56
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:33,832
On Christmas Day, Arnold Doughty, 90,
went blue and died.

57
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,859
So far, there has been
no communication from him.

58
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,363
(Laughter)

59
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:53,021
I think I've made a mistake, all right?

60
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,818
- Just give it a day. Please.
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

61
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,320
But we've just moved all that in.

62
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:04,076
I'm moving it back out again.
All right? It's my things, isn't it?

63
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:06,204
Who is he?

64
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:11,064
Some gaga old fart Social Services
have sent. Lost his wife.

65
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,214
Lives in a camper van. Like Popeye.

66
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:19,553
Clarence! We can get your stuff just how
you like. Take as long as you want.

67
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:22,974
- That's not a word.
- Yes, it is.

68
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,852
- "Taxi".
- You're not playing properly.

69
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:29,565
Remember your first day at school?
It's a bit like that.

70
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:33,278
- It is a bit like that.
- The first night's the worst.

71
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,531
- Oh!
- I went as mad as her, first few nights.

72
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,703
Be quiet!
Otherwise the war will start again.

73
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:45,584
A lot of jabbering simpletons
rushing about, wetting themselves.

74

telling you what to do.

75
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:52,114
- I'm off.
- Hey!

76
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:56,786
Just give it a go.

77
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:03,127
This is temporary.

78
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:11,887
This is only temporary.

79
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,827
OK.

80
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,830
Why doesn't she let him go
if he wants to go?

81
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:20,709
She should do.
Then I can move back into my old room.

82
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:24,569
You can move back if you can pay us
50 quid a week.

coming here if you're not too busy?"

Get out! Clear off!

161
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:38,731
Come here, you lot!

162
00:14:38,732 --> 00:14:43,466
Come here, come on!
Never mind making a bid for freedom!

163
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,446
(Miaows)

164
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:05,388
'It's all clear. False alarm'.

165
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:10,644
They are real people, not toys! They were
little boys and girls as well once!

166
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:16,339
I don't want to live here! I want things
to be like they were. I want my room back!

167
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,158
Mark my words! By the time he's 13, he'll
be sniffing glue out of a plastic bag!

168
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,661
Thanks, Lilian.

169
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:30,272
What did you want to say, Edward?
What do you want to say?

170
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:34,068
(Blows raspberry)

171
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:53,217
Oh, where are you off to with a grump on?
Go on, get yourself off to school.

172
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:57,013
Tell Mr Kelly
you had to go to the dentist.

173
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,745
Idiots!

174
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:02,770
Cow!

175
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,797
Wankerer!

176
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:11,321
(Engine running)

177
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,702
Mummy!

178
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:37,019
Dad!

179
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:48,324
Easy way out. Coward's way out.

180
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:53,496
Just, you know, a cry for help.
That's all. Classic.

181
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:56,938
- A what?
- Never mind, big ears.

182
00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:02,069
Don't say, "That's all," Steve. How
could we let him get to that? Poor fella.

183
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,512
We're going to have
to cheer this place up a bit.

184
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:33,503
I'm very sorry for smacking you.

185
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:39,384
Are you all right?

186
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:48,937
Come here.

187
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:02,412
You're very fortunate, you know.

188
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:05,416
I never met my grandparents.

189
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:11,506
And my mummy and daddy -
too far away for us to see them much.

190
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:18,097
You've got all these old people around
with all these amazing stories.

191
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,601
It's a privilege.

192
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,751
At least I think it is.

193
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,484
Do you...?

194
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,779
Don't be scared of death, love.

195
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,949
It's all right to be sad.

196
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,723
There's no point being scared.

197
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:41,208
I'm not scared.
I just want to know what happens.

198
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:58,937
(Plates clatter)

199
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:03,276
- Nurse!
- I thought you might want your stuff.

200
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:07,447
Draw that curtain round.

201
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:11,161
And give me my left shoe.

202
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:18,898
- Did you want one?
- No...

203
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,963
Ta.

204
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,968
(Footsteps)

205
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:32,873
Sorry for setting the fire bell off.

206
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:36,460
Sorry I put a lot of talcum
on your floor and that.

207
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:39,881
Sorry for not saying sorry
when you ran me over.

208
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:43,241
And that time I chucked dirt on your head.

209
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:48,330
That's an awful lot of things
to be sorry for at such a young age.

210
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,333
Sorry.

211
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,464
Are you a magician?

212
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:00,553
- I gave it up.
- Why don't you start again?

213
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,057
Do me a favour.

214
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,523
When you...

215
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,068
Did...

216
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:19,887
Did you see any kind
of bright white light?

217
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:23,414
Or a tunnel with Jesus at the end?

218
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:26,478
As a matter of fact, I did.

219
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,465
This cross-eyed little herbert turned up
and yanked me back out.

220
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:35,595
That's what
you should be saying sorry for.

221
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:40,662
 That certain night

222
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:44,040
 The night we met

223
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:49,715
 There was magic abroad

224
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:53,010
 In the air

225
00:20:53,012 --> 00:21:01,062
 There were angels dining at the Ritz

226
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:10,032
 And a nightingale sang
in Berkeley Square. 

227
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,983
(Singing continues downstairs)

228
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:31,931
Can someone inform me
what the hell you think you're playing at?

229
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:36,959
I'm stuck up here on my own
with nothing to keep my trousers up with!

230
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:48,598
Welcome home.

231
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,412
You know, if I want to top myself...

232
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,666
I can jump out the window!

233
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:18,634
(Door closes, footsteps running)

234
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:34,695
(Mouths words)

235
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:40,513
(TV) 'There must be some way we can. '

236
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:42,099
(Loud snap)

237
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,687
'- They say love will find a way. Always.
- I don't deserve love from you.

238
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:47,856
(Snap)

239
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:52,653
'What I deserve is these crippled legs.
And reflect on what I've done. '

240
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:55,136
(Snoring)

241
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,576
(Sniffs)

242
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:25,672
(Door creaks)

243
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,639
(Door closes)

244
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:08,389
Forget it.

245
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:25,513
How much did that cost?

246
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:28,976
You can't put a price on looking good,
chucklebum.

247
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:31,876
How much is looking stupid?

248
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:35,129
Nice 'do, Stevie.

249
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,877
(Tapes clatter)

250
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:53,902
You want to watch where you're going.

251
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,058
Is this your grand passion?

252
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,500
Yeah. But I'm not supposed to.

253
00:25:06,897 --> 00:25:09,357
They're all pictures of ghosts.

254
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:13,027
When they took that,
there was no one there.

255
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,678
Apart from that bloke.

256
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:19,933
(Shouting outside)

257
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,896
- Please, please!
- What?

258
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,462
- What's his problem?
- Who?

259
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:30,028
Flash Gordon.

260
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,867
(Eddie) He was in a war.

261
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,935
What about the others?

262
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:43,690
Lilian's miserable. She trumps a lot.
Reg gets drunk.

263
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:47,319
Elsie was a dancing teacher,
but now has a plastic leg.

264
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,613
Prudence tears up toilet paper.

265
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:54,536
Ena thinks she's still the King's
housemaid and can't stop stealing stuff.

266
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:58,123
Clive's had a stroke,
so all he can say is, "One out".

267
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,148
"Rage...

268
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:03,986
"Rage against the dying of the light".

269
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:09,679
 The wheels on the bus go
round and round

270
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,765
 Round and round, round and round

271
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:16,353
 The wheels on the bus go
round and round

272
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:18,773
 All day long. 

273
00:26:18,774 --> 00:26:23,111
(Ena) They do go round and round,
don't they? Sometimes.

274
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:26,699
 The dogs on the bus go
woof, woof, woof

275
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:29,453
 Woof, woof, woof
Woof, woof, woof

276
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,289
 The dogs on the bus go
woof, woof, woof. 

277
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,417
Jesus Christ Almighty!

278
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:37,962
 All day long
All day long

279
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:41,508
 The babies on the bus go waa-waa-waa

280
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,472
 Waa-waa-waa
Waa-waa-waa. 

281
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:48,956
I can't put the two things together.

282
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:52,813
Lived on my own.

283
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:54,983
Well, myself and the missus.

284
00:26:54,984 --> 00:26:59,738
You live on your own all your life,
then they think it's a great idea

285
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,159
to shove you together
with a load of strangers.

286
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:06,497
And what do the mummies on the bus say?
Anyone?

287
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,917
"Screw this," if they've got any sense.

288
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,213
- Everybody all right?
- Yes, thank you.

289
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,465
Nice to see you, Clarence.

290
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,762
 The mummies on the bus say
hush-hush-hush, hush-hush-hush. 

291
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,807
Oh, God.

292
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:25,333
I know something that would cheer you up.

293
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,064
You've got to be bleeding kidding!

294
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,776
Have one of your beers.
I want to show you something.

295
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:35,823
- Are you interested in ghosts?
- No, not in the slightest.

296
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,951
- I am.
- So I gathered.

297
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:40,287
I'm trying to catch them on tape.

298
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:44,708
Where are you going?
There's nothing in it. It's all bollocks.

299
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,400
- No, it's not.
- It is.

300
00:27:47,714 --> 00:27:52,009
"Samuel Peet - not dead, only sleeping".

301
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:55,452
He's gonna be pissed off
when he wakes up.

302
00:27:57,684 --> 00:28:00,477
This is going to bring my piles down.

303
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,002
I need a coin.

304
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:16,080
Now you have to dance around it
a hundred times.

305
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:20,899
Their hand comes out
and you can ask it questions. Come on.

306
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:24,903
One.

307
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,198
Two.

308
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,496
98...

309
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:37,813
- What's happening?
- Nothing much.

310
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:40,130
99...

311
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,053
100.

312
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:48,348
(Rustle of wind)

313
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:58,797
'There's lots of different ways to
contact them. S챕ances and Ouija boards'.

314
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,174
You can stand in front of a mirror

315
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:05,930
and say someone's name again
and again and again, then they'll appear.

316
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:10,124
- Does this apply to anyone?
- No, you have to be dead.

317
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,100
Is that your wife?

318
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:28,604
She looks like Dame Edna.

319
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,692
Shut up.

320
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:35,382
'Now it's good night from me.

321
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:39,034
'And it's good night from him.
Good night'.

322
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:43,725
Good. night!

323
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,250
Good night, sweet ladies.

324
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:52,216
Thanks for the mystery tour.
I'm not that bothered in the future.

325
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:55,136
My name's Edward.

326
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:59,641
Mine's Clarence.

327
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:07,128
 Simply because you're near me

328
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,884
 Honey, but when you're near me

329
00:30:11,885 --> 00:30:16,389
 I'm in the mood for love

330
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:20,686
 Heaven is in your eyes

331
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:25,067
 Bright as the stars we're under

332
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:29,405
 Oh, is it any wonder

333
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:33,952
 I'm in the mood for love?

334
00:30:33,953 --> 00:30:38,415
 Why stop to think of whether

335
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:42,921
 This little dream might fade?

336
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:47,176
 We've put our hearts together

337
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:49,678
 Now we are one

338
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,181
 I'm not afraid

339
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:56,186
 If there's a cloud above

340
00:30:56,188 --> 00:31:01,673
 If it should rain, we'll let it
But for. 

341
00:31:17,505 --> 00:31:20,028
(Whispers) Annie...

342
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,365
Annie...

343
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:28,747
(Out loud) Annie?

344
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:32,543
Annie...

345
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,882
Annie!

346
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,721
(Whispers) Annie...

347
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,767
Annie...

348
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:51,775
Annie?

349
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:03,914
Annie...

350
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:13,112
- Right, I'm knocking off.
- That's a good idea.

351
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:15,197
I'm off down The Ship.

352
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:18,932
- Do you mind if I get changed in here?
- In...?

353
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:29,361
(Sound of unzipping)

354
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,348
Did you see "Top of the Pops" last night?

355
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:39,059
No, I don't watch it.

356
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:41,584
Who was on?

357
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:46,131
- No, I.I don't watch it neither.
- No.

358
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:49,989
Are you still with Mike or...?

359
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,805
No, I packed him in.

360
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:57,331
- We're both going away soon, so...
- University?

361
00:32:57,332 --> 00:33:00,751
- That's it.
- I wish I'd gone sometimes.

362
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:06,425
I failed my Geography "A" level. There was
another question on the back of the page.

363
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:12,621
I finished half an hour before everybody
else. I'm thinking, "They're bloody slow!"

364
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:17,544
Do you want a lift?

365
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:20,275
Yeah, if you like.

366
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:23,509
Great. I'll just get me jacket on.

367
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,654
You smell like a tart's window box,
Steve! What have you got on?

368
00:33:58,655 --> 00:34:03,097
Just something I were bought
for Christmas, you know.

369
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:09,605
'Uhhhh. '

370
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:15,424
This is what I've got to look forward to,
is it?

371
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:20,054
Can't you find something more
constructive to do? Learn a skill?

372
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:22,955
I only want to know what happens.

373
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:29,274
What happens is. is you think
the last thought you're ever gonna think

374
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:34,260
and then whatever it was
that used to be you. just goes.

375
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:39,641
Christ, it'd be lovely!
I've got lots of things I'd like to say.

376
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,708
But the curtain's come down,
unfortunately.

377
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,752
That's horrible!

378
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:51,113
It can't just be black! Don't take
the piss! It can't just be black!

379
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:59,957
(General chatter)

380
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,205
Are you waiting for someone?

381
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,541
Yes, a little lad.

382
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:21,149
(Bell rings)

383
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:24,298
Your grandson, is he?

384
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,050
No.

385
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,427
Just a little lad.

386
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:32,162
(Children laugh and shout)

387
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,677
Gaylord!

388
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,957
You don't have to come and get me.

389
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:56,294
Don't you want a game?
Nice weather for one.

390
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:58,778
I don't like football.

391
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:05,952
I was wondering if you might
accompany me on an expedition?

392
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:17,382
'Two fat ladies, 88.'

393
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:21,574
The bulb's broken.

394
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:24,975
Doesn't matter. The darker, the better.

395
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:36,238
Now, for those of you...

396
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,930
who have never before sat at a s챕ance,

397
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:44,518
there is absolutely nothing
to be fearful of.

398
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,230
Ghosts are very friendly sorts.

399
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:49,816
They like a nice little chinwag.

400
00:36:49,818 --> 00:36:53,905
But they're very scared of loud noises

401
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:56,324
and sudden movements

402
00:36:56,325 --> 00:37:00,453
which is the reason
why they're very rarely to be sighted

403
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:03,749
in discos and wrestling matches,
for example.

404
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:07,546
You shouldn't joke.
It'll make 'em vengeful.

405
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:12,281
Spirits, please accept
my mortal apologies.

406
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:21,709
Now, who are we hoping
to contact tonight?

407
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,340
- Anyone.
- OK, we'll try for anyone.

408
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,995
Is there anybody there?

409
00:37:33,996 --> 00:37:37,873
Is there anybody there?

410
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,294
- (Loud knock)
- Is someone in here?

411
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:43,819
(Loud knock)

412
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:46,967
- Who is it?
- Arnold?

413
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:49,492
(Two knocks)

414
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:51,932
Someone else?

415
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:54,331
(Knock)

416
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:56,229
Who?

417
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,880
It's "yes or no" questions only, I think.

418
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,612
Is there life after death?

419
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,614
(Knock)

420
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,389
- What's it like?
- Is it nice?

421
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,121
- (Knock)
- Are there any ghosts in this house?

422
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,040
- (Loud rattle)
- Oh!

423
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:18,130
Are there any nice ghosts in this house
that don't want to scare anyone

424
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,863
or cause any bother or nothing?

425
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:24,785
(Loud knock and rattling)

426
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,580
Yeah.

427
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:45,454
 Happy birthday to you

428
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:50,835
 Happy birthday, dear Edward

429
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:55,800
 Happy birthday to you! 

430
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:59,220
- Eddie, good morning!
- Good morning.

431
00:38:59,222 --> 00:39:01,181
(Voices outside)

432
00:39:01,182 --> 00:39:03,622
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

433
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:14,510
Thanks.

434
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:18,432
I'm going to have a shave.

435
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:24,648
Can I have a kiss, please...?
Thank you.

436
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:32,323
It's a special and glorious day today.

437
00:39:32,595 --> 00:39:36,139
- Yeah.
- Canada is a country.

438
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:42,544
And my big God-bothering girl Mavis
is coming from there to see me today!

439
00:39:43,316 --> 00:39:46,652
With her husband
who's got a plate in his head.

440
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:51,240
Of course, she's not a girl now,
little man. She's 66 years old.

441
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:53,326
I'm 11!

442
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:57,415
Well, she's six times better than you are,
isn't she?

443
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,857
(She coughs and wheezes)

444
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:05,362
(Loud thump)

445
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,931
(Mum) Steve!

446
00:40:10,932 --> 00:40:13,747
- What?
- Come here!

447
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,736
Oh, fantastic(!)

448
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:25,887
(Car approaches)

449
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,790
(Doorbell rings)

450
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:36,692
Someone answer the door!

451
00:40:39,174 --> 00:40:42,802
Who do you think you are?
Lord and Lady Aggleshite?

452
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:44,929
Tradesman's entrance!

453
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:47,307
Well, shake a leg!

454
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:49,143
- Oh!
- Got her.

455
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:51,812
- Mum!
- Happy birthday, mate.

456
00:40:51,814 --> 00:40:54,899
- Back to your room! Quick sharp!
- Is she dead?

457
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:57,319
No, she's fine, she's fine.

458
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,053
(Loud thump)

459
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:04,829
What's all the fuss about?

460
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,373
She's had it. She's only just died!

461
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:10,565
Now stop that. Stop what you're doing!

462
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:26,145
(Faint breathing sound)

463
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:29,630
She's just in her room with her things.

464
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:36,387
It's hard to know what to say.

465
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:54,095
Eddie, I'm worried
this is how the Yorkshire Ripper started.

466
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,224
He won't end up
like the Yorkshire Ripper!

467
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:59,601
(Dad) Why are you so bloody morbid?

468
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:03,189
- (Eddie) Cos I live here!
- (Mum) We are doing our best!

469
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:06,068
We used to go away for the day
on my birthday.

470
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:09,677
(Dad) It doesn't entitle you
to do what you like!

471
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,605
Oh!

472
00:42:24,132 --> 00:42:26,906
I heard Lilian's ghost.

473
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:31,890
It went "uuuuhhhh".
And I was too thick to turn the tape on.

474
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:37,606
That's the sound of the air passing over
the vocal cords as it comes out the lungs.

475
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:40,339
No, it's not.

476
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:42,862
Can we do another s챕ance?

477
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:47,242
The proper reaction is to mourn
and celebrate their achievements

478
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:49,870
as human beings, then try to move on,

479
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:52,790
not stick a microphone up their nose!

480
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:56,879
I used to have a room
with Paddington Bear wallpaper.

481
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,342
Yeah, well, I used to have
a beautiful wife and all my own teeth.

482
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:06,055
Your life changes, buster.
And not always for the better.

483
00:43:06,057 --> 00:43:11,334
You accumulate regrets
and they stick to you like old bruises.

484
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,799
Sorry.

485
00:43:26,665 --> 00:43:29,313
Many happy returns of the day.

486
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:34,695
I'll teach you a few tricks.

487
00:43:35,593 --> 00:43:38,178
I'll do you a magic show.

488
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:41,181
And you can rub out all of today.

489
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,790
And you can ask your pals.

490
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:46,855
I don't want a party.

491
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:51,549
Join hands and make contact
with the living, son!

492
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:55,573
You've got to keep it hidden, see?

493
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:58,557
Keep it in the knuckles. Go on.

494
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,333
You're lucky. You're still flexible.

495
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:05,649
Go on.

496
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:08,652
Now make it disappear.

497
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:12,240
Go on!

498
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:16,890
Pick it up.

499
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:19,374
Start again.

500
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,295
It doesn't start until September, does it?

501
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:26,006
Tanya!

502
00:44:26,737 --> 00:44:30,554
God Almighty! Poor bunch of pricks!

503
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:33,952
Go on, ask him.

504
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:36,477
Ask him about your party.

505
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:39,083
Good afternoon, Bob.

506
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:43,380
I don't understand.
It doesn't take five months to pack!

507
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:46,489
Tragic, isn't it?

508
00:44:47,804 --> 00:44:52,830
What were her achievements, then?
What was she like?

509
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:58,086
She was a manipulative,
passive aggressive...

510
00:44:58,483 --> 00:45:01,006
unkind old asshole.

511
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:19,256
 Wish me luck
as you wave me goodbye

512
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,302
 Cheerio, here I go

513
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,930
 On my way. 

514
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,851
Tanya's resigned!
Can you believe that?

515
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:32,855
- She's what?
- Can I have a party? I was a prick.

516
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:37,319
- Where did you pick up that?
- Did she give any details?

517
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,739
- I want a magic show.
- You were naughty.

518
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,033
- Go on.
- Details?

519
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:44,370
- Mum!
- Eddie, get off our backs!

520
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:46,956
We've got this bloomin' wake.

521
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:51,669
 'Til we meet once again,
you and I

522
00:45:51,671 --> 00:45:56,717
 Wish me luck
as you wave me goodbye! 

523
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,077
Maybe we should have a wee dance?

524
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:04,310
The dancers have all gone under the hill,
my dear.

525
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:10,025
 With a cheer, not a tear
Make it gay. 

526
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:15,531
Ohhh, go on, then. It'll do you good
to have some other kids around.

527
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:20,996
- She must have said why.
- I don't know why you're so upset.

528
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:23,917
It's me who'll cop for the extra work.

529
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:26,795
Cos I do sod all around here, don't I?

530
00:46:26,796 --> 00:46:31,781
You know, sometimes I wish
we did go bloody bankrupt!

531
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:36,912
 'Til we meet once again, you and I

532
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:43,962
 Wish me luck
as you wave me goodbye! 

533
00:46:50,283 --> 00:46:54,976
Find the Lady. 5 will get you 10,
10 will get you 20. Money in.

534
00:46:55,831 --> 00:46:58,187
Where is it?

535
00:46:58,668 --> 00:47:01,670
No. There she is.

536
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:04,464
- Not so bad here, is it?
- No.

537
00:47:04,466 --> 00:47:07,259
And the vicar says,

538
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:13,831
"Madam, this is a ladies bike.
It doesn't have a crossbar".

539
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,505
You see...

540
00:47:20,986 --> 00:47:26,888
she thought she was sitting on
the crossbar all the way from Keighley.

541
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,895
- But it was his stiffy.
- Yep.

542
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:37,192
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah.

543
00:47:40,968 --> 00:47:43,491
Fucking Christians.

544
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:49,978
You use two panes of very polished glass
for Pepper's Ghost.

545
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:52,314
At an angle like that.

546
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:55,067
Annie lies there. Well, your assistant.

547
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:57,945
- You've had this.
- What?

548
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:03,452
- You've already had this week's money.
- I do not believe I have had this week's.

549
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:06,686
- Don't you?
- No, sunshine, I don't.

550
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:12,276
- Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
- Bugger off!

551
00:48:16,552 --> 00:48:20,680
It can just be very small-scale.
It could just be me and you.

552
00:48:20,682 --> 00:48:23,851
- What could?
- My birthday party.

553
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:28,941
I have been trying to draw you out of
yourself, in case you hadn't twigged.

554
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,861
God, what's the worst that could happen?

555
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:33,988
Kids eat some cake

556
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:40,101
and we lift the grim bloody pallor of
mortality for a few glorious moments.

557
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:43,604
OK, this one.

558
00:48:44,627 --> 00:48:47,754
Got. Got. Need.

559
00:48:47,756 --> 00:48:50,947
- Oi.
- What?

560
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:55,786
- Have we got PE?
- Of course. Spastic.

561
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,126
Hey.

562
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:07,466
Shit!

563
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:13,244
Wow!

564
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:16,539
- Do it again.
- The light is on!

565
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,584
The light is on!

566
00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:24,549
You've got to flex it
between your knuckles. Don't drop it.

567
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,845
Flex it in your what-nots.
Bleedin' hell.

568
00:49:28,847 --> 00:49:31,996
You've got to practise, you know.

569
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:38,337
Have you been prac...
Give us your whatsit's doo-dah there.

570
00:49:39,151 --> 00:49:42,217
You're not going to leave, are you?

571
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:46,513
Why do you write so much on your arms?

572
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:52,414
Shall we go and get some magical items
for your party?

573
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:57,879
 Don't jump off the roof, Dad
You'll make a big hole in the yard

574
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:01,634
 Mother's just planted petunias

575
00:50:01,636 --> 00:50:05,222
 The weeding and seeding was hard

576
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:08,642
 If you must end it all, Dad

577
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:11,813
 Why don't you give us a break?

578
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:15,817
 Take a walk in the park, Dad

579
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:19,655
 And there you can jump in the lake! 

580
00:50:19,657 --> 00:50:22,158
(Horns blare)

581
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,184
(Clarence) Oops-a-daisy!

582
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,668
This is where we are, then.

583
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:34,862
Find some items
to make your party go with a swing.

584
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:44,352
It's funny.

585
00:50:44,353 --> 00:50:47,021
You spend your life accumulating stuff

586
00:50:47,023 --> 00:50:51,215
and then you can't find anywhere
to put it.

587
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:56,137
Imagine that.

588
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:59,767
Imagine all the money I've spent.

589
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:03,313
All the bloody work I've done.

590
00:51:17,017 --> 00:51:19,060
There.

591
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:21,729
I had a fine woman, you know.

592
00:51:21,731 --> 00:51:24,588
She was very artistic.

593
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:27,466
Very gentle.

594
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:31,158
We were very happy.

595
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:33,744
- What does this do?
- Tells the time.

596
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:38,791
- Is it magic?
- No. It's a grandfather clock.

597
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:43,589
You've got to give them the patter,
otherwise they'll latch on to you.

598
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,718
- What's patter?
- She was very good at that as well.

599
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,953
She helped me write my funny lines.

600
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:55,333
I met her at Euston Station.

601
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,273
Well, I saw her.

602
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:01,216
She passed me by.

603
00:52:01,695 --> 00:52:03,779
I went after her.

604
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:08,785
I had a ten-bob note in my pocket.
You don't see them any more.

605
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:10,830
They were red.

606
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:14,959
So I took it out and I said,
"Excuse my intrusion, Miss,

607
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:17,754
"but I think you might have dropped this".

608
00:52:17,756 --> 00:52:22,615
And she said,
"Oh, gosh! I did. Thank you".

609
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:25,035
Yeah.

610
00:52:25,515 --> 00:52:28,622
So I took her to Lyons Corner House.

611
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:33,170
We had a long bun, as it were.

612
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,384
And that, as they say, was that.

613
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:46,602
Oh, God.

614
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:55,175
I haven't the faintest idea
why they scrapped 'em.

615
00:52:55,176 --> 00:52:59,243
Tanners and florins and shillings.

616
00:52:59,848 --> 00:53:04,602
You don't know what change
you're getting nowadays. And...

617
00:53:04,604 --> 00:53:06,919
And...

618
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:11,465
Where is this?

619
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:15,178
(Tyres screech)

620
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:20,435
Clarence?

621
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:23,499
- Patter.
- What?!

622
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:28,110
- Misdirection.
- Clarence, you're...! Clarence!

623
00:53:29,091 --> 00:53:32,282
(Horns blare)

624
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:43,815
Sorry, I...

625
00:53:43,817 --> 00:53:48,696
 Don't jump off the roof, Dad

626
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:53,015
 You'll make a hole in the yard. 

627
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,733
You OK?

628
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:19,942
When I was a nipper,

629
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:22,111
I used to...

630
00:54:22,112 --> 00:54:26,658
I remember looking up,
lying on my back,

631
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,518
and looking up at the stars

632
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:35,001
and thinking
what a great, big university it is.

633
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:36,962
Universe.

634
00:54:36,964 --> 00:54:43,158
And all them stars, well, you know,
now they're very, very small.

635
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:48,476
It's all. shut up shop

636
00:54:48,477 --> 00:54:52,188
and the stars, you know,
they don't...

637
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,588
what-not.

638
00:54:57,071 --> 00:55:00,596
And the whole. bloody thing

639
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:04,829
has ended up...

640
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,395
on little...

641
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:12,067
me.

642
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:17,950
You can take it to a garage.

643
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:21,370
What? Oh!

644
00:55:22,935 --> 00:55:25,876
(Engine splutters)

645
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:33,154
You see, when you die...

646
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:36,471
then you come back to life.

647
00:55:36,952 --> 00:55:41,039
You know, actually,
you're born again.

648
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,583
Then you die again

649
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:47,110
and, afterwards, you come back to life.

650
00:55:50,593 --> 00:55:53,283
Sounds exhausting.

651
00:55:55,724 --> 00:55:59,791
I want to come back as an animal.

652
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:04,024
A rabbit or a badger.
Or something.

653
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:08,113
- I like badgers.
- What's so good about badgers?

654
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:13,077
I like badgers because they're
bad-tempered and they look good.

655
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:17,604
And...
you can make sporrans out of badgers.

656
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:23,255
But if you came back as a person,
you get a chance to put it right again.

657
00:56:23,257 --> 00:56:25,592
Let me tell you a secret.

658
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:28,762
Being a person is a pain in the arse.

659
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:32,663
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is!

660
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:40,715
- Clarence?
- What?

661
00:56:41,195 --> 00:56:45,323
If you die,
will you come back and see me?

662
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:48,702
Jesus wept! Chuck that thing away!

663
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:53,438
Chuck it away!
Chuck my bloody tricks away!

664
00:57:09,061 --> 00:57:11,729
What did you do that for?!

665
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:16,485
I'm pissing against the wind.
I'm drenching my mackintosh.

666
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:19,678
You don't come back, son!

667
00:57:20,158 --> 00:57:23,599
Once they've gone, you can't talk to them!

668
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:29,835
If I could just say to her, "I'm sorry".
If I could tell her I was bloody sorry,

669
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:32,902
what a difference that would make.

670
00:57:33,382 --> 00:57:38,512
- She's dead, son! She divorced me.
- Who?

671
00:57:38,513 --> 00:57:41,223
Annie. I wouldn't settle down.

672
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:47,169
I couldn't keep it in my trousers.
I was a good-looking fella.

673
00:57:49,276 --> 00:57:53,635
Then one day I came back home
and she'd...

674
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,271
Many years later,
I got a letter saying that she'd...

675
00:58:06,505 --> 00:58:10,030
I was too late for her bloody funeral!

676
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:15,619
I've never even seen her grave!

677
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,976
It's hard...

678
00:58:18,978 --> 00:58:24,233
to get this far and realise
there's absolutely bloody nothing!

679
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:28,196
- You said you were happy.
- Who's happy?

680
00:58:28,197 --> 00:58:33,243
- We could do another s챕ance.
- Don't be retarded. I made it up.

681
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:36,706
- What?
- Sod off! I want to be by myself.

682
00:58:36,707 --> 00:58:40,710
- Clear your own stuff up!
- I will!

683
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:43,653
Badgers are stupid!

684
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,275
- Sorry, love!
- Coo-ee!

685
00:59:00,277 --> 00:59:05,846
- You getting your rabbit in your hat?
- No, I'm shoving it up your bum!

686
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,351
Makes you think, doesn't it?

687
00:59:28,352 --> 00:59:29,977
No.

688
00:59:29,979 --> 00:59:34,316
I wasn't really thinking
about anything very much.

689
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,425
I was thinking about having my dinner.

690
00:59:40,033 --> 00:59:45,894
No, I mean about life being too short.
All that balls.

691
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,066
(Tanya) 'What's the matter, Stevie?

an awful lot of fun.

'Oh, Christ, Tanya. '

695
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:07,106
Don't go to university.
Stay here. We could date.

696
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:09,775
- What?!
- Do you think I'm attractive?

697
01:00:09,777 --> 01:00:13,196
- Hold your horses! I'm 18.
- It's fantastic.

698
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:17,033
- What are you? Like 45?
- No, I'm 39!

699
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:20,101
'Going on bloody geriatric!'

700
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:22,582
(Knock)

701
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:27,713
(Clarence) Kidder? I'm thinking
of doing the Card-Finding Duck.

702
01:00:27,715 --> 01:00:29,716
Go away!

703
01:00:29,717 --> 01:00:33,637
- It takes two people.
- Tough titty!

704
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:36,787
(Edward) I don't want any bloody magic!

705
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:50,365
(Teacher) Ranjit, who in the previous book
was called John, has got six marbles.

706
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:54,036
Zulema, who used to be Samantha,
has got 12.

707
01:00:54,038 --> 01:00:56,998
And Keith, thank goodness,

708
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:59,125
has got four.

709
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:04,153
What percentage of the bag
does each one have?

710
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:07,658
Five minutes.

711
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:12,642
- I don't want to go!
- Pack it in, the both of you! Manners!

712
01:01:12,643 --> 01:01:15,395
But it's an old folks' homo!

713
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:18,398
Oh, God, what's that smell?

714
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,468
- Eew! It's wee!
- No wonder he's a complete weirdo.

715
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:31,664
 Happy birthday to you

716
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:36,796
 Happy birthday, dear Edward

717
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:42,032
 Happy birthday to you! 

718
01:01:44,514 --> 01:01:49,874
- Go on, make a wish.
- Quick, before that senile old bat!

719
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:56,591
(MUSIC: "Come on, Eileen")

720
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:01,388
Did you make that smell?

721
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:06,498
- (Record scratches)
- Carry on! Carry on!

722
01:02:06,499 --> 01:02:10,502
- Let me do it.
- No. I am perfectly capable.

723
01:02:10,504 --> 01:02:16,092
- Him, he's out! He moved!
- I've been moving since 1917!

724
01:02:16,094 --> 01:02:18,826
I can't do anything else.

725
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,453
(Music restarts)

726
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,470
Get up, you. Reg the Hair.

727
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:38,994
Get up. Get up!

728
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:40,538
Oh!

729
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:42,937
Now move.

01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:58,122
(Distant music)

731
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:34,227
Can you do your magic show?

732
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,543
What?

733
01:03:39,693 --> 01:03:42,717
You sure?

734
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:05,661
Have you got any kids?

735
01:04:10,438 --> 01:04:15,150
(Mum) 'Now then,
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,'

736
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:20,637
please put your hands together
for The Amazing Clarence!

737
01:04:21,868 --> 01:04:25,643
Thank you.

738
01:04:27,709 --> 01:04:33,214
I'm not the sort of magician who drags you
through endless mysteries.

739
01:04:33,215 --> 01:04:36,197
I'm pretty straightforward.

740
01:04:39,598 --> 01:04:44,457
- And I don't do card tricks.
- Awww!

741
01:04:48,734 --> 01:04:51,257
Well, maybe one or two.

742
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:57,033
Would you take a card for me, please?
Any card, any card.

743
01:04:57,035 --> 01:05:01,038
Thank you. Look at it.
Don't tell me what it is. No, no.

744
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,166
Don't tell me.

745
01:05:03,168 --> 01:05:06,921
Put it back.
I have a friend who will do that for me.

746
01:05:06,922 --> 01:05:09,298
Ronald, the Card-Finding Duck.

747
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,449
He is going to find your card for you.

Oh! Oh!

Quack, quack!

Can I have another brave volunteer,
please?

751
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,569
You? Another volunteer?

752
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:30,073
Come on, come on. Who? Who?

753
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:34,787
- You, sir?
- No, no, absolutely not! No, no, no.

754
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:39,335
- They'd sit knitting and eating frogs.
- Eugh!

755
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:44,487
And watching people
having their heads cut off.

Unfortunately,
they found that the guillotine

759
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:08,015
was susceptible
to the power of raspberries.

760
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:12,832
They found
that if you got enough people...

761
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:16,962
to blow raspberries,
the blade would be diverted

762
01:06:16,964 --> 01:06:19,863
from its fatal course.

763
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:24,805
Which is why I need your help.
OK?

764
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:28,205
Let's have a dry run.

OK.

- Thank you.

- No, no, son!
- Let me go!

773
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:26,609
- Any other medication?
- Yes. I'm on pills for my...

01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:31,656
Well, I'll be buggered.

Well, he's going senile.

- Yes, you are! You are!

795
01:09:27,023 --> 01:09:30,025
You shouldn't get so involved.

796
01:09:30,027 --> 01:09:32,842
What about you? Getting involved!

797
01:09:36,952 --> 01:09:42,457
(Tape) 'Oh, Christ, Tanya.
Don't go to university. We could date.

798
01:09:42,459 --> 01:09:47,171
'- Do you think I'm attractive?
- Hold your horses! I'm 18.

799
01:09:47,172 --> 01:09:50,257
'- It's fantastic!
- What are you? 45?

800
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:54,471
'No, I'm 39!
Going on bloody geriatric!

801
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:59,603
'- Don't have an affair with me, Stevie.
- I can't support my family.

802
01:09:59,604 --> 01:10:03,983
'I'm a rotten bloody father, a terrible
husband and nobody but you

803
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:06,986
'has a single bloody second for me.

804
01:10:06,988 --> 01:10:10,387
'You're like a breath of fresh air, Tanya.

805
01:10:11,994 --> 01:10:14,684
'I think I love you.

806
01:10:15,373 --> 01:10:17,896
'I do'.

807
01:10:34,938 --> 01:10:39,609
(Dad) 'Maybe if you paid me
a bit of attention every now and again!

808
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:43,738
(Mum) 'What's the bloody problem
with getting your head down?

809
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:47,034
'Can you not see beyond a pair of tits?'

810
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:50,454
I have never been unfaithful to you.
Not in 15 years!

811
01:10:50,456 --> 01:10:53,124
You just undermine me, Steve.

812
01:10:53,126 --> 01:10:57,713
All the time, you never do anything
other than complain!

813
01:10:57,715 --> 01:11:00,300
(Mum) 'It's exhausting!

814
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:03,637
'- Why don't you just go?
- Oh, come on!

815
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:06,705
(Mum) 'I'm sick of it! Go!'

816
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,975
(Engine revs)

817
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:33,402
(Car pulls away)

818
01:11:38,263 --> 01:11:41,015
- There.
- Oh...

819
01:11:41,016 --> 01:11:46,187
- You look nice in that tie, Reggie.
- Thank you.

820
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:50,109
But you never have it quite straight,
do you?

821
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:51,361
No?

822
01:11:51,362 --> 01:11:55,324
We've got to straighten you out a bit
in general.

823
01:11:55,325 --> 01:11:57,910
Oh, yes. I suppose so, yes.

824
01:11:57,911 --> 01:12:00,559
Come along.

825
01:12:06,296 --> 01:12:08,819
It's half eight, love.

826
01:12:10,301 --> 01:12:12,636
Come on, get up.

827
01:12:12,637 --> 01:12:15,160
I want a talk.

828
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:33,474
Edward?

829
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:37,980
Eddie?

830
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:48,762
On Sunday,
we went to Edward's birthday party.

831
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:54,708
There was a wizard who cut an old man's
finger off. It were extremely wicked.

832
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:05,282
An old person and a young person, please.

833
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:07,848
One eighty.

834
01:13:08,788 --> 01:13:12,457
- That's a lot of ready cash.
- He's my grandad.

835
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:17,819
- Are you?
- Possibly. There have been many women.

836
01:13:21,386 --> 01:13:25,870
When are we going home, then?
Come on.

837
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:30,209
I wanna be where my stuff is.

838
01:13:35,027 --> 01:13:38,530
Come 'ere! Oi!

839
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:43,307
Come 'ere!

840
01:13:44,455 --> 01:13:48,083
That was a cheap bloody trick!
Pull the red thing.

841
01:13:48,084 --> 01:13:51,795
- Too late. We're going.
- Pull the whatchamacallit!

842
01:13:51,797 --> 01:13:54,904
I will if you tell me what it's called.

843
01:13:55,844 --> 01:13:58,492
Well, I know it's red.

844
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:03,518
What's a divorce like?

845
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:05,812
- What?
- A divorce.

846
01:14:05,814 --> 01:14:08,733
A bit tricky, I should think.

847
01:14:08,734 --> 01:14:10,860
Come on!

848
01:14:10,861 --> 01:14:13,988
- Is it still there?
- What?

849
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:17,701
- Is it?
- What's the matter?

850
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,414
Is the...
Is the ground still there?

851
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:24,899
Look - ground! Sky! Ground!

852
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:26,837
Ow!

853
01:14:26,839 --> 01:14:30,113
- Oi!
- Concentrate!

854
01:14:32,888 --> 01:14:37,414
Any danger of a cup of tea
and a pork pie?

855
01:14:38,686 --> 01:14:41,627
Did I already ask that?

856
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:46,842
- Thank you.
- Stay here.

857
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:53,432
My name...
is Clarence Parkinson.

858
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:57,563
And England is my nation.

859
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:02,360
My teacher's name is. Mr Scott.

860
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:06,467
And Christ is my...

861
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:08,386
salvation.

862
01:15:08,388 --> 01:15:12,038
Clarence! Come here!

863
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:26,389
- That's the same name as my missus.
- I know.

864
01:15:33,376 --> 01:15:34,668
Oh.

865
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:36,609
No...

866
01:15:38,966 --> 01:15:41,197
Oh. God.

867
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:47,915
Sod off.

868
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:56,967
Sod off!

869
01:15:56,968 --> 01:16:00,722
Sod off!

870
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:10,670
- Sod off...
- Put them down, then. Put them down.

871
01:16:10,671 --> 01:16:12,839
Get it off your. Don't!

872
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,280
Don't. You...

873
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:18,054
You've spoilt them.

874
01:16:18,055 --> 01:16:20,056
Yeah.

875
01:16:20,057 --> 01:16:24,477
I've spoilt...
all these nice flowers, ain't I?

876
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,127
It's all right.

877
01:16:36,577 --> 01:16:40,872
Know what they're gonna say
on my gravestone?

878
01:16:40,873 --> 01:16:45,148
"Here lies Clarence B Parkinson.

879
01:16:45,629 --> 01:16:48,589
"He was born, he effed it up

880
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:51,782
"and then he died".

881
01:16:52,637 --> 01:16:55,180
What's your name?

882
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:57,892
- Eh?
- Edward.

883
01:16:57,894 --> 01:17:00,292
Edward...

884
01:17:00,772 --> 01:17:03,774
Things aren't exactly

885
01:17:03,776 --> 01:17:06,675
as they ought to be.

886
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:11,806
Have you any idea what it is?

887
01:17:13,704 --> 01:17:16,645
There's something the matter.

888
01:17:24,509 --> 01:17:30,370
The name on that gravestone
is the same name as my wife.

889
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:43,343
Leave it.
I'm gonna go call my mum.

890
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:54,543
Today's the first time we've spent
more than half an hour with each other

891
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:59,967
without a bloody fogey or shitty arse
or liquidised bloody carrots in the way

892
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:05,306
for a year. Because our kid's run off
because he hates us so much

893
01:18:05,307 --> 01:18:07,808
because of what we do.

894
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:11,501
That isn't why. What we do is good.

895
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:15,234
We didn't go to university, Steve.

896
01:18:15,236 --> 01:18:19,364
You asked me to marry you.
We had a baby.

897
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,891
Do you remember how much...

898
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:28,083
Do you remember
how hard we tried for him?

899
01:18:28,084 --> 01:18:30,315
Yeah.

900
01:18:31,964 --> 01:18:34,883
That was the journey we decided to make.

901
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:37,844
And there might be a few less "dates"

902
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:41,933
and I might end up looking
like my mother, but...

903
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:44,332
Sorry.

904
01:18:50,152 --> 01:18:52,695
It's not that way, love. Just over here.

905
01:18:52,697 --> 01:18:57,098
- I thought it was outside.
- You come with me. That's it.

906
01:18:59,997 --> 01:19:03,750
You argue with your mates sometimes,
right?

907
01:19:03,752 --> 01:19:08,278
And obviously your mum and me...
sometimes...

908
01:19:10,427 --> 01:19:13,159
I can be a grumpy bum.

909
01:19:15,224 --> 01:19:18,331
It's no fault of yours, love. It's just...

910
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:26,758
Are you not going to live at home?

911
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:30,137
I don't know.

912
01:19:31,869 --> 01:19:35,163
Hey, but you must never think, ever,

913
01:19:35,164 --> 01:19:39,918
that you're not absolutely the most
important thing in the world

914
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,402
to your mum and me.

915
01:19:44,843 --> 01:19:47,867
Do you understand?

916
01:19:54,562 --> 01:19:57,961
When's he going to die?

917
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:06,388
We'll look after him.
Just like we look after everybody.

918
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:13,501
I'm a little bit bored with you men
and your problems at the moment, Edward.

919
01:20:13,502 --> 01:20:17,964
Sometimes you just have to learn
to let things go.

920
01:20:17,965 --> 01:20:20,363
I know.

921
01:20:24,598 --> 01:20:26,370
Eh?

922
01:20:28,728 --> 01:20:33,816
- There you are. Where have you been?
- Go back to sleep.

923
01:20:33,818 --> 01:20:37,487
- I've been looking for you!
- Oh, God help us.

924
01:20:37,489 --> 01:20:40,408
Another woolly one who can't cope.

925
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:42,744
Annie...

926
01:20:42,745 --> 01:20:45,602
I'm sorry, pigeon.

927
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:52,004
That's all I wanted to say.
Just to tell you. that I'm sorry.

928
01:20:52,006 --> 01:20:56,593
I got distracted, love.
If I had my time over again...

929
01:20:56,595 --> 01:20:59,096
If I had it again...

930
01:20:59,098 --> 01:21:01,266
Annie...

931
01:21:01,267 --> 01:21:08,504
I forgive you.

932
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:50,950
'Marty, I'll be very sad to see you go.

933
01:21:50,951 --> 01:21:54,746
'You've really made a difference
in my life.

934
01:21:54,747 --> 01:21:58,875
'Just knowing I'm going to be around
to see 1985,

935
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:02,944
'that I'm going to succeed in this
and travel through time!

936
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:13,351
'It's going to be really hard to wait
30 years to talk to you about this.

937
01:22:13,353 --> 01:22:16,794
'I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

938
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:20,340
(Marty) 'I'm really gonna miss you'.

939
01:22:22,989 --> 01:22:25,908
Ace one, wasn't it? That one was magic.

940
01:22:25,909 --> 01:22:29,954
- Like the bit with the skateboard?
- I was there, too.

941
01:22:29,956 --> 01:22:34,126
- Oh, no. You sure?
- Yeah. You coming in?

942
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:36,879
A couple of minutes can't hurt.

943
01:22:36,881 --> 01:22:41,427
- But you did like it, though?
- It was good, Dad!

944
01:22:41,428 --> 01:22:46,037
- Can I have a word?
- Most assuredly.

945
01:22:49,688 --> 01:22:52,629
With him.

946
01:24:06,571 --> 01:24:09,281
(Clarence) 'Getting to be spring again.

947
01:24:09,282 --> 01:24:12,075
(Edward) 'It's October.

948
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:16,122
(Clarence) 'The leaves are looking
very nice on the, er...

949
01:24:16,124 --> 01:24:18,751
'large plants you get in the garden.

950
01:24:18,752 --> 01:24:22,714
- Trees.
- You're not doing that trick right'.

951
01:24:22,715 --> 01:24:27,135
You've got to give it some patter. Words.
Why don't you...

952
01:24:27,137 --> 01:24:31,099
What do you call a man with a paper bag
on his head? Russell.

953
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,560
Or a licence plate on his head? Reg.

954
01:24:33,561 --> 01:24:36,668
- A man with a car on his head?
- Seatbelt?

955
01:24:39,026 --> 01:24:41,069
Good lad!

956
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:44,531
- Can I have my fiver now?
- Your what?

957
01:24:44,533 --> 01:24:48,912
- You said you'd give me a fiver.
- What a load of bollocks.

958
01:24:48,913 --> 01:24:52,062
- (Knock)
- Come in.

959
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:56,546
- Ready for the off?
- Where to?

960
01:24:56,547 --> 01:24:58,695
Pictures?

961
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:02,908
Ta-ta for now.

962
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:43,185
I was wondering whether you wanted
to move back into your old room.

963
01:25:43,186 --> 01:25:45,918
I'm OK where I am.

964
01:25:47,691 --> 01:25:50,798
He was some magician, wasn't he?

965
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:55,012
Oh, come here.

966
01:26:28,073 --> 01:26:31,764
Oh, yeah? He shoots, he scores!

967
01:26:34,038 --> 01:26:37,187
Come on, then! Pass it!

968
01:26:46,136 --> 01:26:48,492
One out!

969
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:05,013
Go on, then.

970
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:08,433
Nice one, old man(!)

971
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:26,204
(Growl)

972
01:27:27,435 --> 01:27:30,020
Come on!

973
01:27:30,022 --> 01:27:32,420
One out!

974
01:27:45,874 --> 01:27:48,397
Oh, look!

975
01:27:49,002 --> 01:27:51,400
Abracadabra!

976
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,155
Oh...

977
01:28:01,392 --> 01:28:04,541
(Edward) Where are you going?

978
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:11,778
Out.

979
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:15,700
- That's all.
- You never go out.

980
01:28:15,701 --> 01:28:19,829
Well, things are different now,
aren't they?

981
01:28:19,831 --> 01:28:23,147
Why do you have to put make-up on?

982
01:28:23,627 --> 01:28:25,942
Because...

983
01:28:26,422 --> 01:28:31,365
Oh, I don't know.
Makes you feel a bit more human.

984
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:35,432
You look like a vampire.

985
01:28:35,433 --> 01:28:37,956
(Doorbell)

986
01:28:39,896 --> 01:28:42,628
Cheers, big ears(!)

987
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:54,434
You look nice!

988
01:29:06,011 --> 01:29:07,678
Hi.

989
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,829
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
