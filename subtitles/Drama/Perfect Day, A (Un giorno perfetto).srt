1
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:55,138
Come on, sneaky.

2
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,060
Hang in there. You can make it.

3
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:32,615
-Are you okay?

4
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:47,991
-Fat fuck.

5
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:49,913
He didn't go hungry in the war.

6
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,006
-It might be his glands.

7
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,928
They're called glands, right?

8
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:00,708
Thyroid does not produce
enough hormones

9
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,950
so body does not assimilate fat.

10
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:03,911
Glands.

11
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,705
<i> My brother told me that.</i>

12
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:07,434
-Yeah, your brother
is a doctor?

13
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:09,548
-No, fatso.

14
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,094
-What are they laughing at?

15
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,400
-He's just saying
funny things, you know.

16
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,874
-Yeah, I can tell that.

17
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,924
-Ah, it's normal here.

18
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:27,102
This area is famous for that.

19
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,024
<i> Yoghurt and sense of humor.</i>

20
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,451
They always say funny things.

21
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:34,373
That's why people
invite them to weddings.

22
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:38,185
Trust damir,
when you get married

23
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:39,274
invite somebody from here.

24
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:40,683
They're always laughing.

25
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:43,566
Babies here are born laughing,
not crying.

26
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:49,172
Most famous comedian
in my country is born here.

27
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,926
Petrovich.
You know petrovich?

28
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:53,272
-No, I don't know petrovich.

29
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,995
- He tells famous Albanian

30
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:59,230
in bathtub joke. It's great.

31
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,664
-Mike 2, Mike 2,
this is Mike 1, come in.

32
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,458
-He tells it for 30 years

33
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,924
<i> and people always laugh
 every time he tells.</i>

34
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:08,679
30 years, always same joke.

35
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,274
-Yeah, and that might be
him in the well.

36
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:13,196
Mike 2, Mike 2,
this is Mike 1, come in.

37
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:23,093
<i> Mike 2, Mike 2,
 this is Mike 1, come in.</i>

38
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:28,539
<i> Mike 2, Mike 2
 this is Mike 1, come in.</i>

39
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,460
-Copy, mambru!
This is b! Go!

40
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:35,425
<i>- Uh, do you have any rope
 in the car? Over.</i>

41
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:37,796
-I can't hear you.
Come back with that!

42
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:40,487
<i>- Do you have any rope
 in the car? Over?</i>

43
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,184
-Negative. No rope.
No rope on board.

44
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:43,818
<i>- Okay.</i>

45
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,740
<i> We'll be out of here in 15.
 Over and out.</i>

46
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:47,182
-Copy that.
Over and out.

47
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,687
-Ey, ey, ey, ey!

48
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,127
-Watch where you step.

49
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,547
They want us to drive around it.

50
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,719
-How do you know?

51
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,641
-It's a trap.

52
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,747
See that grass there?

53
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:29,047
They dragged it here.

54
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:33,179
See, they put mines on one side

55
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:36,478
<i> so that when you drive
 around it, boom. Game over.</i>

56
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
<i> The question is which side?</i>

57
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,899
-Well, we'd better
turn around.

58
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,589
-They would expect us to go right.
-You think so?

59
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:47,241
-But if we were coming
from the other side, then..

60
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:50,124
...right would be left, so..

61
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,942
-B, there was another road
back there.

62
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:55,089
-Maybe they know.

63
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:57,011
-Maybe they know what?
-Maybe they know we know.

64
00:06:58,004 --> 00:06:59,445
-Yeah, but we don't know!

65
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,303
-Unless they're fucking
with us.

66
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,449
-Well, come on, b.
Just..

67
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:05,178
Let's turn around. There was
another road back there --

68
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,395
-you hear that?
-No.

69
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,959
-That!
-What?

70
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,233
-Rpgs.
-What's that?

71
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,788
-Grenades.
-No, I didn't hear any grenades.

72
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,846
<i>- Oui, oui, oui, yeah.</i>

73
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:17,126
No way we're going back
that way.

74
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:19,529
That's not gonna happen.

75
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,803
Mr. cow..

76
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:24,590
...is it to the left
or to the right?

77
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:26,512
-You're asking the cow?

78
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:28,786
-Let's go.

79
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:33,110
-Are we turning around?
-Rpgs.

80
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,324
It's all here in my logbook.

81
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,688
-What are you doing?
-I'm looking it up.

82
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,193
-Mining protocol says
to turn around.

83
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:45,571
- Mining protocol.

84
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:47,941
Don't believe everything
you read in mining protocol.

85
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:50,088
They write that stuff in Geneva.

86
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,329
They've never seen a mine
in their lives in Geneva.

87
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:53,738
Cows, yes, plenty of cows

88
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,885
but none with mines around 'em.

89
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:58,992
This is my protocol,
not Geneva.

90
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,363
There it is.

91
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,957
What?
Is that my handwriting?

92
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,014
What the fuck does that say --

93
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:05,975
-but I don't know
what it says.

94
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,448
It says to turn around.
-No, look.

95
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,403
Look, right there.
What is that?

96
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,812
That's a cow.
-It's a dog.

97
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,413
-It's not a dog.
-Yes, it's a dog --

98
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:14,047
-dogs don't have horns.

99
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:15,456
That's a cow.

100
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,019
That's an arrow
and it says to go right.

101
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,080
Or left?

102
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:26,027
Oh, fuck it.
We're late.

103
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,205
I'm sick of cows.
-No, no, no! What are you doing --

104
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,575
-arrows and all
of this fucking bullshit.

105
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,458
-No, no, no!
No, we have to go back, b!

106
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,181
Oh, no, please! We have
to go back! Don't you dare..

107
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,807
-...catch a tiger by the toe.
-No, no, no.

108
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,434
Oh, no.
-If he hollers..

109
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:53,894
<i>-Ah, putain! I hate you!</i>

110
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:56,104
I just.. I hate you.

111
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:57,514
I hate you!

112
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:59,116
Fucking crazy!

113
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:05,105
-They brought him
from somewhere else

114
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,060
and throw into well
to spoil water.

115
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,127
-They hear them
when they came with car.

116
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:13,049
<i> With loud music,
 boom, boom, boom.</i>

117
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:18,206
When they came out this morning,
fat guy was in well.

118
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,712
-Well, huh.

119
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,524
-He wants to know
where you're from.

120
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:26,695
-Puerto Rico.
-Uh, Puerto Rico. American.

121
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:28,873
Uh, piculin Ortiz.

122
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,699
-Yes, piculin Ortiz --

123
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,141
<i>- great basketball player.</i>

124
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,959
-Yes, very good.
Piculin Ortiz, very good.

125
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:39,508
-He asks why you're here.

126
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,718
Don't you have woman
who loves you at home?

127
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:44,281
-Tell him I do.
That's why I'm here.

128
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,142
-He says you're funny
like you're from here.

129
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,064
<i> You know,
 the same sense of humor.</i>

130
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,620
-Okay.

131
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,653
-I'll never get in a car
with you again, you got that?

132
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,735
<i> Never again.
-What happened?</i>

133
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,305
-He doesn't give a shit
about rules.

134
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,258
-She wanted to go one way,
me, another.

135
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,667
It's always the same
with chicks.

136
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:13,622
-You ran over a cow!
We could have blown up!

137
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:16,601
-I consulted my notebook.
-Your notebook?

138
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,523
You're not gonna say anything?

139
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,256
-Shit, b.
-Shit, b?

140
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,780
Is that all?

141
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:29,125
-What do you want me to say?

142
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,919
- I'm -- I don't know.

143
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,585
You're in charge
of security here.

144
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,243
<i> What will you do next?
 Send him  to bed without dessert?</i>

145
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,941
-Dessert?

146
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:38,766
I didn't know
there was dessert here.

147
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,817
-Mambru,
everything was under control.

148
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:42,514
You know me. There was
nothing crazy about it.

149
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,436
Intuitive, maybe.
But not crazy.

150
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:46,486
-Sophie.

151
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:49,882
He knew there was nothing
underneath that cow.

152
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,996
He was just...
Showing off for you.

153
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,840
Sophie, come on!
Sophie.

154
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,633
-She's adorable!

155
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:00,484
And you are getting
no respect from her.

156
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,406
-Did you know
about this dessert?

157
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:06,314
-Glad I only got
1 more week here.

158
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:09,933
<i>- Oh, putain!</i>

159
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:12,752
-What?

160
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:17,301
-It's a dude!
-I know it's a dude.

161
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,030
<i>- You said a corpse
 on the radio.</i>

162
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:21,145
-So?
-A corpse could be anything.

163
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,970
It could be a dog, a pig, a..

164
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:25,757
-Sophie, a corpse is a corpse.

165
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,647
A dead dog is not a corpse.

166
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,344
-She's French.

167
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:31,426
-A dead dog is corpse..

168
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:32,836
<i> ...technically.</i>

169
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:36,680
-Is this her first?
-Yep.

170
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,933
-He's gigantic.

171
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:47,283
Is he from the village?
-No.

172
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,070
They brought this guy
from somewhere else.

173
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,311
-I thought they do it
with animals.

174
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:55,290
-Not in war. Nobody throws
an animal in a well.

175
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,245
Wasted food.

176
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:59,390
B, give me a hand with the pipe.

177
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,003
-For how long
has he been in the well?

178
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,245
-12 hours.
10, maybe.

179
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,481
-So what's our expert say?

180
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,722
-We have to get it out
and clean the well.

181
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:14,638
In 24 hours, it won't matter
what we pour in there.

182
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,759
We'll have to seal it.

183
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:18,225
-We'll get the blue helmets
to help.

184
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:19,922
-At least this one's
in one piece.

185
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:22,805
They usually chop it up,
you know.

186
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,208
<i> It speeds up the decay.</i>

187
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,194
It's disgusting, but..

188
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,827
...there's a good side to it.

189
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:31,358
It -- it gets easier
to get 'em out of there

190
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
you know, when they're,
when they're in chunks.

191
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:38,726
So, you know.
-Hey.

192
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:43,594
He says there's a small store
in drusina village.

193
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,413
It's nearby.
And they might have rope there.

194
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:53,236
-Is, is he your first,
dogs aside?

195
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,593
Really?

196
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,995
Unbelievable.

197
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,596
It's important moment,
your first corpse.

198
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,294
You never forget it.

199
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,561
It's like your first girlfriend
or the first time you get laid.

200
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,099
I remember the first time
i got laid

201
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,301
but my first corpse, that shit
is burned in my memory.

202
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:15,498
I'll never forget
that face, man.

203
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,637
-Was it terrible?
-No, it wasn't terrible.

204
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,783
It was, it was nice.

205
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,577
She was, uh, 17

206
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,787
<i> red head, nice body.</i>

207
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:27,158
-The corpse?
-No, my..

208
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,111
The girl,
the first girl I slept with.

209
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,289
What's wrong with you?
-Oh.

210
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,827
-That's sick.

211
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,172
<i>- Sophie!</i>

212
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:37,247
You're gonna ride with me
to the security briefing.

213
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,067
<i> B, you're going with damir
 to drusina.</i>

214
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,476
-Drusina.

215
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,391
<i>- There are 2 more Wells
 to the west.</i>

216
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,299
About 12 kilometers..

217
00:13:58,486 --> 00:13:59,958
...in nisinje.

218
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,585
-Yeah, they were both
mined last week.

219
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,507
We informed unprofor

220
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,518
but it'll take a while
to demine them.

221
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,696
Even if Wells are a priority

222
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,849
it's gonna take
at least a couple days --

He's a little boy.

232

<i> Give him his ball.</i>

Give him back his ball.

It's his ball. He's a kid.

235
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:44,867
-Uh-huh?

236
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,461
-No, no, no, no, no.

237
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,682

<i> We're friends, friends.</i>

a new ball, brand-new ball?

-Where?

248
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,422
-Base camp.
Soldiers have ball. Deal?

249
00:15:20,424 --> 00:15:22,055
You pick ball
and I drive you back.

250

Let me tell you.

253
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:55,721
Mambru wouldn't have
taken that shit

254
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:57,131
from anyone
couple of years ago.

255
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:59,789
He would have thrown her
in the well with the fat fucker.

256
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,480
He's good at what he does

257
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:04,018
but he has not been
the same lately.

258
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,349
He -- he's talking
about giving it all up.

259
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,377
You see, there's this girl..

260
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,395

...waiting for him.

00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,585

swings set out back.

264

You know,
the whole kit and caboodle.

265
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:26,215
He's not the same.
He's just like he's here, but he's not here.

00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,436
-No.

268
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:32,653

They change you.
I got changed by one too.

00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:34,425
...minor altercations..

321
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,148
...but I repeat,
the area is quite calm.

322

<i> Water.</i>

00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:59,314
Our sector is supplied
by 3 Wells.

333
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:01,972
Davari and nisinje
are still mined

334

-Excuse me, sir.

337
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,454
Negative. The third well
is not functional.

338
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,920
<i> We were just there.
- What's wrong with it?</i>

339
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:16,931
<i>- Somebody threw a corpse in it
 to contaminate the water.</i>

340
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,885
<i> Someone should remove it.</i>

341
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:23,209
-The mines are our priority.

342
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:25,932
-But then remove the mines
from the other two.

-Well, but according

348
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:42,044
there is a body rotting inside.

349
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:45,183
So it must be removed,
so we can purify the water.

why we need the rope for,
so I explained him.

460
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:20,039
And he told me that
if somebody throw man in a well

461
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,416
he probably was no Saint

462

and it's better
to leave him there.

463
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,028
Never touch dead people,
he says.

464
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:34,293
-How much? How much?

465
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:36,503
Money. How much?

466
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:49,283
-Uh, he says that, uh

467
00:29:49,285 --> 00:29:51,301
they need rope for hangings.

468
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,440

She said you were moving.
-Yeah?

00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,796
-She was having doubts
about what?

482
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,646
-Between the 2 colors,
salmon or beige.

483
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,785
Which one did she finally pick?
-No idea.

484
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:02,476
She handles that part,
the color part.

485
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:05,103
But I am there if she needs
my opinion, of course

486
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:07,025
to support her.

487
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:09,427
That's what couples
are all about, right?

488
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,381
Support.

489
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:13,688
-Of course.

490
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:17,115
I -- I was actually looking
at bedrooms too.

491
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:19,004
<i> Can you believe it?</i>

492
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:20,061
-You?

493
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:22,496
-Yeah, with bernal.

494
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,205
-So you and bernal
are back together?

495
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:29,159
<i>- Mm-hmm. Looks like it.</i>

496
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:33,291
-What color did you pick?

497
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,501
-Uh...Salmon.

498
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:45,752
<i>- Difficult to know.</i>

499
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,353
Many problems here.

500
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,563
Maybe they're enemies
and they don't want you

501
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:52,029
to remove body from well.

502
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,272
Or maybe they put it there.

503
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:56,706
-You think?
-Could be.

504
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,115
You know,
things are complicated.

505
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:01,190
Whatever you think...
It's possible here.

506
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:05,482
Or maybe you are foreigner

507
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:07,981
and that's why
they don't sell you rope.

508
00:32:07,983 --> 00:32:11,345
Many people hate foreigners
because they come with war.

509
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,747
<i> You remind them
 that everything is bad here.</i>

510
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:16,182
<i> You know, the bombs,
 the, the deaths</i>

511
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:18,327
<i> and so they hate you for that.</i>

512
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:27,008
-What's that sign saying?

513
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,706
-"Un convoy, stay..

514
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:34,152
...back."

515
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:36,938
-You see the size
of that escort?

516
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,379
Military target.

517
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,584
<i> They're taking meat
 to the refugees.</i>

518
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:53,146
You might as well paint
a bull's eye on your chest.

519
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:55,485
The further away you get
from these guys, the better.

520
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:57,407
You get what I'm saying?

521
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:01,026
What's that?

522
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:12,846
-I told her I was coming.

523
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:16,882
-You told Sarah
we were gonna see each other?

524
00:33:16,884 --> 00:33:18,964
<i>- Yeah,
 because of the evaluation.</i>

525
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:22,871
You're not mad, are you?

526
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:24,889
-About which part?
-What evaluation?

527
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:27,324
-Yeah. What evaluation?

528
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,136
-We need to check if
the mission still makes sense.

529
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:33,698
<i> If the cost is justified.
-And that's up to you?</i>

530
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,068
-We don't have
unlimited resources, mambru.

531
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,279
-Never mind your report.

532
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:40,457
Tell them we can't leave.

533
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:43,276
-But you're leaving next week.
-So what?

534
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,094
Me leaving is one thing,
all of us leaving is another.

535
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,337
-This is almost over, mambru.
Peace is coming.

536
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:50,643
<i> Don't you watch the news?
-I don't.</i>

537
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:54,070
I'm too busy pulling bodies
out of Wells.

538
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,331
<i> But peace may come,
 the problems don't disappear.</i>

539
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:02,143
This is gonna be an emergency
zone for a long while.

540
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:33,886
-What are you doing?

541
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,808
-$6 each.

542
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:48,429
-You know they need water.

543
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,087
<i> You understand?</i>

544
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,169
<i> It's not -- it's not fair.</i>

545
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:59,671
You know they need water?

546
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,579
-Sophie.

547
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:04,605
Sophie.

548
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:06,527
-You know it's not fair.
-Sophie!

549
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:16,584
They're taking advantage
of them.

550
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,268
-Of course, they are.
This is war.

551
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:24,624
Come on,
let's get back to the car.

552
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:31,415
-What bastards.

553
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:34,138
$6 for water
and that's how we help people.

554
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,091
-We can't get the body out.

555
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,013
We have no rope.

556
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,192
-You don't have any rope?

557
00:35:40,194 --> 00:35:41,185
-It broke.

558
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:42,306
-We have to do
what we have to do.

559
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,004
Get the body out
and clean the water.

560
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:46,310
-Sophie, we're not
allowed to touch it.

561
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,040
-Yeah, what's wrong with you?
Weren't you in the room?

562
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,249
Mambru is right.
He's doing what he was told.

563
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,421
-Please don't agree with me.

564
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:55,471
-Tough shit.
If you're right, you're right.

565
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:57,553
They give you an order,
you follow it. Period.

566
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,467
-Let me do the talking.
Don't say a word. You'll see.

567
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,956
Uh, this is storage?
Uh, supplies?

568
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,846
-Storage, yes.

569
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:46,433
<i>-Uh, we are pomoc.
Uh, aid workers.</i>

570
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,611
Uh, we have a problem.
Big problem.

571
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:50,662
We need a rope.

572
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:52,584
Do you have any rope?

573
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,299
Rope, like..

574
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:04,724
There's a -- there is a,
ahem, there is a corpse.

575
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,069
Uh, a corpse.

576
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,599
Dead fucker in a -- a well.

577
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,554
And, uh, we need to get it out.

578
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:12,924
So we need rope.

579
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:15,551
So the people
could drink the water.

580
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:17,536
You understand?

581
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:18,882
-Water.

582
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,142
No water here.
Uh, war, sorry.

583
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:26,088
-No, uh, no.
We don't need no water.

584
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,658
<i>Only.. What's rope?
- Konapac.</i>

585
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,644
<i>- Kono -- konopac, no water.</i>

586
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:32,047
<i>-No water, no konopac.</i>

587
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,321
No nothing. War, sorry.

588
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:40,375
-Uh..
-Should I?

589
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:41,496
-Yeah.

590
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:56,711
-Hey, hey!

591
00:37:57,738 --> 00:37:59,178
<i> Konopac.</i>

592
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:02,573
You lend me this one.
2 hours.

593
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:05,231
-No, no, no. Not possible.

594
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:07,186
<i> Not possible.
-N -- n -- not the flag.</i>

595
00:38:07,188 --> 00:38:09,940
Just the rope.
-It's my...Country.

596
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:13,400
<i> You take r -- rope.
 Flag down.</i>

597
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:16,187
This is war.
Flag down, not possible.

598
00:38:16,189 --> 00:38:18,397
-We know, w -- we know,
we know this is war.

599
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:19,774
We only want the rope.

600
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:22,305
-Flag down, we surrender.

601
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:23,842
<i>Me, kaput.</i>

602
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,245
They thum-thum-thum me.

603
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:27,910
Understand?

604
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:31,018
This is war.
Flag down, not possible.

605
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,355
-You gotta make a choice,
flag or water?

606
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,332
<i>-  Mike 1, Mike 1,
 this is Mike 2. Copy?</i>

607
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:45,624
-Uh, Mike 2, this is Mike 1.

608
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:47,546
How did it go over there? Over.

609
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:51,165
<i>- Not good. There was rope.</i>

610
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,087
But there's no rope.

611
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:55,617
<i>- Uh, I didn't copy that.</i>

612
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,052
<i> Uh, can you give that
 to me again? Over.</i>

613
00:38:58,054 --> 00:38:59,974
-No rope, no rope.

614
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:02,569
-Shit.

615
00:39:04,748 --> 00:39:06,732
<i> Okay, we'll wait for you here.
 Over and out.</i>

616
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:13,523
-Maybe they throw man
in the well

617
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:15,445
so they can sell water.

618
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,421
<i>- Maybe.</i>

619
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,973
-You need rope?

620
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,471
-Yeah.
-I know where you find.

621
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,244
-Oh, yeah? Where?

622
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:03,781
-In my house.

623
00:40:03,783 --> 00:40:05,703
Not far. I'll take you.

624
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:11,757
-And how long is this rope?

625
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:14,096
-Long.

626
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:18,228
-Show me.

627
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:44,205
<i> Yeah, there was
 a change of plans.</i>

628
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:46,287
We're heading over to dukovo.

629
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:47,985
Apparently there's rope there.

630
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,907
<i>- Who says?
-Rope?</i>

631
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,662
-Uh, local sources.

632
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:53,750
<i> Over and out.</i>

633
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,705
-Aren't we going back
to the base?

634
00:40:55,707 --> 00:40:58,972
-Yeah, but first we're gonna
get our friend out of the well.

635
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,926
-You're not allowed.
-Says who?

636
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,168
-The united nations.
They said you can't do it.

637
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,602
-I don't take orders
from them.

638
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:06,724
I'm not wearing a helmet.

639
00:41:06,726 --> 00:41:09,126
-It was just explained
to you by an official.

640
00:41:09,128 --> 00:41:10,695
Who do we need to get
for you to understand?

641
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:12,073
<i>- Butros ghali?
-Yeah.</i>

642
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:14,123
Butros butros-ghali.

643
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,725
I want him to come here
and explain to me

644
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:18,127
why the hell we can't get
the body out of that well.

645
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:20,049
<i>- I can't talk to you.</i>

646
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:36,065
<i> I'm never gonna
 make my meeting.</i>

647
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:37,858
<i>- You know it's a good thing
 you're getting to see</i>

648
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,069
<i> what's going on here
 first hand.</i>

649
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,151
<i> It is gonna help your report.
- Don't make this personal.</i>

650
00:41:42,153 --> 00:41:44,681
I was sent by headquarters.

651
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:46,892
-It's always personal.

652
00:41:46,894 --> 00:41:49,358
<i>- Mambru, you got 2 people
 in the back seat.</i>

653
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,280
<i> Are you aware of that?</i>

654
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,475
-Nikola, left or right?

655
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:19,628
-Right.

656
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:22,062
-Right.

657
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,108
-No rope around here.

658
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:57,586
<i> Maybe there was a store
 before.</i>

659
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:04,248
Maybe they made rope here.

660
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,637
There was a factory.

661
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,270
<i> This could have been
 the center of the entire</i>

662
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:11,936
<i> Balkan rope industry.</i>

663
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,844
<i> Everybody in the village
 made rope.</i>

664
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:19,784
Every year they'd split the
surplus at the rope festival.

665
00:43:19,785 --> 00:43:22,602
<i> People come from all over
 the country to celebrate.</i>

666
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:24,717
<i> Singing, dancing.</i>

667
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,888
At weddings, newlyweds
would give each other rope

668
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,091
and tie themselves together
as a symbol of their union.

669
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:33,173
<i>-Who is this guy?
- Offerings were made..</i>

670
00:43:33,174 --> 00:43:36,216
-He's part of our, uh,
integration program.

671
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:39,099
<i>- There were miracles.
 Rope appeared out of nowhere.</i>

672
00:43:40,957 --> 00:43:44,993
<i> Welcome to konopac,
 the rope capital of the world.</i>

673
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:47,235
<i> Population, 5.</i>

674
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:49,894
<i> I'm b, I'll be your tour guide
 for this afternoon</i>

675
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:52,712
<i> and I'm pleased to be
 with y'all on this lovely day.</i>

676
00:44:04,693 --> 00:44:06,038
-No, no.

677
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:09,497
Stay with Sophie,
stay with Sophie.

678
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,544
That's the kid's house.

679
00:44:16,546 --> 00:44:18,850
He says there's a big chunk
of rope in there.

680
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:24,648
-Shit!
Where d'you get her?

681
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,250
Models without borders?

682
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:30,093
-Hi, I'm Katya.
-That's Katya.

683
00:44:30,095 --> 00:44:32,912
Ka -- Katya?
The Katya? Katya, Katya --

684
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:34,642
-yeah.
-What's she doing here?

685
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:36,436
Is she here to see you?
-Can't get enough --

686
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:47,134
wait, wait.

687
00:44:47,136 --> 00:44:48,576
<i> It's tied up.</i>

688
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:54,149
Nikola, stop.

689
00:44:58,923 --> 00:45:00,204
-Rope.

690
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:03,566
-That's the rope?

691
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,122
Our rope?

692
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:08,852
-Nikola no lie.

693
00:45:08,854 --> 00:45:10,389
-Nikola no lie,
but Nikola no say

694
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:12,023
the rope was tied
to a dog either.

695
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:14,585
-I say I take you to rope
and rope is there.

696
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,699
-Kid is right.
The rope is there.

697
00:45:16,701 --> 00:45:18,109
And it's perfect.

698
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:20,768
-It's not perfect.

699
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,106
Perfect would be
if there was no dog on one end.

700
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:26,277
-Rope is there. Dog is
your problem, not Nikola's.

701
00:45:26,279 --> 00:45:28,167
Nikola little boy.

702
00:45:28,169 --> 00:45:30,505
-Nikola little boy.

703
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:32,491
-You come here to help, no?

704
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:34,093
<i> Now you help.</i>

705
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:36,303
-You heard him, mambru.
It's your turn.

706
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:39,153
You're the safety expert here.
-Exactly.

707
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:41,460
-We need the rope.
-Thank you, Sophie.

708
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:44,471
I know we need the rope,
but we need our hands too.

709
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:45,592
-You want the kid to get it?

710
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:49,019
-Great idea, Katya.
Great idea.

711
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:51,870
-Don't we have anything
we can give him?

712
00:45:51,872 --> 00:45:54,689
Valium? Percocet?

713
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:56,323
-I'll check.

714
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:01,096
-Nikola!

715
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:04,715
Where are you going?

716
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,007
-Inside.

717
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:10,962
-You can't go inside.

718
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:12,884
It's not safe, come on!

719
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,368
-I need my ball.

720
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:25,985
-You see the roof?

721
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:29,156
It's falling.
It's too dangerous.

722
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:36,555
How about we get the rope

723
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:40,527
<i>and then I go inside
and get ball?</i>

724
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:41,712
-Okay.

725
00:46:42,706 --> 00:46:44,627
-Let's go help Sophie.

726
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:48,567
<i>-  He brought you to his house.
- He said there was rope here.</i>

727
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:51,385
<i> And there is.
-He said?</i>

728
00:46:51,387 --> 00:46:53,467
I don't understand,
who's in charge here? The kid?

729
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:56,638
-Well, sometimes we get
information from local people.

730
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,849
<i>- Local people?</i>

731
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:00,579
<i> You mean local kids?</i>

732
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:02,693
-Good doggie. Oh, yeah.

733
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,326
...good doggie.

734
00:47:06,378 --> 00:47:09,163
<i> Good doggie.
-That should be enough.</i>

735
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:20,662
<i>-Careful, damir.
- Don't worry.</i>

736
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:28,190
<i>-  Tajsone.</i>

737
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:29,919
<i> Tajsone.</i>

738
00:47:31,106 --> 00:47:33,444
Tajsone crazy dog.

739
00:47:33,445 --> 00:47:36,262
One day, he bite my father.

740
00:47:36,264 --> 00:47:38,505
But my father
more crazy than tajsone.

741
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:40,266
He bite tajsone back

742
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:43,501
and since then
tajsone respect him.

743
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:45,327
-So your dad...Bit the dog?

744
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,793
-Everybody to hospital
that night.

745
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:49,588
Dog too.

746
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,093
He says

747
00:47:51,095 --> 00:47:52,534
"what you do to me

748
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,168
I do to you."

749
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,506
And tajsone never
bite him again.

750
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:57,659
-Sure.

751
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:02,752
Where are they now?

752
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,674
Your, your mum and your dad?

753
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:09,575
-They afraid something bad
happen to us here.

754
00:48:09,577 --> 00:48:11,561
So they leave me
with my grandfather

755
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:13,451
and they go in donovich.

756
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:14,636
-Hmm.

757
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:18,800
-But he says they will
come back when war is over.

758
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:20,082
-Oh, sure.

759
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:23,157
I'm sure.

760
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:29,531
-He's even more awake now
than he was before.

761
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,119
-This won't be easy.

762
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:35,649
He survived the war.

763
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:37,315
-Nikola.

764
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:39,557
If your ball is in house,
where is?

765
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:43,337
-In garage.
-Garage?

766
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:44,810
<i> Vamonos, Sophie.</i>

767
00:50:24,526 --> 00:50:27,696
Okay, let me go first.

768
00:50:27,698 --> 00:50:29,618
Stay right behind me.

769
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:31,600
Oh, boy.

770
00:51:42,748 --> 00:51:44,701
-Where is the roof?

771
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:46,623
-Out there somewhere.

772
00:51:49,442 --> 00:51:52,324
They blew it off
from right there, you see?

773
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:55,303
They leave an open tank
of butane..

774
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:57,514
...they light a fuse..

775
00:51:57,516 --> 00:51:59,467
...close the windows,
shut the door.

776
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:02,125
Half an hour later

777
00:52:02,127 --> 00:52:03,855
pfft!

778
00:52:03,857 --> 00:52:05,169
Roof is gone.

779
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,147
-Who?

780
00:52:08,149 --> 00:52:10,069
-Neighbors, probably.

781
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:16,091
But before the war

782
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:18,270
<i> if you were a Muslim
 and your husband a serb..</i>

783
00:52:19,456 --> 00:52:21,217
...or the other way around

784
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,139
<i> it was no big deal.</i>

785
00:52:26,823 --> 00:52:28,936
Then the war starts..

786
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:30,858
...the lines are drawn.

787
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,150
And now it's too dangerous
to stay here.

788
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:38,738
<i> So..</i>

789
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:42,070
...you leave the kids
with their grandparents..

790
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:46,298
...and you go
to the other side..

791
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,220
...where it's safer.

792
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:54,146
<i> But while you're away..</i>

793
00:52:56,709 --> 00:52:58,021
...the neighbors blow up
your house

794
00:52:58,023 --> 00:52:59,943
so you won't come back
after the war.

795
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,890
Hey, it could be worse.

796
00:53:04,108 --> 00:53:05,548
-What could be worse?

797
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,919
-Putting a mine in the sofa
in case you do come back.

798
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:13,845
Let's move.

799
00:53:15,223 --> 00:53:16,664
-No.

800
00:53:47,255 --> 00:53:48,535
<i> Mambru?</i>

801
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:51,738
I got it.

802
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,660
-He's gonna be a happy kid.

803
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:06,441
Wait! Wait! No!

804
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,947
-Sorry.
-Sophie, don't.

805
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,869
- I'm so sorry.

806
00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:16,179
<i>- Wait, Sophie.</i>

807

<i> Don't turn around.</i>

808
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:21,336
-What?
-Look at me.

809
00:54:22,138 --> 00:54:24,059
Look at me.

810
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,660
Don't turn around.

811
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,055
It's okay.
-What --

812
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,169
-look at me. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

813
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:32,932
Come here..
Don't! Don't! Don't!

814
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:55,065
-Nikola.

815
00:54:55,067 --> 00:54:56,795
Here's the ball.

816
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:57,884
Mambru needs you inside.

817
00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:19,858
-Long enough.

818
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:23,158
-Let's do it.

819
00:56:38,113 --> 00:56:39,328
There are soldiers.

820
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:43,493
<i>-  Uh, copy that. Over.</i>

821
00:56:43,495 --> 00:56:45,415
-Welcome to the Balkans!

822
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:51,149
-Uh, hotel, hotel.

823
00:56:51,151 --> 00:56:53,551
<i> This is Mike 1, come in. Over.</i>

825
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,612
-Hey.

826
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:00,085
Tell them not to wash the car.

827
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,744
We don't have any money.

828
00:57:02,746 --> 00:57:03,961
-They don't wanna
wash the car.

829
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,434
-I know they don't
wanna wash the car.

830
00:57:05,436 --> 00:57:07,356
It's a joke. Tell them.

831
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:15,525
Tell them.

832
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:40,510
<i>- Uh, we've been stopped
 at a local military checkpoint</i>

833

30 kilometers east, sector 6.

<i> 4 expats.</i>

836
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,806
-Yeah, yeah.
What the hell was that?

837
00:57:48,808 --> 00:57:51,272
Ask them what the problem is.

838
00:57:58,096 --> 00:58:00,498
-Uh, he says the road
is closed. We have to go back.

839
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,618
-Why?

840
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:08,538
-Uh, he says, uh,
because we can't go through.

841
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,459
-That explains everything.

842
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:14,335
<i> The road is closed.</i>

843
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:20,197
-Uh, Johnny cash?

844
00:58:21,607 --> 00:58:23,688
<i>- Yeah, I think
 it's something else.</i>

845
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,162
<i>- I'm walking over.</i>

846
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:26,955
-Can they stop us?

847
00:58:26,957 --> 00:58:28,493
-Looks like it.

848
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:30,094
-According to the peace
agreements, these guys

849
00:58:30,096 --> 00:58:32,305
should have been
demobilized by now.

850
00:58:32,307 --> 00:58:34,419
-Oh, you wanna go
and tell them?

851
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:36,245
-Fine.

852
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:37,558
-Hey..

853
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:43,708
Okay.

854
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,142
Sophie, get behind the wheel.

855
00:58:46,144 --> 00:58:47,968
If I put my hands like this

856
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:49,955
turn the car around
and get the hell out of here.

857
00:59:00,493 --> 00:59:02,414
<i>- What's the problem?
 Why can't we go through?</i>

858
00:59:05,362 --> 00:59:06,354
<i>- Tell him
 we need to go through.</i>

859
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:08,276
<i> We have to reach the base.</i>

860

<i>- You can't.</i>

861
00:59:10,937 --> 00:59:12,313
-Sorry, madam.
This is a war.

862
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,458
-No, this is not.
War is over.

863
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,317
There are peace talks underway.

864
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,071
Cessation of hostilities.
Do you understand?

865
00:59:23,012 --> 00:59:24,324
You haven't been informed.

866
00:59:25,703 --> 00:59:27,624
Who's your commanding officer?

867
00:59:31,725 --> 00:59:33,101
-Are those prisoners
right behind me?

868
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:35,151
-Yeah.

869
00:59:35,153 --> 00:59:36,945
-Do we know what
they're doing with them?

870
00:59:36,947 --> 00:59:38,867
-I wouldn't want to be
in their shoes.

871
00:59:45,274 --> 00:59:47,772
-Excuse me, uh..

872
00:59:47,774 --> 00:59:51,391
Can you tell them, uh, if
they need a hand with anything

873
00:59:51,393 --> 00:59:53,313
we are willing to help?

874
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:06,446
-What did he say?

875
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:08,015
-Nothing.
He says, uh, we have to go.

876
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:09,937
The road is closed.

877
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:13,269
-Okay. Okay.

878
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,928
Ask them what time
do they open the road.

879
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:17,369
-I can't.

880
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,981
-Why?
-I can't.

881
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:31,303
-Why?
-He say that he knows my family in dabrica.

882
01:00:35,468 --> 01:00:37,229
-Do you have family
in dabrica?

883
01:00:37,231 --> 01:00:38,830
-My brother.

884
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:43,122
-Okay. I'm sorry.

885
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:44,660
-Let's go.
-Okay.

886
01:00:45,718 --> 01:00:47,927
Okay. We go!

887
01:01:13,939 --> 01:01:15,667
<i>- We stumbled
 on to a little situation</i>

888

on the road to bjelane.

889
01:01:17,558 --> 01:01:19,607
20 prisoners, blue minibus.

<i> Looks like
 they're up to no good.</i>

891

<i> Inform the blue helmets,
 tell them to go check it out</i>

892

<i> and make sure
 everything is kosher.</i>

<i> Location 30 kilometers
 east of dukovo. Over.</i>

-You know where we are?

895
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,037
-I think so.

896
01:02:30,111 --> 01:02:32,383
<i> Mike 2, this is Mike 1. Over.</i>

897
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:34,849
<i>-  Yeah, go ahead.
- Yeah. The road isn't here.</i>

898
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,188
<i> We should have seen it
 4 kilometers back. Over.</i>

899
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,949
-That's not good.

900
01:02:38,951 --> 01:02:41,416
<i>- Let's keep that hill
 in the sight. Uh, over.</i>

901
01:03:04,479 --> 01:03:05,760
<i> Cow?</i>

902
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:08,483
-Cow.

903
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:20,975
<i> Oh, man!</i>

904
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:25,300
Uff!

905
01:03:27,382 --> 01:03:28,919
That's fresh.

906
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:38,464
-Fuck me.

907
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:40,098
-What do you think?

908
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,924
Go to the left?

909
01:03:41,926 --> 01:03:43,269
-Or right?

910
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:44,519
-Or over it?

911
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,441
This morning we went over one.

912
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:48,363
<i> It worked.
-What worked?</i>

913
01:03:49,517 --> 01:03:51,726
-They always follow a pattern.

914
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:54,064
-Maybe the pattern
is to change pattern.

915
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,043
And now it's underneath.

916
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:58,965
That's what I would do
if I were them.

917
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,406
-If you were them,
maybe you're thinking

918
01:04:00,408 --> 01:04:01,687
<i> that we know
 what you're thinking</i>

919

<i> and then you'd go on the side.</i>

920
01:04:05,628 --> 01:04:07,838
<i>- It was dragged here.</i>

921

-Excuse me?

922
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:12,066
-The cow.
It was dragged from here.

923
01:04:12,068 --> 01:04:14,468
-You mean
it's from somewhere else?

924
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,845
-Yeah, it was brought here.

925
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:20,394
-The cow?
-Yeah, the cow, the cow.

926
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:23,277
Okay, b, go ahead
and inform on our position.

927
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:25,391
We're gonna have to spend
the night here.

928
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:27,889
-With the cow?
-With the cow.

929
01:04:27,891 --> 01:04:29,331
- You're kidding me, right?

930
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,741
-You're not going to
drive over this one?

931
01:04:30,743 --> 01:04:32,886
-No, this is a different
breed of cow.

932
01:04:32,888 --> 01:04:34,199
-Isn't there another way?

933
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:36,025
Also, it is a possibility
it could have just died?

934
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:38,332
-Everybody, listen up!

935
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:40,318
We're gonna move the cars
back 10 meters

936
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,521
and nobody strays from the cars
without my permission.

937
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:45,443
Nikola, the ball stays
in the car.

938
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:46,917
-We can't stop like this
in the middle of the night.

939
01:04:46,918 --> 01:04:48,838
We have to keep going.
I'm already cold!

940
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,144
Can we go back
or something and make..

941
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:55,597
-Go, get it.

942
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,519
If you don't blow up,
we keep driving.

943
01:05:00,915 --> 01:05:02,196
Well?

944
01:05:04,246 --> 01:05:06,167
Come on, get in the car.

<i> Do you happen to know

01:06:02,288 --> 01:06:04,209
-How are you doing?

960
01:06:07,413 --> 01:06:09,334
-I can't stop
thinking about them.

961
01:06:10,648 --> 01:06:12,441
The 3 of them.

962
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:14,620
I imagine them together
in that house.

963
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,520
Is that normal?

964
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:27,848
-Forget them.

965
01:06:28,714 --> 01:06:30,315
They're gone.

966
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,561
-What are we going to do?

967
01:06:36,563 --> 01:06:37,778
-Nothing.

968
01:06:38,932 --> 01:06:40,373
We keep going.

969
01:06:42,103 --> 01:06:44,024
Don't think about it.

970
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,676
You'll end up going home.

971
01:06:50,432 --> 01:06:52,257
Forget what's happened

972
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:54,179
or what's gonna happen.

973
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:58,631
Focus on what's happening now.

974
01:06:58,633 --> 01:06:59,432
Have some.

975
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,781
The rest doesn't exist here.

976
01:07:06,095 --> 01:07:07,696
Maybe back home..

977
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:10,291
...but not here.

978
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:13,109
<i>- Mambru!</i>

979
01:07:14,712 --> 01:07:16,537
Your girlfriend called the base!

980
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:18,459
Apparently it's urgent!

981
01:07:20,157 --> 01:07:22,783
<i> Mambru, did you hear me?</i>

982
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:25,313
<i> Your girl --
-i heard. I heard.</i>

983
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,175
You have to work on it.

984
01:07:31,977 --> 01:07:33,385
Trust me.

985
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:47,736
Where do you think you are?
At a barbecue?

986
01:07:47,738 --> 01:07:49,946
Hotel, this is mambru.

987
01:07:49,948 --> 01:07:52,445
Did she say
why it was urgent? Over.

988
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,007
<i>- Negative. Just to call her.
 Over and out.</i>

989
01:07:59,844 --> 01:08:02,695
<i>- What's going on, Sarah?</i>

990
01:08:02,697 --> 01:08:04,296
Yes, she is.

991
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:09,037
What a coincidence, huh?

992
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,568
Yes, she told me
you guys ran into each other.

993
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,490
So what's going on?

994
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:15,827
Hmm?

995
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,031
Whichever.

996
01:08:20,217 --> 01:08:22,138
I mean, does it matter?

997
01:08:23,612 --> 01:08:25,053
Either one.

998
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:27,744
The second one.

999
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:30,210
Uh, salmon.

1000
01:08:31,781 --> 01:08:33,637
No, it's not that I don't care.

1001
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:35,847
<i> I totally do.</i>

1002
01:08:35,849 --> 01:08:38,154
<i> I trust you,
 which is different.</i>

1003
01:08:42,543 --> 01:08:44,464
-Where is damir's coffee?

1004
01:08:46,931 --> 01:08:48,051
Thank you.

1005
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:55,418
-What about his parents?
Won't they be worried?

1006
01:08:56,861 --> 01:08:58,301
-They won't be worried.

1007
01:08:58,303 --> 01:09:01,184
-Well, he's just a kid and
you're keeping him all night.

1008
01:09:01,186 --> 01:09:04,356
-He lives in bjelani with his grandfather.
He says it's no problem --

1009
01:09:04,358 --> 01:09:06,598
-what he said doesn't matter.
He's a minor.

1010
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:11,114
What would you say
if he were your son?

1011
01:09:11,116 --> 01:09:14,382
Some people take him
and bring him back the next day.

1012
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:15,791
Well?

1013
01:09:15,793 --> 01:09:18,385
What would any
normal person think?

1014
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,428
-That there was a problem
at the checkpoint?

1015
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,286
-I said normal, b,
you don't count.

1016
01:09:24,633 --> 01:09:27,259
-B, did you know that
Katya came all the way here

1017
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,660
to close the mission
and send us home?

1018
01:09:29,662 --> 01:09:32,864
-What home?
-Exactly. What home?

1019
01:09:33,986 --> 01:09:36,132
That's the problem.

1020
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:38,918
A home, b.
Normal with walls.

1021
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,481
That isn't bombed out.
Have you got one of those?

1022
01:09:41,483 --> 01:09:44,235
Wife, children, friends.

1023
01:09:44,237 --> 01:09:47,086
A dog. Someone
waiting for you somewhere?

1024
01:09:47,088 --> 01:09:48,912
-Yeah, I got plenty of people
waiting for me.

1025
01:09:48,914 --> 01:09:50,674
-Plenty. How many?

1026
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,645
-Hookers don't count.

1027
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:57,080
-Hookers don't count?
-No, they don't.

1028
01:09:57,082 --> 01:09:59,483
I mean, emotional bonds.

1029
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:01,532
Have you got any?

1030
01:10:01,534 --> 01:10:02,910
-Emotional bonds.

1031
01:10:07,524 --> 01:10:09,572
I'll have to think about it.

1032
01:10:09,574 --> 01:10:11,142
-You guys spend
so much time around here

1033
01:10:11,144 --> 01:10:13,480
you forget what real
life is like.

1034
01:10:13,482 --> 01:10:16,267
Look, I don't wanna
kick you out of here.

1035
01:10:16,269 --> 01:10:18,221
I just wanna do my job.

1036
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:20,336
For that,
i have to get to the base.

1037
01:10:20,338 --> 01:10:22,321
Is that too much to ask?

1038
01:10:24,212 --> 01:10:26,550
-Where are you going?
-I need to pee.

1039
01:10:26,552 --> 01:10:28,791
-What did I say?
Nobody strays.

1040
01:10:44,906 --> 01:10:48,395
Damir, what are you looking at?

1041
01:10:48,397 --> 01:10:50,317
<i> Show some respect
 for your colleagues!</i>

1042
01:11:05,789 --> 01:11:07,871
-Internal affairs is moving.

1043
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:11,586
You noticed, right?

1044
01:11:11,588 --> 01:11:13,796
-What?
-Her panties.

1045
01:11:14,726 --> 01:11:16,776
They were black.
-So?

1046
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:20,876
-So nobody wears
black panties to a war

1047
01:11:20,878 --> 01:11:23,021
unless they're expecting
something.

1048
01:11:23,023 --> 01:11:25,487
-Where did you hear that?

1049
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,307
-You gotta bang her.
It's no big deal.

1050
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:31,157
She'll soften up a bit,
she writes a favorable report

1051
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,566
and everybody be happy.

1052
01:11:32,568 --> 01:11:33,688
Sophie agrees.

1053
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,514
-Oh, you two talked about it?

1054
01:11:35,516 --> 01:11:36,891
-We don't even need to.

1055
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:38,269
We understand each other
without talking.

1056
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:40,126
It's non-verbal communication.

1057
01:11:40,128 --> 01:11:42,240
-This morning your
communication was pretty verbal.

1058
01:11:42,242 --> 01:11:43,714
-We're pass that.

1059
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:49,192
And I have been tilling
the soil for you.

1060
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,650
-What soil?
-With Katya.

1061
01:11:53,677 --> 01:11:55,758
I told her that, you know

1062
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,345
from time to time,
you...Talk about her..

1063
01:11:59,347 --> 01:12:01,267
...all affectionate.

1064
01:12:03,543 --> 01:12:05,335
-That's not true.
-I know it's not true.

1065
01:12:05,337 --> 01:12:07,033
It's a trick.

1066
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,955
We want her happy.

1067
01:12:09,885 --> 01:12:11,101
Can't you just slip her one?

1068
01:12:11,102 --> 01:12:13,631
I -- it's not like
I'm asking you to fuck damir.

1069
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:16,002
-B..

1070
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:17,988
...i have a girlfriend.

1071
01:12:19,558 --> 01:12:21,287
Yeah.
-She's hot.

1072
01:12:21,289 --> 01:12:23,113
You had a thing with her before.

1073
01:12:23,115 --> 01:12:24,843
It's a relapse.

1074
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:27,822
It's like smoking again.
It's totally understandable.

1075
01:12:27,824 --> 01:12:29,904
Uh, she writes
a terrible report about us..

1076
01:12:31,218 --> 01:12:33,139
...we gotta go home.
What then?

1077
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:36,791
Who helps the people then? Huh?

1078
01:12:36,793 --> 01:12:38,937
You even think about that? No.

1079
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:40,666
You're being selfish.

1080
01:12:40,668 --> 01:12:42,460
You gotta fuck her..

1081
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:44,382
...for the Bosnian people!

1082
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,681
Make a sacrifice..

1083
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:49,603
...for the humanitarian cause.

1084
01:12:50,886 --> 01:12:52,903
She won't say no.

1085
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:55,337
Hey. Hey.

1086
01:12:56,843 --> 01:12:58,604
I'm serious.
-Mmm.

1087
01:13:29,516 --> 01:13:31,437
Did he fall asleep?

1088
01:13:34,032 --> 01:13:36,690
-He says when he grows up,
he wants to be an aid worker.

1089
01:13:36,692 --> 01:13:38,420
-Tell him how much we make

1090
01:13:38,422 --> 01:13:40,758
he'll change his mind real fast.

1091
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,943
Pay no attention.

1092
01:13:41,945 --> 01:13:44,442
He'll tell the soldiers
he wants to be a soldier.

1093
01:13:44,444 --> 01:13:46,235
These journalists,
he wants to be a journalist.

1094
01:13:46,237 --> 01:13:47,645
<i>- Have you guys
 seen my notebook</i>

1095
01:13:47,647 --> 01:13:49,150
or did you throw
that away too, mambru?

1096
01:13:49,152 --> 01:13:50,528
-He would tell Katya
he wants to..

1097
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:53,251
Hey, Katya, what is it
that you do now exactly, Katya?

1098
01:13:54,404 --> 01:13:57,574
-Conflict evaluation
and analysis.

1099
01:13:57,576 --> 01:14:00,426
-Forget that. He don't wanna
tell anyone he wants to do that.

1100
01:14:00,427 --> 01:14:02,347
I don't even know what that is.

1101
01:14:04,335 --> 01:14:06,063
-Is he hitting on you?

1102
01:14:06,065 --> 01:14:07,985
<i> Watch out. He always hits
 on the new ones.</i>

1103
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:10,771
-I know that.
We all do.

1104
01:14:10,773 --> 01:14:12,181
-You all know what?

1105
01:14:12,183 --> 01:14:13,719
-That you always do that.

1106
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,352
They warn us.

1107
01:14:15,354 --> 01:14:16,826
-Was it
in your mission briefing?

1108
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,652
-Under potential hazards.

1109
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,829
-Along with mines
and drunken soldiers?

1110
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,719
-Right above it.

1111
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:24,641
You should read them.

1112
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,364
<i>- I will now.</i>

1113
01:14:31,786 --> 01:14:33,707
-That's me a few years ago.

1114
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,095
Does she have a boyfriend?

1115
01:14:38,097 --> 01:14:39,664
-I don't know.

1116
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:41,394
-No, of course not.

1117
01:14:41,396 --> 01:14:42,676
How convenient.

1118
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:45,142
Ask her.

1119
01:14:45,144 --> 01:14:47,352
Maybe she's got a photo
of him in her wallet.

1120
01:14:49,403 --> 01:14:51,452
Have you got one of Sarah's?

1121
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:53,887
-What do you care?
-You didn't before.

1122
01:14:55,553 --> 01:14:57,474
-How do you know?

1123
01:14:58,532 --> 01:15:00,709
-You didn't.

1124
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:02,919
-Did you look in my wallet?
-That's not the point right now.

1125
01:15:02,921 --> 01:15:06,346
The point is whether or not
you had one. And you didn't.

1126
01:15:06,348 --> 01:15:08,268
-Did you look in my wallet?

1127
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,671
-So what if I did?

1128
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,080
I was looking
for something else.

1129
01:15:12,082 --> 01:15:13,714
-Like what?
-Your passport.

1130
01:15:13,716 --> 01:15:16,789
I don't remember.
-Unbelievable.

1131
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:18,167
You looked in my wallet!

1132
01:15:18,169 --> 01:15:20,408
-You hid that you had
a girlfriend from me.

1133
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,555
-I never hid
anything from you.

1134
01:15:24,894 --> 01:15:26,687
It just never came up.

1135
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,865
I never said
i didn't have a girlfriend.

1136
01:15:28,867 --> 01:15:30,307
-I talked to you
about my boyfriend.

1137
01:15:30,309 --> 01:15:32,837
-Non-stop.
-I left him for you.

1138
01:15:32,839 --> 01:15:34,759
-Nobody asked you to.

1139
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:38,859
Did I ask you to leave him?

1140
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:40,300
Did I?

1141
01:15:42,415 --> 01:15:44,432
-What's wrong with men?

1142
01:15:44,434 --> 01:15:46,002
You know, it's normal.

1143
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,348
You talk about your girlfriend.

1144
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,270
You carry her photo
in your wallet.

1145
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:51,704
What are you so ashamed of?

1146
01:15:51,706 --> 01:15:53,113
Is it that hard
to just admit it?

1147
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,580
-Okay! I have a girlfriend!

1148
01:15:55,582 --> 01:15:57,502
Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

1149
01:15:58,784 --> 01:16:00,032
Here.

1150
01:16:03,364 --> 01:16:05,541
Here is a picture
of my girlfriend.

1151
01:16:10,572 --> 01:16:12,749
<i> Yeah, I have a girlfriend.</i>

1152
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,931
Here.

1153
01:16:20,853 --> 01:16:23,095
Go ahead and tell the world
i have a girlfriend.

1154
01:16:23,097 --> 01:16:25,594
Who wants to see
a picture of my girlfriend?

1155
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:28,573
<i>- Is she naked?
-No, she's not naked.</i>

1156
01:16:28,575 --> 01:16:31,519
Normal people don't carry naked
photos of their girlfriend.

1157
01:16:31,521 --> 01:16:32,800
-Damir does.

1158
01:16:33,762 --> 01:16:34,883
-You looked in my wallet?

1159
01:16:34,885 --> 01:16:37,478
-I -- I was looking
for your passport, uh..

1160
01:16:42,059 --> 01:16:44,140
-Can't see her very well.
It's blurry.

1161
01:16:45,486 --> 01:16:47,919
-You can see her just fine.

1162
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:50,835
<i> What? You want me to carry
 around a poster of her?</i>

1163
01:16:51,893 --> 01:16:53,749
-You tricked me, mambru

1164
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:55,671
<i> and I believed you.</i>

1165
01:17:01,438 --> 01:17:03,551
-It wouldn't have made
any difference.

1166
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,651
You think I lied to you..

1167
01:17:08,677 --> 01:17:10,213
...but I didn't.

1168
01:17:11,848 --> 01:17:13,096
Here.

1169
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:23,122
It was nobody's fault.

1170
01:17:24,276 --> 01:17:27,799
Our relationship...
Had a blind spot.

1171
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:30,970
Yeah, like a car.

1172
01:17:30,972 --> 01:17:33,565
Something we couldn't see,
that's all.

1173
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,647
-You mean...Your wife?

1174
01:17:35,649 --> 01:17:37,729
-Don't call my wife
a blind spot.

1175
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:39,683
-I didn't, you did.
-I didn't mean her.

1176
01:17:39,685 --> 01:17:41,060
I was just giving an example.

1177
01:17:41,062 --> 01:17:43,398
Besides she's not my wife.

1178
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,872
We're not married!

1179
01:17:44,874 --> 01:17:46,666
-See?
You're denying here again.

1180
01:17:46,668 --> 01:17:48,492
<i>- Please, can you guys
 go somewhere else?</i>

1181
01:17:48,494 --> 01:17:50,414
<i> I'm trying to go
 to sleep here.</i>

1182
01:17:51,728 --> 01:17:53,200
-Shh!

1183
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:57,460
No, we can't!

1184
01:17:57,462 --> 01:17:59,382
There are mines!

1185
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:37,693
<i>- What? What? What? What?</i>

1186
01:18:37,695 --> 01:18:39,166
What the fuck?

1187
01:18:41,826 --> 01:18:43,811
<i>- Oh, my god. Jesus.</i>

1188
01:18:43,813 --> 01:18:45,733
<i>- Oh, shit, you scared me.</i>

1189
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:48,743
Mambru, wake up.
Wake up. Wake up.

1190
01:18:50,057 --> 01:18:52,587
<i> Mambru, follow the granny.</i>

1191
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,534
<i> Follow the granny.</i>

1192
01:18:55,536 --> 01:18:57,712
<i> Trust me, follow the granny.</i>

1193
01:18:57,714 --> 01:18:59,250
-10-4, b. 10-4.

1194
01:19:00,404 --> 01:19:02,325
-It's just a cow.

1195
01:19:04,537 --> 01:19:06,457
Oh, my god, I'm sorry.

1196
01:19:20,392 --> 01:19:22,633
-Not too close,
not too close.

1197
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:32,115
-Okay.

1198
01:19:41,022 --> 01:19:42,942
-Just don't look.

1199
01:19:42,943 --> 01:19:44,318
<i> Don't look.</i>

1200
01:19:59,664 --> 01:20:00,911
-Yay!

1201
01:20:03,828 --> 01:20:06,453
<i>- I was right. It was left!</i>

1202
01:20:50,818 --> 01:20:52,674
-It's my grandfather.

1203
01:20:54,693 --> 01:20:57,640
-Uh, b, tell damir
to get over here.

1204
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:21,182
<i> Oprostite. Excuse me.</i>

1205
01:21:21,184 --> 01:21:23,617
It's our fault.

1206
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:25,475
Tell him the road was closed.

1207
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:28,838
-We couldn't make it back
last night.

1208
01:21:29,736 --> 01:21:31,657
And Nikola behaved very well.

1209
01:21:35,983 --> 01:21:37,583
Uh..

1210
01:21:37,585 --> 01:21:40,786
Tell him, uh, that Nikola
took us to his house in dukovo.

1211
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:54,207
-He asks
if boy went into the house.

1212
01:21:56,451 --> 01:21:58,628
-No, he didn't. I did.

1213
01:22:07,661 --> 01:22:08,878
<i>- Nikola.</i>

1214
01:22:24,446 --> 01:22:26,912
-Ask him if he knows
what happened to his parents.

1215
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,059
<i>- He knows.</i>

1216
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:42,896
-When he will tell him?

1217
01:22:46,997 --> 01:22:48,502
<i>- When war stops.</i>

1218
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,056
<i> When time comes.</i>

1219
01:23:21,271 --> 01:23:23,544
<i>- Let's go, let's go.
 Let's free some space here.</i>

1220
01:23:25,051 --> 01:23:26,971
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

1221
01:23:39,817 --> 01:23:41,065
-Make sure
you send a postcard.

1222
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:46,543
-Oh, yeah.

1223
01:23:48,017 --> 01:23:49,778
<i>- Here we are!</i>

1224
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:52,341
<i> The war plumbers.</i>

1225
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:54,775
<i> Unclogging pipes!</i>

1226
01:23:54,777 --> 01:23:58,362
You know, maybe I should be
moving along somewhere.

1227
01:23:58,364 --> 01:23:59,675
<i> Maybe Katya was right.</i>

1228
01:23:59,677 --> 01:24:01,405
<i> I should find a wife</i>

1229
01:24:01,407 --> 01:24:03,712
and have 2 and half kids.

1230
01:24:03,714 --> 01:24:06,851
Settle down.
-Fuck all that.

1231
01:24:06,853 --> 01:24:08,933
This is your home.

1232
01:24:08,935 --> 01:24:10,439
I mean..

1233
01:24:10,441 --> 01:24:13,322
...or wherever,
people need your help, b.

1234
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:16,813
<i> That's your family.</i>

1235
01:24:16,815 --> 01:24:19,279
<i> The family that waits for you.</i>

1236
01:24:19,281 --> 01:24:21,522
Misses you.

1237
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:24,405
<i> How many people can say..</i>

1238
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:28,280
...they are missed by people
they've never met before, huh?

1239
01:24:28,282 --> 01:24:29,562
Not many.

1240
01:24:30,491 --> 01:24:31,932
<i> Not many.</i>

1241
01:24:39,044 --> 01:24:40,773
Okay.

1242
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:41,861
Pull.

1243
01:24:41,863 --> 01:24:43,143
-Slowly!

1244
01:24:57,911 --> 01:24:59,831
<i> Allez, come on up, Romeo.</i>

1245
01:25:13,863 --> 01:25:16,360
-Whoa, whoa! What?

1246
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:17,673
Sophie!

1247
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,293
<i> Sophie!</i>

1248
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:25,297
What's going on?

1249
01:25:53,485 --> 01:25:56,271
Wh -- what's the problem?

1250
01:25:56,273 --> 01:25:58,674
-Are you in charge here?

1251
01:25:58,676 --> 01:25:59,859
-Yes, I am.

1252
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:03,062
-Yeah, I have a request
from, uh, ri -- richa..

1253
01:26:03,064 --> 01:26:05,529
Uh, Richardson?
-It's Richard.

1254
01:26:05,531 --> 01:26:07,354
-Oh, yes. Sophie Richard.

1255
01:26:07,356 --> 01:26:09,404
<i> It says, "inspection request</i>

1256
01:26:09,406 --> 01:26:12,576
uh, explosives."

1257
01:26:12,578 --> 01:26:15,234
You must abandon the extraction
of that corpse immediately.

1258
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,637
<i> It could be mined.
-But it's not.</i>

1259
01:26:19,047 --> 01:26:21,096
-May I?
-Sure.

1260
01:26:22,795 --> 01:26:25,004
-That's a mistake.

1261
01:26:25,006 --> 01:26:27,214
We've searched that well
inside out.

1262
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:29,744
There are no explosives
in there. It's all clear.

1263
01:26:29,746 --> 01:26:33,332
-Well, you may not be aware of
it, sir, but this is a red zone.

1264
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:35,126
There's been some changes
of jurisdiction

1265
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:38,041
and we handed everything over
to the local authorities.

1266
01:26:38,043 --> 01:26:40,700
<i>So mined or not, removing that dead body
 is illegal.
</i>

1267
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,640
-I can't believe this.
-But it's a basic sanitary service.

1268
01:26:44,642 --> 01:26:45,793
I mean,
with all due respect, sir

1269
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:47,587
it wouldn't matter
if it were a pig.

1270
01:26:47,589 --> 01:26:49,348
-Abandon the extraction
immediately.

1271
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:51,142
You need a judge present
to do what you're doing.

1272
01:26:51,144 --> 01:26:53,576
-A judge?
-Yes, a judge.

1273
01:26:53,578 --> 01:26:55,883
The area is now
under civil jurisdiction.

1274
01:26:55,885 --> 01:26:57,612
It's all here
in the peace agreements.

1275
01:26:57,614 --> 01:26:58,958
We must all respect procedure.

1276
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,399
-Where the hell
are we gonna find a judge?

1277
01:27:00,401 --> 01:27:01,904
-We will provide a judge.

1278
01:27:01,906 --> 01:27:03,314
Just notify
the local authorities.

1279
01:27:03,316 --> 01:27:05,108
Respect protocol.

1280
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:07,222
It's not your responsibility
to solve everything.

1281
01:27:07,224 --> 01:27:09,720
<i>- Can't you make an exception?
 The people here need water.</i>

1282
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:11,578
-Just abandon the extraction
from my request.

1283
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:14,173
Let us do our job. You might
be generating a conflict.

1284
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:16,159
<i>- But there already
 is a conflict here.</i>

1285
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,305
<i> If we do not clean the water,
 we won't need 1 judge</i>

1286
01:27:18,307 --> 01:27:20,227
<i> we'll need 20 judges.</i>

1287
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:21,669
<i>- We cannot make
 any exceptions, ma'am.</i>

1288
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,558
<i> It's all written
 in the peace agreements</i>

1289
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,377
<i> and it must be respected
 by all parties in conflict.</i>

1290
01:27:26,379 --> 01:27:29,356
It's very simple.
You cannot touch dead bodies.

1291
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:47,742
-Give me that rope.

1292
01:27:47,744 --> 01:27:49,312
That's our rope.

1293
01:27:49,313 --> 01:27:51,554
<i> Give it to me! Don't take it.</i>

1294
01:27:53,156 --> 01:27:54,437
You do nothing here!

1295
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:56,743
United nothing!
You're nothing!

1296
01:27:56,745 --> 01:27:58,537
<i>- I understand your reasoning</i>

1297
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:00,330
<i> but there's nothing else
 we can do.</i>

1298
01:28:00,332 --> 01:28:03,117
We understand that your work
is very important here.

1299
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,264
<i> Remember,
 we are on the same side.</i>

1300
01:28:05,266 --> 01:28:07,186
Stay out of trouble.

1301
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:33,451
-I'm sorry.

1302
01:29:15,062 --> 01:29:17,239
-Psst! Psst!

1303
01:29:20,059 --> 01:29:21,659
Excuse me!

1304
01:29:23,999 --> 01:29:26,176
Excuse me.

1305
01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:29,828
May I see the ball?

1306
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:33,286
-Huh?

1307
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:35,817
Is that the ball?

1308
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:39,245
Let me see the ball.
Let me see..

1309
01:29:39,247 --> 01:29:40,622
-Ooh!

1310
01:29:46,901 --> 01:29:48,342
-What's he doing?

1311
01:29:50,905 --> 01:29:52,666
-No, I just wanna
see the ball.

1312
01:29:52,668 --> 01:29:54,204
No, no, no, no.

1313
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:57,952
Huh?

1314
01:30:02,693 --> 01:30:04,614
This is not your ball!

1315
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,754
Get out of my face!

1316
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:23,961
-He says, uh,
Nikola sold it to them for $10.

1317
01:30:29,856 --> 01:30:31,617
-Bullshit.

1318
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:33,026
Bullshit.

1319
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,073
-Hey, Nikola!

1320
01:30:40,075 --> 01:30:41,995
Did you sell the ball?

1321
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,391
Yeah?

1322
01:31:23,445 --> 01:31:24,917
-Does it hurt?

1323
01:31:25,783 --> 01:31:27,288
-Nope.

1324
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,449
I thought you wanted that ball.

1325
01:31:38,307 --> 01:31:39,780
-I need money.

1326
01:31:41,511 --> 01:31:43,367
-What for?

1327
01:31:43,369 --> 01:31:45,770
-To go and see my parents
in donovich.

1328
01:31:49,999 --> 01:31:51,888
I have a friend.

1329
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:55,124
I pay,
he takes me where they are.

1330
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:57,622
I have $40,
only need 10 more.

1331
01:32:01,243 --> 01:32:03,291
-You can't do that.
-Yes, I can.

1332
01:32:03,293 --> 01:32:05,117
He has brother at checkpoint.

1333
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:07,680
-You pay, you go.
-You can't.

1334
01:32:07,682 --> 01:32:09,057
It's too dangerous.

1335
01:32:09,059 --> 01:32:12,325
-Not dangerous. You pay,
all is possible here.

1336
01:32:14,183 --> 01:32:16,104
-You can't do that.

1337
01:32:50,764 --> 01:32:52,364
Here's a $100.

1338
01:32:54,575 --> 01:32:56,464
On one condition.

1339
01:32:56,466 --> 01:32:58,867
You take your grandfather
on this trip.

1340
01:33:05,883 --> 01:33:08,124
Now put it in your pocket.

1341
01:33:08,126 --> 01:33:10,046
Put it in your pocket.

1342
01:33:24,237 --> 01:33:26,831
-Fat fucker.

1343
01:33:41,213 --> 01:33:44,256
<i>-  Mike 1, Mike 1. Hotel here.
 Come in, please.</i>

1344
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:49,029
<i>- This is Mike 1,
 come in. Over.</i>

1345
01:33:49,031 --> 01:33:51,143
<i>- We have a problem, mambru,
 in karaula</i>

1346
01:33:51,144 --> 01:33:53,000
<i> at the refugee camp.</i>

1347
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,826
<i> The latrines are flooded,
 somebody should go</i>

1348
01:33:54,828 --> 01:33:56,748
<i> check it out. Over.</i>

1349
01:33:59,471 --> 01:34:02,546
-Uh, should we go
straight there? Over.

1350
01:34:02,548 --> 01:34:04,083
<i>- I think you'd better.</i>

1351
01:34:04,085 --> 01:34:06,262
<i> There are 8000 refugees there.</i>

1352
01:34:06,263 --> 01:34:08,312
<i> That's a lot of latrines.
 Over.</i>

1353
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:11,900
-Okay, we're on our way.

1354
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:13,245
<i> Over and out.</i>

1355
01:34:18,211 --> 01:34:19,490
-I'm sorry.

1356
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,149
-No problem.

1357
01:34:22,151 --> 01:34:25,193
I'm curious to see if you guys
actually fix something here.

1358
01:34:29,613 --> 01:34:31,375
<i>- That camp was built
 in a big hurry.</i>

1359
01:34:31,377 --> 01:34:33,552
They got the drainage
wrong there.

1360
01:34:33,554 --> 01:34:36,372
The ditches must have collapsed
and all the waste overflows

1361
01:34:36,374 --> 01:34:39,478
<i> so we're probably looking
 at a swimming pool of shit.</i>

1362
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:42,586
<i> That'll make the well
 look like a mountain spring.</i>

1363
01:34:43,548 --> 01:34:45,725
-A perfect day.
-Yeah.

1364
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:48,575
-Hey, your first flooded
latrines are important too, Sophie.

1365
01:34:48,577 --> 01:34:50,497
You never forget them either.

1366
01:34:53,893 --> 01:34:55,751
-Is it gonna be rough?

1367
01:34:55,753 --> 01:34:59,146
-Nah, we'll be fine
as long as it doesn't rain.
