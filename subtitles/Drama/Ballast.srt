1
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,553
This is John Dixon. Are you in there?

2
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,511
Darrius?

3
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,908
Oh, that's... Lawrence, I'm sorry to bother you,
but people's been worried about you...

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,007
the store being
closed and all.

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,631
Are you okay?

6
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,079
Darrius?

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,879
Darrius.

8
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,876
You didn't call anybody?

9
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,519
Before too long, the dog...

10
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,750
I was sittin' on top,
and the deer came runnin'.

11
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,671
Yes.

12
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,830
This is John Dixon.

13
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,795
I wanna report a death.

14
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,438
Yes.

15
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,114
Darrius Batiste.

16
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,439
Darrius.

17
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,592
Lawrence, what's the address here?

18
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,793
Hold on.

19
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,398
It's 69... It's 69 Clayton Road.

20
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,516
No, I'm just a neighbour.

21
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,512
His brother's here,
but there's something wrong with him.

22
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,670
I can't get anything out of him.

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,751
He just walked out.

24
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,475
Yes, I'll stay here until someone arrives.

25
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,431
Yes, that's correct.

26
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,555
Okay.

27
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,473
About how long will that be?

28
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,828
Okay.

29
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,436
Oh, Jesus. Oh, man. Oh, God.

30
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,078
They're coming. They're coming.
Just hold on.

31
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,594
- Hey, what's his name?
- I only heard one. Lawrence.

32
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,671
Know any kind of medical history on him?

33
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,436
- Is he allergic to anything? Diabetic?
- No. No. I really don't know.

34
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,715
Yeah, we're definitely gonna have
to load and go with this guy.

35
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,749
Wow. What's this guy going?
About 270?

36
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,355
Lawrence. Hey, buddy.
Lawrence, stick with me, man.

37
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,715
- Go ahead and get that IV on that side.
- Okay.

38
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,439
- How far are we from the hospital, man?
- Ten minutes.

39
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,876
Emergistat 101.
Emergistat 101, Baptist ER.

40
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,190
This is Baptist. Go ahead.

41
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,432
En route with about a 35-year-old male,
gunshot wound times one to the right chest.

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,159
Initial GCS was about a six.

43
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,038
- Dropped down in the ambulance.
- Okay.

44
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,076
Got him decompressed times one.

45
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,469
- He's been tachycardic the entire time.
- Okay.

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,516
- About 110.
- Okay.

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,272
On three. One, two, three.

48
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,476
Last set of vitals... 90 over 40.

49
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,870
- How much fluid did he get?
- He's got about 250 in him.

50
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,951
Dopamine's at five.

51
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,039
Tube's at 25 at the T,
14 gauge, right AC.

52
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,588
- No other injuries, Doctor.
- Okay. Somebody help me turn him over.

53
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,356
Turn him over. Let me have a look.

54
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,112
Give me a pad.

55
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,435
Come here, boy. Come on.

56
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,274
Here. Come on. Come on, puppy. Here.

57
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,591
Here you go.

58
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,711
Hello, Lawrence.

59
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,388
You're in the hospital.

60
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,471
You've been here for about 10 days.

61
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,074
You had surgery,
and you're doing fine.

62
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,879
Your right lung
was pretty severely damaged.

63
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,434
You also had some pneumonia
after surgery.

64
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,876
That's why we had to keep you sedated
till it all cleared up.

65
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,396
I know the tube is bothering you,
but we'll remove that soon.

66
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,389
Okay?

67
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,759
Mr. Batiste?

68
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,276
Hey, Lawrence. How you doing?

69
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,438
I just wanna tell you
that I'm really sorry about your brother.

70
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,151
Are you doing okay?

71
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,918
I've been keeping your dog.
I thought you might want him back.

72
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,111
I guess you got a lot to deal with right now,
so I'll keep him a bit longer.

73
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,270
Are you sure you're all right?

74
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,870
You let me know if there's anything I can do
to help you, okay?

75
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,676
Come with me today, James.

76
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,159
Nuh uh.

77
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,151
Come on now. I'll be by myself.

78
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,271
So you can help me.

79
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,116
You can't sit here the whole break
by yourself doing nothing.

80
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,190
Just keep me company.

81
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,119
James?

82
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,319
Shit.

83
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,951
What the fuck you doing up in here,
little ass nigga?

84
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,031
Man, leave that nigga alone.

85
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,352
- What's up, man?
- Nothing much.

86
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,516
- You all right?
- Yeah.

87
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,036
Yo, I got another drop for you Tuesday, man.
Still got that bike?

88
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,072
All right, come by Tuesday
around 2:00, man.

89
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,913
I get that green stuff
you gave me last time?

90
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,429
I don't know, man,
'cause last time you still owed me.'

91
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,035
- So no, I don't think...
- I thought you said we were even.

92
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,635
No, man. Hey, look though, man.
Got to go, man.

93
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,159
You said I was gonna
get caught up last time.

94
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,392
Nah, dude.
Look though, man. You got to go, man.

95
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,914
Remember you said you were gonna...
how I was gonna get caught up...

96
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,991
Get the fuck out of here.

97
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,468
Yo, come by here Tuesday, man.

98
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,869
From now on, man,
you got to pay for what you want free.

99
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,996
No more freebies.

100
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,948
- Nigga's trying to get some free shit.
- Yeah, man.

101
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,312
- Bring your bike, dude.
- Leave that nigga alone, man.

102
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,597
- He's just a little kid and shit.
- Kid, my ass.

103
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,875
You have anything planned for tonight?

104
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,033
I was thinking about cooking up
a porterhouse.

105
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,111
Do you like steak?

106
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,593
Well, you wanna come over
about 6:00 then?

107
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,039
Okay.

108
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,951
You shot yourself?

109
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,471
Why?

110
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,551
With this?

111
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,636
Why'd you steal my gun?

112
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,233
Go inside.

113
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,229
- Did you call the police?
- No.

114
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,957
That's from the gun?

115
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,393
- You got a dog?
- Yes.

116
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,471
Where is he?

117
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,676
He's at a neighbour's.

118
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,671
Is it a wolf?

119
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,439
He's a halfwolf.

120
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,431
Is he mean?

121
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,714
No.

122
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,715
Let me see where you shot yourself.

123
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,393
I said let me see
where you shot yourself.

124
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,516
Why is it like that?

125
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,192
Like what?

126
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,316
There's two of'em.

127
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,436
That's from the gunshot.

128
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,398
That's where they took part of my lung.

129
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,199
Hey, sweetie,
what you doing still up?

130
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,990
You get that message I left you?

131
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,353
I had to work a few extra hours.

132
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,715
You know how that is.
If I didn't, he would have fired me.

133
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,190
- You get that sandwich I left you?
- Uh-huh.

134
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,116
Is that my present?

135
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,631
It's a Xbox?

136
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,353
I thought we couldn't afford one.

137
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,749
How was your day?

138
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,398
Okay.

139
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,471
Ready to go to bed?

140
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,998
Mama.

141
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,712
I seen this small sign on a telephone pole
say youth basketball sign-ups.

142
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,229
Think I could play this year?

143
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,710
I don't see why not.
Sound like a good idea to me.

144
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,711
It costs $20.

145
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,194
Well, maybe we can figure
something out.

146
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,835
- When is it?
- Friday.

147
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,435
From 5:00 to 9:00.

148
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,272
In Tchula?

149
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,351
Uh-huh, the community centre.

150
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,356
All right. Well, when I come back
from that lawyer, then we'll go, okay?

151
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,953
All right.

152
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,511
Come give me a hug.

153
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,588
I love you so much.

154
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,278
You love me?

155
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,713
Uh-huh.

156
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,153
Tell me.

157
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,071
I love you.

158
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,399
Good night.

159
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,154
- You need something, James?
- You got money?

160
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,232
In my wallet, on top of the microwave.

161
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,076
You only got nine bucks?

162
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,551
- Where's his wallet?
- It's next door.

163
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,631
Go get it.

164
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,312
I just need to get those key s there.

165
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,036
- Where is it?
- In the bedroom.

166
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,151
Go get it.

167
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,476
So how did he die?

168
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,551
He took pills and fell asleep.

169
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,671
- On purpose?
- Yes.

170
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,118
So how does that make you feel?

171
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,191
Just give me the wallet.

172
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,312
I don't feel nothing.

173
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,472
He was an asshole and a fucking coward.

174
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,596
Did your mama tell you that?

175
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,671
You both are.

176
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,951
I know you think a lot of ugly things
about Darrius, but he really loved you.

177
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,634
No, he didn't.
He never even came to see me once.

178
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,154
He couldn't, James.

179
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,915
Your mama asked the court
to make it illegal for him to see you.

180
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,991
You didn't know that?

181
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,078
It made his heart sick.

182
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,310
Well, he shouldn't have left
if it made him so sick.

183
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,396
Now, give me the wallet.

184
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,511
What up, man?

185
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,716
Hey, you got to leave, man.

186
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,199
I got money.

187
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,271
- How much?
- Enough.

188
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,828
- What up, man?
- What up, man?

189
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,233
- Get your little ass away from the door.
- How much?

190
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,878
- Two rocks.
- Two rocks?

191
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,475
Two rocks?

192
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,471
- That's 40. You got that much?
- Yeah.

193
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,280
- Where did you get it?
- I took it.

194
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,828
From who, your fine mom?

195
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,876
- His fine what?
- His mom.

196
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,112
- You'd fuck her too if you had the chance.
- I ain't fucking no old-ass pussy.

197
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,594
No shit.

198
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,956
Two rocks.

199
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,473
Straight.

200
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,910
Yo, dude, we're just messing
with you though, man.

201
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,638
You be all right.

202
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,992
And Baby's about his height.

203
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,674
Baby 's about...
I'd give him about this here tall.

204
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,228
He's very short,
but he's a stocky type dude.

205
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,118
I thought that motherfucker
was like about 6'3", 6'4".

206
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,633
Hell, no.

207
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,109
Hell, no. Shit.

208
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,033
- Oh, for real?
- Them two used to click.

209
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,758
- Yep.
- Yeah.

210
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,831
That'd be cool right there.

211
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,112
- What's up, man?
- Nothing much.

212
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,997
- What you doing?
- Playing Xbox.

213
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,593
Xbox?

214
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,112
What's up, little man?

215
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,750
All right, yo, man, you know
you owe us some money, right?

216
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,239
Huh?

217
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,958
You owe us some money, man.

218
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,952
All that stuff we've been giving you, man,
you ain't never paid me back for it.

219
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,875
I do drops for you, and then plus
I just gave you 40 yesterday.

220
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,996
That's the point.

221
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,278
Go back where you got the 40 from
and get more.

222
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,351
Everything will be straight.

223
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,791
Where she keep it anyway?

224
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,677
- Who?
- Your mama.

225
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,637
She ain't got no money.

226
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,632
- Hey, don't lie to me, man.
- I ain't lying to you.

227
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,199
I got it from somebody else.

228
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,392
- Who?
- A dude down there in Marks.

229
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,831
Well, until you get your money
from over in Marks, I'm taking this shit.

230
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,638
This shit too.

231
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,553
- Man, you can't take my mama's stuff.
- Get the fuck off of me.

232
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,030
I said get the fuck off.
Get the fuck off of me, nigga.

233
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,113
Yo, man, you owe us a hundred bucks,
man, you get your stuff back.

234
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,518
Let's go, man.

235
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,519
Let's go.

236
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,716
Try to catch up with those guys.

237
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,431
You're fucked, bitch.

238
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,716
Hey, baby, come on. We're late.

239
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,071
James, where you going?

240
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,470
James, did you forget
about basketball sign-ups?

241
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,152
I don't wanna do it.

242
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,753
Why not?

243
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,990
Close that door.

244
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,071
Come here.

245
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,517
What's wrong with you?

246
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,591
What happened to your face?

247
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,433
You got in another fight, didn't you?

248
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,919
Damn it, James.

249
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,275
You're not even in school now.

250
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,672
Come on.
We'll talk about it in the car.

251
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,193
Come on.
I'm already late for the lawyers.

252
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,392
Well, fine then.

253
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,471
I'll come back and pick you up
after I get back, okay?

254
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,909
And then we'll go
to basketball sign-ups.

255
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,199
Damn it.

256
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,831
What can I do for you, Ms. Sykes?

257
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,671
Recently, someone I know died
and left me and my son something...

258
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,320
and he left it on a piece of paper...

259
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,836
and I wanted to know
how to go about legalizing it.

260
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,672
Is it a will?

261
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,557
No. It's a letter.

262
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,518
Is it from the deceased's attorney?

263
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,160
No. It's just a letter from him.

264
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,356
Do you have it with you?

265
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,032
Yes.

266
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,554
But...

267
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,591
I don't have any money...

268
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,471
and I plan on selling what it was left...
that he left us, but...

269
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,391
How much is this gonna cost?

270
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,789
My hourly rate's $200.

271
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,472
Well, how long do you think
something like this may take?

272
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,553
I can't tell you that for certain
until I see what you've got there, ma'am.

273
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,194
Well, how much would it cost me
just for you to read it?

274
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,793
Not a penny.

275
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,950
I'll get your money today. I promise!

276
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,757
There ain't nothing in there.
You took it all last time.

277
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,355
Got more anywhere?

278
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,671
I'll give you money if you need it,
but you have to tell me what it's for.

279
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,955
Just give it to me!

280
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,157
If it's to buy drugs,
I ain't giving you any.

281
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,076
Just give it to me!

282
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,675
Not for that.
You're all fucked up now, aren't you?

283
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,990
You want me to shoot you?

284
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,752
You can shoot me if you want.

285
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,996
I'll shoot you!

286
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,513
I don't care.

287
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,750
I'll shoot you, motherfuck!

288
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,271
Motherfuck!

289
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,391
James, what's wrong?

290
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,791
What's going on with you today?

291
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,476
Come here. What's wrong?

292
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,039
Come here.

293
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,073
Tell me.

294
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,469
I need a hundred dollars.

295
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,472
You need a hundred dollars for what?

296
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,790
I broke somebody's TV.

297
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,394
You broke somebody's TV. Whose?

298
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,835
Sit down. Sit down.

299
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,110
And when do you have to have it?

300
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,111
Fast.

301
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,191
Like today?

302
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,313
James, I ain't got that kind of money.

303
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,399
All right.

304
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,431
Maybe we can go to the ATM
and see what we've got...

305
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,795
and we'll figure out
what we can do about the rest.

306
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,799
Come on.

307
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,718
Get away, Mom! Get away!

308
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,634
Boy, what is wrong with you today?

309
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,598
Damn, James.

310
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,598
- Go around, mom. Mom, go around.
- Look at this fool here.

311
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,630
- Who is this?
- Go around, Mom.

312
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,836
James, what is going on?

313
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,550
- Get away from 'em.
- Get away from who? Who is that?

314
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,993
Get away from 'em, Mom.

315
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,919
Mom, look out. Look out.

316
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,759
Mom, get out! Mom, get out!

317
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,238
Jarrel, car! Come on, man.

318
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,554
Sweetie, you gotta tell me what is going on.

319
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,155
Sweetie... Talk to me, sweetheart.

320
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,190
Tell me what's going on.

321
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,677
Tell me!

322
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,035
This is our house. I got the papers to say so.
So stay the fuck away from here!

323
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,878
Look. We ain't gonna be here long.

324
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,633
So you stay away from us,
and we'll stay away from you.

325
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,075
And I'll let you know
what we're gonna do about it later.

326
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,151
- About what?
- The house!

327
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,113
- What about it?
- Selling it!

328
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,230
You can't sell that house.

329
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,276
I can do what I want.
He gave it to us.

330
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,954
You delivered the letter.
You don't know what it says?

331
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,674
This is all one property.

332
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,910
You can talk to my smart-ass lawyer
about that.

333
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,036
And we'll figure out what we're
gonna do about the store later.

334
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,599
The store?

335
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,194
What are you doing to me, Marlee?

336
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,238
What am I doing to you?
This is your fault.

337
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,790
If it weren't for you and your brother,
I wouldn't be in this situation.

338
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,871
Now, stay the fuck away from us!

339
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,756
Stay away from him.

340
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,711
You got my keys?

341
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,677
And don't go anywhere
until I get back from work.

342
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,470
He fired me.

343
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,391
He said I couldn't work this way.

344
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,471
I had to take a sick leave.

345
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,790
And I've already had too many,
so I'm out!

346
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,998
He said I couldn't work like this
'cause it's disturbing for the clients.

347
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,953
Like the motherfuckers
even know I'm there!

348
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,071
I'm invisible to them!

349
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,637
I'm so sick of this shit!

350
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:23,998
Mom?

351
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,117
- Hi, Mr. Dixon.
- Hey, Lawrence.

352
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,034
I was wondering
if I can have Juneau back now.

353
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,318
Good boy.
I'll see you tonight.

354
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,839
Whoa.

355
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,159
Who dog?

356
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,591
Juneau.

357
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,034
Where you get that?

358
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,918
Up there. There's another one.

359
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,319
- You gonna make another one?
- Uh-huh.

360
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,759
For me?

361
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,510
Yep.

362
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,396
Sweetie, sit down.
Go on. Sit down and eat. I'll do this.

363
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,279
Is that Lawrence's dog?

364
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,430
And my dad's.

365
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,399
James, we can't afford to feed no dog
right now, especially theirs.

366
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,233
Come on. Out, out, out, out.

367
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,154
Out, dog, out. Out.

368
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,835
Who are you and you and you?

369
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,832
- I'm Little Bo Peep.
- And we're her sheep!

370
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,516
Are we gonna get more stuff to eat?

371
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,153
Mom?

372
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,954
I have to get another job.

373
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,678
When?

374
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,596
It's for groceries.

375
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,910
My mom only has three dollars.

376
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,480
Does she know you're here?

377
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,836
No. She's sleeping.

378
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,476
So what do you like to eat?

379
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,993
This too?

380
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,958
Take what you want.

381
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,674
We're gonna have to go to Simpson's
for perishables.

382
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,877
Anything?

383
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,559
$33.99.

384
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,394
Where'd that box come from?

385
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,198
- I got it for us.
- Where?

386
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,714
Lawrence gave it to us from his store.

387
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,597
I told you not to talk to him.

388
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,592
- So what we gonna do about it?
- What?

389
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,757
- The store.
- Sell it. I don't care.

390
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,430
Well, how would that work?
You gonna buy our half out from us?

391
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,311
We sell it to someone and split the money.
Someone will want it.

392
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,710
Then what you gonna do?

393
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,030
What about the house?

394
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,031
The same.

395
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,398
Sell both?

396
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,552
No one's gonna buy
one of these houses by itself.

397
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,756
The property's only worth
something intact.

398
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,554
This ain't no more
of your manipulating shit?

399
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,234
I'm just trying to do what's right
about my child.

400
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,198
I don't need this shit right now,
Lawrence.

401
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,157
Do whatever you want.

402
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,470
Juneau. Juneau. Juneau.

403
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,199
My dad was a deejay or something?

404
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,672
We had a show at WPPK.

405
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,513
Remember that old radio tower on
Money Road out by you guys?

406
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,068
- Uh-huh.
- That was it.

407
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,356
So why aren't you still doing it?

408
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,158
We had to work the store
when daddy got sick.

409
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,438
Do you take the dog on walks?

410
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,953
Sometimes.

411
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,554
Could I take him on a walk?

412
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,316
You better put this leash on him.
If he scents a deer, he'll strike out.

413
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,873
You can come if you want.

414
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,952
If you're almost the same person...

415
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,636
and have the same feelings as my dad,
did you love my mom too?

416
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,438
No.

417
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,238
Did she love you?

418
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,639
No.

419
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,234
Why not, if you're the same as him?

420
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,117
We're not exactly the same.

421
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,555
What's different?

422
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,838
Little things. I'm a half inch taller.

423
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,070
He's better at math.

424
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,673
Things like that.

425
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,995
So how'd it happen?

426
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,718
Talking about twins?

427
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,552
Uh-huh.

428
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,234
You know about the eggs
in a woman's ovaries?

429
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,397
Yeah, they teach us that in school.

430
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,278
They come from one egg
that splits in two.

431
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,318
They form two people that are
genetic copies of each other.

432
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,355
Did you ask the court to make it illegal
for my dad to see me?

433
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,995
You no good motherfucker,
you never stop, do you?

434
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,992
How the fuck you gonna tell James
I had Darrius barred from seeing him?

435
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,792
'Cause it's the truth.

436
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,394
He left us first. Why the hell
you didn't tell him that truth?

437
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,755
How you gonna fill his head with some
fucked-up bullshit about his father loving him...

438
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,348
making him out like some goddamn hero
and me some crazy woman?

439
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,395
He left us like a fucking coward.

440
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,711
Look...

441
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,995
Are we gonna start this again?

442
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,629
Hell, yeah. If you gonna
poison my child against me...

443
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,950
like the only other person I loved
against me...

444
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,077
You never loved Darrius.
You only wanted what he could offer you.

445
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,230
Why you don't know shit
about your own twin?

446
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,835
It took our dad a whole lifetime to
save up enough to buy this property...

447
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,038
and you just think you can walk in our lives
in one day and piss that all away?

448
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,429
That's a pretty fucked-up kind of love,
don't you think?

449
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,033
A fucked-up kind of love?

450
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,111
Let me tell you
what's a fucked-up kind of love...

451
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,111
Being so terrified of your brother wanting...

452
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,236
You were an addict, Marlee.

453
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,949
- Where was that money really going to?
- Fuck you!

454
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:46,079
You were so terrified of him having something
out of life, wanting something different...

455
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,311
you was willing to destroy
his whole damn family! Huh?

456
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,119
Weren't you?
For what?

457
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,351
To be caught in some
sick little prison of yours?

458
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,749
That's a truly fucked-up kind of love!

459
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,719
You will never comprehend
my love for him.

460
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,711
You call that shit love?

461
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,633
That bullshit you whispered in his ear
about me was love?

462
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,633
Look what your love did to him!

463
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,673
I don't think selling the store
is a good idea.

464
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,198
Like you said, it's a good solid business.
It's making money.

465
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,835
I can't help you.

466
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,433
That's okay.

467
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,955
So, I don't know how that would work.

468
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,356
I can do it myself.
I can get James to help me.

469
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,629
I can do it. I can.
I'm a hard worker.

470
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,235
And when I feel passion about something,
I work hard at it.

471
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,788
I can make it happen.

472
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,792
So you feel passion for that store now?

473
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,758
I can't help you.

474
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,230
Then I'm going to do it, okay?

475
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,828
I need a salary or something.

476
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,957
Lawrence, please.

477
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,476
Your cash sales will be about 2,000 a week.

478
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,551
Take it out of that.

479
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,394
- Well, how much?
- However much you want.

480
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,190
- You all open again?
- Yes.

481
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,396
- Pumps too?
- Yes.

482
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,118
Is Lawrence back?

483
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,031
No.

484
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:59,591
- All right, I'll just go ahead on and...
- Hey, how you all do it?

485
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,990
Do you pump first then pay,
or do you pay first then pump?

486
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,595
Well, I usually pump then come in and
get my coffee and pay for it at the end.

487
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:13,272
Excuse me? Excuse me.
I only can take cash today.

488
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,315
Okay.

489
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,790
Twenty-seven new messages.

490
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,917
Tuesday, 1:59 P.M.

491
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,675
Hi. This is Jumbo calling
from Delta Wholesale Beverage.

492
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,228
We been trying to get in touch
with you over the last couple days.

493
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,639
Haven't heard back from you yet.

494
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,599
We wanted to make sure that you
still needed deliveries at your store.

495
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,712
We sent two trucks by and...

496
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,954
Jorgenson's Dairy calling
for Lawrence Batiste or Darrius Batiste.

497
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,508
Apparently, no one has been
available at your store...

498
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,239
to accept deliveries
in our last three attempts...

499
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,311
What about the cancelled accounts?

500
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,034
I can call and have them...

501
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,759
and set them up for you
if you want me to.

502
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,473
I don't want to deal
with that place any more.

503
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,955
You have to.

504
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,155
Why do I have to?

505
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,711
Right.
Everything with an expiration date on it.

506
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,030
We're running low on beverages too.

507
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,520
So what do you supply to us?

508
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,200
So do I call you with that or fax it?

509
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,752
No. "Sykes."

510
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:28,630
S-Y-K-E-S.

511
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,359
No, he's not.

512
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,951
What up, player?

513
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,552
What's up, little man?

514
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,116
Hi, Uncle Lawrence.

515
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,112
Hi, James.

516
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,637
- Hi.
- Hi.

517
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,191
Delta delivered again?

518
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,874
Yeah, I worked it out with them.

519
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,910
I can go over those things with you now,
if you want.

520
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,556
Want to start
with the credit card machine?

521
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,198
I figured it out.

522
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,191
You did?

523
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,431
I called the number on the machine,
and they walked me through it.

524
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,675
You know about running the batch
at the end of the day?

525
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,789
Uh-huh.

526
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,110
Okay.

527
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,477
This is the paperwork for the store.
This is the rest.

528
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,360
It's not safe to keep anything
in the register overnight...

529
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,795
so we deposit each day.

530
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,350
We should make you a co-signee now...

531
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,910
so you can start writing checks
and making deposits.

532
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,513
Okay.

533
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,113
You should probably start checking the mail
every day for supplier invoices now.

534
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,473
Okay.

535
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,438
Did you figure out the gas machine too?

536
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,078
Okay, will this be all for you?

537
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,390
- That's all, thank you.
- Okay.

538
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,918
- And 22 cents is your change.
- Okay, thank you.

539
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,513
Here's a bag for you.

540
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,319
Thank you.

541
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,914
- Okay, have a good one.
- You too.

542
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,592
- Hello. How you doing?
- How are you, ma'am? Fine.

543
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,636
- Have a good day.
- You do the same.

544
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,510
So, we're good?

545
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,319
Uh-huh. Tomorrow then?
Bookkeeping?

546
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,235
- Around the same time?
- Okay.

547
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,711
So what about school?

548
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,310
What happens when his break ends?

549
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,273
I don't know. He ain't going back
to that shit school.

550
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,998
You're transferring him?

551
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,436
No. All the schools around here
ain't shit.

552
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,797
He has to go to school.

553
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,836
Why? They ain't teaching him nothing.

554
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,433
The only thing he learning up there
is how to take drugs and get beat up on.

555
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,516
You could home school him.

556
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,232
I could help you.

557
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,789
Why?

558
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,471
See you tomorrow
about the same time.

559
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,836
Okay. Could I call you
if I have any questions?

560
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,037
- All right.
- I need your number.

561
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,758
Hold on.

562
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,351
- Okay.
- All right, see you.

563
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,431
All right, see you later.

564
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,111
Kitty.

565
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,797
Hello, kitty.

566
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,309
Kitty.

567
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,870
Hi, Lawrence. It's me, Marlee.

568
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,834
No, it's fine. Actually, I was calling
about the homeschooling thing.

569
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,272
I wanted to know
if you had time to talk about it.

570
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,640
That's it?

571
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,075
"File a certificate of enrolment...

572
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,754
with the admissions office
in the county of residence"?

573
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,189
What if they reject it?

574
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,594
They can't.

575
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,677
There's requirements
for what he has to study, right?

576
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,469
No. It's whatever you think
he should learn.

577
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,632
Does he have to pass a test
or something to keep qualifying?

578
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,631
We could sign up for those youth leagues.

579
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,599
Basketball, football, soccer.

580
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,317
I bet...
I bet we'll have enough now.

581
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,359
He could do some of the teaching.

582
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,158
Can't be no worse than the teachers
you already have.

583
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,829
But only if you want to.
If you don't want to, we don't have to.

584
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,911
You think it could work?

585
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,913
So this alternating days thing,
is that gonna be okay with you?

586
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,713
What if I worked some of the hours
at the store on the days you teach?

587
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,388
So you can just teach in the day.

588
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,748
How would the salary work?

589
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,071
Just take what you're taking now,
full-time.

590
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,991
For half the hours?

591
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,355
That's the way it worked
with Darrius and me.

592
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,234
But you both worked full-time.

593
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,871
We were both there full-time,
but it only takes one person.

594
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,633
So we basically just double-paid.

595
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,833
But you were the owners.
It's your money anyway.

596
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,639
You're an owner now.

597
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,553
So why didn't you alternate days
and pay yourself the same?

598
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,473
You could've had
all that time for yourself.

599
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,471
For what?

600
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,470
I don't know.

601
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,313
You could've travelled
somewhere or something.

602
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,829
We'd want to do that together.

603
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,868
I'm sorry about your brother,
Lawrence.

604
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,316
It's hard for me to talk about it too.

605
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,876
But I want you to know I'm sorry.

606
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,352
What's that?

607
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,396
Pre-algebra.

608
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,469
Yikes.

609
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,268
We're making some spaghetti.
Would you like some?

610
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,513
No. I'm all right.

611
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,592
It's just spaghetti. No big deal.

612
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,072
I know...

613
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,436
that the things you been doing...

614
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,550
with James are genuine.

615
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,231
It's confusing, but it makes sense.

616
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,308
I mean, genetically and all.

617
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,835
That's why I'm saying I'm sorry.

618
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,189
I don't know what I'm saying, but...

619
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,240
What the fuck you doing?

620
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,632
Shit!

621
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,556
Is this what it was all about?

622
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,751
Is this what you was after?

623
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,314
God damn it,
I already took him out of school!

624
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,754
Why you doing this?!

625
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,194
Is he still gonna teach me tomorrow?

626
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,476
I don't know.

627
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,836
Am I going back to my school?

628
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,834
No.

629
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,670
Come on, Lawrence.

630
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,677
- Lawrence...
- Please just leave me alone.

631
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,710
He's gonna try it again.

632
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,792
I'm late, James.

633
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,388
I'll help you with your math
when I get back tonight...

634
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,073
but until then you're gonna have to try
by yourself, okay?

635
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,149
Hey, baby, it's me. Pick up. James?

636
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,038
Hello?

637
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,312
Uh-huh.

638
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,275
I tried, but it's too hard.

639
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,590
I did. I don't know how to do it.

640
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,312
I did look at that one.

641
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,194
No, he went somewhere.

642
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,793
I don't know.

643
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,876
Where are the shells, James?

644
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,871
- Show me.
- Shells for a gun?

645
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,439
- They 're not in there.
- Where are they?

646
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,476
Out in the field.

647
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,515
Where?

648
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,511
- You took his gun?
- No.

649
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,034
Because I hid it from you.
But you got another one, don't you?

650
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,075
No.

651
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,799
God damn it, James!
You promised me no more guns.

652
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,155
- Where?
- Farther.

653
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,350
Why you doing this?

654
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,110
You got your books?

655
01:33:00,111 --> 01:33:01,111
