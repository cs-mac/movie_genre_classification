1
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,355
Stop now.

2
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,673
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,953
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,308
I don't know what
you are talking about.

5
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,555
-Please.
-As you wish.

7
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,279
Wait!

8
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,310
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,637
In the sacristy...

10
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,157
...the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,396
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,393
Thank you.

13
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,829
Thank you.

14
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,715
Thank you.

15
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,230
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

16
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,918
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

17
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,998
...but which words?

18
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,156
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

19
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,555
-Hatred, racism.
-Ku Klux Klan.

20
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,788
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

21
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,317
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

22
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,551
Now this symbol. Anyone?

23
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,875
Evil.

24
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,189
In English, please.

25
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,389
Devil's pitchfork.

26
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,670
Poor, poor Poseidon.

27
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,148
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

28
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,475
Now this symbol.

29
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,835
-Madonna and child.
-Faith. Christianity.

30
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,635
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, lsis...

31
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,274
...centuries before
the birth of Christ.

32
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,029
Understanding our past
determines actively...

33
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,152
...our ability to understand
the present.

34
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,792
So how do we sift truth from belief?

35
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,436
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

36
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,631
...and thereby define ourselves?

37
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,992
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

38
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,113
...to find original truth?

39
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,392
Tonight, this will be our quest.

40
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,560
I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

41
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,755
I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

42
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,876
I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

43
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,233
Sure, I can do that.

44
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,273
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

45
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,596
-Michael Culp? He adores you.
-Oh, yeah.

46
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,751
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

47
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,748
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

48
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,279
He told me. Thank you.

49
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,708
Mr. Langdon?

50
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,674
Hi.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,149
Bonjour, professor.

52
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,114
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBl.

53
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,068
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

54
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,999
My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,636
...considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...

56
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,239
...you might assist us.

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,591
Will you excuse me a moment?

58
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,478
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

59
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,829
Yes, we know.

60
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,156
We found your name
in his daily planner.

61
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,874
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.

62
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,600
Why would someone do this to him?

63
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,758
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

64
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,111
He was shot, yes.

65
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,868
But what you see
in the photograph...

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,548
...Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

67
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,633
Teacher, all four are dead.

68
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,432
The sénéchaux and the
Grand Master himself.

69
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,552
Then I assume
you have the location.

70
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,718
Confirmed by all.

71
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,195
Independently.

72
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,078
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

73
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,433
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

74
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,035
It is here.

75
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,595
In Paris, Teacher.

76
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,759
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

77
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,874
You will go forth, Silas.

78
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,156
I chastise my body.

79
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,431
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

80
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,668
Okay.

81
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,913
-Mr. Langdon.
-Yes.

82
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,237
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

83
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,599
You like our pyramid?

84
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,789
It's magnificent.

85
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,431
A scar on the face of Paris.

86
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,278
After me, please.

87
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,671
It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.

88
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,388
It's unique.

89
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,636
The two are geometric echoes.

90
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,795
Fascinating.

91
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,796
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

92
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,111
How well did you know the curator?

93
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,392
Not at all. We met only once.

94
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,795
We were on a....

95
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,070
On a panel together.

96
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,748
Something is funny?

97
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,553
We didn't agree on much.

98
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,150
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

99
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,150
Could we take the stairs?

100
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,277
So Saunière requested
tonight's meeting.

101
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,549
Yes.

102
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,159
How? Did he call you?

103
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,872
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

104
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,638
Had something to discuss.

105
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,875
What?

106
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,837
You seem uncomfortable.

107
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,836
-Are any of those real?
-Of course not.

108
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,589
So you know something
of security procedures.

109
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,839
Well, I know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.

110
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,429
Most now rely on containment.

111
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,677
Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.

112
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,950
Now we keep them in.

113
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,199
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

114
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,072
How would you know that?

115
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,790
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.

116
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,068
Dear God.

117
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,915
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

118
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,873
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

119
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,072
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

120
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,874
-We are a simple Catholic church.
-Simple?

121
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,674
With a brand-new $47-million
headquarters in Manhattan.

122
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,838
Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?

123
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,235
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

124
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,476
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

125
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,199
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

126
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,356
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

127
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,074
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

128
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,389
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

129
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,592
...and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

130
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,073
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

131
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,079
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...

132
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,748
...in the cloisters
of our residential halls.

133
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,115
But we are all united in God's work
around the world.

134
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,949
Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one's life.

135
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,914
Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?

136
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,669
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

137
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,595
And because the war finally
draws to a close.

138
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,634
-Bishop, we need to stay on message.
-That will be all, Michael, thank you.

139
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,989
Aringarosa.

140
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,635
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.

141
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,757
It hides beneath the Rose.

142
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,958
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

143
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,392
I meet the council in an hour.

144
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,275
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

145
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,194
The Vitruvian Man.

146
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,472
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

147
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,511
And the star on his skin?

148
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,915
A pentacle.

149
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,678
And its meaning?

150
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,199
The pentacle is ancient.

151
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,037
Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.

152
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,708
This symbol, professor.
This setting.

153
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,990
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

154
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,159
Devil worship.

155
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,911
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

156
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,470
This is a symbol for Venus.

157
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,350
It represents the female half
of all things.

158
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,597
It's a concept called "the divine
goddess" by religious historians.

159
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,152
You are telling me that
Saunière's last act on earth...

160
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,592
...was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

161
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,037
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

162
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,356
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

163
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,154
...and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

164
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,679
-ls that so?
-Yes.

165
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,029
Then...

166
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,078
...what do you make of this?

167
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,553
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."

168
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,797
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

169
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,510
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

170
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,351
Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.

171
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,075
Precisely.

172
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,358
Precisely.

173
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,595
So, professor--

174
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,991
Officer Neveu.

175
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,599
Please, pardon the interruption.

176
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,755
This is not the time.

177
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,951
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

178
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,878
...and I've deciphered the code.

179
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,719
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

180
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,195
That's the code Saunière
left on the floor.

181
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,551
Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.

182
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,954
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

183
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,559
The numbers are out of order.

184
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,433
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

185
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,993
Right?

186
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,394
Pardon me?

187
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,592
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

188
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,711
Your embassy called Division.

189
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,399
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

190
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,551
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

191
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,479
Well, thank you.

192
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,550
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

193
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,034
Miss Neveu? This....

194
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,719
No. That's the right number.

195
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,275
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

196
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,435
But I'm getting--

197
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,393
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

198
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,952
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

199
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,277
You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...

200
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,675
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

201
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,836
You are in grave danger.

202
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,073
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

203
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,873
Good evening, Sister.

204
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,475
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

205
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,239
Of course, Father.

206
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,392
But so late?

207
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,555
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

208
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,276
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,309
It would be my pleasure.

210
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,192
There's been an accident. A friend.

211
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,311
I have to fly home in the morning.

212
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,714
I see.

213
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,799
Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.

214
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,069
Yes.

215
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,311
She said it is meaningless.

216
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,318
Mathematical joke.

217
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,032
Is it meaningless?

218
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,556
I'll take another look
when I come back.

219
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,629
I'm sorry. Of course.

220
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,836
Do you have a message
from Saunière?

221
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,078
What are you talking about?

222
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,559
Crazy old man.

223
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,228
You have me confused with
someone else.

224
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,112
I was asked to come here
and consult.

225
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,117
No, you are
sous surveillance cachée.

226
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,833
Yes, and--

227
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,553
What?

228
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,469
Bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.

229
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,669
Suspect?

230
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,838
Check your jacket pocket.

231
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,308
Just look.

232
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,839
GPS tracking dot.

233
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,952
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

234
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,550
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...

235
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,916
...in case you tried to run.

236
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,954
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

237
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,031
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

238
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,119
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...

239
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
...Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

240
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,633
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

241
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,999
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

242
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,791
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

243
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,439
He is sure you're guilty.

244
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,428
When did Saunière contact you?

245
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,629
-Today?
-Yes, yes.

246
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,796
What time? What time?

247
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,752
At 3. Around 3. Three.

248
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,554
The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were--

249
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,352
-I was giving a lecture.
-At 9.

250
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,111
You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?

251
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,869
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

252
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,117
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

253
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,517
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

254
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,711
Stop it! Just stop!

255
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,753
Who are you?

256
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,190
What are you talking about?
Tell you what?

257
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,596
Maybe who really killed him.

258
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,434
The Fibonacci sequence.

259
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,710
I believe Saunière wrote it...

260
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,673
...so his investigation would
include cryptographers.

261
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,272
That's quite a leap, isn't it?

262
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,833
No.

263
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,638
And the letters.

264
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,875
"P.S."

265
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,638
P.S., postscript.

266
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,228
"Princess Sophie."
Yeah. Silly, I know.

267
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,193
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

268
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,954
Jacques Saunière
was my grandfather.

269
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,117
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

270
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,956
If you help me understand why...

271
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,675
...I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

272
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,519
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

273
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,468
No.

274
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,949
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

275
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,755
What exactly do you propose?

276
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,593
Saunière was reading his book.

277
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,831
"Blood trail."

278
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,438
Excuse me, captain.

279
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,519
Crypto called.
They identified the code.

280
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,438
Neveu told us already.

281
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,269
I should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.

282
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,311
Yes.

283
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,909
Except they didn't send Neveu.

284
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,349
What?

285
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,791
Captain, look at this.

286
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,634
He jumped!

287
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,029
Shit.

288
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,238
He's moving again. And fast.

289
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,512
He must be in a car.

290
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,913
He's going south
on Pont du Carrousel.

291
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,508
Bastard.

292
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,032
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

293
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,715
I will only take a moment.

294
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,434
Of course.

295
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,870
He is much older than I remember.

296
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,396
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

297
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,908
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

298
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,958
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

299
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,677
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

300
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,033
It seems when
he couldn't speak to me...

301
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,031
...he reached out to you.

302
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,560
Whatever he needed
so badly to say...

303
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,273
...he found neither of us in time.

304
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,755
-Wait a minute.
-Professor?

305
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,392
Come on.

306
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,233
It can't be that easy.

307
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,272
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

308
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,230
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

309
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,839
These are scrambled.

310
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,635
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

311
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,592
Would you hold this, please?

312
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,716
This phrase is meaningless.

313
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,078
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

314
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,349
An anagram.

315
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,312
You have eidetic memory?

316
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,036
Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.

317
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,437
Anagram is right.

318
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,228
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"
becomes:

319
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,954
"Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa."

320
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,675
Professor, the Mona Lisa
is right over here.

321
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,430
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

322
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,313
Smart to hit the truck.

323
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,076
What, you admire him now?

324
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,631
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

325
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,434
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

326
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,718
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

327
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,356
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

328
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,549
Why?

329
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,911
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

330
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,078
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

331
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,279
The sacred feminine.

332
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,909
Why do you say that?

333
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,193
Something Saunière said
the first time we came here.

334
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,552
There. Blood.

335
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,389
Hey.

336
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,594
"So dark the con of man."

337
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,511
No. It doesn't say that.

338
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,870
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?

339
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,995
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

340
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,353
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

341
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,434
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

342
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,629
Madonna of the Rocks.

343
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,429
Da Vinci.

344
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,112
Careful. Careful.

345
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,949
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

346
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,032
Stay where you are!

347
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,233
Let go of the painting...

348
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,112
...and put it on the ground.

349
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,039
No. You put your gun down.

350
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,231
Now!

351
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,953
Or else I will destroy the painting.

352
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,119
Hurry up!

353
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,038
Slide your gun to me.

354
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,199
Be careful.

355
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,231
I never really liked this painting.

356
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,554
Run.

357
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,032
It was Saunière's.

358
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,473
I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.

359
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,436
He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.

360
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,316
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

361
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,839
"So dark the con of man"?

362
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,598
No. Have you?

363
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,076
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

364
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,470
Anything ritualistic in nature?

365
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,797
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

366
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,276
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

367
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,278
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

368
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,835
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

369
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,318
One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

370
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,909
...Sir lsaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

371
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,078
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

372
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,669
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

373
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,950
...as "the dark con of man."

374
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,913
But what secret?

375
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,514
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

376
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,877
I can't do this by myself.

377
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,198
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

378
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,435
Please.

379
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,039
Even if we could get out of this--

380
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,639
Okay.

381
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,711
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

382
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,314
Well, that was....

383
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,758
We won't last long in this car.

384
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,679
Fache doesn't like to be eluded,
even on a good day.

385
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,598
We need to get out of sight.

386
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,436
Christ, give me strength.

387
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,308
You are a ghost.

388
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,756
Christ, give me strength.

389
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,308
Stealing in a house of God!

390
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,997
You are an angel.

391
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,516
Christ, give me strength.

392
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,030
You have powerful friends.

393
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,752
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

394
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,154
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

395
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,355
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

396
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,437
The light is not ideal.

397
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,239
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

398
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,595
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

399
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,510
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...

400
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,109
...mark the world's
first prime meridian...

401
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,675
...which passed through
this very church.

402
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,598
It hides beneath the Rose.

403
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,949
I'm sorry?

404
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,349
Sister.

405
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,111
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

406
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,269
I insist.

407
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,153
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

408
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,319
And with you.

409
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,990
Grey Smart Car. Black roof.

410
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,590
Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.

411
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,949
How could you let them get away?

412
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,958
Why not just shoot the damn painting?
Imbecile!

413
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,879
You should put his cigar
out in your hand!

414
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,354
Get out of here!

415
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,792
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

416
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,996
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

417
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,639
A decoy, I'm sure.

418
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,149
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

419
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,914
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

420
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,714
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

421
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,755
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

422
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,753
Robert Langdon is guilty.

423
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,038
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

424
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,959
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

425
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,157
Your police don't patrol this park.

426
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,228
Stay here.

427
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,028
Police.

428
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,668
What do you want?

429
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,876
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

430
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,031
Go and get something to eat.

431
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,311
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

432
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,592
No. And now we have
a place to think.

433
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,718
Any ideas, professor?

434
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,270
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

435
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,596
"What's the next step?"

436
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,358
With him, it's always:

437
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,518
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

438
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,514
Puzzles.

439
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,039
Codes.

440
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,035
A treasure hunt.

441
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,514
To find his killer.

442
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,876
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

443
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,035
I hope not.

444
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,831
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

445
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,277
It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...

446
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,789
...conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.

447
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,151
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...

448
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,716
...was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

449
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,239
...the Priory of Sion...

450
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,319
...and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

451
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,672
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

452
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,714
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

453
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,232
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artefact...

454
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,192
...Iost since the time of Christ.

455
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,359
An artefact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

456
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,028
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

457
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,394
Put it this way:

458
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,353
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

459
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,870
They quit the Holy Land
and travelled directly to Rome.

460
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,877
Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...

461
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,389
...or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

462
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,798
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...

463
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,470
... these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.

464
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,317
By the 1300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.

465
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,839
Too threatening.

466
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,191
So the Vatican
issued secret orders...

467
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,198
... to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

468
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,754
The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...

469
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,317
...and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

470
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,829
The plan went off like clockwork.

471
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,873
The Templars
were all but exterminated.

472
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,119
The date was October 13th, 1307.
A Friday.

473
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,151
Friday the 13th.

474
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,278
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure...

475
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,993
...but they found nothing.

476
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,317
The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...

477
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,239
...and the search for their
sacred artefact began again.

478
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,399
What artefact? I've never
heard about any of this.

479
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,033
Yes, you have.

480
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,675
Almost everyone on earth has.

481
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,033
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

482
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,399
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

483
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,597
Maybe more than that.

484
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,554
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

485
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,754
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern lD stamp.

486
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,757
"Haxo 24."

487
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,871
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

488
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,595
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

489
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,315
He left us, professor.

490
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,832
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an lD stamp.

491
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,277
It's a street address.

492
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,439
This is Jacques Saunière.

493
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,513
Please leave a message
after the tone.

494
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,470
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

495
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,159
This is Sandrine Bieil.

496
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,556
I have called the list.

497
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,797
I fear the other guardians are dead.

498
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,197
The lie has been told.

499
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,357
The floor panel has been broken.

500
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,876
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

501
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,196
Job 38, verse 1 1.

502
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,391
Do you know it, Sister?

503
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,792
Job 38:1 1.

504
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,516
Hitherto shalt thou come...

505
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,998
...but no further.

506
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,519
"But no further."

507
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,272
Do you mock me?

508
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,276
Where is the keystone?

509
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,752
I do not know.

510
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,829
No.

511
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,679
You are a sister of the Church...

512
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,791
...and yet you serve them:
the Priory.

513
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,834
Jesus had but one true message.
That--

514
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,800
Come, you saints of God.

515
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,234
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

516
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,599
To receive her soul.

517
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,397
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

518
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,591
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

519
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,152
Welcome, bishop.

520
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,719
May Christ be with you.

521
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,592
And also with you.

522
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,314
It's been too long, Manuel.

523
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,711
I saw your press conference.

524
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,273
Very priestly.

525
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,754
Vultures.

526
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,111
But you need a good cover
to fly into ltaly these days.

527
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,952
So how are things in Rome?

528
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,514
We serve at his pleasure.

529
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,790
Today is today.

530
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,754
But there are many tomorrows.

531
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,152
Vatican cellars.

532
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,830
1976.

533
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,828
Seventy-six, a year of independence.
How fitting.

534
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,435
I thought you'd like it.

535
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,033
I'll fetch the others.

536
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,477
Welcome, bishop.

537
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,836
This council is convened.

538
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,310
Our words shall never
pass these walls.

539
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,558
What business, say you?

540
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,436
As you know, my request for funds--

541
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,713
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

542
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,957
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?

543
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,232
The endeavour is complex.
Freedom has a high cost.

544
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,357
And, of course, you will deliver us.

545
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,949
How fortunate we are.

546
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,597
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

547
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,994
How humble.

548
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,595
Our saviour, Bishop Aringarosa.

549
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,791
Were we to grant your request...

550
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,237
...when would
this mission commence?

551
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,158
-Actually, tonight.
-What?

552
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,192
-lt has begun.
-We have not agreed.

553
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,833
How dare you presume to--

554
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,712
I do not presume, I act!

555
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,990
The Vatican's unwillingness
to support us...

556
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,713
...is both impious and cowardly.

557
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,879
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

558
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,597
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

559
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,269
Tonight...

560
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,589
...the Grail will be destroyed.

561
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,554
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

562
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,239
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

563
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,672
He knows a great deal
about this council.

564
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,475
And about the Priory.

565
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,709
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

566
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,036
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

567
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,951
Because of your expertise?

568
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,479
-I'm sorry?
-About the Priory.

569
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,035
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

570
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,558
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

571
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,673
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

572
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,596
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

573
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,074
What was it?

574
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,472
How may I help you?

575
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,310
The door to the right, please.

576
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,274
That was quite a performance.

577
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,992
The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.

578
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,275
I know I got in front of you,
old friend.

579
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,031
I did what I thought was best.

580
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,833
So...

581
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,029
...now what?

582
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,588
Now we wait for the Teacher's call.

583
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,034
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

584
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,637
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

585
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,715
Yes.

586
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,828
Understood.

587
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,830
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

588
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,600
...are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

589
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,232
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

590
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,994
Often willed through generations.

591
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,155
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

592
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,078
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

593
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,996
And what's your longest account?

594
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,713
Quite a bit longer.

595
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,674
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

596
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,788
But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.

597
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,118
Once the computer
confirms your key...

598
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,551
...enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

599
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,309
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

600
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,277
What if I lost track
of my account number?

601
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,239
How might I recover it?

602
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,874
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 1 0-digit number...

603
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,036
...known only to the account bearer.

604
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,196
I hope you manage to remember it.

605
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,354
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

606
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,989
-Ten.
-Ten.

607
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,589
Your grandfather's
Fibonacci sequence.

608
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,910
Scrambled, unscrambled?

609
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,068
Unscrambled.

610
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,318
It's your key.

611
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,395
Funny, I don't even like history.

612
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,718
I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

613
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,353
Moment of truth.

614
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,594
My God. I don't believe this.

615
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,115
A rose.

616
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,518
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

617
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,793
Forgive the intrusion.

618
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,390
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.

619
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,038
You must follow me, please.

620
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,514
For your own safety.

621
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,393
You knew they were coming?

622
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,239
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

623
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,159
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

624
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,510
It includes a safe-passage clause.

625
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,835
Safe passage?

626
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,468
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

627
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,994
In there?

628
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,272
Hey, is there a problem?

629
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,988
Good evening, sir. Police.

630
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,353
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

631
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,789
-English?
-Yes.

632
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,674
We are looking for two criminals.

633
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,593
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

634
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,550
Would you mind opening the hold?

635
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,470
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

636
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,432
You don't have keys
to your own truck?

637
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,234
It's armoured.
Keys get sent to the destination.

638
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,396
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

639
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,032
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

640
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,509
What?

641
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,313
This piece of shit.

642
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,238
Forty euros in Barbès.

643
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,509
Yours for 35.

644
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,035
No, no, no.

645
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,912
-Thirty.
-No. It's okay, it's okay.

646
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,314
Come on, 30, eh?

647
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,748
I said, no!

648
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,389
Move along!

649
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,309
Now we wait.

650
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,988
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

651
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,431
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

652
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,838
Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.

653
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,431
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

654
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,875
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

655
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,994
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

656
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,395
Amen.

657
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,070
I chastise my body.

658
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,993
The Holy Grail.

659
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,430
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

660
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,868
It's nonsense.

661
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,631
You don't believe in God.

662
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,549
No.

663
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:12,593
I don't believe in some magic
from the sky.

664
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,199
Just people.

665
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,314
Sometimes that they can be kind.

666
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,349
And that's enough?

667
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,917
Well, I think it has to be.
I think it's all we have.

668
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,874
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

669
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,678
I was raised a Catholic.

670
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,794
Well, that's not really an answer.

671
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,431
Professor, are you okay?

672
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,118
Go ahead, open it.

673
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,869
Go on.

674
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,954
A cryptex.

675
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,629
They are used to keep secrets.

676
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,436
It's da Vinci's design.

677
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,191
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

678
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,269
...which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

679
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,552
If you force it open, the vial breaks...

680
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,320
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...

681
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,468
...and your secret is lost forever.

682
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,796
The only way
to access the information...

683
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,275
...is to spell out the password...

684
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,790
...with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

685
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,189
That's 12 million possibilities.

686
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,276
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

687
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,630
Saunière made one for me once.

688
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,352
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

689
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,995
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

690
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,835
Come on.

691
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,519
Please, you're not all right.

692
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,432
May I try something?

693
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,597
I don't know why it works.

694
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,670
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

695
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,188
You think?

696
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,995
Yes.

697
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,272
Feeling better, Sophie?

698
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,236
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

699
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,474
I was 4.

700
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,554
I'm sorry.

701
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,711
It was many years ago.

702
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,954
Better?

703
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,515
Yeah.

704
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,389
Okay.

705
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,948
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...

706
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,549
...and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

707
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,952
I don't know what
you're talking about.

708
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,997
All right! Okay!

709
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,635
Right now!

710
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,635
Step back!

711
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,709
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

712
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,233
Turn around.

713
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,753
Turn around!

714
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,672
You too, mademoiselle.

715
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,793
Sophie!

716
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,559
Get in the truck!

717
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,634
I'll drive! Hurry!

718
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,312
-Better?
-Always, if I got too nervous...

719
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,478
...I had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.

720
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,714
Saunière used to say
I was like a dog.

721
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,078
A cute dog. You know, a little dog.

722
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,196
What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?

723
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,315
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

724
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,033
I need to know.

725
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,550
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

726
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,637
You call him by his last name.

727
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,348
You say you hate history.

728
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,710
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

729
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,831
So now you're a psychologist too?

730
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,193
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

731
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,072
What do you mean, groom me?

732
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,431
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

733
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,273
Say Saunière was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.

734
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,471
Still, years later,
when he imagines...

735
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,953
...the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.

736
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,039
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

737
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,232
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

738
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,431
-Real enough to kill for.
-Who?

739
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,829
I'm out of my field here.

740
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,671
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

741
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,872
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

742
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,713
Do you trust this man?

743
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,279
I hope you can.

744
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,878
Vernet, André.

745
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,193
It seems you're not a driver at all.

746
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,551
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

747
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,673
Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.

748
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,110
That carries jail time.

749
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,392
Speak to my lawyer.

750
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:36,718
All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property....

751
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,836
It might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don't you think?

752
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,440
You think you're in pain now,
André Vernet?

753
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,628
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

754
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,353
What do you want?

755
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,674
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

756
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,914
Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.

757
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,678
It's on the wrong side.

758
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,235
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

759
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,432
Robert! Do I owe you money?

760
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,953
Leigh, my friend...

761
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,391
...care to open up
for an old colleague?

762
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,238
-Of course.
-Thank you.

763
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,835
But first, a test of honour.

764
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,032
Three questions.

765
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,355
Fire away.

766
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,959
Your first:

767
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,674
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

768
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,839
Tea, of course.

769
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,029
Excellent.

770
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,435
Second: milk or lemon?

771
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,429
Milk?

772
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,955
That would depend on the tea.

773
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,115
Correct.

774
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,119
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:

775
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,394
In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?

776
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,189
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

777
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,597
Your heart is true.

778
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,759
You may pass.

779
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,750
Welcome to Château Villette.

780
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,998
Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...

781
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,919
...studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.

782
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,439
Sorry?

783
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,598
The cryptex, it's a hot coal.

784
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,669
A hot potato?

785
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,279
So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?

786
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,632
Very close.

787
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,514
The truck's signal is coming online.

788
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,073
It's about time.

789
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,238
Locked on and tracking, sir.

790
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,197
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

791
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,072
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

792
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,111
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

793
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,228
Aringarosa.

794
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,672
I still don't know why
he put you into this...

795
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,157
...and I'm sorry.

796
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,195
But...

797
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,718
...I'm also very glad.

798
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,800
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

799
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,875
Robert!

800
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,394
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

801
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,717
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

802
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,956
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

803
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,789
It's an honour to welcome you...

804
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,356
...even though it's late.

805
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,355
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

806
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,438
So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.

807
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,518
What a lovely smile you have.

808
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,435
Earl Grey?

809
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,435
Lemon.

810
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,229
Correct.

811
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,190
Château Villette. Yes.

812
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,712
-No.
-Oh, you must.

813
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,559
Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...

814
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,159
...he is fantastic with sauces.

815
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,430
-Thank you.
-No, I can't.

816
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,071
A dramatic late-night arrival.

817
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,675
Mention of life and death.

818
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,194
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

819
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,675
We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.

820
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,269
The keepers?

821
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,474
The secret war?

822
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,557
Sorry for all the mystery.

823
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,158
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

824
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,635
You?

825
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,671
-Really?
-Not without your help.

826
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,038
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

827
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,355
Not if it works.

828
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,950
There are always four:

829
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,712
The Grand Master
and the three sénéchaux...

830
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,151
...make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

831
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,712
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.

832
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,437
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

833
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,872
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

834
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,911
And that is what
they want you to believe.

835
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,513
The Priory is charged
with a single task:

836
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,871
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

837
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,469
The source of God's power
on earth.

838
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,193
No, that's a common
misunderstanding.

839
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,155
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:

840
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,068
The Holy Grail.

841
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,158
I don't understand.

842
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,319
What power? Some magic dishes?

843
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,959
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

844
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,152
To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...

845
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,511
...you must first understand
the Holy Bible.

846
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,475
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

847
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,478
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

848
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,352
The pagan emperor Constantine.

849
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,796
I thought Constantine
was a Christian.

850
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,833
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

851
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,554
...who was baptized
on his deathbed.

852
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,911
Constantine was Rome's
supreme holy man.

853
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,679
From time immemorial...

854
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,158
...his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities...

855
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,716
...and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.

856
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,876
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

857
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,317
Three centuries earlier...

858
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,353
...a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

859
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,755
...preaching love and a single God.

860
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,952
Centuries after his crucifixion...

861
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,073
...Christ's followers
had grown exponentially...

862
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,714
...and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

863
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,831
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

864
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,597
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

865
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,598
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

866
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,234
...that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

867
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,591
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

868
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,518
...but he was also a pragmatist.

869
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,756
And in 325 anno Domini...

870
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,829
...he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

871
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,033
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

872
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,357
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

873
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,710
...Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

874
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,639
...known as the Council of Nicaea.

875
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,239
And at this council...

876
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,116
...the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well...

877
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,074
...everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...

878
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,713
... to the date for Easter...

879
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,878
...to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

880
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,957
...the immortality of Jesus.

881
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,674
I don't follow.

882
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,594
Well, ma chère,
until that moment in history...

883
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,551
...Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

884
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,435
...as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

885
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,352
A mortal man.

886
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,718
Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.

887
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,514
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

888
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,948
Not the Son of God?

889
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,435
Not even his nephew twice removed.

890
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,349
Hold on, you're saying
Jesus' divinity came from a vote.

891
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,439
Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.

892
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,833
By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...

893
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:33,396
...by making him capable
of earthly miracles...

894
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,513
...as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...

895
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,790
...but within the human world.

896
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,231
And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.

897
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,750
Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.

898
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,748
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

899
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,518
-Semantics.
-No, it's not semantics.

900
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,598
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

901
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,351
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

902
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,516
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

903
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,075
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

904
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,157
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

905
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,591
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"

906
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,553
How many have been murdered
over this question?

907
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,158
As long as there has been
a one true God...

908
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,430
...there has been killing
in his name.

909
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,148
Now let me show you the Grail.

910
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,912
This used to be the ballroom.

911
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,111
I have little occasion to dance
these days.

912
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,240
I trust you recognize
The Last Supper...

913
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,634
...the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

914
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,434
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

915
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,756
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlour tricks.

916
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,190
You asked for my help, I recall.

917
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,914
Allow an old man his indulgences.

918
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,316
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

919
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,518
-ln the middle.
-Good.

920
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,439
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

921
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,915
And what drink?

922
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,077
Wine. They drank wine.

923
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,475
Splendid. And one final question:

924
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,558
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

925
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,677
One? The Holy Grail?

926
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,835
Open your eyes.

927
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,278
No single cup.

928
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,989
No chalice.

929
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,839
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

930
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,032
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

931
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,313
...celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

932
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,394
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

933
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,309
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

934
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,069
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

935
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,959
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

936
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,196
-Quite to the point.
-Yes, indeed.

937
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,356
This is known as the blade.

938
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,357
It represents aggression
and manhood.

939
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,199
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

940
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,279
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

941
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,598
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

942
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,153
This is called the chalice.

943
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,956
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

944
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,230
...the shape of a woman's womb.

945
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,233
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

946
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:45,195
It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.

947
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:51,195
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

948
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,518
...that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

949
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,914
Wait, please.

950
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,432
You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

951
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,068
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

952
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,238
But they are all men.

953
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,475
Are they?

954
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,995
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

955
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,794
...seated in the place of honour?

956
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,352
Flowing red hair.

957
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,590
Folded feminine hands.

958
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,069
Hint of a bosom. No?

959
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,591
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

960
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,194
Who is she?

961
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,232
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

962
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,595
The prostitute?

963
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,959
She was no such thing.

964
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,751
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

965
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,793
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

966
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,437
This is an old wives' tale.

967
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,993
The original one, in fact.

968
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,191
There's virtually no empirical proof.

969
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,437
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

970
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,232
Theories. There are theories.

971
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,477
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

972
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,796
Mirror images of each other.

973
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,355
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

974
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:21,792
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

975
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,356
...appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

976
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,917
...as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

977
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,077
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

978
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,988
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

979
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,192
...when these two figures
change position.

980
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,191
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

981
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,197
No. But history...

982
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,318
...she does make it true.

983
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,592
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

984
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,755
Philip?

985
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,679
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

986
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,791
...along with any other gospels
that made...

987
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,355
...Jesus appear human
and not divine.

988
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,270
"And the companion of the Saviour
is Mary Magdalene.

989
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,189
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

990
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,197
...and used to kiss her on the--"

991
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,152
But this says nothing of marriage.

992
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,920
Well, actually....

993
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,075
Robert.

994
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,157
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

995
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,592
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

996
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,360
-She wrote a gospel?
-She may have.

997
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,358
-Robert, will you fight fair?
-She may have.

998
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,348
"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us?'

999
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,514
And Levi answered:

1000
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:44,633
'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

1001
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,118
If the Saviour made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

1002
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:53,598
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

1003
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:57,475
...that it's up to her
to continue his Church.

1004
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,120
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

1005
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,549
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

1006
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,516
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

1007
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:16,074
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

1008
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,472
From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...

1009
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,148
...of the original Arthurian legend.

1010
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,275
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

1011
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,230
Sang real, it means "royal blood."

1012
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,959
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

1013
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,594
...it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

1014
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,279
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless--?

1015
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,153
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

1016
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,552
For her own safety and for that
of Christ's unborn child...

1017
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,718
...she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.

1018
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,789
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

1019
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,195
They know the child's name.

1020
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,917
-A little girl.
-Yes.

1021
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,111
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

1022
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,309
Why?

1023
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,990
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

1024
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,838
People found God through sex?

1025
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,759
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...

1026
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,633
...but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

1027
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,990
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.

1028
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,794
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

1029
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,037
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

1030
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,992
The Catholic lnquisition
soon publishes...

1031
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,351
...what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.

1032
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,835
The Malleus Maleficarum.

1033
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,478
The Witches' Hammer.

1034
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,349
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

1035
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,710
...all freethinking women.

1036
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,830
In three centuries of witch hunts...

1037
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,829
...50,000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

1038
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,508
Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.

1039
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,758
Imagine, then, Robert...

1040
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,949
...that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

1041
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,798
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

1042
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,795
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

1043
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,710
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

1044
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,195
...has defended
for over 20 centuries.

1045
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,437
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

1046
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,270
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

1047
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:39,758
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

1048
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,998
...and Mary Magdalene.

1049
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,549
Sir Leigh?

1050
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,511
Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.

1051
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,078
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1052
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,799
Yes, can I help you?

1053
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,956
Yes. They're on the news now.

1054
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,031
Living descendants? Is it possible?

1055
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,798
It's not impossible.

1056
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,390
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

1057
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,397
You are wanted for four murders!

1058
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,990
That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."

1059
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:27,476
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

1060
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,035
-That's why he needed you.
-You will leave my house!

1061
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,151
-Leigh, listen!
-No, I'm calling the police.

1062
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,590
Jacques Saunière
was her grandfather.

1063
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,918
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.

1064
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,236
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

1065
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,119
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

1066
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,389
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

1067
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,154
-What?
-I'll bet he was right at the top.

1068
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:57,309
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

1069
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,637
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other sénéchaux dead?

1070
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,831
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

1071
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,790
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

1072
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,592
Someone outside the society.

1073
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,828
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

1074
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,469
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

1075
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,879
Not really.

1076
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,516
No, that's impossible.

1077
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,078
Can that really--?

1078
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,628
Is it the keystone?

1079
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,110
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

1080
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,550
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

1081
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,352
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

1082
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,519
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

1083
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,029
Yes.

1084
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,913
As the legend foretold:

1085
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,710
"lt hides beneath the Rose."

1086
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,478
Oh, my.

1087
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,479
Leigh.

1088
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,159
Leigh?

1089
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:35,995
Please.

1090
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,111
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

1091
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,351
Inside the keystone...

1092
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,113
...there'll be a map.

1093
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,993
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

1094
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,598
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

1095
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,715
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

1096
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,913
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

1097
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,553
I know some of them.

1098
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,232
Can you keep secrets?

1099
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,513
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

1100
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,549
And codes?

1101
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,634
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

1102
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,196
A sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

1103
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,153
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.

1104
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,079
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem--

1105
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,794
Robert!

1106
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,194
Do not move, woman.

1107
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,275
Cripple.

1108
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,471
Put the box on the table.

1109
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,832
What, this trifle?

1110
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,828
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

1111
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:08,918
Put the keystone on the table.

1112
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,438
You will not succeed.

1113
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,677
Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.

1114
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,155
Rip the gate down.

1115
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,112
Well, well, my dear.

1116
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,388
Sit down.

1117
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,953
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

1118
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,196
-Are you?
-Yeah.

1119
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,630
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

1120
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,876
Get something
to restrain this monster.

1121
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,233
Above the joint.

1122
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:17,437
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

1123
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,993
He's wearing a cilice.

1124
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,876
-A what?
-Well, look.

1125
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,635
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

1126
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,634
Not so common these days.

1127
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,877
Opus Dei.

1128
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,435
Remy, take care of this.

1129
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,999
Fache is Opus Dei.

1130
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,073
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

1131
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,838
Robert.

1132
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,197
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

1133
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,435
Leigh?

1134
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,351
You want what's in this box?

1135
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,112
We need a way out of here.

1136
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,231
Well, actually...

1137
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,918
...I do have a plane.

1138
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,792
-Robert! Where do we go?
-Come along.

1139
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,718
-ln here. Come in.
-Over here.

1140
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,275
Get the door. Hurry.

1141
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,111
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

1142
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,514
Watch out!

1143
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,598
Be careful.

1144
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,358
Come, Rem--

1145
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,474
Shit.

1146
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,355
Easy.

1147
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,355
Jesus!

1148
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:10,515
Apropos.

1149
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,032
I can't imagine
what your complaint is.

1150
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,118
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1151
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,595
Put that away. We might need him.

1152
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,269
Better.

1153
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,518
Opus Dei.

1154
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,869
-What is it?
-A conservative Catholic sect.

1155
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,832
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1156
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,237
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1157
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,271
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1158
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,869
...and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1159
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,389
And one that has been
going on forever.

1160
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,750
On the one side stands the Priory...

1161
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,474
...and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1162
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,830
...with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1163
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,712
...throughout the Church.

1164
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,357
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1165
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,120
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1166
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,151
...the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1167
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,952
-That's insane.
-ls it?

1168
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,634
How many atrocities and scandals
has the Catholic Church...

1169
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,831
...rationalized in its time?
And what happens...

1170
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,679
...if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows...

1171
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,838
...that the Church's version of Christ
is inaccurate?

1172
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,708
What if the world discovers...

1173
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,514
...that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1174
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,235
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1175
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,474
I've got a signal now, sir.
It's ringing.

1176
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,076
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France...

1177
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,278
...and could you make
the plane ready for...

1178
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,275
...Zurich.

1179
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,239
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1180
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,314
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1181
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,713
You're the one who lost them.

1182
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,553
You control every step
of this investigation.

1183
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:03,035
You don't let anybody breathe.

1184
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,120
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

1185
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,119
What is it with these two birds?

1186
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,319
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1187
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,272
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1188
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,917
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1189
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,111
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1190
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,798
I am the messenger of God.

1191
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,590
Did you kill my grandfather?

1192
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,192
I am the messenger--

1193
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:13,519
Each breath you take is a sin.

1194
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,235
No shadow will be safe again.

1195
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,991
For you will be hunted by angels.

1196
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,237
You believe in God?

1197
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,869
Your God doesn't
forgive murderers.

1198
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,032
He burns them.

1199
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,715
Sophie.

1200
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,919
The Teacher will be pleased.

1201
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,236
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1202
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,634
Destroy it.

1203
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,310
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1204
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,919
And the heir?

1205
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,910
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1206
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,879
There will be no need.

1207
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,596
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1208
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,394
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1209
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,638
But if you had to...

1210
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:00,118
...would you do as councils
have done before us?

1211
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:09,988
Christ....

1212
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,838
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1213
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,918
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1214
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,593
Robert.

1215
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,588
When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.

1216
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,279
Is that so?

1217
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,151
Don't you see it?

1218
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,998
They never wanted you.

1219
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,394
Maybe even Fache didn't.

1220
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,512
It's all about this...

1221
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,312
...idiotic little box.

1222
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,837
That's not too flattering.

1223
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,710
Crazy old man.

1224
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,196
Why leave me with this?

1225
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,068
I should just throw it away.

1226
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,918
He trusted you, Sophie.

1227
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,071
A guardian of the Holy Grail.

1228
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,915
It sounds so stupid.

1229
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,278
It's quite an honour,
if you think about it...

1230
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,708
...and take it seriously.

1231
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,754
He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.

1232
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,431
Not him. You.

1233
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,800
He was the only family I knew.

1234
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,475
And maybe I didn't know him at all.

1235
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,917
I'm his marionette, Robert.

1236
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:52,112
Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.

1237
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,431
But you've done enough.

1238
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:06,511
I don't know why Saunière
picked me to help you, Sophie.

1239
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,951
But I won't leave you alone
in all this.

1240
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,558
Two marionettes, then.

1241
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,310
Maybe this is why he chose you.

1242
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,550
Because you will stay.

1243
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,112
I need the flight plan.

1244
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,395
Ten minutes.

1245
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,590
I asked you to get it for me.

1246
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,517
I'm on break.

1247
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,439
Come back in 10 minutes.

1248
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,436
My nose! My nose!

1249
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:03,314
The flight plan, please.

1250
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,475
You asshole!

1251
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,878
It's not "cross."

1252
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,308
"Spear"?

1253
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,519
What happened to her?

1254
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,798
No one knows.

1255
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,397
Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.

1256
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,309
And the zealots pursued her still...

1257
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:44,078
...even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.

1258
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,270
But she always had her Knights.

1259
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,789
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1260
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,434
You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...

1261
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,077
... to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene...

1262
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:59,272
...was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1263
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,435
...who were oppressed.

1264
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:05,072
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1265
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,794
...until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1266
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,358
...the Holy Grail...

1267
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,193
...was finally lost in time.

1268
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:25,635
What are you doing?

1269
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,354
At the chateau, you said,
"lt hides beneath the Rose."

1270
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,879
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1271
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,516
In Latin, sub rosa.
Literal translation....

1272
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,233
"Beneath the rose."

1273
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,119
We need a mirror.

1274
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,039
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1275
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,832
Thank you.

1276
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,788
In London lies a knight
a Pope interred

1277
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,549
His labour's fruit
a Holy wrath incurred

1278
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,753
You seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb

1279
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,590
It speaks of Rosy flesh
and seeded womb

1280
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,588
"ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred"?

1281
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,429
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1282
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,632
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1283
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,795
Templars.

1284
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,958
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1285
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:29,229
Temple Church.

1286
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,476
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear...

1287
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,399
...Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1288
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:35,919
Leigh.

1289
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,875
Harbouring and transporting
fugitives?

1290
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:43,074
You are already implicated enough.

1291
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,676
You and l, Robert,
have observed history.

1292
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,030
Time has been our glass.

1293
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,632
We are in history now. Living it.

1294
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,838
Making it.

1295
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,873
"lmplicated"?

1296
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,554
I am on a Grail quest.

1297
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,553
Forgive me, Robert...

1298
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,955
...but you two may well
have given this old man...

1299
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,390
...the greatest night of his life.

1300
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,269
Thank you.

1301
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,316
He's going to want more money.

1302
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:36,673
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1303
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,749
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1304
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,110
No extradition.

1305
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:52,796
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1306
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,672
What's going on, Bezu?

1307
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,319
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1308
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,153
Yes.

1309
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:15,636
A bishop of my order called me.

1310
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,951
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1311
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,754
His name was Robert Langdon.

1312
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,912
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1313
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,680
That he would keep killing.

1314
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,389
He said I had to stop him.

1315
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:36,029
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1316
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:39,471
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1317
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:46,876
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1318
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,398
The bishop?

1319
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,636
God himself?

1320
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,918
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

1321
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,878
Go on, Fache.
I'll take care of the controller.

1322
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,949
Maybe he needs a few extra euros.

1323
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,389
Just tell me next time.

1324
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,109
I have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1325
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,190
-Secure the area!
-Wider!

1326
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,391
-Armed police!
-You two, round the back!

1327
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,832
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1328
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,871
-Three men up!
-Ready!

1329
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,548
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1330
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,069
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done in my case.

1331
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,308
Oh, good morning.

1332
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,239
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1333
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:09,034
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives...

1334
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,912
...and you may have
a hostage onboard.

1335
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,599
I'm to take you all into custody.

1336
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,951
Sadly, I have an important medical
appointment which I can't miss.

1337
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,354
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1338
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:20,279
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1339
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,957
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1340
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,434
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1341
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:27,392
If it's so important
for you to stop us...

1342
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,716
...then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1343
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,798
You can start with him.

1344
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,513
Search the plane.

1345
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,869
All right.

1346
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,192
I could run them over.

1347
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,515
Bad tip.

1348
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,799
Let him go.

1349
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,395
The French cannot be trusted.

1350
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:18,635
Everyone comfy?

1351
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,915
Biscuits?

1352
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,078
They didn't notice anything?

1353
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,758
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1354
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,714
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1355
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,109
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1356
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,471
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1357
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,033
I am honoured.

1358
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:55,916
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1359
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:01,233
-I take it the news is good, then.
-I fly to London.

1360
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,351
The Teacher is waiting for me there.

1361
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:06,996
He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the exchange.

1362
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:11,398
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1363
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,477
Imagine it.

1364
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:23,950
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1365
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:26,993
-So should anything go wrong--
-Yes, I know, I know.

1366
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:29,712
This council does not exist.

1367
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,318
As it never has.

1368
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:38,675
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1369
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,757
Keep an eye out for the police.

1370
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,874
I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...

1371
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:06,197
...by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.

1372
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,233
Did he never tell you?

1373
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,591
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1374
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,358
How old were you?

1375
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:15,629
Seven.

1376
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,198
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1377
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,311
...to the echoes screaming back.

1378
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,875
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1379
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,115
Help!

1380
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,434
It was a long time ago.

1381
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,153
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1382
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:35,672
You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1383
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:43,831
Temple Church.
I always forget it's right here.

1384
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:49,478
Built 1 185 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.

1385
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,519
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1386
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,675
I don't know.

1387
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,594
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1388
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,472
...which is especially odd...

1389
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,877
...since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1390
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,475
Hello?

1391
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,754
Why do they make them so scary?

1392
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,235
Oh, it's cold.

1393
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,591
"ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1394
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:40,311
So which tomb has an orb?

1395
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,072
Those knights
with their legs crossed...

1396
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,236
...means they'd been
to the Holy Land.

1397
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,557
Two wear tunics over their armour...

1398
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:07,752
...and two have full-length robes.

1399
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,438
Two are grasping swords.

1400
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,350
And one-- Two are praying.

1401
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:18,117
This one has his arms at his sides.

1402
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,835
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1403
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:26,511
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1404
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:30,039
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1405
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,037
Maybe.

1406
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:43,879
These aren't tombs.

1407
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,355
-What? Yes, of course they are.
-No.

1408
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,437
-They're effigies.
-What?

1409
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,596
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1410
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:52,193
This place is wrong.

1411
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:57,357
Can we go now? We should go.

1412
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,032
Sophie! No!

1413
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,073
Where is the keystone?

1414
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,269
Do not test me!

1415
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:08,674
-Let her go!
-Don't hurt her.

1416
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,836
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1417
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,678
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1418
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,350
Just let her go, and you and I can--
We'll come to some agreement.

1419
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:18,313
Remy.

1420
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,949
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1421
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,312
Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.

1422
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,795
-Yes, I do.
-What do you think you're doing?

1423
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:37,192
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.

1424
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,356
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!

1425
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,596
That was satisfying.

1426
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,552
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1427
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,318
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1428
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:52,714
What?

1429
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,797
Here. You okay?

1430
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,029
Sorry.

1431
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,078
I don't think he's following.

1432
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,669
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1433
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:03,757
-So we have to find it before they do.
-I have to get to a library, fast.

1434
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,032
Lieutenant!

1435
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,719
One flag off the prints.

1436
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,316
Remy Legaludec.

1437
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,999
Petty theft.

1438
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:27,275
Skipped out on a hospital bill
for a tracheotomy.

1439
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,838
Peanut allergy.

1440
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,559
Like Marie.

1441
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,716
This way. Marie?

1442
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,036
My daughter.

1443
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,753
Over here.

1444
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:47,189
Where?

1445
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,594
Up there.

1446
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,838
What's all that?

1447
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,270
Very advanced surveillance.

1448
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,068
It's a listening post.

1449
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:26,230
Get me Fache.

1450
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:31,150
Four of these names are
the men killed last night.

1451
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:43,670
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1452
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,151
Let's see if he complains so now.

1453
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,077
Are you the Teacher?

1454
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,149
I am.

1455
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:59,192
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.

1456
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,233
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1457
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,476
You've done enough.

1458
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,075
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1459
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:17,077
I understand.

1460
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,149
Good.

1461
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:26,836
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1462
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:29,110
I will dispose of the old man.

1463
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,798
Bless you, Silas.

1464
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:34,954
Teacher.

1465
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,478
Christ be with you.

1466
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:52,035
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1467
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,231
If we're gonna help Leigh,
that's too long.

1468
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,839
Where you going?

1469
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,076
Getting you a library card.

1470
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,516
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1471
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:17,075
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

1472
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:26,508
That's great.

1473
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,556
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1474
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:33,388
Thanks.

1475
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,151
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1476
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:40,591
"ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1477
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,518
Compounding keywords:

1478
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,439
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1479
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:49,868
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1480
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:56,270
Can you believe how well I did?

1481
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,836
I even convinced the monk.

1482
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,511
I should be in theatre.

1483
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:14,239
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1484
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:19,831
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1485
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:28,516
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1486
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,996
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

1487
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:34,033
...of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

1488
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,389
"A. Pope."

1489
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,632
Your grandfather was a genius.

1490
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,349
Come on.

1491
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:19,238
Emergency.
Which service do you require?

1492
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:24,309
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1493
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:30,071
We've just had a 999 call.

1494
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:32,510
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1495
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,676
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1496
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,394
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1497
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:50,073
The knight we're looking for
is Sir lsaac Newton.

1498
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:55,109
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1499
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:57,750
Gravity, for God sakes.

1500
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:02,038
And if you choose to believe...

1501
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:06,438
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1502
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:19,068
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1503
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:22,875
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1504
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:25,196
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1505
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,153
"ln London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1506
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:31,318
Sir lsaac Newton's funeral
was presided over...

1507
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,990
...by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1508
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:39,432
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

1509
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:40,915
Here.

1510
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:44,272
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1511
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,509
An orb.

1512
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:51,430
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1513
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:54,996
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

1514
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:59,591
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1515
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:02,196
See, our moon is missing.

1516
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:05,073
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1517
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:07,874
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1518
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:12,598
Robert. These tracks.

1519
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,635
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1520
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:19,953
Teabing was here.

1521
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:22,395
He was alone.

1522
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:28,279
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1523
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,033
...others might call it God's will.

1524
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:35,309
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

1525
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,558
...I could solve the riddle alone.

1526
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:40,839
But I was unworthy.

1527
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,234
But you....

1528
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,395
You have a reason to be here.

1529
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:49,070
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1530
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,316
Your grandfather
and the other sénéchaux...

1531
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,397
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

1532
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:56,273
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1533
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:01,200
How could you know
Saunière's last words?

1534
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:02,355
Leigh.

1535
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:05,670
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1536
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:07,468
You are a murderer.

1537
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:10,592
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1538
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:14,429
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1539
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,391
You self-righteous bastard!

1540
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,828
We need to just walk away.

1541
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:21,758
-No, don't. Don't.
-Walk away.

1542
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,393
I'll do what I have to now.

1543
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:32,629
Anything.

1544
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,993
Do you understand?

1545
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:41,198
So now...

1546
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,356
...can't we all be friends again?

1547
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,828
This way.

1548
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:25,229
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1549
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:28,155
I'm listening now.

1550
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,074
For 2000 years...

1551
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:34,429
...the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...

1552
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:39,950
...crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1553
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:44,438
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1554
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:47,713
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

1555
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,833
Armed police!

1556
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:52,308
Drop your weapon!

1557
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:56,715
Stop, Silas!

1558
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:12,032
We are betrayed, my son.

1559
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:15,108
The living heir must be revealed.

1560
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:17,716
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1561
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:20,992
Not miraculous, simply man.

1562
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:23,479
I'm sorry.

1563
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:27,073
Armed police!

1564
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:30,398
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1565
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:41,835
Put it down now! Put it down!

1566
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,191
I am a ghost.

1567
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:54,828
The dark con can be exposed.

1568
02:04:55,040 --> 02:05:00,114
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1569
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,839
The three of us.

1570
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,353
How is Silas?

1571
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:23,790
Is he--? Is he alive?

1572
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:25,195
The monk?

1573
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:31,438
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1574
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,552
Get me out of here, Fache.

1575
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,075
Wait.

1576
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:42,273
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1577
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:47,033
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1578
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,675
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1579
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,628
You used me.

1580
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,396
God uses us all.

1581
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:01,639
Help me, Fache.

1582
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,795
Take him.

1583
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,038
-Did you get his cell phone?
-Yes, sir.

1584
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:12,196
I'm going to need a trace.

1585
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:16,678
Your Silas is dead.

1586
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,192
The Priory's sacred charge...

1587
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:28,278
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1588
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:34,195
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1589
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:38,109
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

1590
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:40,836
So, what choice did I have?

1591
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,678
I sought out the enemy.

1592
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:52,278
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1593
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:56,389
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1594
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,713
Rector, I made them call me.

1595
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,195
"Teacher."

1596
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,594
-Why don't you and l--
-No.

1597
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,268
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1598
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:06,829
Do it.

1599
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:08,719
No, I mean it. Down.

1600
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:12,433
Not you. No, my dear, you....

1601
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,309
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1602
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:20,229
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1603
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:24,516
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1604
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:27,473
...of those of different skin,
of women.

1605
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:30,752
You can put an end to all that.

1606
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:34,509
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

1607
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,679
It's your duty.

1608
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,114
You know the answer to this riddle.

1609
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:44,953
Open the cryptex...

1610
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,118
...and I'll put down the gun.

1611
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:07,477
I have no idea how.

1612
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,432
I don't know the code.

1613
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:12,200
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1614
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,795
Like your grandfather, then.

1615
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:23,398
Willing to die for your secret.

1616
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:27,836
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

1617
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:32,591
...I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1618
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:35,076
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1619
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,271
-Leigh, you can't just--
-Open the cryptex.

1620
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:38,915
I don't know how.

1621
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:40,917
Open it or he dies.

1622
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:42,951
-I swear, I don't know.
-Do it! Do it!

1623
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:44,388
-Stop it!
-I don't know!

1624
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:45,874
Stop it!

1625
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,111
She can't do it, Leigh.

1626
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:06,398
But give me a moment.

1627
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:17,718
Robert.

1628
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,429
What are you doing?

1629
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:33,355
Please.

1630
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:51,633
I'm sorry.

1631
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:02,475
I'm sorry.

1632
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:06,713
No!

1633
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:15,555
No, Robert!

1634
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,714
No!

1635
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:19,555
No.

1636
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,116
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

1637
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,679
The map is ruined.

1638
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:32,834
The Grail.

1639
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:34,509
It's lost.

1640
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:36,599
The Grail is gone.

1641
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:39,554
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1642
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:42,119
You taught me that.

1643
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:46,555
Armed police!

1644
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:48,990
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1645
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:50,633
Put the gun down.

1646
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,475
Put the gun down.

1647
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:02,674
That one. The old man.

1648
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:03,835
You're under arrest!

1649
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:06,156
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

1650
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:08,157
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1651
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:10,271
...something which you
later rely on in court.

1652
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:12,994
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1653
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,475
I'll have some questions for you.

1654
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:01,795
Big crowd out there now.

1655
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:05,676
Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.

1656
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:16,914
I'm sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?

1657
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:19,469
It wasn't only us, was it?

1658
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:22,672
He used you too.

1659
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:26,199
Leave us, please.

1660
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:30,195
Leave us, please.

1661
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:43,674
I should have been smarter.

1662
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:46,110
I acted on faith, I suppose.

1663
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,274
I'm sorry.

1664
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,033
How many?

1665
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:54,277
Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.

1666
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:59,798
The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.

1667
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:03,150
To do as he asked.

1668
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:06,552
Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.

1669
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:09,433
-Remy?
-Yes.

1670
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:10,629
By poison.

1671
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:15,709
How much of it
have you been able to figure out?

1672
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:20,435
Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.

1673
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:22,999
It won't ever make sense.

1674
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,075
I'm sorry.

1675
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:52,352
He forgot everything we've learned.

1676
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:54,996
Everything we teach.

1677
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,719
It's why we study history.

1678
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:04,392
So we'll stop killing each other.

1679
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:29,115
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1680
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:31,390
How could you? Robert!

1681
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,035
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1682
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,551
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1683
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:38,909
How could you?

1684
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:45,311
You couldn't! You solved it.

1685
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:50,990
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1686
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:54,988
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1687
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:57,350
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

1688
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:59,471
...and you'll set her free
upon the world!

1689
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:02,956
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1690
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:17,716
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

1691
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:22,633
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1692
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:27,470
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1693
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:32,039
A-P-P-L-E.

1694
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:34,314
Apple.

1695
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:51,113
The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits

1696
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:53,550
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates

1697
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,751
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies

1698
02:16:55,960 --> 02:16:59,635
She rests at last
beneath the starry skies

1699
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:03,071
I think I know where she's gone.

1700
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:06,349
I think the Grail has gone home.

1701
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:30,036
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1702
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:32,037
Rosslyn Chapel.

1703
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:34,838
So this is it.

1704
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,552
The gift at the end.

1705
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:42,069
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1706
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,072
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1707
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:47,588
What was it?

1708
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:49,917
He called me a flatfoot.

1709
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:52,390
A beat cop of history.

1710
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:55,076
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1711
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:58,511
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1712
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:02,349
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1713
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:07,476
Saunière said he was the most
honourable man he had ever known.

1714
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:13,760
We are who we protect, I think.

1715
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:16,318
What we stand up for.

1716
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:29,079
Jewish...

1717
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:32,754
...Christian, Egyptian...

1718
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:36,315
...Masonic, pagan...

1719
02:18:37,360 --> 02:18:38,998
...Templar crosses...

1720
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:40,919
...pyramids.

1721
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:51,955
I think I've been here before.

1722
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:53,229
Sophie.

1723
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:13,958
A very long time ago.

1724
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:17,912
Come along, Sophie.

1725
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:33,549
Sophie.

1726
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:35,629
Over here.

1727
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:46,516
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

1728
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:49,235
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1729
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:52,832
Fused as one.

1730
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,271
As the pagans would have wanted.

1731
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:58,478
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1732
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:06,710
We're just gonna be a moment.

1733
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:55,148
Robert.

1734
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:28,758
I've never seen that before.

1735
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:36,030
The style is....

1736
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:38,993
It's unmistakable.

1737
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:50,030
These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.

1738
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:55,078
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1739
02:21:55,640 --> 02:22:01,192
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1740
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:20,838
The fleur-de-lis.

1741
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:10,795
She was here.

1742
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:15,273
Her sarcophagus.

1743
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:18,833
Mary Magdalene.

1744
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:22,436
The Holy Grail herself.

1745
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:25,393
She was here.

1746
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:36,353
With modern DNA testing,
those bones...

1747
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:39,916
...could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.

1748
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:43,598
Where did she go?

1749
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:46,830
Did the Church finally get her?

1750
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:03,274
This is incredible. Look at this.

1751
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:06,631
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1752
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:10,559
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1753
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,997
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1754
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:41,233
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1755
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,800
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1756
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:47,515
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1757
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:50,314
...was it something about your past?

1758
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:53,752
How could you know that?

1759
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:57,079
About how your parents died?

1760
02:24:58,040 --> 02:24:59,632
Sophie?

1761
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:03,950
It was during primary school.

1762
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:07,391
I was in his library.

1763
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,553
Doing research.

1764
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:13,274
I was trying to find out
about my family.

1765
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:15,630
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1766
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:18,635
I wanted to know about them.

1767
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:21,231
But I couldn't find any records.

1768
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:24,157
Not of their death...

1769
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,352
...not of the accident.

1770
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,230
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember...

1771
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:31,668
...but he would never tell me.

1772
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:33,472
I told you, no.

1773
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:37,239
But why can't l?

1774
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:39,318
He stood over me...

1775
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,956
...and he wouldn't let me leave.

1776
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:44,878
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1777
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:46,958
Never look for them, Sophie.

1778
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:48,355
Promise me.

1779
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:50,835
Swear it!

1780
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:52,595
Swear it to me!

1781
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,757
I kept my promise.

1782
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:10,913
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

1783
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:15,791
One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.

1784
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:19,553
And what I saw
my grandfather doing....

1785
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:22,038
Some ritual.

1786
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,479
I was so frightened.

1787
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,070
We hardly ever spoke again.

1788
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:40,470
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1789
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:43,636
Before your parents were killed?

1790
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:46,754
Yeah. No. I don't know.

1791
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:48,915
Why?

1792
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:53,830
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1793
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,437
These are my parents.

1794
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:17,794
My brother.

1795
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:21,112
And this is you, isn't it?

1796
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,435
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1797
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:33,595
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1798
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:37,555
...and the girl, 4.

1799
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:43,477
But your name was never Saunière.
It's Saint-Clair.

1800
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:48,995
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

1801
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:53,229
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1802
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,238
Royal blood.

1803
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:06,713
I was so wrong.

1804
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:12,393
Saunière didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1805
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,308
Sophie...

1806
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:19,796
...you are the secret.

1807
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,475
You survived the accident.

1808
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:26,274
If it even was an accident.

1809
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:28,311
The Priory found out.

1810
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:31,952
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1811
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:35,711
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1812
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:38,310
...who raised you as his own.

1813
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:41,078
According to all of this...

1814
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:44,118
...Princess Sophie...

1815
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:49,119
...you are the heir.

1816
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:53,157
The end of the bloodline.

1817
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:57,877
You are the last living descendent...

1818
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:00,792
...of Jesus Christ.

1819
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:45,674
What is this?

1820
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:48,829
Sophie?

1821
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:52,955
Who are you?

1822
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:55,515
There have been many names.

1823
02:29:56,040 --> 02:29:57,758
The keepers.

1824
02:29:58,600 --> 02:29:59,999
Guardians.

1825
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:02,550
The Priory of Sion.

1826
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:07,994
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1827
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:09,993
Jacques Saunière.

1828
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:17,394
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1829
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:22,108
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1830
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:25,357
...as they have always
protected our family.

1831
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,831
I gave you up once...

1832
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:33,512
...knowing I might
never see you again.

1833
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:38,671
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1834
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:44,914
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1835
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:48,596
Welcome home, child.

1836
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:12,669
Hey.

1837
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:16,593
No more strings.

1838
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:24,191
His last breath to keep me safe.

1839
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:32,399
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1840
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:35,435
About my family.

1841
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:42,629
What will you do?

1842
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:47,315
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1843
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:50,389
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1844
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,238
She said when Saunière died...

1845
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:59,035
...he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1846
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:02,994
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1847
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,951
What would you do, Robert?

1848
02:32:07,880 --> 02:32:11,953
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1849
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:16,199
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1850
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:20,072
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

1851
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:22,157
...a human inspiration. That's it.

1852
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:25,554
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

1853
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:28,075
But...

1854
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,797
...when I was a boy....

1855
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:37,398
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1856
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:42,519
...I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

1857
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:45,793
What I did...

1858
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:47,794
...I prayed.

1859
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:53,193
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1860
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:55,038
...so I could see my parents again...

1861
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:57,708
...so I could go to school again...

1862
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:00,270
...so I could play with my dog.

1863
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:04,791
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1864
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:09,234
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1865
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:11,271
Maybe human is divine.

1866
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:14,272
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1867
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:17,153
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1868
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:19,989
Like turning water into wine?

1869
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:23,836
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1870
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:27,032
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1871
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:30,518
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1872
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:33,712
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

1873
02:33:36,320 --> 02:33:38,914
Well, here's the question:

1874
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:42,240
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1875
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:46,154
...would she destroy faith?

1876
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:50,195
Or would she renew it?

1877
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:55,077
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

1878
02:33:57,240 --> 02:33:58,468
Thank you.

1879
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:01,714
For bringing me here.

1880
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:06,195
For letting him choose you...

1881
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:08,029
...Sir Robert.

1882
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:18,835
You take care.

1883
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:21,429
Yes.

1884
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:46,189
Hey.

1885
02:34:58,640 --> 02:34:59,595
Nope.

1886
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:02,990
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1887
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:07,719
Godspeed.

1888
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:05,308
Bloodline.

1889
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:10,039
Rose Line.

1890
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:18,272
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1891
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:15,636
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1892
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:21,876
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.

1893
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:40,750
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.

1894
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:22,269
She rests at last
beneath starry skies. "
