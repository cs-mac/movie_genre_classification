1
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,175
The principle, Your Honor,
is informed waiver,

2
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:47,272
a concept deeply embedded
in the black-letter law of this state.

3
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:51,621
This is a simple case of a contract
willingly and completely executed.

4
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:55,373
Appeals to the contrary, based on emotion,
have no place in a court of law.

5
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,822
- Objection!
- Order, order!

6
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,426
This is not a court of law.
You did not enter through a doorway.

7
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,270
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the rabbit hole
and we, like so many Alices,

8
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:17,518
have plunged through it
directly into Wonderland.

9
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:22,187
Behold the Queen of Hearts,
Carraghan Chemical.

10
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:27,754
A company that has spewed its bile
into the Leffingwell River for 17 years.

11
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,791
Plants wither. Children die.

12
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:34,213
And there isn't a court in the land
that can stop them.

13
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,614
Finally, one man has had enough.

14
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:44,297
Frustrated, desperate, he slams
his truck into the plant manager's office

15
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,189
and for one bright, shining day,
that hellhole of a factory shuts down.

16
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:52,940
Do we honor him?
Do we throw him a parade?

17
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,854
Do we even say thank you?

18
00:02:55,951 --> 00:03:00,108
No. He is put on trial.

19
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:03,525
- Welcome to the Mad Hatter's tea party.
- Objection!

20
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:05,835
Objection? Why not "Off with their heads"?

21
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,172
...paid him fully, according to the contract.

22
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,654
But now he wants more and he intends
to get it by harassing my client.

23
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,181
Yes, the plaintiff is
a man of moderate means.

24
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:17,190
Yes, Xydex is a very successful corporation.

25
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,459
But the law, not charity,
must dictate our course today.

26
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,047
Yes, yes.

27
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,111
He rammed through that wall.

28
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:31,755
And, yes, he did shut
that hellish factory down for one day.

29
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:37,355
And, yes, he is responsible
for damages in the amount of $427,000.

30
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:41,035
How high a price is that to pay
if he saved just one single life?

31
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:45,576
Madam, I will give you $427,000
for your child. Deal?

32
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:50,566
And you, madam.
Same price for your husband.

33
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:54,533
And you, counselor. How about half
a million bucks for your precious hide?

34
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,095
- Objection!
- Order!

35
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,233
- The counsel is out of line.
- Sustained.

36
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,310
Mr. Ward, sit down.

37
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:04,772
Order, order!

38
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,214
Defense is prepared to mount its case.

39
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:10,094
We have witnesses,

40
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:13,672
depositions and evidence
to prove my client acted fairly.

41
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:17,572
But to what end? The plaintiff has
put no viable case before this court.

42
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,509
Defense moves for nonsuit.
Submitted, Your Honor.

43
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:26,187
Would you go next door and remind them
that justice is blind, and not deaf?

44
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,180
As to your motion, counsel...

45
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:33,869
12 minutes.
12 minutes!

46
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,935
Eight and a half days
it took those idiots to mount their case!

47
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,407
- Too bad you mispronounced "harassing. "
- It's too bad you didn't get a chance to.

48
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:45,511
Counselor, where will you be
spending your vacation?

49
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,860
- I have no vacation.
- Maggie! You must have three or four weeks.

50
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:53,448
No. I hear something big's
happening on Argo Motors.

51
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:55,919
- Do you know anything about it?
- No.

52
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,543
Have you?
I haven't heard.

53
00:04:57,615 --> 00:05:00,550
You guys wanna be big-time lawyers,
learn to lie better.

54
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:02,631
Maggie! Lawyers never lie.

55
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:07,372
We just tell the truth judiciously
to guarantee utter confusion.

56
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:11,748
Damn, you could lose your hand
in one of this things.

57
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,940
Mr. Ward, excuse me.
Howard Crayhill.

58
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,334
I've read all your books.
I've read <i>Civil Rights on Trial</i> twice.

59
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:32,424
Congratulations.
You found a copy they hadn't burned.

60
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:36,325
Grateful client?

61
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,009
No, it's a present for your mother.
Anniversary.

62
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:43,340
Hard to believe we've been together 34 years.

63
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,195
35.

64
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,669
You're biting your fingernails again, Margaret.

65
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:59,045
Don't.

66
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,508
Minor flesh wound.
He didn't even draw blood.

67
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:05,063
Brian, my father always draws blood.

68
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:19,436
I was getting ready to make a left.
I had the blinker on.

69
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:24,424
I saw the other car coming towards me,
in the rearview mirror.

70
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,983
And I couldn't move.
I couldn't get out of the way.

71
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:30,055
I just watched him, in slow motion.

72
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,112
At first, I couldn't believe it was happening.

73
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:38,347
It was like watching TV or something.

74
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,903
And then the guy hit me.

75
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:46,343
The car just... It just exploded.

76
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:49,415
There was fire everywhere.

77
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:52,878
My wife started screaming,

78
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:54,951
and my baby boy...

79
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,890
- Son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry.

80
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,933
You have nothing to apologize for.

81
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,006
What happened to you...

82
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:12,006
I'm so goddamned tired of this.

83
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:15,144
Those bastards think
they can do anything they want.

84
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:19,438
Lie, kill, destroy whatever
they touch and get away with it.

85
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:23,213
Let me tell you something, Steven.
They don't always get away with it.

86
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:26,956
Once in a while, people like us,
this law firm, we stop them.

87
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,357
This is going to be one of those times.

88
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:31,595
Mr. Ward, I'm very grateful.

89
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:35,656
I just wish that I had been
with your firm from the beginning.

90
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,312
We're here now.

91
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:47,462
Good afternoon.
Quinn Califan and Lunt.

92
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:52,772
I'm sorry, he's away from his desk right now.
May I take a message?

93
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,861
Hold on one second.

94
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,015
Maggie!

95
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:59,658
- Maggie, Mr. Grazier wants to see you.
- Now?

96
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:04,776
OK, tell me what you know
about Argo Motors.

97
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,694
They're our biggest client.
21% of last year's billing.

98
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,646
26. They're headed up by Eugene Forrest.
He came aboard two years ago...

99
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:16,810
In a hostile takeover. Thinks the future
of automobiles is in computerization.

100
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:20,556
Rumor is now that he's looking
to merge with a Silicon Valley type.

101
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:24,616
Wrong. He found it.
LorCoTron Electronics.

102
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,857
Jeez. Big time.

103
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,182
But there's a catch.
And this is where we come in.

104
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,540
Three years ago, a class action suit
was filed against Argo,

105
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,894
claiming that their 1985 station wagon,
the Meridian, blew up on impact.

106
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,512
- So? Lawsuits are a dime a dozen.
- Did they have a case?

107
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:47,747
No. I've handled Argo since that car was
still on the drawing boards. It's totally clean.

108
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:51,467
We persuaded the other side's attorneys
that they couldn't win.

109
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:55,016
But now another firm has re-filed.
A much more aggressive firm.

110
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:59,495
The new American way.
Find the guy who built it, then rob him blind.

111
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,305
- So what do we do, guys?
- Settle, for chump change.

112
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,652
- Confidentiality clause, don't tell the papers.
- No, we have to win in public.

113
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,337
LorCoTron is a very conscientious
company, very consumer-oriented.

114
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:14,156
This LorCoTron thing is time-critical.
You can't...

115
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:16,873
OK, OK!

116
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:19,758
If I decide we fight it,
one of you will be on point.

117
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,092
It's good input.

118
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,582
Thanks for your time.

119
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:30,157
My hobby is rebuilding American cars...

120
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:32,230
Get outta here!

121
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,813
Michael.

122
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,164
You have to give me this case.

123
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,717
I know Argo backwards and forwards.

124
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,205
I'm a better litigator
than any other associate

125
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:10,028
and you're too busy to go to court
on all the prep work.

126
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:13,259
Bernstein has a lot going for him.
He's a team player.

127
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,497
Second team.

128
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,809
Maggie!

129
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,555
Please! This is the partnership express.
I deserve this.

130
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:25,096
- Why are you throwing lightweights at me?
- Look. OK. OK!

131
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,102
I want you on this one.

132
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:30,630
There's no question.

133
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:34,086
- There's a problem.
- What?

134
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,792
Plaintiff's attorney's your father.

135
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:46,635
Yeah? What's wrong?

136
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:51,940
- We got no case.
- Sure we have a case. Look at the facts.

137
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:56,238
I've looked. Looked at the probability charts
backwards and forwards, Jed.

138
00:10:56,303 --> 00:11:00,329
The facts are that Argo built a half a million
Meridians and a few of them blew up.

139
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,784
132 cars?

140
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:06,343
On a half a million built,
that's only a few cars.

141
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,157
That's not that many more
than would have blown up no matter what.

142
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:16,104
Maybe Argo designed it wrong, maybe they
didn't. But that doesn't make a case.

143
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,398
Hey, I got a car that blows up, people
like Steven who almost died in 'em.

144
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:24,903
I got a car company that doesn't give a shit.
To me that makes a case.

145
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:30,539
Rosenberg Blittman had everything
that we have. They had it for three years.

146
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,094
They dropped the case.
Couldn't find anything.

147
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,232
Billy Blittman couldn't find
his butt with both hands.

148
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:42,537
That's true, but it's a contingency case, Jed.

149
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,730
Even if we win, we see no money for years.
Can we afford that?

150
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,660
Hey, I know it's not a slam dunk, Nick.

151
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,170
Once in a while, you just gotta go
with your gut, the passion.

152
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,337
I got a real feeling about this one.
Network news-time.

153
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:03,301
- Jed, I like seeing you on TV. Really...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

154
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:07,213
It's not about my ego.
It's about us. What we stand for.

155
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:11,173
This firm was built on David and Goliath
cases. They're not around any more.

156
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,824
All these fascist Reagan judges
hear you're after a big corporation,

157
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:17,546
they throw your ass right out of court.

158
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:19,437
It's too discouraging.

159
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:23,015
Something like this comes along.
Good plaintiffs, decent evidence.

160
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,258
A judge who'll listen.

161
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:29,221
I gotta tell you,
I've gone to war with a lot less.

162
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:34,504
It would be fun
to nail those Argo bastards to the wall.

163
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:41,990
- Wanna kick their asses?
- I believe so.

164
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,965
Just once, I'd like to see you
sleep through the night.

165
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:08,387
- Miss these great movies?
- They are on cassette.

166
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:11,277
No, it's not the same.

167
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,350
You're freezing.

168
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,373
Michael.

169
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:23,530
- Do you like me?
- What?

170
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,605
- Do I like you?
- Yeah.

171
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:28,777
- What kind of a question's that? Of course.
- Surprise.

172
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,951
How can you not know that?

173
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:34,732
How can I know that?
How can anybody?

174
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:40,232
Tomorrow, if I did something you
really hated, would you still be here?

175
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,310
Listen. Come here.

176
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,988
Listen to me.
That's not the way these things work.

177
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:49,357
I'm not your father.

178
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:52,903
- This has nothing to do with him.
- Yes, it does.

179
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:57,448
Maggie. I want this to work.
I really do.

180
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,649
I trust you. And you want
to know if you can trust me.

181
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:04,557
All right.

182
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:09,096
Give this place up.
Live with me. Mm?

183
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,508
No, Michael. We said we'd talk
about that after I make partner.

184
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,878
- Maybe we need to talk about it now.
- No.

185
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,852
It might help
but I'm just not ready to go public yet.

186
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,496
You don't think they suspect?

187
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,500
Suspecting is different
from being on the mailing list.

188
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:33,192
- Who cares what they think?
- I do.

189
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:36,874
- Why?
- Because it's different for a woman.

190
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:44,231
I don't want them saying I made partner
for anything other than my work.

191
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,619
Maybe I should be the one
asking how much you like me.

192
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,797
No.

193
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,227
Oh, no!

194
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:56,426
No, come on.
One anxiety attack at a time.

195
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,567
Your turn, is it?

196
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,645
Oh, OK.

197
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:37,102
- Who's Cyd Charisse?
- Deborah, your dad's new intern.

198
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,752
- She's really great.
- Aren't they all?

199
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,830
Ah, come on!

200
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,614
Good luck with the school board.

201
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:59,369
Luck I got. Votes I need. Thanks a lot.

202
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:01,380
Mom! Hiya.

203
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:06,244
Mom, come on. You're the bride. You're
supposed to be having a good time. Relax.

204
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:10,409
- It's my petition. Are you having fun?
- Yeah, I haven't talked to Dad all evening.

205
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,412
- Maggie!
- Maggie, be nice.

206
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,348
- Maggie, I got one for you.
- Stop that.

207
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:20,489
<i>Weems</i> versus <i>United States,</i> 1910.
What was the issue?

208
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:23,176
Damn, a pop quiz
and me without a blue book.

209
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,450
These are the easy ones. Come on!

210
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,268
Cruel and unusual punishment.

211
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:31,684
- They put a guy in chains for 15 years.
- That's absolutely right.

212
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,173
- OK, so you do know everything.
- That's right also.

213
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,661
Terrific, everybody's right.
Jed, why don't you and Maggie dance?

214
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:44,102
You promised! Excuse me, but rumor
has it this used to be a party.

215
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,247
- Come on, Nick, dance with me.
- All right.

216
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,579
- Jed, dance with Maggie.
- All right, but you're a party pooper.

217
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,434
- One more, one more.
- What?

218
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:54,699
1941. <i>Kemper</i> v <i>Walden. </i> Issue?

219
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:01,829
- Come on, issue!
- All right, all right.

220
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:04,586
- Issue!
- All right, all right, wait!

221
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:07,786
- I haven't the vaguest idea.
- The court ruled

222
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:14,413
that children have the right
to sue their parents for nonperformance.

223
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:27,750
The guy in the peach trunks, Nature Boy
Rick Flair, I represented him once.

224
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:30,789
- He used to wrestle under the name of...
- Son of Satan.

225
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,804
Son of Satan. Right.

226
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:36,555
He had the horns, he had the pitch fork,
the whole shot.

227
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,524
He had a great thing going
with a guy named the Angel of God.

228
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:43,176
One morning, Satan wakes up
and he sees the light.

229
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:46,475
Becomes a Born Again Christian.
Blows the whole rivalry.

230
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:49,707
- What happened?
- Son of God goes berserk.

231
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:53,419
- He sues my client for breach of contract.
- Did they have a contract?

232
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,901
- He was imposing on my client's...
- Religious freedoms.

233
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,796
- Can I talk to you?
- Just a minute.

234
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:01,448
- Did you win?
- The judge threw us out of court.

235
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,900
He thought it was a publicity stunt
and that we should go to hell.

236
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:06,185
- Dad.
- What?

237
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:08,164
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

238
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:10,856
- See you guys.
- Sorry. Thanks.

239
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,795
This <i>Walden</i> versus <i>Kemper. </i>
Did you make that up?

240
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,967
Look it up, counselor.

241
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:21,348
I wanted to ask you
about something about work.

242
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:24,455
- You want to ask me about something?
- Yeah. I know.

243
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,268
- You want my advice?
- It shocked the hell out of me.

244
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:32,164
I've been offered a case.
A good case. Partnership time.

245
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:36,646
- Why would you want to be a partner there?
- Dad, please! Don't make me sorry I asked.

246
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,572
- Go ahead, ask. What's the problem?
- I get this look in your eye. For God's sake.

247
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:47,910
OK. Anyway, it's a great case.
I know I could try the hell out of it.

248
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:53,416
But I wonder if I should pass it up because
there's a pretty extreme conflict involved.

249
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:56,300
- How extreme?
- They want me on Meridian.

250
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:03,652
- So what's the problem?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

251
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,141
It's obvious there's no problem.
You're not taking it.

252
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,905
Oh, really? Just like that?

253
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:12,454
Margaret, don't you see?
They're using you as a parlor trick.

254
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,630
They think I'll see my precious daughter

255
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:17,255
- and go all soft inside.
- It's a bit more than that.

256
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:20,806
Will you think, Margaret?
You're an associate at Quinn Califan.

257
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,344
They pop out baby lawyers like you, like
a shark grows teeth, row after row, forever.

258
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:29,676
When it comes to the crunch,
they'll send in the big boys.

259
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,604
They already did.

260
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:35,205
You mean you?

261
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,907
Did it ever occur to you
that I might be a very good attorney?

262
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:43,812
- You damn well better be. I raised you.
- No! Mother raised me!

263
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,926
You had a date.

264
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,208
Sorry.

265
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:02,150
I'm looking forward to it.
It's kinda funny.

266
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:04,262
I don't see the humor.

267
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:09,612
Fred Quinn thinks
he can rattle me with my daughter.

268
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,710
What if she wins?

269
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:17,386
Some day, maybe, but please
don't force me to be immodest.

270
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:20,138
No one ever had to before.

271
00:20:20,238 --> 00:20:25,094
- Whose side are you on, anyway?
- Oh, Jed. Don't be an ass.

272
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:39,462
- Absolute nonsense!
- What do you mean?

273
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:44,269
You don't know what you're talking about!
What do you want me to do, buy her flowers?

274
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:48,426
- She hates me!
- She doesn't hate you.

275
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,015
She hates me, goddamnit.

276
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:55,018
- I see it every time I look in her eyes.
- Oh, yeah?

277
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,217
Yeah. I don't hate her
and I have every right to.

278
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,883
Does it matter to her
that these cars are blowing up? No.

279
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,530
Does it matter her that people...
babies are being killed? No.

280
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,486
Does she care that she's in bed
with the vilest kind of corporate vermin?

281
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,063
- I'm talking to you!
- No, you're not. You're talking to the jury.

282
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:22,219
Listen, Jed. I love you dearly
but you are a superior, self-righteous bastard

283
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:25,133
who's never satisfied
with anybody or anything.

284
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:28,940
If I were Maggie,
I wouldn't want you to be my father either.

285
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:35,688
- So I'm the bad guy here?
- Oh, I don't know.

286
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,107
I should have locked
the two of you in a room years ago

287
00:21:39,182 --> 00:21:42,662
and not let you get out
until you'd kissed and made up.

288
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:47,207
But I thought, in time,
you'd come to your senses.

289
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:49,766
Boy, was I wrong.

290
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,580
So now I spend my life
between two bickering children,

291
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,541
both of whom are old enough to know better.

292
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:59,622
Especially you.

293
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,830
Margaret, I can take.

294
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:12,165
A swine like Frederick Quinn,
no problem at all. But you...

295
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:14,245
you rattle me.

296
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,727
Stelli, I love you.

297
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:24,330
You know me for the old codger that I am,
and you still hang around.

298
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,813
I can't for the life of me understand why.

299
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:35,531
Jed...

300
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,427
this case will eventually go away.

301
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:48,006
Please, please don't make her go away with it.

302
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,045
Hi!

303
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:23,434
Hi, how are you?

304
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:28,646
Are you ready?

305
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:35,108
Maggie, are you taking one for a test drive?

306
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,354
I don't even have a learner's permit!

307
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:40,906
You don't need one! On-the-job training.

308
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:43,429
Very funny. Very funny.

309
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,934
- So what's wrong?
- I didn't say a word.

310
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:51,427
I know. And very loudly.

311
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,869
OK.

312
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:56,138
I'm worried, Maggie.

313
00:23:56,238 --> 00:23:58,627
I'd like you to drop the case.

314
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,286
- Tell him to drop it. I dare you.
- He won't.

315
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,238
- I dare you!
- You know he won't.

316
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,929
This is the first time I have him
somewhere he doesn't make the rules,

317
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,819
before a judge in a courtroom.

318
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:17,892
Someplace I can beat him.

319
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,965
"Beat him"? He's your father, Maggie.

320
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,754
So what?

321
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:26,505
I am sick and tired of being afraid of him.

322
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:32,265
All my life he's made me feel like
I wasn't good enough. Never mind if he was.

323
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:35,651
He made some mistakes.
That just makes him human.

324
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:37,733
Too human.

325
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,701
You of all people should know that.

326
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:45,703
All of those women.
Were those mistakes?

327
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:49,451
What happened between
your father and me is our concern.

328
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,005
I think if I can put it behind me,
you should too.

329
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,492
Well, I've tried. And I can't.

330
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:59,340
Mom, I was there.
I saw how much he hurt you.

331
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:01,893
Why didn't you just leave him?

332
00:25:03,214 --> 00:25:05,418
Come on, talk to me.

333
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:09,228
About what you choose?
What about what I want?

334
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:12,294
I won't drop this case. I won't!

335
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,268
Somebody has to fight him. You didn't.

336
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:18,211
Oh, Maggie, you never understood.

337
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:21,382
Maybe that's my fault.

338
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,569
Look, I had to make a choice with your father.

339
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,710
It was a very hard choice.

340
00:25:28,782 --> 00:25:33,059
Sure I could have left.
God knows I thought about it.

341
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,622
But I still love him.

342
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:38,990
So I decided to stay and try to make it work.

343
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:43,494
It took a long time,
but we got through it.

344
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,892
And I honestly feel that I got
a lot more than I gave up by staying.

345
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:54,154
And I still do,
whether you believe it or not.

346
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:58,373
It's fine, Mom.

347
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:01,673
You forgive him.

348
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:04,492
You have a right to your choice.

349
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,663
And I have a right to mine.

350
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:14,344
We'll just be following you around
for a couple of days, videotaping you.

351
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:18,636
The boat, the docks, trying to show what
your life has been like since the accident.

352
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,352
My life, it is not so very interesting.

353
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:24,902
When we show the jury the tape,
we think they'll find it very interesting.

354
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:28,290
We want them to see what you've lost,
what you can't do any more.

355
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:30,853
I cannot fish is what I cannot do.

356
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,031
- It's good.
- It's good I cannot fish?

357
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:36,549
No, no, Mr. Minh. It's a terrible thing.

358
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:40,234
We need to hear the stories
from all the Meridian owners who got hurt.

359
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:44,557
- Mr. Minh, I'd like to thank you...
- Who is this man with Mr. Ward?

360
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:46,629
That's Jack Tagallini.

361
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:49,353
Mr. Ward helped him,
just like he's gonna help you.

362
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:51,811
Mr. Ward, he must be very great man.

363
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:54,504
A very great man.

364
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:57,890
Now, listen.
You take care. We'll be in touch.

365
00:26:57,998 --> 00:26:59,973
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

366
00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:04,907
- Pretty severe burns.
- But his English! The jury won't understand.

367
00:27:04,974 --> 00:27:08,553
So we shoot the video.
If it doesn't play, we lose him.

368
00:27:08,622 --> 00:27:09,570
Who's next?

369
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,827
We'll go right to the summary proceedings.

370
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,543
- How do I look?
- Nervous.

371
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:24,712
- Why?
- You have Pepto-Bismol on your mouth.

372
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:28,130
- Maggie!
- Hi. Hi.

373
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:33,604
Are we still friends?

374
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,328
What do you think?

375
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,586
Don't worry about me, Margaret.
I'm just your old decrepit father.

376
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:42,148
Be strong. Come on.

377
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,016
Your Honor, it's about evidence.
Plaintiff doesn't have any.

378
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:51,340
The only reasonable course of action
is to grant my client summary judgment.

379
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:54,307
- Denied.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

380
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:58,021
Next case.

381
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:05,608
Case no. 861947,

382
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:09,026
<i>Kellen et al. </i> versus <i>Argo Motors. </i>

383
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:13,416
For the plaintiffs, Jedediah Tucker Ward.

384
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,493
For the defense, Margaret Eleanor Ward.

385
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:19,176
I'm glad I'm not going to be
at your house for the holidays.

386
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:26,025
I presume the proper waivers
have been signed here.

387
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,306
- They have, Your Honor.
- OK, what have you got for me?

388
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:32,935
The court has before it a discovery motion

389
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,584
compelling the defendant to supply
the names and current addresses

390
00:28:36,654 --> 00:28:42,186
of all Argo employees involved in designing
the Meridian model, between 1980 and 1985.

391
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,780
Response, Miss Ward.

392
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:48,459
It doesn't deserve one.
This is a bald-faced fishing expedition.

393
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:54,221
People who worked on the car design might
have something interesting to say about it.

394
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:59,107
Your Honor, if my esteemed colleague
had the vaguest idea what he was looking for,

395
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:03,142
he could narrow his discovery
to something smaller than the phone book.

396
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:06,312
Miss Ward, I think he deserves something.

397
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:09,252
What he's asking for is out of the question.

398
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:14,693
Some of the people haven't worked for Argo
for years. They've scattered to the four winds.

399
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,180
Generating a current address list
could take thousands of hours.

400
00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:25,292
- We will give him the names.
- Mr. Ward?

401
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,145
That's a start, Your Honor.

402
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:34,338
The job descriptions and the names are not
of much value without the current addresses.

403
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:38,058
Mr. Ward, in all fairness,
I think Miss Ward has proved

404
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:41,770
that supplying the addresses
would put an undue burden on the defense.

405
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:46,506
I was concerned about that, too, Your Honor,
so I called the pension department at Argo.

406
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:49,869
Told them I had a former friend
I was looking for named John Smith.

407
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:53,349
Did they have anybody by that name
who worked for the company? They did.

408
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:56,553
Called him up on the computer
and gave me his current address.

409
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:02,091
- Really?
- An illegal invasion of privacy!

410
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,873
They keep an updated record
of all former employees

411
00:30:04,942 --> 00:30:07,975
- to send them their pension statements.
- Your Honor...

412
00:30:08,078 --> 00:30:11,908
They asked me if I worked with him
at Argo and where did I live,

413
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:15,364
and then they sent me this current newsletter.

414
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,331
It wasn't hard at all, Your Honor.

415
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:21,413
I want those addresses.

416
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:25,735
- A cheap sideshow trick.
- It worked.

417
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:29,994
- Because Symes is a sucker for your antics.
- Lighten up. I'll buy you an ice cream.

418
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,232
- Oh, Jed, cut it out.
- Estelle, shush.

419
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:34,374
No! Now, listen. No more.

420
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,484
No. There's a lot more.

421
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:38,859
This is just the beginning.

422
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:45,737
- She used to like ice cream.
- She used to like you.

423
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:52,452
I know.

424
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:57,448
I know, Michael. You don't have
to try to make me feel better.

425
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,444
It's just this thing
is gonna slow us up so much.

426
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,312
Maggie.

427
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:12,967
Maggie! Maggie!

428
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:22,631
One, two, three, four, five.

429
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:26,340
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:29,541
Mom.

431
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,644
Is there a doctor? Call the doctor!

432
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:35,044
Mom!

433
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:51,179
1954, I was watching the McCarthy
hearings on television.

434
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:58,501
I had trouble keeping my mind
on the testimony.

435
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:03,178
There was this beautiful young woman
sitting in the first row of the gallery.

436
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:09,540
Every time the camera would catch her
in the background, she was doing this.

437
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:16,323
I was fascinated.

438
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,277
I watched for hours,
trying to catch sight of her.

439
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:24,098
Finally, I couldn't stand it any longer.
I called the hearing room.

440
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:26,181
Had the guard...

441
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,667
ask her if she would call me during recess.

442
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:36,233
Amazingly enough, she did. I introduced
myself and asked her what she was doing.

443
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:41,516
She said she was mouthing the words
"McCarthy is a weasel. "

444
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:48,460
Subliminal advertising, she called it.

445
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:54,886
She said it would stick in people's minds
forever and no matter what, she claimed,

446
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,965
it would sway the deaf vote.

447
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:04,457
I got on the next plane
and we were married a month later.

448
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:15,590
I'm sure wherever Stelli is now, there are
12 guys better than me chasing her around.

449
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:21,128
But if you have a moment,
I just have this to say.

450
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:23,782
Remember please forever that I love you.

451
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,989
Don't be late for work.

452
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:54,244
You OK?

453
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,749
I've been better.

454
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:05,987
- How's it going in there?
- It's going OK.

455
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:09,607
- People have started to leave.
- Good.

456
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,869
You need something?

457
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,664
- A priest.
- Yeah.

458
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:22,661
Somebody I could confess to.
Somebody who'd tell me it wasn't my fault.

459
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:25,603
It wasn't your fault.

460
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:29,604
Maggie, she shot an embolism.
These things take years.

461
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:32,328
They build up...

462
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,818
No, but then I took this case.

463
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:41,516
You know, Nick, all my life,
whatever I wanted, she was always there.

464
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:45,575
She's always been there for us and
the one time she asked me to do something...

465
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,652
No, no, no. Come on.

466
00:35:48,622 --> 00:35:51,491
You can't blame yourself for that.

467
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:56,964
That's not what she would have wanted.

468
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:59,305
OK?

469
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:01,348
Yeah.

470
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:03,910
- I gotta go home.
- No.

471
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:09,099
I think what you gotta do is stay here
and be here with your father.

472
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:11,815
He'll be fine, Nick.
He's got you.

473
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:15,267
He's got me, yeah, but he needs you.

474
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,611
He needs you, Maggie.

475
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,433
Nick!

476
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:24,262
Laura's looking for you.

477
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:29,832
Take your dish.

478
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,246
Thanks for coming.

479
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,324
See you.

480
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:49,575
I never knew she kept this.

481
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:53,671
My jelly-jar glass.

482
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:59,106
Do you remember when she boycotted grape
jelly in sympathy with the farm workers?

483
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:04,073
Yeah. And all I'd eat was peanut butter
and grape jelly sandwiches.

484
00:37:04,493 --> 00:37:07,275
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

485
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:10,375
I solved the problem, though.
Or at least I thought I did.

486
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,307
I found a grape jelly without
any grapes in it. All chemicals.

487
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:20,074
- She'd never let you eat that.
- No. But it put her in a moral dilemma.

488
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:23,490
Should she satisfy a demanding child
with an affront to human rights

489
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:25,452
or cop out to toxic sludge?

490
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:30,341
- What did she do?
- She introduced me to marmalade.

491
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:34,250
Hey, Jed. Give a call.

492
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:36,488
OK. Thanks.

493
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,780
What a mess.

494
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:49,287
Your mom was always
in charge of organization.

495
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:14,819
She had a dental appointment today?

496
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:44,489
- How fast was that, Dr. Getchell?
- 30mph.

497
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:51,175
That's amazing.
Just amazing.

498
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:57,612
Isn't that amazing, Maggie?
All that damage for just going 30.

499
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:59,498
Yeah.

500
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:05,892
Well, there's gonna be damage till
we can figure out a way to make cars bounce.

501
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:17,123
- Do you test every model this way?
- Every model, every year.

502
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,171
Feds say we got to.

503
00:39:19,277 --> 00:39:23,499
Course, this is only one test.
We do 77 others.

504
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:25,572
Don't want no surprises.

505
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,388
That's what gets my goat
about this damn lawsuit.

506
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:32,802
What you got here is just about
the safest damn car on the road.

507
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,146
- You'll say that on the stand?
- Hell, yes.

508
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:37,220
But don't stop with me.

509
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:41,578
- What's this?
- Meridian performance charts.

510
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:46,314
The '85 model exceeded
every federal standard that year.

511
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:48,388
- Plus...
- Plus?

512
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:51,458
- Plus Rowena.
- Who's Rowena?

513
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,355
Not who. What.

514
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:56,967
An independent research facility.
The car passed every test.

515
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:10,184
- I can't find my keys.
- You're late. I need you to chop ze onions.

516
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:14,409
- Aren't we going out for dinner?
- No, I'm making your mom's menudo.

517
00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:16,483
You're cooking?

518
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:23,592
- How many tablespoons in a teaspoon?
- Do I look like a calculator?

519
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,653
- Maybe I should make something.
- Oh ho ho! No, thank you.

520
00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:29,731
I prefer to die in ze bed.

521
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,748
Is this supposed to look like this?

522
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:38,024
- Jesus!
- What?

523
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:40,427
No, nothing.

524
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:43,754
So I just left everything the way it was.

525
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:46,187
- Have you finished?
- Yeah.

526
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:51,915
- Not bad for a couple of lawyers.
- Yeah, it wasn't your mother's but...

527
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,453
- It was great.
- I just wanted some of her smell around.

528
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:02,631
I got some of your mom's things packed up.
I figured you might like 'em.

529
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:04,904
- Yes. Yes.
- Wanna see 'em?

530
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:09,833
Oh, no. Oh my God!

531
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,388
Look at all your hair!

532
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:19,911
You had a beautiful mother, Magpie.
Look at that. My God.

533
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:22,570
Magpie?

534
00:41:22,669 --> 00:41:25,735
You haven't called me that since...
I must have been 12.

535
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:28,422
Yeah.

536
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:30,794
- The prettiest, smartest...
- Yeah.

537
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,762
...mouthiest kid.

538
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:42,571
- Ah, the People's Park Festival.
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,425
- 1967, '68.
- Yeah.

540
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,147
They don't make marches like they used to.

541
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,351
Do you remember this?

542
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:07,498
No, only what I read in the paper.
You left Mom and me at home. Of course.

543
00:42:07,596 --> 00:42:09,603
I'd just turned 13.

544
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:14,153
My first boyfriend had dumped me.
And I could have used you.

545
00:42:14,796 --> 00:42:18,092
Young love was always
your mother's line, Margaret.

546
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:21,385
I was busy trying to keep
the planet in one piece.

547
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,340
Burning a few bras in the process.

548
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:25,825
I was more interested
in burning draft cards.

549
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,446
Really? I thought you were more
interested in the women's movement.

550
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:36,260
Relationships were more casual
in those days. It was just more open.

551
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:39,944
Oh, please!
I'm so tired of the '60s crap.

552
00:42:40,012 --> 00:42:42,696
I was on the road for six,
nine months at a time.

553
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:45,993
None of this ever meant anything to me.

554
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:51,431
Not even Alice Worth?

555
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,515
So that's it? Case dismissed?

556
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,850
- You're out of order, counselor.
- And you are guilty as charged.

557
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:15,210
Alice Worth was my law partner.

558
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:19,683
Oh, please, Dad!
You think I didn't know?

559
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:24,426
- This is none of your business, goddamnit!
- Alice Worth was very much my business!

560
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:28,420
She wasn’t just some nameless one-nighter.

561
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:33,129
Alice was a friend.
She was Mom's friend. Mine.

562
00:43:33,772 --> 00:43:38,955
She was everything I wanted to be.
She was smart and beautiful and a lawyer.

563
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,974
I used to follow her around in here, to watch
how she'd cross her legs or hold her drink,

564
00:43:44,076 --> 00:43:46,181
and then Mom finds her letters to you.

565
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,729
She never cried in front of me.
She wouldn't do that.

566
00:43:54,828 --> 00:43:57,381
But when she thought I was asleep,
I could hear her.

567
00:43:57,452 --> 00:44:00,419
Alone in her room,
sometimes three, four in the morning.

568
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:07,752
- I'm really tired of this ancient history.
- She was never the same after that!

569
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:10,023
Something in her eyes went dead.

570
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:14,020
Margaret, you have to know
that I was committed to your mother.

571
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:19,177
No. In one fell swoop,
you took away the woman I admired,

572
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:22,178
the mother I knew
and the father I believed in.

573
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:26,465
The conscience of America.
Defender of the huddled masses!

574
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,191
The only thing you cared
about the huddled masses

575
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:31,814
was how tall you could stand
on their shoulders!

576
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:34,818
- Wait a minute. There's more to this...
- I'm going.

577
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:37,674
- Wait. I spent my life trying to help people.
- Oh, yeah?

578
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,832
Got any thank-you notes
from Jack Tagallini recently?

579
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,715
Margaret! I had nothing to do with that.

580
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,431
Oh, yeah?
I think you're being a little modest.

581
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:50,250
Before you met Jack Tagallini,
he was just a nice guy,

582
00:44:50,348 --> 00:44:52,868
pissed off at the cost
overruns at Zembella Air.

583
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,031
- It never occurred to him to go public.
- He didn't know how. I had to show him how.

584
00:44:57,101 --> 00:45:01,989
You forced him! Or conned him! Or whatever
it is you do to get on the cover of <i>Newsweek. </i>

585
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,874
Oh, Jesus Christ!

586
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,577
I was on the cover of <i>Newsweek</i>
because I was right. Goddamnit!

587
00:45:09,676 --> 00:45:14,313
That jury was out for two hours and 27
minutes. They gave us every single point.

588
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,031
But what about Jack Tagallini?

589
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,029
You turned him into a whistle-blower
without telling him what it would cost.

590
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,134
He lost his job, all of his friends,
his professional life.

591
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:29,092
That case changed the law! It affects
every single person who gets on an airplane.

592
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,781
- You stopped taking his calls.
- I helped him.

593
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:34,219
- No, you dumped him!
- The world keeps turning.

594
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:36,487
I had other people to help.

595
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:37,930
You dumped him!

596
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:41,704
I couldn't hold his fucking hand, OK?

597
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:45,666
No, you didn't hold a hand unless
it was young, female and attractive!

598
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,806
You're a user, Dad.
You used Tagallini and all those women

599
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:51,329
and you used Mom!

600
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,245
Goddamned hypocrite.

601
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,411
How dare you question my behavior?

602
00:45:57,516 --> 00:46:01,193
You, whose claim to fame is being
one of Quinn Califan's young Nazis.

603
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,333
My clients don't blow their brains out.

604
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:07,048
- If your mother could hear you now...
- She can't, can she?

605
00:46:07,148 --> 00:46:11,490
She got outta here. Wherever she is, she's
gotta be happier than when she was with you.

606
00:46:16,396 --> 00:46:20,706
So, finally... words fail
the great Jedediah Tucker Ward.

607
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,787
You get...

608
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:46,371
Maggie!

609
00:46:46,988 --> 00:46:48,963
Maggie.

610
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,402
I heard you were having dinner with
your father. I figured you could use a friend.

611
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:08,482
Oh, Michael.

612
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:30,404
Mr. Quinn is ready for you.

613
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,413
Thank you, Sally.

614
00:47:34,636 --> 00:47:36,709
Maggie. Come in.

615
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,787
Thank you.

616
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:42,185
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

617
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:46,562
- You look tired.
- No, well, I'm fine.

618
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:51,786
When my mother died... Well, I know
how long it can take to get over.

619
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:55,016
- With the workload you're carrying...
- I'll manage.

620
00:47:55,116 --> 00:47:59,491
I want to believe that.
But in looking over this transcript,

621
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:02,793
I'm worried about
the Steven Kellen deposition.

622
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,432
No. It's all completely under control.
He's wearing down.

623
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,217
If he gets into court in that wheelchair
with this story, he'll be far too sympathetic.

624
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:17,602
- I understand that, Mr. Quinn.
- I can't put this in strong enough terms.

625
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,872
I want him eliminated
as an effective witness.

626
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,085
Yes, sir.

627
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,657
- Are you prepared to do that?
- Absolutely.

628
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:34,498
Then you won't mind if I sit in?

629
00:48:34,988 --> 00:48:37,224
No. No.

630
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:39,817
Great.

631
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:45,443
Now, Mr. Kellen, when the paramedics
were pulling you out of the vehicle,

632
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:48,074
how did it feel to be on fire?

633
00:48:48,236 --> 00:48:50,854
For Godsakes,
you just asked me that question.

634
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:54,338
No, sir, I believe I asked you
if you remembered being on fire.

635
00:48:54,412 --> 00:48:57,227
And I asked you,
when did you know you were on fire?

636
00:48:57,292 --> 00:49:01,383
And now I'm asking,
how did it feel to be on fire?

637
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:02,345
It was...

638
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:05,924
Maggie, I'm warning you,
we are already halfway out the door here.

639
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:11,745
Mr. Kellen, were you ever a patient
of a Dr. Maxwell Chastain?

640
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:15,810
Maybe. So?

641
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:18,563
Yes or no, please.

642
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:19,683
Yes.

643
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:24,393
Is Dr. Chastain a psychologist
specializing in car phobias?

644
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:27,777
- Is he, Mr. Kellen?
- Yes.

645
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:31,688
As I understand it, a car phobia
means you're afraid of driving. True?

646
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,686
It's not as simple as that.

647
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:38,374
What's not simple?
Whether it's true or it's false?

648
00:49:39,756 --> 00:49:40,770
I guess it's true.

649
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:43,331
Which makes you cautious,
maybe too cautious?

650
00:49:43,436 --> 00:49:46,306
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Noted.

651
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,769
The car blew up.
How can you be too cautious?

652
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:51,843
Technically, it burst into flames.

653
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,112
Prior to the accident, how many times
have you been cited for driving too slow?

654
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,725
- Twice.
- Are you sure it wasn't three times?

655
00:50:02,828 --> 00:50:06,538
Here we have December of '81,
August of '83, then again in October.

656
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:08,643
Objection. This is beyond the scope...

657
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:11,945
Have you had any other accidents
in the last five years?

658
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,460
- Don't answer that.
- If he doesn't, he answers in front of a jury.

659
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:19,012
Look, they weren't my fault.
Other people hit me.

660
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:22,018
- I wonder why.
- Do you really?

661
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:25,768
- Do you even care what happened?
- I know what happened, Mr. Kellen.

662
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:29,698
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no. My God.

663
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,422
And so do you.

664
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:36,387
I don't believe this, I don't believe this.

665
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,402
We're out of here. Come on.

666
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:41,705
Who the hell do you think you are?
This wasn't my fault.

667
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,706
- This deposition is finished.
- Are you fucking human?

668
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:46,819
Do you care, Miss Ward, about anybody?

669
00:50:46,892 --> 00:50:49,096
Nick, please.

670
00:50:56,492 --> 00:50:58,499
Nice pictures. Real nice.

671
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:07,265
What's a good set of 8"x 10"s cost
these days? 10, 15 bucks?

672
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:12,137
This is important, Fred.

673
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,985
What's the going rate
for a man's dignity, huh?

674
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:18,019
You stole his wife, his kid, his body.

675
00:51:18,092 --> 00:51:22,565
Now I guess you spend another 10 or 15
dollars and get the whole package?

676
00:51:22,668 --> 00:51:27,207
That's what this is about, money. He's after
your money and you're out to protect it.

677
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:30,341
Well, you hold onto it real tight

678
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:34,951
because without a heart and soul,
that's all you'll ever have.

679
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:42,665
Jed, we have angles like this
on all your people.

680
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:46,408
Bottom line, you don't want to try this case.

681
00:51:52,428 --> 00:51:55,363
Kellen had me out there,
buck naked in a hailstorm.

682
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:59,112
I need better information from you.
We got four weeks before the trial.

683
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,562
- 242 people worked on the design of that car.
- I know this.

684
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:06,694
So there are 242 chances
for you people to do something right.

685
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:11,946
- Most of them don't wanna talk with us.
- That's just excuses.

686
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:15,940
Hold on a second. You always go on about
the great David and Goliath cases.

687
00:52:16,012 --> 00:52:18,729
It seems you've forgotten
how hard the David work is.

688
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:24,741
We have worked very hard. If you cannot
see that, maybe we aren't the problem here.

689
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:56,938
What do you think?

690
00:52:57,646 --> 00:52:59,621
It needs something.

691
00:53:00,462 --> 00:53:01,542
Olive.

692
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:05,700
Overstated.

693
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,515
- I'm Ray.
- I'm Maggie.

694
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,750
Maggie. What do you do?

695
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:18,629
Me?

696
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:23,171
I'm a professional killer.

697
00:53:24,686 --> 00:53:27,556
- Do you like your work?
- Yes and no.

698
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:32,839
See, it's long hours.

699
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:36,613
And there's a lot of stress.

700
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:40,395
But when you finally put your head
on the pillow at night,

701
00:53:40,462 --> 00:53:43,080
there's this warm feeling
you get from knowing

702
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,216
you tore at least
one person's heart out that day.

703
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:54,052
I'm a lawyer.

704
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,277
I think you've had enough.

705
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:03,715
Ray, there's never enough.

706
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:17,515
Yeah, but my question is, do they count
their time in bed together as billable hours?

707
00:54:17,582 --> 00:54:19,971
Sure. At Grazier's rate.

708
00:54:20,078 --> 00:54:23,907
Maggie's the associate
so I assume she does all the work.

709
00:54:23,982 --> 00:54:29,067
- Especially the oral argument.
- What about oral arguments?

710
00:54:30,286 --> 00:54:32,358
It's just a case we heard about.

711
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,819
Drilling rights.

712
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:37,260
Maggie, you didn't go home
last night, did you?

713
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,562
It's a month before trial.

714
00:54:39,662 --> 00:54:44,037
The list of people that worked on
the Meridian, wasn't there a Pavel?

715
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,274
Yeah, he was one of
the research guys. Why?

716
00:54:47,342 --> 00:54:51,172
It's just a weird thing in Getchell's file.

717
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:58,853
A commendation letter to Getchell,
from Flannery who was the CEO back then.

718
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:03,623
Blah blah blah, usual hype. Then it says
"Please accept my gratitude and thanks

719
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:06,628
for keeping Pavel and the Meridian
issue in the family. "

720
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:10,979
It's signed at the beginning
of the 1985 model year.

721
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,637
So?

722
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:17,422
So, what "issue"?

723
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:25,538
Could be something.
I wanna talk to him.

724
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,171
Thank you.

725
00:56:41,997 --> 00:56:44,550
Do you want a rabbit?

726
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:48,996
They are the best ones.
I even got them toilet trained.

727
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:50,924
- Dr. Pavel?
- Yes?

728
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:55,811
I'm Margaret Ward. My law firm was in
contact with you and said I'd be stopping by.

729
00:56:55,918 --> 00:56:57,347
And?

730
00:56:57,422 --> 00:57:00,040
I'd like to talk to you
about some research you did

731
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:03,110
while you were working
at Argo on the Meridian.

732
00:57:03,182 --> 00:57:05,483
What Meridian?

733
00:57:05,549 --> 00:57:10,634
A car. You did extensive research
on its electrical system.

734
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:12,905
It was project 0243.

735
00:57:15,149 --> 00:57:17,670
I'm no longer good with numbers.

736
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:21,091
It was a 1985 model, station wagon,

737
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:24,581
and you said there were problems with it.

738
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:32,681
- The depth charge!
- Excuse me?

739
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,230
That's what I called it, the depth charge.

740
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:40,941
Herbert, stop flirting with the lady.

741
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:46,216
- Depth charge, sir, is...
- You want to know about the circuits.

742
00:57:46,317 --> 00:57:48,772
Yeah, yeah. OK.

743
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,922
- I saved their ass on that one.
- Really? How?

744
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,300
- There was this guy. A hillbilly.
- Hillbilly?

745
00:57:59,405 --> 00:58:02,602
- What's his name?
- You mean Getchell? George Getchell?

746
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,485
That's the one.
Getchell, that's the name.

747
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,550
He was your supervisor for 16 years.

748
00:58:15,885 --> 00:58:21,036
16 years.
Just testing, testing, testing.

749
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:26,055
Did you know that whatshisname designed
the circuit and I was supposed to test it?

750
00:58:26,158 --> 00:58:28,841
But he said "Alexander Pavel,
leave it alone. "

751
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:35,467
"We've already tooled up for it
on the assembly line. The circuit is OK."

752
00:58:35,566 --> 00:58:37,541
That's what he said.

753
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,189
But I am a scientist.

754
00:58:41,582 --> 00:58:44,102
I test it anyway on my own.

755
00:58:44,206 --> 00:58:47,173
I like to mix things.

756
00:58:48,142 --> 00:58:50,280
I like to see how things combine.

757
00:58:54,285 --> 00:58:56,260
The circuit was OK...

758
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:03,271
until I started hitting the car
when the left-turn signal was flashing.

759
00:59:03,342 --> 00:59:06,189
Then...

760
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:08,261
Depth charge.

761
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:12,744
- It blew up?
- It blew up.

762
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:15,785
The Meridian blew up?

763
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:19,268
Yeah.

764
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:23,944
You see, where there's
an impact of metal on metal.

765
00:59:27,885 --> 00:59:33,068
In this area,
the devices are maybe 50-75cm apart.

766
00:59:35,726 --> 00:59:39,981
If there's an arc
in the flow of the circuit...

767
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:41,060
Yeah.

768
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:44,580
Just as it's penetrating
the electrical fuel pump,

769
00:59:44,686 --> 00:59:47,948
then the gas tank will blow up.

770
00:59:48,045 --> 00:59:51,974
It's just a simple chain reaction.

771
00:59:52,077 --> 00:59:56,682
So you're saying that,
if the car is hit from the rear,

772
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,546
when the left-turn signal is functioning,

773
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:02,694
it just might blow up.

774
01:00:02,797 --> 01:00:03,779
Correct.

775
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:09,701
If you are really interested in this,
why don't you read my report?

776
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,497
And let's have a coffee.

777
01:00:11,597 --> 01:00:13,485
The report...

778
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:16,932
When you filed this report,
did you give a copy to Getchell?

779
01:00:17,037 --> 01:00:20,266
- To the company.
- May I see another copy?

780
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,919
No, the company has it, of course.

781
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,161
- The company has everything?
- Yep.

782
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:28,229
Except my notes.

783
01:00:28,301 --> 01:00:30,308
- You do have notes?
- Of course.

784
01:00:30,381 --> 01:00:33,229
- May I see those, please?
- No.

785
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:34,308
No?

786
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:38,659
If you want my notes,
you need to go to Iron Mountain.

787
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:42,381
Sugar?

788
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:50,283
Thank you.

789
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:04,874
Miller's left the office.
You want me to try him at home?

790
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:07,330
No, no.

791
01:01:07,438 --> 01:01:11,496
I think I should have died
the day Nixon resigned.

792
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,463
Look at this. See? Look.

793
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:18,468
See this? This guy here.

794
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:28,583
How about I make you
some dinner at my place?

795
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:37,222
No. Thank you, but...

796
01:01:41,038 --> 01:01:43,012
I'm really not very hungry.

797
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:45,092
So...

798
01:01:45,198 --> 01:01:48,427
Anyway, listen. I think
I found something pretty interesting.

799
01:01:48,526 --> 01:01:49,508
What's that?

800
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:52,135
A commendation letter
from Flannery to Getchell.

801
01:01:52,237 --> 01:01:55,172
Do you remember an Argo research guy,
Alexander Pavel?

802
01:01:55,277 --> 01:01:56,706
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

803
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:26,052
Thank God.

804
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:37,510
I don't know.
Maggie, we're talking about Argo Motors.

805
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:41,476
- They have guys who research everything.
- Not everything.

806
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:45,739
A glitch that takes three or four things
to happen simultaneously could slip by.

807
01:02:45,837 --> 01:02:49,153
I get Getchell to come clean.
We settle quietly out of court.

808
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:52,077
Argo Motors kisses my feet
for avoiding a public scandal.

809
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:56,364
Maybe, maybe.
Then again, maybe Pavel is a nut bar.

810
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:58,152
Maybe.

811
01:02:59,566 --> 01:03:04,836
I grant you, these days, the guy
is a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic.

812
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:07,779
But somebody was at home
when that report was made.

813
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:10,374
Mr. Getchell is returning your call.

814
01:03:10,478 --> 01:03:13,260
Oh, it's our good buddy from Argo!

815
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:16,456
- Dr. Getchell.
- Miss Ward, how are you?

816
01:03:16,557 --> 01:03:21,642
I'm fine, sir. How would you
like to discuss Alexander Pavel?

817
01:03:23,597 --> 01:03:26,445
Alexander Pavel is a senile old fool.

818
01:03:27,021 --> 01:03:29,388
So you didn't take his advice
on the blinker circuit?

819
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:31,875
I decided his test results were inconclusive

820
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:36,619
and informed Mr. Flannery,
the chief executive officer at the time.

821
01:03:36,717 --> 01:03:39,084
People were blown up, sir.

822
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:42,149
We changed that light in the next model year.

823
01:03:42,221 --> 01:03:44,555
I suggest you get an attorney.

824
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:46,923
I've already talked to one.

825
01:03:47,885 --> 01:03:52,195
It was right at the time the report came out.
He said we had nothing to worry about.

826
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,342
What idiot told you that?

827
01:03:54,446 --> 01:03:57,097
If I'm not mistaken, he's your boss.

828
01:03:57,197 --> 01:03:59,172
Michael Grazier.

829
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,580
Miss Ward? Are you there?

830
01:04:05,837 --> 01:04:08,521
What? What did he say?

831
01:04:09,837 --> 01:04:12,423
Maggie?

832
01:04:15,406 --> 01:04:20,872
It was a rough time.
I was buried, working on 50 things at once.

833
01:04:25,101 --> 01:04:27,109
It got lost in the shuffle.

834
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:31,110
You gave advice on something
you hadn't reviewed.

835
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:33,570
I mistook it for another report.

836
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:35,717
Why didn't you tell somebody?

837
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:41,419
Well, Quinn had just made me liaison
with Argo's in-house counselor.

838
01:04:41,517 --> 01:04:43,459
That was a huge plum.

839
01:04:43,565 --> 01:04:46,860
If I did it well, they were gonna
give me all of Argo's litigation.

840
01:04:46,957 --> 01:04:49,640
Not a good time to appear sloppy.

841
01:04:55,789 --> 01:04:57,796
Now what?

842
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:02,216
We have to lose it.

843
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:10,309
I am not going to be a party
to destroying evidence.

844
01:05:13,069 --> 01:05:18,819
Maggie, Argo paid this firm a little over
8 million dollars in fees last year.

845
01:05:18,926 --> 01:05:20,900
Do you want to jeopardize that?

846
01:05:21,005 --> 01:05:24,387
We'd hurt ourselves and the client.
It would compound the mistake.

847
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:27,757
- Michael, people were killed!
- Yes, I know that.

848
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:31,433
It was a bad mistake, but it's done.
Over. We have to move on.

849
01:05:31,502 --> 01:05:33,509
I don't know.

850
01:05:33,678 --> 01:05:36,678
What? What don't you know?

851
01:05:36,749 --> 01:05:39,302
People make mistakes. <i>Mea culpa. </i>

852
01:05:39,405 --> 01:05:44,261
But they don't want to trash their lives.
Guilty as charged.

853
01:05:44,365 --> 01:05:47,300
Sometimes you have to learn the hard way.

854
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:50,951
You know, you're not the only one
that doesn't sleep at night.

855
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:54,796
OK. Tell me you don't
make mistakes yourself.

856
01:05:55,725 --> 01:05:58,027
Maggie.

857
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,198
Maggie, come on, please.

858
01:06:02,669 --> 01:06:06,215
If you have any feelings for me, please.

859
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:09,100
Think about this for a while, huh?

860
01:06:10,317 --> 01:06:12,291
Hey, come on.

861
01:06:23,565 --> 01:06:25,540
Oh, Michael, no.

862
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:28,712
What?

863
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:32,938
You didn't give me this case
to help my career.

864
01:06:33,037 --> 01:06:35,885
You wanted to cover your ass.

865
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:40,771
If this ever came up, who better to keep your
secret than someone you're sleeping with?

866
01:06:40,878 --> 01:06:42,787
You asked me for this case.

867
01:06:42,861 --> 01:06:45,861
You threw the bait down
and waited for me to snap it up.

868
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:50,122
Maybe this isn't completely clear to you,
Maggie. If I go down, so do you.

869
01:06:50,189 --> 01:06:52,709
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- You're about to.

870
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:56,578
You're gonna break rule no. 1,
which is don't fuck your friends.

871
01:06:56,685 --> 01:06:59,653
You turn on me,
every lie here is gonna turn on you.

872
01:06:59,757 --> 01:07:02,791
You'll be on the bricks
faster than you can dream of.

873
01:07:02,861 --> 01:07:06,919
When you try to tie into another firm,
you'll be lucky to get hired as a messenger.

874
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:10,498
I guess that's a risk I have to take.

875
01:07:12,717 --> 01:07:15,172
Look around you, Maggie.

876
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:18,277
I'm all you've got, anywhere.

877
01:07:19,245 --> 01:07:23,304
Now, you do this, you are all alone.

878
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,459
Frederick, the way I see things...

879
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:31,972
The way you see things
is what's gotten us in this position.

880
01:07:32,077 --> 01:07:35,721
My father does want
all of the information on Pavel.

881
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:39,270
We hand this over,
we lose Argo and the case.

882
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:41,959
If we don't give full disclosure
and we get caught,

883
01:07:42,029 --> 01:07:45,193
we lose the confidence of all our other clients.

884
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:51,720
You're jeopardizing the biggest corporate
play this firm has ever been involved with.

885
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:53,796
We're down to the wire here.

886
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:58,146
We cannot let this become
even more of a disaster.

887
01:07:58,221 --> 01:08:00,905
What do you want to do?

888
01:08:01,805 --> 01:08:05,896
How long did Pavel work for Argo?

889
01:08:06,926 --> 01:08:08,714
32 years.

890
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:14,597
You have to figure, an awful lot
of paper would build up over that time.

891
01:08:16,749 --> 01:08:19,302
Right.

892
01:08:19,406 --> 01:08:21,380
So we bury it.

893
01:08:22,286 --> 01:08:26,628
We send them everything. Every letter,
every phone message, every scrap of paper.

894
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:30,760
Anything we can find,
we'll send them the Library of Congress.

895
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:34,178
They just have to pull the files
from the year the research was done.

896
01:08:34,285 --> 01:08:38,508
- Things get misfiled.
- You can't do that.

897
01:08:38,605 --> 01:08:40,994
We can inventory the documents
any way we like.

898
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:44,550
Come up with some arcane structure, bury it.

899
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:48,843
Bottom line, it is within the letter of the law.

900
01:08:48,909 --> 01:08:52,422
- It'll work.
- It had better, Michael. It had better.

901
01:08:52,525 --> 01:08:54,630
Now, both of you, this matter is quarantined.

902
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:57,898
No one outside this room is to hear about it.

903
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:02,949
There is still the matter of Miss Ward.

904
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:04,548
What does that mean?

905
01:09:04,621 --> 01:09:12,107
Well, it's obvious there are serious questions
regarding her loyalty to this case.

906
01:09:13,869 --> 01:09:20,296
I consider her an important and extremely
loyal member of this team, Michael.

907
01:09:20,397 --> 01:09:23,658
Are you going to have a problem with that?

908
01:09:23,757 --> 01:09:25,862
No.

909
01:09:25,965 --> 01:09:27,241
Good.

910
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:40,132
Can I see that, please?

911
01:09:44,557 --> 01:09:47,306
There it is, page 23, third from the bottom.

912
01:09:47,405 --> 01:09:51,431
I transposed the numbers,
put it in project 2340.

913
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:54,282
Plausible deniability.

914
01:09:54,349 --> 01:09:59,880
- Congratulations, they'll never find it.
- That is the idea.

915
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:02,699
- Ah, the glamour of law!
- Justice by avalanche.

916
01:10:02,797 --> 01:10:05,066
Maggie, you're just defending your client.

917
01:10:05,165 --> 01:10:10,860
- What about the victims?
- They should have had a better lawyer.

918
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:14,918
- This entire box is from 1963.
- This is a joke.

919
01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:17,225
All of my labels are falling off.

920
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:22,475
Let's just keep digging.
Maybe we'll find what we're looking for.

921
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:26,469
Hey, what's going on?
We lose our lease?

922
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:31,811
No, this is a Father's Day gift,
courtesy of Quinn Califan and Lunt.

923
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,867
- What's so funny?
- Don't you get it?

924
01:10:37,965 --> 01:10:42,023
We ask for one man's files.
She sends us a paper blizzard.

925
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:45,987
- She's hiding something.
- Yeah. Maybe.

926
01:10:46,061 --> 01:10:49,509
- I ever tell you you're a terrific lawyer?
- Yes.

927
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:51,588
I lied.

928
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:57,092
Find this guy Pavel. You know,
the bunny man? I wanna talk to him.

929
01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:07,180
The testing methodology was state of the art
at the time and that's what we went by.

930
01:11:07,277 --> 01:11:10,790
OK, George.
We're through for the day.

931
01:11:10,861 --> 01:11:13,512
You're still talking a little above the jury.

932
01:11:13,581 --> 01:11:15,653
Not that that would be difficult.

933
01:11:15,757 --> 01:11:17,731
Just keep it simple.

934
01:11:18,381 --> 01:11:22,058
- I wish I'd never seen that damn report.
- Makes two of us.

935
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:25,540
- May I ask a question, please?
- Sure.

936
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:29,671
Why didn't you just
change the blinker circuit?

937
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:36,201
It's just a question.

938
01:11:43,085 --> 01:11:47,624
I told Flannery about the problem
a month or so before he died.

939
01:11:47,725 --> 01:11:50,311
- He called in his head bean counter.
- What's that?

940
01:11:50,381 --> 01:11:53,480
- Risk management expert, right?
- Yeah.

941
01:11:53,549 --> 01:11:57,477
Flannery shows him the data and asks him
how much it would cost to retrofit...

942
01:11:57,549 --> 01:12:00,778
- You mean recall?
- Yeah, you got it.

943
01:12:00,877 --> 01:12:03,876
To retrofit 175,000 units.

944
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:08,421
Multiply that times 300 bucks a car,
give or take.

945
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:11,394
You're looking at around $50 million.

946
01:12:11,469 --> 01:12:15,397
So the risk guy,
he crunches the numbers some more.

947
01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:20,357
He figures you'd have a fireball collision
about every 3,000 cars.

948
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:22,534
That's 158 explosions.

949
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:25,829
Which is almost as many
plaintiffs as there are.

950
01:12:25,901 --> 01:12:28,519
These guys know their numbers.

951
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:38,626
So you multiply that
times $200,000 per lawsuit.

952
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:43,938
That's assuming everybody sues and wins.
30 million max.

953
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:48,714
See? It's cheaper to deal with the lawsuits
than it is to fix the blinker.

954
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:54,345
It's what the bean counters
call a simple actuarial analysis.

955
01:13:17,357 --> 01:13:19,332
Dad?

956
01:13:28,525 --> 01:13:32,420
- Dad!
- Miss Ward? What an honor.

957
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:35,307
You've come to admire your handiwork, I see.

958
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:39,754
- Is he here?
- He's gone.

959
01:13:41,325 --> 01:13:45,383
This wasn't my idea. I'm sorry.

960
01:13:46,285 --> 01:13:48,357
I'm glad to hear that.

961
01:13:50,637 --> 01:13:52,611
So.

962
01:13:53,644 --> 01:13:59,078
You guys got anything stronger
than herb tea to drink around here?

963
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:07,496
That bad?

964
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:11,012
I'm sorry.
Deborah usually does this kind of thing.

965
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:14,859
- You mean she has another job?
- Maggie! She's married.

966
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,437
That never stopped him before, Nick.

967
01:14:18,508 --> 01:14:21,574
She's married to a woman named Cindy.

968
01:14:24,045 --> 01:14:25,027
Really?

969
01:14:25,101 --> 01:14:28,745
Really. He doesn't play around any more,
or maybe you hadn't noticed.

970
01:14:28,845 --> 01:14:32,674
- Nope. Maybe I didn't care.
- Of course you care. The man owns you.

971
01:14:32,748 --> 01:14:37,702
Everything you are, everything you do
is based on driving him crazy.

972
01:14:37,804 --> 01:14:41,699
- Well, thank you, Dr. Freud.
- Like it takes a genius to spot it?

973
01:14:41,804 --> 01:14:45,252
Jesus, Maggie!
If he stands up, you sit down.

974
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:49,318
If he turns right, you turn left,
even if you don't want to.

975
01:14:49,389 --> 01:14:52,138
Your biggest aspiration
is to be his mirror image.

976
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:58,020
Exactly the opposite of what he is,
and the problem is you don't know what he is.

977
01:14:58,124 --> 01:15:00,994
That makes being you impossible.

978
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:03,938
You give him too much credit, Nick.

979
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,948
I guess you always have.

980
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:16,199
And what the hell have you done?

981
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:21,676
You're probably gonna beat him, Maggie.

982
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:23,748
We both know that.

983
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:29,803
You got the staff and the money
to grind us into the ground.

984
01:15:30,925 --> 01:15:36,359
But even if he loses,
he'll know he went down on the right side.

985
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:39,298
You'll have your big success.

986
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:44,293
Your partnership. And what else?

987
01:15:50,189 --> 01:15:52,196
I got work to do.

988
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,331
What?

989
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,227
Oh, no. Oh, no!

990
01:16:53,516 --> 01:16:57,193
- Of course, he denied everything.
- There's not one single copy left?

991
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:01,668
- No.
- Then, who's to say the notes ever existed?

992
01:17:02,924 --> 01:17:06,754
Here! Good dog.

993
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:08,868
Go catch the ball.

994
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,013
It won't work, Mr. Quinn.

995
01:17:11,116 --> 01:17:14,150
I can still testify.
I can tell them the notes existed.

996
01:17:14,221 --> 01:17:18,956
What then? Your testimony will be vitiated
by Michael who has an impeccable record

997
01:17:19,021 --> 01:17:21,192
and loyal friends in the legal community.

998
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,813
And you will have destroyed
a very promising career.

999
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:26,186
I'd hate to see that happen.

1000
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,369
What about Pavel?

1001
01:17:30,477 --> 01:17:34,219
My father will find him, call him up
as a witness and he'll blow the cover.

1002
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:36,902
I don't think so.
We have a way of neutralizing him.

1003
01:17:37,005 --> 01:17:38,979
- How?
- You.

1004
01:17:43,596 --> 01:17:46,182
I watched your deposition of Mr. Kellen.

1005
01:17:46,284 --> 01:17:49,896
You discredited him while making it seem
like he was doing it to himself.

1006
01:17:49,997 --> 01:17:51,906
That takes talent.

1007
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:57,315
The good doctor's a far more impeachable
witness. He shouldn't be a problem.

1008
01:17:57,388 --> 01:18:02,309
At least, I hope it's you. The jury accepts this
kind of thing much better if a woman does it.

1009
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:08,228
But even if it's not, you can be certain the
good doctor will be dispatched by someone.

1010
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,307
It's going to happen.

1011
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:14,123
This is really the way you want it?

1012
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,578
It's the way it is.

1013
01:18:16,684 --> 01:18:21,419
Bottom line, Michael Grazier's put us
in an extraordinarily difficult position.

1014
01:18:21,517 --> 01:18:24,550
When it's over, he's going to pay for it.

1015
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,173
But that needn't concern you.

1016
01:18:27,277 --> 01:18:30,179
You're gonna be far too busy...

1017
01:18:30,284 --> 01:18:33,862
as the youngest partner
in the history of this firm.

1018
01:20:31,788 --> 01:20:33,795
- Margaret!
- Yeah?

1019
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:39,975
- Margaret, are you here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
01:20:41,581 --> 01:20:44,614
Nick said you came by the office
the other night. Did you...

1021
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:47,269
- Yeah.
- I guess we just missed each other.

1022
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:49,348
How did you get in?

1023
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:52,708
I used your mother's key.

1024
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:55,399
I tried calling you
but your phone's been disconnected.

1025
01:20:55,469 --> 01:20:57,640
Come in.

1026
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:01,669
I didn't want to use it but I...

1027
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:06,858
I got worried.
I thought something had happened to you.

1028
01:21:06,956 --> 01:21:09,738
Your mom was mad at me
when she died and I...

1029
01:21:10,348 --> 01:21:13,414
Don't worry. I'm not going out any windows.

1030
01:21:15,148 --> 01:21:18,858
I just wanted to say that I was sorry
and I'm wrong. I was dead wrong.

1031
01:21:18,956 --> 01:21:22,535
I got real defensive.

1032
01:21:22,636 --> 01:21:27,971
I started... I was acting like a clown.
I was bullying people. You...

1033
01:21:28,076 --> 01:21:30,148
Dad, you don't have to do this.

1034
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,220
Wait, I'm not finished yet. I...

1035
01:21:36,428 --> 01:21:38,217
I guess I'm finished.

1036
01:21:52,076 --> 01:21:54,531
Would you sit down?

1037
01:21:54,636 --> 01:21:56,611
Yeah.

1038
01:22:01,356 --> 01:22:03,331
You can just toss that.

1039
01:22:07,021 --> 01:22:10,534
Dad. I wish Mom were here.

1040
01:22:10,636 --> 01:22:13,670
I wish I could call her and talk to her.

1041
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:15,813
And yet I know exactly what she'd tell me.

1042
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:19,905
And I was going to call you. I was.

1043
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,558
I wanted to. But I didn't know how.

1044
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,075
I'm so used to being angry with you
that anything else just doesn't feel right.

1045
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:34,147
It felt kind of awkward.

1046
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:38,696
I'm sorry I spent my whole life
being angry with you.

1047
01:22:38,796 --> 01:22:44,710
It's been a constructive anger.
I've gotten a lot done, somehow.

1048
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:48,708
You were also my scapegoat.
If anything went wrong, I blamed it on you.

1049
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:53,188
Anything. I could fail a test
and somehow it was your fault.

1050
01:22:55,084 --> 01:23:00,452
Now I look at things as they are
and I realize I need a new approach.

1051
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:07,266
I don't have the slightest idea where to begin.

1052
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,627
I don't know.

1053
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:16,617
I get up and pray to God I can get through
the day without somebody catching on.

1054
01:23:16,716 --> 01:23:20,709
In-between, it's just all smoke and mirrors.

1055
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:26,345
I always thought I was doing the right thing
but maybe I was wrong. I don't know.

1056
01:23:31,788 --> 01:23:36,774
I think that's the first time
I ever heard you say that.

1057
01:23:36,876 --> 01:23:38,981
I guess I should work on that, shouldn't I?

1058
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,842
Come in.

1059
01:23:59,404 --> 01:24:00,386
Hi.

1060
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:11,912
- These are for you.
- Fine.

1061
01:24:13,484 --> 01:24:17,991
Nothing terribly important. Interrogatories,
depo summaries, witness lists.

1062
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,515
Just leave it.

1063
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:22,977
Michael, you were right.

1064
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:27,108
I would make a lousy messenger.

1065
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:33,251
I'm listening.

1066
01:24:33,356 --> 01:24:35,560
I saw my father last night.

1067
01:24:36,556 --> 01:24:41,378
We talked about a lot of things.
Even got some of them straightened out.

1068
01:24:41,485 --> 01:24:46,121
Afterwards I did some thinking
and I realized...

1069
01:24:46,188 --> 01:24:51,305
I realized it had been a long time
since I'd done any thinking. It felt good.

1070
01:24:51,404 --> 01:24:55,627
Somebody once told me
an emotional lawyer is a bad lawyer.

1071
01:24:55,724 --> 01:24:59,783
- I've been a pretty bad lawyer lately.
- No argument.

1072
01:24:59,884 --> 01:25:04,739
I've come very close to blowing everything
around here for everyone, including myself.

1073
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,260
So, what do you say?

1074
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,402
You forgive me, I'll forgive you.

1075
01:25:12,236 --> 01:25:16,033
Or I'll forgive you, you forgive me.
Please.

1076
01:25:26,924 --> 01:25:29,313
Tell me what you know about Pavel.

1077
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,802
He doesn't have a chance.

1078
01:25:36,396 --> 01:25:37,541
Right.

1079
01:25:43,788 --> 01:25:46,024
Dr. Pavel.

1080
01:25:46,124 --> 01:25:50,346
Let's talk about the Meridian blinker circuit.

1081
01:25:50,444 --> 01:25:55,779
In your capacity as research scientist at Argo,
did you have occasion to test it?

1082
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,258
Yes, sir, I did.

1083
01:25:57,356 --> 01:26:00,356
- Did you have any problems with it?
- Did we have problems?

1084
01:26:00,428 --> 01:26:04,290
That circuit is garbage.
It blew up the gas tank.

1085
01:26:04,396 --> 01:26:07,244
I said so in the report to Mr. Getchell.

1086
01:26:07,308 --> 01:26:09,861
It was his big invention.

1087
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:12,713
Big deal, Mr. Getchell.

1088
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:16,261
So I gave him the report,
and after that, I don't know.

1089
01:26:16,364 --> 01:26:20,620
You were certain, and still are, that this circuit
should not have gone into that car?

1090
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:23,172
Objection! Calls for conclusion.

1091
01:26:23,276 --> 01:26:27,073
Your Honor, his job at Argo
was reaching conclusions just like this.

1092
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:29,035
Overruled.

1093
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:34,697
Should this circuit
have gone into the Meridian?

1094
01:26:34,796 --> 01:26:38,145
Yes, if you want to kill people.

1095
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:49,057
- No further questions.
- Your witness, Miss Ward.

1096
01:26:49,964 --> 01:26:54,601
Your Honor, does plaintiff's counsel
intend to introduce this alleged report?

1097
01:26:55,179 --> 01:26:58,027
- Mr. Ward?
- No.

1098
01:26:58,828 --> 01:27:04,676
So the only evidence of its existence
is testimony, such as that of Dr. Pavel?

1099
01:27:06,348 --> 01:27:08,355
Yes, just testimony.

1100
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:30,050
Dr. Pavel, in all of your years at Argo, you
must have worked on hundreds of projects.

1101
01:27:30,156 --> 01:27:32,228
Oh, yes. Hundreds.

1102
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,689
Could you tell me about
some of your favorites?

1103
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:39,749
Objection. Dr. Pavel's former
research has no relevance here.

1104
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,642
Overruled.

1105
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:44,549
Please answer, Doctor.

1106
01:27:45,099 --> 01:27:47,336
There were lots.

1107
01:27:47,436 --> 01:27:50,305
The Atlas, that was a terrific car.

1108
01:27:51,116 --> 01:27:53,985
Motorcycle Python.

1109
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:58,118
The Python.
Doctor, did it have circuit problems?

1110
01:27:58,795 --> 01:28:03,465
No, but I worked on different motorcycles.
Maybe some of the others...

1111
01:28:03,564 --> 01:28:08,136
Perhaps like the A100. Do you remember
a defective gasket on that one?

1112
01:28:08,236 --> 01:28:10,211
A100?

1113
01:28:11,436 --> 01:28:12,516
No.

1114
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:18,021
What about CA3200? According to
reports, an axle had to be replaced.

1115
01:28:18,124 --> 01:28:21,637
Yes, yes. That was a wonderful motorcycle.

1116
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:26,116
That was the first time we put that linkage
in a two-wheeled vehicle.

1117
01:28:26,188 --> 01:28:29,002
The CA3200 was a pickup truck, Doctor.

1118
01:28:29,068 --> 01:28:32,450
Objection. Your Honor,
she's testifying for the witness.

1119
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:37,028
Sustained.

1120
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:41,889
Doctor, what is 2762396?

1121
01:28:41,995 --> 01:28:43,970
Objection! This is not a math test.

1122
01:28:44,076 --> 01:28:46,181
It goes to the quality of his memory.

1123
01:28:46,284 --> 01:28:50,474
Overruled. I think, without the report,
the doctor's memory is relevant.

1124
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:53,190
I'm going to allow this line of questioning.

1125
01:28:53,259 --> 01:28:57,188
I'm not so good with numbers any more.
Could you please repeat it?

1126
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:00,391
Absolutely. 2762396.

1127
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,572
- Isn't that your phone number, sir?
- Objection!

1128
01:29:05,676 --> 01:29:08,578
- Overruled.
- How about 94536?

1129
01:29:08,684 --> 01:29:13,059
- Objection.
- Overruled. Sit down, Mr. Ward.

1130
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:21,315
Your zip code, sir. 123019?

1131
01:29:24,684 --> 01:29:26,659
Isn't that your birthday, sir?

1132
01:29:28,556 --> 01:29:31,655
- And 0243?
- Objection, Your Honor.

1133
01:29:31,756 --> 01:29:34,342
- All right, Miss Ward.
- Isn't that the Meridian?

1134
01:29:34,443 --> 01:29:35,720
Miss Ward!

1135
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:37,697
- Your Honor...
- No further questions.

1136
01:29:37,804 --> 01:29:40,357
I'd like that last remark
struck from the record.

1137
01:29:40,428 --> 01:29:42,053
Strike the last answer.

1138
01:29:42,156 --> 01:29:45,472
- Miss Ward, I don't want to warn you again.
- Beautiful.

1139
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:48,363
You may step down, Doctor.

1140
01:29:49,547 --> 01:29:52,198
Not good with numbers any more.

1141
01:29:52,268 --> 01:29:54,275
That's not a crime, is it?

1142
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:57,828
I still remember the most important things.

1143
01:29:58,156 --> 01:30:00,577
Next witness, Mr. Ward.

1144
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:08,715
Your Honor, plaintiff calls Michael Grazier.

1145
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:12,358
What?
Objection! This is unsupportable!

1146
01:30:12,428 --> 01:30:14,697
Your Honor,
I need him on the witness stand.

1147
01:30:14,796 --> 01:30:17,578
- It's outrageous!
- Hold on.

1148
01:30:17,676 --> 01:30:21,059
I want you all in my chambers now.
Recess.

1149
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,958
I don't care.
I need him on the stand.

1150
01:30:26,027 --> 01:30:28,264
Come on, Jed. You listen to me!

1151
01:30:28,364 --> 01:30:32,586
Go and turn some other courtroom
into a circus with your half-ass stunts.

1152
01:30:32,684 --> 01:30:35,717
Come on, Fred.
If it's a stunt, if I'm a joke, let me prove it.

1153
01:30:35,787 --> 01:30:38,057
The jury came out
on that one a long time ago.

1154
01:30:38,155 --> 01:30:40,610
- Wait a minute...
- Hold it!

1155
01:30:40,716 --> 01:30:43,563
Just sit down. Look, people.

1156
01:30:43,628 --> 01:30:46,977
Listening to you spit on each other
is entertaining as hell.

1157
01:30:47,084 --> 01:30:49,735
But I gotta move this thing along.

1158
01:30:49,835 --> 01:30:53,152
- Jed, what the hell are you doing?
- I have to have him on the stand.

1159
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:56,675
It's critical to show Argo's state of mind
when they built that car.

1160
01:30:56,747 --> 01:31:01,057
- He can't do this without prior notice.
- He can. It's within your discretion, Judge.

1161
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:05,190
He's trying to save face in front of his
clients, so they think he has something.

1162
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,496
There's no offer of proof here.

1163
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:10,279
You're asking for a leap of faith here, Jed.

1164
01:31:10,347 --> 01:31:12,584
Can you give me one reason why I should?

1165
01:31:12,684 --> 01:31:15,401
The worst thing that can happen
is that I am wrong.

1166
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:17,802
If I am, you're gonna make it
very ugly for me.

1167
01:31:17,867 --> 01:31:21,642
I would think the thought of that
would be irresistible to you.

1168
01:31:21,707 --> 01:31:26,628
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help you God?

1169
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:29,799
- I do.
- Be seated and state your name.

1170
01:31:34,539 --> 01:31:36,776
Michael McKinley Grazier.

1171
01:31:37,675 --> 01:31:41,799
Mr. Grazier, I understand you are
in charge of legal affairs for Argo

1172
01:31:41,867 --> 01:31:43,755
in the firm of Quinn Califan and Lunt.

1173
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:47,944
I'm the chief legal liaison
between Argo and my firm.

1174
01:31:48,043 --> 01:31:54,786
If somebody asks for a safety report on Argo,
someone like me, for instance,

1175
01:31:54,859 --> 01:31:58,788
you would get it and you would turn
it over to them. Right?

1176
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,550
Right.

1177
01:32:00,619 --> 01:32:04,264
All of them. Every single one.

1178
01:32:05,323 --> 01:32:09,480
Mr. Ward, you have all
the safety research in existence.

1179
01:32:12,268 --> 01:32:16,043
You mean there might be a report
that is no longer in existence?

1180
01:32:16,108 --> 01:32:21,705
There might be eight-legged mice on Venus.
That's another question I can't answer.

1181
01:32:21,804 --> 01:32:25,415
Very easy for you to make jokes.
You have both your arms and legs.

1182
01:32:25,516 --> 01:32:30,055
- Objection! Argumentative.
- Sustained.

1183
01:32:30,156 --> 01:32:35,971
Opposing counsel's not suggested anything
that justifies keeping Mr. Grazier on the stand.

1184
01:32:36,076 --> 01:32:39,425
- Isn't it time to move on?
- I'm leaning in that direction.

1185
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,223
Please get to the point.

1186
01:32:41,324 --> 01:32:45,634
Mr. Grazier, do you know of
the existence, now or in the past,

1187
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:49,155
of a report calling into question
the safety of the Meridian model?

1188
01:32:49,227 --> 01:32:52,544
I can't testify on some hypothetical report.

1189
01:32:52,619 --> 01:32:55,968
It wasn't hypothetical to Dr. Pavel.
He wrote it.

1190
01:32:56,076 --> 01:32:59,873
- So he says.
- So he says under oath.

1191
01:33:01,484 --> 01:33:04,517
Do you understand, sir,
that you are testifying under oath?

1192
01:33:04,587 --> 01:33:08,264
- Yes, I do.
- And that perjury is grounds for disbarment?

1193
01:33:08,364 --> 01:33:11,495
Mr. Ward, I find that objectionable.
I do know the law.

1194
01:33:11,596 --> 01:33:16,931
So do I. You're using semantics when
all you have to do is answer a question.

1195
01:33:17,036 --> 01:33:22,218
- Did you see that report? Yes or no?
- Objection! The question has been answered.

1196
01:33:22,315 --> 01:33:25,315
- It's been asked and has not been answered.
- Overruled.

1197
01:33:25,388 --> 01:33:27,592
Yes or no? I think you're being evasive!

1198
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:30,343
I'm not.
I'm answering the questions you're asking.

1199
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:34,983
The hell you are! You know that,
I know that, the jury knows that.

1200
01:33:35,084 --> 01:33:37,833
- Mr. Ward...
- Everybody in this courtroom knows it.

1201
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:42,177
- Mr. Ward, sit down.
- That son of bitch is getting to the jury.

1202
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:47,302
No. He's only bluffing.
He did the same thing in <i>Wrangell</i> v <i>Kincaid. </i>

1203
01:33:47,404 --> 01:33:49,957
- I can handle this.
- Then do it.

1204
01:33:50,028 --> 01:33:52,199
Miss Ward?

1205
01:33:55,084 --> 01:33:59,557
Mr. Grazier, Mr. Ward has been
thundering on for quite some time now.

1206
01:33:59,628 --> 01:34:04,898
It occurs to me that, with all his fire and
brimstone, he might have confused the issue.

1207
01:34:05,004 --> 01:34:08,550
I'd like to ask you a simple question,
straight out.

1208
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:13,224
Have you any knowledge of a report
calling any version of the Meridian unsafe?

1209
01:34:16,268 --> 01:34:18,689
No.

1210
01:34:20,427 --> 01:34:24,868
Have you ever seen one,
read one or heard of one?

1211
01:34:26,668 --> 01:34:28,904
No.

1212
01:34:35,724 --> 01:34:37,699
No further questions.

1213
01:34:39,308 --> 01:34:42,853
Members of the jury,
what you've seen here is a little unusual.

1214
01:34:42,955 --> 01:34:49,513
Mr. Grazier's presence on the stand should not
influence you to find for or against his client.

1215
01:34:49,579 --> 01:34:50,528
You may step down.

1216
01:34:53,996 --> 01:34:57,956
Your Honor,
plaintiff calls Anthony Patricola.

1217
01:34:58,027 --> 01:35:01,159
- Who the hell is Anthony Patricola?
- I've never heard of him.

1218
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:04,042
His name was there.
You must have missed it.

1219
01:35:04,108 --> 01:35:08,101
I'm sure I gave it to you,
along with a bunch of other papers.

1220
01:35:08,204 --> 01:35:11,979
Looked like the goddamn
Library of Congress.

1221
01:35:15,307 --> 01:35:18,984
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1222
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:22,149
- I do.
- Be seated and state your name.

1223
01:35:24,043 --> 01:35:26,596
Anthony Patricola.

1224
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:28,936
What do you do for a living, Mr. Patricola?

1225
01:35:29,035 --> 01:35:34,698
I am the chief accountant in the risk
management division of Argo Motors.

1226
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:37,894
Are you what is affectionately
called a "bean counter"?

1227
01:35:37,995 --> 01:35:40,297
Yes, sir.

1228
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:44,192
- Are you the head bean counter?
- Yes, sir.

1229
01:35:44,267 --> 01:35:47,431
- So you see a lot of reports in your job?
- Yes.

1230
01:35:47,499 --> 01:35:52,234
- You take these reports and make...
- Bitch.

1231
01:35:52,299 --> 01:35:54,634
You gave him Patricola.

1232
01:35:57,707 --> 01:36:01,220
I'm sorry, Michael.
I guess it's in the genes.

1233
01:36:01,323 --> 01:36:03,778
...a defective part.

1234
01:36:03,884 --> 01:36:07,145
You make a decision whether
to replace that part in a recall

1235
01:36:07,243 --> 01:36:10,472
or suffer the consequences of a lawsuit,
whichever's cheaper.

1236
01:36:10,539 --> 01:36:12,394
Is that correct?

1237
01:36:12,459 --> 01:36:16,420
I don't make the decisions,
I just analyze the reports.

1238
01:36:16,524 --> 01:36:19,012
Reports, yes.
Let's talk about them.

1239
01:36:19,115 --> 01:36:23,654
Do you recall one questioning the safety
of the 1985 Meridian model?

1240
01:36:26,379 --> 01:36:27,939
Yes.

1241
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,953
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Quinn?

1242
01:36:35,019 --> 01:36:38,848
May we approach?
Defense requests a conference in chambers.

1243
01:36:38,956 --> 01:36:41,225
- And, Your Honor...
- Yes?

1244
01:36:41,324 --> 01:36:43,298
Lead counsel only.

1245
01:36:45,516 --> 01:36:48,101
All right, Fred. What's on your mind?

1246
01:36:48,204 --> 01:36:51,073
Your Honor, there's been
an appalling conspiracy.

1247
01:36:51,147 --> 01:36:54,627
One that has compromised our case.
I demand a mistrial.

1248
01:36:54,699 --> 01:36:57,863
- Unbelievable.
- Let's hear it.

1249
01:36:57,963 --> 01:37:02,218
Miss Ward's turned over
privileged information to her father.

1250
01:37:02,315 --> 01:37:07,552
And he's accepted it, in flagrant violation
of every principle of legal ethics I know.

1251
01:37:07,627 --> 01:37:12,068
- Which one would that be, Fred?
- Enough, Jed. This isn't a joke.

1252
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:17,409
The joke is you're being asked
to consider legal ethics argument

1253
01:37:17,515 --> 01:37:19,490
from the boss of Michael Grazier.

1254
01:37:19,595 --> 01:37:24,680
Michael Grazier no longer works
for Quinn Califan. He's a closed issue.

1255
01:37:24,747 --> 01:37:28,130
- Ballast off a sinking ship.
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

1256
01:37:28,235 --> 01:37:32,229
- I'll have the state bar discipline you.
- Do it! Please, do it.

1257
01:37:32,299 --> 01:37:34,983
Your daughter will be thrown
out of the profession.

1258
01:37:35,084 --> 01:37:39,939
Miss Ward discovered that Michael Grazier
had destroyed Dr. Pavel's report.

1259
01:37:40,044 --> 01:37:45,030
I'm entitled to that evidence.
That proved my case.

1260
01:37:45,099 --> 01:37:48,677
She couldn't give it to me so she told me
about a corroborating witness.

1261
01:37:48,747 --> 01:37:51,780
That's not only ethical, legal,
but imperative.

1262
01:37:51,883 --> 01:37:55,811
By the way, you so much as look
in my daughter's direction,

1263
01:37:55,915 --> 01:37:59,231
they won't be able to identity you
with dental records.

1264
01:38:01,803 --> 01:38:05,219
Fred, if what he says is true,

1265
01:38:05,323 --> 01:38:11,488
your firm has violated
at least three sections of the state bar act.

1266
01:38:11,595 --> 01:38:15,337
- Listen, in the best interests of your client...
- But, Your Honor...

1267
01:38:15,435 --> 01:38:18,185
...and what remains of your reputation,

1268
01:38:18,284 --> 01:38:23,586
I think you ought to end this thing
as quickly and as quietly as possible.

1269
01:38:24,459 --> 01:38:26,466
OK.

1270
01:38:29,483 --> 01:38:33,640
I'm going to have to
clear this with Argo but...

1271
01:38:36,555 --> 01:38:38,944
what's it going to take?

1272
01:38:39,019 --> 01:38:42,761
Your Honor, I was looking
forward to trying this.

1273
01:38:42,827 --> 01:38:47,170
- 30 million.
- I think I've got a good chance of winning.

1274
01:38:48,044 --> 01:38:53,346
Come on, Jed. Some of your clients
weren't even hurt that bad.

1275
01:39:00,715 --> 01:39:03,333
50 million dollars.

1276
01:39:07,947 --> 01:39:10,500
Dammit, Jed! What's it going to take?

1277
01:39:10,603 --> 01:39:12,578
Bottom line, Fred?

1278
01:39:17,259 --> 01:39:19,463
You can't count that high.

1279
01:39:24,587 --> 01:39:27,304
- Alexander Pavel.
- Here's to Mr. Minh's fishing fleet.

1280
01:39:27,467 --> 01:39:30,020
Here's to 100 million dollars.

1281
01:39:30,123 --> 01:39:33,506
PT Barnum. Father of us all.

1282
01:39:33,579 --> 01:39:35,586
Cheers!

1283
01:39:43,147 --> 01:39:45,154
- Jed.
- Maggie.

1284
01:39:49,099 --> 01:39:51,554
- Hi.
- So how'd it go?

1285
01:39:51,627 --> 01:39:54,344
- It worked.
- Good. Good, good.

1286
01:39:54,444 --> 01:39:57,313
- Hi, darling.
- Thank you, Maggie.

1287
01:39:58,603 --> 01:40:02,051
Counselor.
I can still call you that, right?

1288
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:03,946
Yeah.

1289
01:40:06,475 --> 01:40:08,744
You did good, Maggie.

1290
01:40:12,587 --> 01:40:16,580
- What?
- It's just you two, together.

1291
01:40:19,148 --> 01:40:24,450
I was beginning to think parenthood wasn't
such a good idea, but you give me hope.

1292
01:40:31,755 --> 01:40:33,730
Dad,

1293
01:40:35,755 --> 01:40:36,868
thank you.

1294
01:40:36,939 --> 01:40:40,867
- Hey, you did it.
- No. Thank you.

1295
01:40:47,563 --> 01:40:50,345
You know, I never told you but...

1296
01:40:51,787 --> 01:40:56,708
when your mom told me that she was
pregnant and we were having you,

1297
01:40:56,779 --> 01:40:59,146
I went out and got roaringly drunk.

1298
01:40:59,243 --> 01:41:02,756
I prayed fervently
there had been a mistake at the lab.

1299
01:41:06,635 --> 01:41:10,214
Even in those days, you didn't listen to me.

1300
01:41:11,883 --> 01:41:18,212
Then you were in my arms and I looked
down at those little crossed eyes,

1301
01:41:18,315 --> 01:41:22,920
and I knew you were gonna break my heart.

1302
01:41:25,707 --> 01:41:27,714
And you did.

1303
01:41:30,444 --> 01:41:34,699
But you gave me back your mom
in your hands and your face...

1304
01:41:35,403 --> 01:41:37,377
- Dad...
- Yeah?

1305
01:41:38,315 --> 01:41:40,039
I love you too.

1306
01:41:46,955 --> 01:41:48,930
I promised Mom once...

1307
01:41:51,243 --> 01:41:53,218
that we would dance.

1308
01:44:17,803 --> 01:44:20,999
