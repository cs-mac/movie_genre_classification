00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,468
I'm asking you who Rosemary is,
why aren't you answering me?

4
00:00:12,754 --> 00:00:14,826
Who's Rosemary?

5
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:16,752
It's my first time hearing such a name.

6
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:19,844
You saw President Hwang's wife?

7
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,806
You're still making excuses
saying you don't know?

8
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:28,366
Everyone knows about your past,
only we don't know.

9
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:33,580
Every night you're in men's arms
pouring wine and joking.

10
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:38,391
You're hiding such a dirty past and
you want to marry Hyun Woo.

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,876
This shameless, scary

12
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:44,576
Husband, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:48,576
What's Rosemary?
Who's pouring wine?

14
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,524
So it's like this...

15
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,672
you're a drinker and you act
like a classy American

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,273
lying to my kind brother
and marrying him?

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,789
This is a great rotten story.

18
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,662
<i>So it's really like this?</i>

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,483
So sister-in-law is such a scary person?

20
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:04,864
<i>There's no need to say anything more...</i>

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,494
I won't accept her as my daughter in law.

22
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:10,660
Money earned by pouring wine

23
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:14,540
and given to us to buy furniture.

24
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:19,712
Hurry up and burn these furniture.
Instantly!

25
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,201
Episode 13

26
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,233
Husband, husband, calm down,

27
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:39,697
husband, husband Please don't get angry,
I'll clean it. calm down.

28
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:41,526
Is this a situation to calm down?

29
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,846
We've been using blankets bought
with dirty money to sleep

30
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:48,854
Wearing suits, this is so unlucky,
how can I take it?

31
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:54,759
Since you already know,
I don't need to argue

32
00:01:54,987 --> 00:02:00,878
I'm a poor orphan, I left home in
high school to a nightclub.

33
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:04,102
Because living needs money...

34
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:08,177
With a 40 degree fever I still go to
the nightclub dancing and pouring wine.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,755
Not everyone without parents
live like you!

36
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,049
You think money is dirty?

37
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:18,181
To make the treasury full, father fired
workers and lied to agencies

38
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,733
Getting these money is a clean thing?

39
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,931
The one stealing money is father, not me.

40
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:29,669
<i>Impolite...</i>

41
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:34,146
being thief and trying
to blame someone else.

42
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:40,026
A tricked marriage,
and begging strongly isn't enough...

43
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:42,894
who do you dare teach a lesson to?

44
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,571
Ah Ran, what kind of attitude
do you have in front of a elder

45
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,327
Hurry up and get out, hurry.

46
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:52,925
Father, you've mistaken...

47
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,088
You will definitely apologize for the smack.

48
00:02:58,517 --> 00:03:02,177
Because my furniture seems
embarrassing today...

49
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,839
Tomorrow, you will thank
me for the furniture

50
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:10,291
For now, good night.

51
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:14,298
This... this...

52
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:34,170
The celebrity and the president
isn't your dad's friend..

53
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,393
they're the nightclub customers right?

54
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,898
Even my brother doesn't know..

55
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:44,714
If my brother helped sister-in-law lie,
then it's a lie.

56
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:49,375
I met Hyun Woo when I was in the nightclub

57
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:52,579
don't dirty his pure love.

58
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,472
I'm tired, please go out

59
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,490
Okay, you better watch out...

60
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:05,520
let's see when you'll still be so strong.
I'll watch carefully.

61
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:12,571
This is even better...

62
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:17,838
I don't need to act nice anymore.

63
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:23,514
From now on, it will officially start.

64
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:29,483
Even if you people unite holding a knife,
I won't be scared at all.

65
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:36,924
It's here, it's time to let everyone
slowly know my existence.

66
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:41,320
Slowly show everyone
that I'm still alive.

67
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,046
Then, if Joo Ah Ran finds out first,
what do we do?

68
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:51,726
Joo Ah Ran will think that it's
Nam Joo Seung's plan of threatening.

69
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:56,848
As a result, Joo Ah Ran and Nam Joo Seung's
war will be even more thrilling.

70
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,625
The war will start now.

71
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,216
<i>Hyun Woo hyung is definitely still alive</i>

72
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,881
<i>Hiding behind Ahn Jae Sung's
face tricking me</i>

73
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:21,672
<i>Need to find evidence. If I don't attack first,
then I'll get controlled</i>

74
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:25,702
<i>Shin Hyun Woo, 180cm tall
Blood type A</i>

75
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,439
No facial surgery, appendix surgery...

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,540
allergic to peanut, seasonal skin infection.

77
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,536
There's no good news to read.

78
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:52,093
<i>What's this?</i>

79
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:57,682
Star Electronics and Soul Furniture
sign investment, big business is born.

80
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:03,673
What is this? I'm the leader
and I don't know about investing.

81
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:11,044
Dad, isn't this sister-in-law
and President Hwang?

82
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:15,902
It is, what's sister-in-law planning now?

83
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:20,082
If it's not a trick, what would
a big business invest in?

84
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:24,115
This is scary, hurry up and
bring that thing down!

85
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,735
Yesterday, Star Electronics
and President Hwang...

86
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:31,835
decided to give our Soul a major investment.

87
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:36,817
Now it's the nation's biggest furniture business.
How do you feel?

88
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,546
Who told you to worry about this?
I won't give you the company's business.

89
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:45,869
You know Soul's condition
and you're still saying this?

90
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,725
SM Furniture emerged online
and Soul's sale decreased.

91
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,483
There's no help for it.

92
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,686
If this continues on, I won't guarantee
that we won't go bankrupt.

93
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:59,632
Bankrupt? Who was the one that
helped the company get to this place?

94
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:04,476
Ever since you got control, Soul started
to get unstable, everyone knows.

95
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,163
Hello? I'm Shin Woo Sub.

96
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:14,493
Yes, President Park.
Investment?

97
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,694
<i>It's not worth celebrating,
but thank you.</i>

98
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:32,298
<i>Let me go.</i>

99
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:39,651
Not afraid of death, you dare trick me?

100
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,420
President made the decision..

101
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:47,049
If President appoint the nightclub couple
stole the business secret.

102
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,208
The impact on the community would be big.
Those few cents were that disappointing?

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,276
Listen carefully...

104
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,781
the water has already spilled.
For the sake of the company's image, I won't correspond

105
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:02,780
But our company's money,
even $10 won't go out.

106
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:08,487
I don't know about the company's investment,
I don't have anything to say.

107
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,151
Come!

108
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,686
<i>I can't, no</i>

109
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,147
Don't think this world so easily...

110
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:30,093
Considering the past,
this time I'll let you off.

111
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:37,904
What is this?

112
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:41,063
Joo Seung Oppa delivered it.

113
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:44,423
Joo Seung Hyung? Let me see.

114
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,650
NNJ? This is...

115
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:58,868
Right, it's the couple ring from in the car
the day of Hyun Woo's incident

116
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,526
You held onto the ring last time right?
Hurry and bring it.

117
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,115
Okay

118
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,195
This one

119
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:20,563
Yes, the same initials.
the same heart shaped ring.

120
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:21,726
The ring's owner is...

121
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,805
It's Hyun Woo Oppa and sister-in-law.

122
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:28,874
NNJ, is Nam Joo Seung and
Joo Ah Ran's initials.

123
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:32,834
I'm like a fool, how can I find out now?

124
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,815
But, if this ring was young
in Hyung's car...

125
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:40,182
then it's evidence that
Hyung knew their relationship.

126
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:46,285
Then, that day in the car,
would it be sister-in-law?

127
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:51,210
So, this couple ring is Joo Ah Ran
and Dr. Nam's, right?

128
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,297
It's definitely right.

129
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:57,841
I'm sure they've seen each other
before Hyung's incident

130
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,815
If Hyung seen this couple ring,..

131
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,778
that day, he definitely had
an argument with sister-in-law.

132
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,142
This is how everything happened.

133
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,821
How can there be such a thing?

134
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,745
Maybe it's not true, not true.

135
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:11,526
Sister-in-law is Sister-in-law,
but it's Joo Seung that I can't forgive.

136
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,864
I can't forgive Joo Seung Hyung

137
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:16,731
Hyung Woo Hyung loves him like a brother.

138
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,910
How can he backstab him?

139
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:22,932
I think Secretary Nam isn't
like that either.

140
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:26,977
If Uncle Nam finds out,
he'll be so angry.

141
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:31,387
He has always been following our dad
like a shadow, being awful to our family.

142
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:37,475
Before this is clear, keep this
as a secret to your Dad. Please.

143
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:42,554
Did you see today's newspaper?

144
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:47,408
Star Electronics will invest into
Soul Furniture

145
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:54,083
So, can you help me one last time?

146
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:59,881
Increasing the factory so suddenly
needs a lot of money

147
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:04,527
After Star Electronics' money comes,
I'll return it immediately.

148
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,615
I'm so sorry,

149
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:12,078
I bought a few buildings in Sony
and used up all my money

150
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,313
Anyhow, Leader Zhu, I'm so sorry.

151
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:18,632
Receiving such a big investment
from a big company

152
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:23,629
Compared to my brother's news,
it's has much more ability

153
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:26,451
Brother?

154
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,460
I guess my little brother knows
a bit about you.

155
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:36,387
I heard from my brother, that's why
I invested such a big amount.

156
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:41,223
For not being able to help,
I'm sorry, See you later.

157
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,025
What do I do?

158
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:56,782
Star Electronics’ investment is gone.

159
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:59,140
How can I get money?

160
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:02,006
It might be the end.

161
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:11,020
Right, only one person can help me.

162
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,301
President Joo, what happened?

163
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,213
I just missed you, so I came.

164
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:52,682
I didn't think I'd be so lucky
to hear to sing

165
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:57,414
The atmosphere is so unique,
what song is it?

166
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:00,292
A story of a man who feel
in love with a prostitute.

167
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:02,684
I really like this song.

168
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,658
Once I sing this song, I'll want to
start dating without myself knowing

169
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:11,891
Feel in love with a prostitute

170
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:17,084
President An can have this kind of love?

171
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:23,675
Of course. If the woman won't hide
her past and her occupation...

172
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:29,388
love cannot start from lies.

173
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,151
What's wrong with the company?
You don't look so good.

174
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:48,624
A woman doing business is so difficult.

175
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:54,990
There's no one with discuss with,
no one with help me.

176
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,899
What ring is this?

177
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,290
I wear it with my girlfriend

178
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:09,741
I personally don't like these things

179
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:12,600
But my girlfriend begged me,
so I wore it.

180
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:17,889
Girlfriend? You're not talking about
Yoon Jae Hee are you?

181
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:23,859
This. My girlfriend probably not
willing so I can't tell.

182
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:27,567
If you're leaving later,
I'm going to leave now

183
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,995
Why do you want to see me?

184
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:53,185
President An gave you this ring, right?

185
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:55,753
I think I told you last time.

186
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:58,735
Please don't interfere with
my personal life.

187
00:16:58,907 --> 00:17:00,386
If you called me because of this.

188
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,350
I'll go in first.

189
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,035
You arrogant woman.

190
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,323
Acting like you don't know in front of me.

191
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:09,973
Behind me you're hooking up with men.

192
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:12,015
You like President Ahn's wealth?

193
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,853
So you're dazzling in front of him?

194
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:16,690
However innocent you act,

195
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,944
you think President An doesn't
know what you're up to?

196
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:23,532
Since President An already knows,
I don't need to be worried

197
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:26,109
If you trust President An,
then you can relax

198
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,559
President An has good insight.

199
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,406
You think he'll randomly like any woman?

200
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:45,663
Miss, if you're like this,
does the hospital head know?

201
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:47,961
What?

202
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:52,216
Hurry up and take off that ring.

203
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:55,347
I can't share with you a man that I like.

204
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:59,871
Being jealous of a woman like you
hurts my pride

205
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:02,689
Now that I look, Miss is a very weird person

206
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:06,197
Lying down Shin Hyun Woo patient,
worrying about the head of the hospital

207
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:09,376
Now you're liking Leader An
behind the hospital head?

208
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:11,712
Why aren't you focused on one man?

209
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:13,968
You shouldn't be like this
for a dead person

210
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:21,084
Don't worry about my business

211
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:28,089
If mention Shin Hyun Woo to me again,
I won't let you go.

212
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:37,045
Okay, from now on I'll only mention
Shin Hyun Woo in "Pyong Chang Dong"

213
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:45,078
I'll end the reasoning with you today.

214
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,440
You dare look down on me.

215
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:02,430
What? Commercial?

216
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:08,518
Yes, we received a notice rushing us.

217
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,867
What's going on? He told us awhile ago he
was handling the mortgage.

218
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,199
It's been so long and it's
still not resolved

219
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,590
Do you use your mouth to do business?

220
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:22,490
Because of Star Electronics' investment,

221
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:25,176
not needing to quickly return
all the money is a lucky thing.

222
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,941
If we're supervised by this,
then there's a problem.

223
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:33,887
I want to kick out the rules,
because only Star Electronics can endure it.

224
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,723
Why's there a phone call?

225
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:43,262
It's not even time for our room
to be cleaned.

226
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,536
Hello?

227
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,430
I'm Kim Mi Yoo, who are you?

228
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:55,101
You found who took Jing Ran?

229
00:19:55,273 --> 00:20:00,445
We looked through the documents and
found contact to the person who took Jing Ran.

230
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:05,852
That's what I said. If you look carefully,
there's definitely a record.

231
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:08,816
Give me a pencil, pencil, yes.

232
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:14,978
I'll ask you next time, I'll hang up

233
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,759
Did you hear?

234
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,692
They found our Jing Ran

235
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:25,278
Wait. When we talk like this and switched
telephone numbers, it's too wrong.

236
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:27,409
Let's call first.

237
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,963
<i>We can really earn money</i>

238
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,930
Hello?

239
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:45,020
25 years ago in the Pyul Gang orphanage,

240
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:47,321
you adopted a little girl?

241
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:50,220
Can I ask, who are you?

242
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:56,428
I'm the girl's aunt, I found someone
to get information...

243
00:20:56,526 --> 00:21:00,049
They said you randomly took my niece.

244
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:05,451
How can you take away a baby
you're temporarily taking care of?

245
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:07,324
Where is my niece now?

246
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:12,137
What are you calling? It seems like
you have the wrong number.

247
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:18,115
Stop talking trash,
just tell me where my niece is!?

248
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:24,599
This person, you think I can't find
your house with this phone number?

249
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:26,624
Sorry...

250
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:33,693
Please give me some time
because I didn't raise the child.

251
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:36,147
The condition now is unclear.

252
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:38,972
Give it to me.

253
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,653
Hello...

254
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:50,380
I'm a person who can't live long.

255
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:55,291
The doctor said surviving until
tomorrow is difficult...

256
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:59,135
Before I die, can't I see me niece?

257
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,527
She's always shining in front of me

258
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:14,490
Hello, Hospital Head,
I'm Shin Hyun Woo's mom.

259
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:17,533
I have an urgent situation
to discuss with you.

260
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:23,216
The child I adopted her uncle and aunt
are looking for her.

261
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:26,535
So it's like this? I heard she had a sister,

262
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,928
I didn't know she had an uncle.

263
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:31,528
If you promised, of course you have to go.

264
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,850
After I contact her, I'll let her go.

265
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:39,488
What? My uncle is looking for me?

266
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:42,351
Of course I have to see him.

267
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:46,675
If I see my uncle, I get might
some news about my sister

268
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,759
Where is it, Hospital head?

269
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:55,516
You don't have any meetings tonight?

270
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:57,529
I know a place with delicious pasta.

271
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,500
Want to try it together?

272
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:02,649
Okay, let's go with my car together.

273
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:06,442
Wait in the car,
I'm going to make a call inside.

274
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,220
Okay.

275
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,132
Please say it.

276
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:35,664
Hurry and go to Sam Sang Dong's
entrance, it's urgent.

277
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:39,358
I have an important meeting
right now, I can't go.

278
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:41,296
You have to come out

279
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,122
It's Nurse Yoon's lover.

280
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:46,962
If you don't come out, you'll regret it.

281
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:53,003
It's helpful to fix Nurse Yoon's feelings.
I'll wait for you.

282
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:54,853
Excuse me.

283
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,283
What's the matter.

284
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:05,187
Did something happen to uncle?

285
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:21,032
An Jae Seung, it's your turn
to show your real heart.

286
00:24:21,374 --> 00:24:24,942
Today I'll let you end.

287
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:28,509
Putting two woman on top of a scale.

288
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:55,967
What happened, are you okay?

289
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,232
I'm fine.

290
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:04,065
What? Let me go, President An, save me

291
00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:06,000
What are you doing to a woman.

292
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:07,588
Who sent you here?

293
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,624
Go away. I only listen to people
who give me money.

294
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,108
If you don't want to die, leave

295
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,319
You little

296
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,659
President An, save me.

297
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:23,944
It's the people sent by Father.
President An

298
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:27,139
President An!

299
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:32,537
Stop the car. Before I call the police,
stop the car.

300
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:53,146
Jae Hee, why are you here?

301
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:57,008
Why is it like this? What would I do
if something happened?

302
00:25:57,194 --> 00:26:00,725
There's no need to help Joo Ah Ran and die.

303
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:04,648
Sorry, there's no time to talk.
I'll call you.

304
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:07,993
Ahjussi, ahjussi

305
00:26:18,602 --> 00:26:22,322
Please give me a little time. A little.

306
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:32,425
Ahjussi, don't go.

307
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,358
It's dangerous

308
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:40,540
What's Joo Ah Ran for this?

309
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:49,006
He's following right?

310
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,600
Yes.

311
00:26:53,384 --> 00:26:58,729
Yoon Jae Hee, now you're awake?

312
00:26:59,258 --> 00:27:05,786
Even if you're stupider you'll know
where An Jae Seung's heart is

313
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:39,184
That little Jin Ran, how come
I can't see her anywhere

314
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:42,014
We've waited for an hour already..

315
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:50,605
Could it be, that the person who adopted
Jing Ran is in the middle playing tricks?

316
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,270
She also wants some profit.

317
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,721
It can't be that she knows we want the
furniture store and want to split it in half can it?

318
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,615
Who give?

319
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,426
Looks like we need to scare her.

320
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:08,040
Then she'll bring Jing Ran out.

321
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,321
Wait

322
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,116
Hello? I'm the person who
just called, Jing Ran's Aunt

323
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:26,060
What's the reason behind
why we still can't see Jing Ran?

324
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:31,327
<i>You want to get sued with kidnap?</i>

325
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,605
What's an adult doing bringing
a child to business

326
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,430
Before we go to your house and corrupt,
hurry up and bring Jing Ran out.

327
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:42,951
Do you understand?

328
00:28:55,127 --> 00:29:00,231
What are you doing?
Why'd you unplug the telephone line?

329
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:04,595
You came? There's always weird
telephone calls coming, so

330
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:07,309
Weird phone calls?
What's that?

331
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:10,574
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

332
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:14,816
Switch the telephone number
tomorrow and it'll be fine.

333
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:23,657
We used the telephone for almost 30 years,
why do we have to change?

334
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:30,348
What is it? Weird telephone
calls calling home.

335
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,717
Excuse me.
Did a 50 year old man come by?

336
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:46,556
Oh, that one.
He left about an hour ago.

337
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:11,801
<i>An Jae Seung, My luck is worn by you.</i>

338
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:17,926
<i>The danger behind getting
you isn't anything.</i>

339
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:45,657
President An, are you okay?
You're really hurt.

340
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,821
Father sent some men to take Soul
away from me. I'm scared.

341
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:53,711
But you shouldn't have jumped out of the car

342
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:55,963
So your own life is nothing?

343
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,346
I'm not afraid of death..

344
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:01,107
when I knew you were chasing behind.

345
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:04,074
All my fear faded away.

346
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:07,462
So risking my life jumping out.

347
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:10,900
If I still alive...

348
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:16,909
the first thing I'd do is confess to you.

349
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:24,040
I.. like you.

350
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,683
Until now, I thought a lot of men liked me..

351
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:35,198
But...

352
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:40,777
the one man I tried to get,
you were the first.

353
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:58,292
<i>An Jae Seung, you're finally trapped by me</i>

354
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:04,228
<i>You were so worried about me,
now you're like a warm sheep</i>

355
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:11,518
<i>Joo Ah Ran, you only have this move?</i>

356
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:15,485
<i>You think this plan would work?</i>

357
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:22,564
<i>Trick me all you can.
But it'll be your end.</i>

358
00:32:55,555 --> 00:33:00,238
Unni, how are you?

359
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:06,830
Today, uncle contacted me.
Although we didn't see each other...

360
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:11,269
the fact that I have a family
makes me happy.

361
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:16,829
Does uncle know Unni's news?

362
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:21,669
Unni, you're looking for me too right?

363
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:24,927
I miss you...

364
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:29,277
I miss you, Unni.

365
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:34,275
Even if the company closes,
we still need to let sister-in-law out.

366
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:37,355
Why don't we let go of
Star Electronics investment?

367
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:42,113
That can't do.
This isn't a childish act

368
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,639
This involved thousands of lives.
How can we just close down?

369
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:48,791
Let's accept the investment.
Saving the company is important.

370
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,710
I need to look at the investment book.
Let your sister-in-law come back

371
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:59,665
She shut her phone.
She's definitely with Joo Seung Oppa

372
00:33:59,762 --> 00:34:05,565
That scary thing.
So unlucky.

373
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,547
Sorry for coming so late.
I have something to say.

374
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:14,958
I'll go in for a bit.

375
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,675
My house is messy, sit here first.

376
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:32,809
It's okay. Our daughter-in-law
didn't come here?

377
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:37,882
No. Is it to make sure?

378
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,426
Last warning, Don't see Ah Ran

379
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,873
Why?

380
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:47,828
Because she's Shin Woo's ex-lover.

381
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:52,844
Whatever is unhappy, I will block

382
00:34:53,368 --> 00:34:58,897
Really? So full of love towards your son.

383
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:02,820
Block it. I have confident in taking Ah Ran

384
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,094
I'm curious in who will win

385
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:10,781
What? You're doing tricks
to a leader's wife?

386
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,704
Taking away Hyun Woo's wife.
Will Doctor Nam be happy?

387
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,513
Of course...

388
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:20,265
I'll be happy.
Miss's unhappiness is my happiness

389
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,417
What are you saying?
How can you say that?

390
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:29,286
I thought we could communicate.
Looks like I was wrong.

391
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:35,251
<i>A child abandoned by his mom.
How good can she get?</i>

392
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:40,083
<i>Even the mother who gave birth
to him won't acknowledge him</i>

393
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:44,217
<i>There isn't much hope, right?</i>

394
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:55,226
In the future it'll be even worse.
Miss, what do you think?

395
00:35:55,973 --> 00:36:01,426
Look for President Shin and tell him
an interesting story he doesn't know

396
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:08,201
I don't want to ruin that family.
So I've been holding it in.

397
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:11,793
I suddenly feel really angry.

398
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:13,907
What are you talking about?

399
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,295
Miss doesn't know.

400
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:19,780
Only a story only my dead father
and I would know

401
00:36:19,923 --> 00:36:25,024
Miss doesn't not know, she forgot.
Did I say something wrong?

402
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:30,507
I don't understand what
Doctor Nam is saying.

403
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:34,569
I have to go back.

404
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,843
<i>It can't be he knows everything</i>

405
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:55,635
<i>It can't be. Impossible.</i>

406
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:07,856
Did I tell President Ahn about this?

407
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:11,044
Actually...

408
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:16,357
not long ago a man
who liked me passed away.

409
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,717
The man's sister wanted to take revenge
on me and opened SM Furniture.

410
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,248
What?

411
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,802
That woman wants me and Soul Furniture dead

412
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:36,246
Help me, please.

413
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:40,290
I definitely cannot give up on Soul

414
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:46,890
Why so you miss Soul so much?
Is it your dead husband's company?

415
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:54,256
Soul has my lonely dead family's soul in it.

416
00:37:56,196 --> 00:38:01,893
Giving up on Soul would be like
giving up on my life.

417
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,222
Then how can I help you

418
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:10,839
You continue to take control of Soul

419
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,852
You have the ability and the wealth

420
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:21,018
In return,
I'll be yours forever.

421
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:27,802
You seem to know well
how to seduce a man.

422
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:31,830
Okay, I'll think about it...

423
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:37,989
But, what's the real reason behind
President Shin pushing away daughter-in-law?

424
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:43,122
In the end, it was still because of me...

425
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:45,587
they're afraid that I'll take away Soul.

426
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:49,162
They still didn't report their son's death.

427
00:38:50,317 --> 00:38:52,760
Lost his parents since birth..

428
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:58,475
None of my in-laws can help me,
and I can't fight my father as is.

429
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,127
I didn't know President Joo has
this kind of pain.

430
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:18,614
Can I sleep here tonight?

431
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:22,904
I don't have anywhere to go.

432
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:33,283
If Leader An won't take me.
I'll only die.

433
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:38,831
I can't let such a pretty person
walk around on the street.

434
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:43,675
Just sleep here tonight.

435
00:39:58,407 --> 00:40:04,128
Lending a blanket to a woman,
you're the first. Good Night.

436
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,186
The pain will hurt a lot.

437
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:17,239
Why don't you treat me as a woman

438
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:26,478
I've already been ready to accept you.

439
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,848
A real man will care like a jewel.

440
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,996
Good night, I'll sleep on the sofa.

441
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:21,042
Ahjussi, why do I seem like a fool?

442
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,768
To take revenge on Joo An Ran...

443
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:28,480
you're sleeping with her. This I know.

444
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:33,546
We've already reasoned...

445
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:38,465
But I feel like I'm going crazy.

446
00:41:41,484 --> 00:41:42,691
Really...

447
00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:47,899
There's only this way?

448
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,264
Hello?

449
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,923
<i>Did sister-in-law sleep there?</i>

450
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:27,719
If you want to leave the house,
let her clean first.

451
00:42:27,908 --> 00:42:32,750
Sleeping everywhere like that, it's so dirty
it makes people feel uncomfortable.

452
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:37,055
What? Didn't she come home?

453
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:39,247
<i>You really know how to act.</i>

454
00:42:39,408 --> 00:42:45,074
But I won't get tricked.
This world has no secrets.

455
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:51,220
What you two did to my brother,
will eventually be revealed to everyone.

456
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:01,733
Thank you.

457
00:43:29,978 --> 00:43:31,718
Is it Doctor Nam?

458
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:36,213
Pick up. Hiding won't solve anything.

459
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:41,712
Tell him you were at my house.
Let him understand.

460
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:45,505
It's me..

461
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,097
Listen carefully...

462
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,559
Listen to me first. Last night
I was at Leader Ahn’s house...

463
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:54,801
Listen to me, don't say anything

464
00:43:56,111 --> 00:44:00,674
Leader Shin's prescription you
changed I already know

465
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,841
Only you used an excuse to fire a guard.

466
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:07,886
You can't even think of an excuse

467
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:11,051
The CCTV evidence has been confirmed.

468
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,588
What?

469
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:19,670
There person who used Miss' phone
to send a message was you too.

470
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:22,142
It's been confirmed with the
communication company.

471
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:26,848
What should you do? Bring these
evidence to find Leader Shin..

472
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:28,093
Or...

473
00:44:28,397 --> 00:44:33,508
tell Hyun Woo about how the
mansion got on fire.

474
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:34,809
Tell these to him.

475
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:35,806
Or...

476
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:41,730
Tell him the truth about Ji Jun
being your father.

477
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:49,032
How is it? Like your wish,
if President faints, that isn't bad.

478
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:53,803
No way. What are you talking about?
Where you are you? I'm coming.

479
00:44:53,913 --> 00:44:55,028
No...

480
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,130
There's no need.

481
00:44:58,703 --> 00:45:00,610
I'm going to Pyong Chang Dong.

482
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:09,862
President An, I'll get off here.

483
00:45:09,913 --> 00:45:12,256
I have something urgent.

484
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,423
Joo Seung.

485
00:46:02,591 --> 00:46:04,491
Joo Seung.

486
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:39,517
This is Joo Seung's dad.
Why's he with mom?

487
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,779
<i>My dad and mom who abandoned me</i>

488
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:52,430
How can this be?

489
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:59,584
Then mom is Joo Seung's mom

490
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:04,189
<i>What do you know about my parents?</i>

491
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:06,119
<i>If you're going to play tricks
on dead people, leave.</i>

492
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:08,656
<i>I'm here to help you</i>

493
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:11,126
<i>Who killed your parents...</i>

494
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,627
<i>only I know in this world.</i>

495
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:19,291
<i>It's shattered. Not one is left.</i>

496
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:22,492
<i>All is shattered and dead.</i>

497
00:47:22,745 --> 00:47:26,048
<i>Your wish is my wish.</i>

498
00:47:31,745 --> 00:47:36,795
Nam Joo Seung, so it's like this.

499
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,801
You're using me to take revenge
on the mother...

500
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:44,191
who abandoned you.

501
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:50,297
You didn't help me because you loved me

502
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:52,749
You're using my parent's death...

503
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:56,269
to break my family?

504
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:04,977
I still didn't know it was like this?

505
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:13,577
Hyung, why'd you come?

506
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:18,884
Open the door. It has something to do
with the comment with President.

507
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:21,285
Just a little while.

508
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:32,278
I'm busy now. Call you later.

509
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:38,425
Joo Seung. I was wrong.
i don't know what to do.

510
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:42,839
I won't see President An anymore.
I promise.

511
00:48:43,073 --> 00:48:46,621
So please forgive me.
We'll start over

512
00:48:46,761 --> 00:48:48,849
Stop lying.

513
00:48:49,433 --> 00:48:53,855
I can never trust woman like you anymore.

514
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:59,406
You tell the truth. then I go to jail.
What do you get from it?

515
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:02,873
Then you'll lose everything

516
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:07,824
Something that's not good for us both,
why do you do it?

517
00:49:08,364 --> 00:49:10,709
Let's go on a trip today.

518
00:49:10,922 --> 00:49:16,707
Do you still remember the seaside
apartment we were in together?

519
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:20,436
I'll arrange my company things,
then I'll go...

520
00:49:20,616 --> 00:49:24,043
I trust that you'll be coming.

521
00:49:54,185 --> 00:49:56,857
Nam Joo Seung...

522
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:01,796
The crime of you lying to me
this whole time.

523
00:50:02,938 --> 00:50:06,261
I'll return it to you today.

524
00:50:12,937 --> 00:50:14,527
President An

525
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:19,262
If you're not busy today,
take a walk with me today?

526
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:25,690
To thank you for yesterday,
I booked a seaside apartment.

527
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,050
It has a new view, you might
like the vacation villages.

528
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:36,286
Then we're set.
I'll get ready.

529
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:43,991
Mom...

530
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:53,004
What happened yesterday?

531
00:50:53,202 --> 00:50:56,270
No matter what we say,
you're still our daughter-in-law.

532
00:50:56,461 --> 00:51:00,585
But you won't come home at night.
I can't endure it anymore.

533
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:03,439
Sorry.

534
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:10,381
The family seems exhausted looking at me,
so I'm avoiding them.

535
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:17,521
There's no place to go,
so I slept on the company's sofa.

536
00:51:22,786 --> 00:51:26,467
This ring, do you still remember?

537
00:51:26,816 --> 00:51:30,873
We found this ring in Hyun Woo's car
on the day of the incident

538
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:34,317
Of course I remember..

539
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:39,010
It's Hyun Woo
and another woman's ring right?

540
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:43,525
No. This ring isn't Hyun Woo's

541
00:51:46,742 --> 00:51:50,022
Yesterday, Doctor Nam sent
the same ring to our house

542
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:55,432
This ring and you and Doctor Nam's
couple ring right? Right?

543
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:56,501
How can this be?

544
00:51:56,678 --> 00:52:01,293
Hyun Woo already knows about you
cheating on Doctor Nam right?

545
00:52:01,468 --> 00:52:04,658
So you two argued. So the incident
happened in the rain right?

546
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:07,243
Sitting in Hyun Woo's car is you, Ah Ran.

547
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:11,860
No. Did mom see it that day?

548
00:52:12,154 --> 00:52:14,829
I was clearly at home.

549
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:19,685
Doctor Nam wants to frame me,
so he's planning something

550
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:25,629
Lies. I'm Hyun Woo's mom

551
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:29,612
If you and Doctor Nam has anything
to do with Hyun Woo's death

552
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:32,595
I won't let you go,

553
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:35,613
Even if we search again,

554
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:38,600
We'll still search what happened
that day...

555
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:42,000
You watch.

556
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:46,361
To forget about your son.

557
00:52:47,717 --> 00:52:51,814
You killed the son you acted
you didn't know for 30 years?

558
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,572
What are you talking about?

559
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:02,414
Mom, you watch.

560
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:05,049
For the dead Hyun Woo...

561
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:09,350
what will you do about your living
son who went to jail?

562
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:11,632
That's it.

563
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:15,650
Have a good day.

564
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:25,260
What exactly do you know?

565
00:53:27,189 --> 00:53:30,060
Ah Ran can't be.

566
00:54:06,866 --> 00:54:09,731
Joo Seung, what should I do?
Mom fainted.

567
00:54:10,052 --> 00:54:12,477
She's in the emergency room now.
Her condition isn't too good.

568
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:15,874
Looks like I can't come to the
resort today. Sorry.

569
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:23,814
Ah Ran...

570
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:27,742
Pick up.
Hurry and Pick up!

571
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,093
Just wait...

572
00:54:42,536 --> 00:54:45,995
Wait till I get there.

573
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:52,675
Without my approval,
you have to chance of dying.

574
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,841
Let's look at the sea next time.
Let's go inside.

575
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:25,279
The view inside is also really good.

576
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,520
Then, okay.

577
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:31,616
It's really a good room.

578
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:36,700
The view is perfect,
and the interior is quite magnificent.

579
00:55:37,154 --> 00:55:41,765
I didn't think that because of this trip,
Ah Ran would spend so much effort.

580
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:46,706
Really, from now on
I'll call you Ah Ran. Can I?

581
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:49,018
Of course.

582
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:55,644
From now on,
I'll also call you Jae Chung.

583
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:05,384
<i>Jae Chung, come here.</i>

584
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,668
<i>The sea is so wide.</i>

585
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:18,282
<i>Looking at the never ending ocean...</i>

586
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:22,239
drinking bittersweet wine,
dying is also a happy ending

587
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:34,777
<i>Ocean, woman, flower, wine.</i>

588
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:37,804
It's really a perfect happy ending.

589
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:44,016
The happy ending is still missing something.

590
00:56:44,675 --> 00:56:46,888
What is it?

591
00:57:30,123 --> 00:57:33,744
<i>Ah Ran, wait. I'm still not drunk
from the wine and ocean.</i>

592
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:35,047
<i>Isn't this too fast?</i>

593
00:57:35,146 --> 00:57:40,028
<i>I've been waiting like this. Do you know
how long I've waited for today?</i>

594
00:57:40,242 --> 00:57:45,024
<i>I never thought I'd be so thrilled
and shaking with a man.</i>

595
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:47,973
<i>It's the first time I actually
feel like a woman.</i>

596
00:57:48,095 --> 00:57:49,185
<i>If it's like this...</i>

597
00:57:49,186 --> 00:57:53,755
<i>I want to get ready
to welcome you. Take a shower first.</i>

598
00:57:55,449 --> 00:58:00,158
Joo Ah Ran, until the end
you're still treating me like a fool.

599
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:11,424
Jae Chung, what are you doing?

600
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,492
Joo Seung.

601
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,269
To be with that person...

602
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,166
you said Miss was extremely ill?

603
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,547
When I spent a whole day
arranging this room...

604
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:30,048
you were playing with that person?

605
01:00:31,783 --> 01:00:37,148
I came to start over.
But you betrayed me!

606
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,612
You have the right to talk like that?
The one who betrayed me first was you.

607
01:00:44,749 --> 01:00:45,627
You still won't shut up?

608
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:47,887
Why won't you say it?

609
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:50,415
that my mother-in-law...

610
01:00:52,175 --> 01:00:54,280
is your real mom.

611
01:00:58,173 --> 01:01:02,867
You were mother-in-law’s outside son.
Why'd you keep it to yourself?

612
01:01:03,847 --> 01:01:06,301
You're angry that mom abandoned you...

613
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:08,702
so you want to ruin this family?

614
01:01:10,744 --> 01:01:14,476
So you pulled me into your revenge.

615
01:01:17,944 --> 01:01:23,909
No, Ah Ran, it's not.

616
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:31,615
You don't love me.

617
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:35,093
It's only for your personal revenge...

618
01:01:36,951 --> 01:01:38,770
you used me.

619
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:43,266
Did I say anything wrong?

620
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:49,756
It was like this from the start.
But now it's not.

621
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,951
We really love each other.

622
01:01:56,684 --> 01:01:59,750
Our trust has shattered.

623
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:04,167
I can't trust you...

624
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:07,750
you also can't trust me.

625
01:02:08,843 --> 01:02:11,807
<i>Also, we're not anything.</i>

626
01:02:16,115 --> 01:02:17,951
Don't hold on to my heart...

627
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:22,560
my heart is flowing.

628
01:02:24,932 --> 01:02:28,627
My heart is already not here.

629
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:58,426
Ah Ran!

630
01:02:59,978 --> 01:03:01,493
Ah Ran!

631
01:03:33,803 --> 01:03:36,787
It can't end like this.

632
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:39,829
If I didn't love you...

633
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:44,282
when Shin Woo died, revenge
would have already ended.

634
01:03:44,664 --> 01:03:47,775
I stayed because of you.

635
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:53,218
Return everything back
to its original space,

636
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,731
first I need to reveal An Jae Seung's mask.

637
01:04:29,321 --> 01:04:33,428
I secretly researched on
SM's Leader Chung's background.

638
01:04:33,774 --> 01:04:38,248
Really? What did you find out?

639
01:04:38,487 --> 01:04:41,298
In America, she's a rich,
big business woman.

640
01:04:41,438 --> 01:04:46,024
Not long ago, because of her husband's death,
she received a lot of fortune.

641
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:52,807
With that much wealth, she just needs
to try then she can swallow up our Soul.

642
01:04:53,255 --> 01:04:54,895
What should we do?

643
01:04:55,310 --> 01:05:00,134
How about I arrange a meeting.
I'll go with you.

644
01:05:00,399 --> 01:05:06,237
Really, could you do that for me? If you want me to
apologize to your brother I will gladly do it.

645
01:05:06,317 --> 01:05:10,788
If the value of designing is less,
I can fill it in.

646
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:16,077
If you want to fill it up,
you need a lot of money.

647
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:18,640
We need to get it no matter what.

648
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:22,839
Right. SM Furniture's President Chang.

649
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:27,954
I heard that compared to Korean's name,
American's name is more well known.

650
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,012
What's America's name?

651
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,704
Julie Chang.

652
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:35,241
What? Julie Chang?

653
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:42,361
No way, Julie Chang is actually
Chang Shang Mo's sister.

654
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:50,865
Then Soul's money is all
in Julie Chang's hands.

655
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:56,377
What can I do?
I'm collapsing.

656
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:59,909
Soul being stolen is a time problem.

657
01:06:01,051 --> 01:06:03,660
At the end I still need to be poor?

658
01:06:31,513 --> 01:06:33,446
Plastic Surgery Department

659
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:49,073
The man who just left,
was that his prescription?

660
01:06:49,228 --> 01:06:51,901
I'm sorry, that's a little difficult

661
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,921
I'm his relative, he seems to be
keeping an illness away from us.

662
01:06:56,165 --> 01:07:00,424
It's for the patient,
please help me out.

663
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:12,132
He's taking so many pain relievers
and antibiotics.

664
01:07:13,538 --> 01:07:14,960
What's the matter?

665
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:20,645
Please confirm the deposit book.

666
01:07:21,654 --> 01:07:22,416
Thank you.

667
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:24,545
Thank you.

668
01:07:30,728 --> 01:07:34,554
I'm sorry, the person who just left,
said that he left his bankbook here.

669
01:07:34,757 --> 01:07:41,648
Oh, I'm sure I gave it back to him. Ah,
you must be talking about Shin Hyun Woo?

670
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:45,352
Shin Hyun Woo?

671
01:07:50,823 --> 01:07:52,077
Shin Hyun Woo!

672
01:07:53,038 --> 01:07:57,503
