1
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:28,265
Everything is over!

2
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:33,709
The mistakes and good things I've
done are appearing before me.

3
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:36,612
Anyway why shouId a rogue
Iike me faII in Iove?

4
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:39,943
Me...in his hands...

5
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:41,612
BIoody Iife!

6
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:44,712
My Iife!

7
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,229
ReaI name is MayaIori Madan.

8
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,169
But nobody knows that name.

9
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:10,305
PoIice or press peopIe recognise
him as Maya master.

10
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,148
He's such a big crook!

11
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:16,980
If he touches,
any Iocker wouId've to give in.

12
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,655
There's no difference of
day or night for him.

13
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:22,348
If he gets a chance,
he'II rob cIean.

14
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,426
JaiI is Iike In-Iaws pIace
for Maya Master.

15
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,097
Guards, prisoners, workers,

16
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,933
which ever Ianguage they may speak
or beIong to which ever region,

17
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,167
he mixes Iike poison in miIk.

18
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:43,670
Maya master went to jaiI
for Iong time.

19
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:50,676
He decided strongIy never to
get caught again by poIice.

20
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:55,015
He pIanned one Iast big heist.

21
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,216
Who is it?

22
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,087
Are you from KurnooI?

23
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:36,426
I'm Maya, MayaIori Madan.

24
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,427
You may remember my name.
- So what?

25
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:44,797
You and Venkat worked together, right?

26
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:48,068
He was with me after that.
In jaiI!

27
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,980
You both pIanned it together.

28
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:57,317
He died in jaiI.
I'm there, join with me.

29
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,150
PIan? There's nothing Iike that.
Don't taIk nonsense.

30
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:05,317
No need to taIk to a crook
Iike you, go away.

31
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:10,296
To heII with you !

32
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:16,269
If seems when Iuck came to him,
he chased it away thinking it as dog.

33
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:21,843
You're retiring in 5 or 6 days.

34
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:27,039
You'II not get saIary,
wiII you roam haIf naked on streets?

35
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,120
Are you doubting my workmanship?

36
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:39,387
I'II caII you after 2 days,
you'II accept.

37
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:54,308
Maya master aIways pIays on
the emotions of other peopIe.

38
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:13,997
Someone is caIIing for you
since morning.

39
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:19,366
BIoody! TeII me.

40
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,538
Master, I think he'II
go away from here.

41
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,341
If he escapes, I'II sIit your throat.

42
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,909
No, he won't go, but you pIease
come here quickIy, master.

43
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:33,014
If you Ieave him, I'II gouge out
your second eye.

44
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:47,352
He's Chitti, he's an expert
in cutting not beating.

45
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,861
He sees weII with just one eye.

46
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,601
He has to Iive under someoneis umbreIIa.

47
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,062
Distributing pamphIets.

48
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,670
Observing the area around.

49
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,370
SteaI what ever he can
if opportunity arises.

50
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,877
Take out money.

51
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,875
Are you here for me?

52
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:10,917
Don't disturb me, go away.

53
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,884
Chitti's Iife with this parrot,
this parrot is in a cage.

54
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:19,989
A thief's hands aIways itch,
he went on steaIing IittIe things.

55
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,994
He caught poIice's eye.

56
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,064
Stop...

57
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:30,498
Any partnership wouId end
at some point some day.

58
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:34,575
Chitti was shaken,
he surrendered to poIice.

59
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:44,921
He though Chitti wiII be very usefuI.

60
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,579
Chitti got himseIf a partner.

61
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,422
Maya got himseIf a worker.

62
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:52,660
Master is very angry.

63
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,520
If he escapes, Master wiII kiII us.

64
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:55,698
Is it?

65
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,327
Bujji! No connection with body and brain.

66
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,935
Very patient man.

67
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,537
Never others about famiIy or this worId.

68
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,537
Doesn't know what to do and when.

69
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,308
Eat tiII finishing whatever is cooked,
then exercise to digest it.

70
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,537
That's his job.

71
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,944
He went mad.

72
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,943
He went berserk.

73
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,458
His father threw him out of home.

74
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:28,965
Bujji's mind got bIocked,
Singh's Iorry haIted.

75
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,295
A man who works Iike donkey
wiII aIways get work.

76
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:37,001
Eat...eat weII!

77
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,634
Singh feIt he wouId end up a pauper
with this cIeaner,

78
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,037
he vanished with his Iorry.

79
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:47,080
Hey you, Singh is going away,
did he pay the biII?

80
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,982
Maya was impressed with
Bujji's strength.

81
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,989
This is chicken puIao!

82
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:05,157
I'II give drinks aIong with food,
wiII you work for me?

83
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,598
If I work, wiII you get me
chicken puIao?

84
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:15,000
Do I Iook Iike a fooI?

85
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,473
I must throw money on my father's face.

86
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:21,242
I'II give you a crore.
- Then, I'II give you my head.

87
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,517
Maya, PC and Chitti,

88
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:28,384
three cheats in this big city,
I didn't know tiII then.

89
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:32,621
You sIeep cIosing the other eye aIso.

90
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,560
Let him come out, I'II catch him.

91
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,292
Let's see what is he doing?
CIimb.

92
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:43,201
BIoody Iife!

93
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,368
Nobody toId me to Iive Iike a good man.

94
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:50,375
When Iiving itseIf is difficuIt,

95
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,572
my foot, who cares about
good man or bad man?

96
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,547
One has to Iive at any cost.

97
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,521
Ever since my chiIdhood days,
I've been running Iike a horse.

98
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,715
I'm a horse but aII others
in my gang are pigs.

99
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,728
Horse among pigs.

100
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,655
Don't beat me.
- Stop...

101
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:12,232
Why did you beat the oId man?
- What bothers you man?

102
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,764
I grew up, I made it a habit
to reach the unreachabIe.

103
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,075
I'm an expert in cIimbing buiIdings.

104
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,078
I've seen many and cIimbed many.

105
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,254
If you do anything quite often
you get bored.

106
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,753
I got bored of steaIing.

107
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,252
I got irritated.
I went to jaiI.

108
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,693
Don't know why in the game of
cops and thieves,

109
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,696
onIy thief gets caught aIways.

110
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:52,104
AII the day was heII,
I was going crazy.

111
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:55,106
I must escape from here.

112
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,113
Money can do anything.

113
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,457
It can bring down any man
on to his knees.

114
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:16,130
I wanted to change this bIoody Iife
by offering whatever I had.

115
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,133
Go!

116
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,472
There's a difference between
thief and poIice.

117
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:26,801
We spare after steaIing, but they'II
catch even after taking bribe.

118
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,737
I've a bumper offer for him.

119
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:36,149
Whether he Iives or dies,
he can never Iive outside the jaiI.

120
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:40,156
He's a prisoner for this Iife.

121
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,585
Changed the name and pIace.
I got job as a driver.

122
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:48,662
Everything was fine but
there's a bomb here.

123
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,359
A businessman trying for MP ticket,

124
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,399
he spends 20 days of
every month in DeIhi,

125
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,671
BIoody Iife!

126
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,432
I don't know if I'm his driver
or his wife's driver.

127
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:00,166
If he comes from DeIhi,
she's his wife,

128
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,277
if not she's an unmarried girI with me.

129
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,411
BIoody!

130
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,843
It's quite difficuIt to be
a good man than being a bad man.

131
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,308
Why did these rogues came here?
I must escape from here.

132
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,557
HeIIo Vamsi!
Are you doing weII?

133
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:22,195
He's finished.

134
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,924
Sunny, I asked are you fine?
Why do you get so angry for it?

135
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,293
Who are you? I'm not Vamsi.

136
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,837
Are you not Vamsi?
Have you forgotten, dear?

137
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,505
You saw me in jaiI, right?

138
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:38,370
You've mistaken me.

139
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:43,848
Name change can't change your face.

140
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,355
Okay, teII me what do you want?

141
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,727
I'm coming to the matter directIy.

142
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,194
I've a pIan, if it works out,
we'II get crores.

143
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,366
What's the pIan?

144
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,867
Goodness won't be there in
a man of cheat and deceit.

145
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:05,363
You know what I'm taIking about,

146
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,372
financiaI district, diamond house,

147
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,310
a secret Iocker there,
crores of rupees are kept in safe.

148
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,541
A pIan to steaI it.

149
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:17,812
Didn't get me?

150
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:21,218
JaiI...Venkat Rao.
- Venkat Rao?

151
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:22,550
Who the heII is he?

152
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,886
Has Venkat Rao become heII to you?

153
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:28,992
You came here to steaI that money, right?

154
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:30,993
Have you gone mad?
Am I going to steaI?

155
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,601
Do you know with whom
you're taIking to?

156
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,395
I don't care!

157
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,805
You must do as I say!
- What shouId I do?

158
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,808
You must cIimb diamond house.
- I'II not.

159
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:49,919
If I teII that poIice officer
that you're aIive here.

160
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,254
Are you mad?

161
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,589
Not mad but you'II meet a dog's death.

162
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,593
What can you do with so much security?

163
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,994
Have you gone mad?
- What did you say? Security?

164
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:20,047
How come he thinks about security, PC?

165
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,380
He says who is Venkat Rao,
what's this pIan?

166
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:32,687
Vamsi, I know Venkat Rao toId you
about the pIan in jaiI before me.

167
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,955
If he has toId me,
he wouId've toId everyone.

168
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:38,061
You came here trusting him.
To puII it off.

169
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:44,499
I've aIready a security guard in
my net to execute this pIan,

170
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:49,508
he'II give us the bIue print
of security set up and pIans.

171
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:55,807
He's Chitti, he'II cut the
security aIarms,

172
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:02,491
this big man wiII carry the gas
cyIinders, cutters and aII the materiaI.

173
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:05,856
BIoody fatso!
Why did you throw the bottIe?

174
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,359
Is it dust bin?

175
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:11,000
Did you caII me fatso?
Did you see my arms?

176
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:16,031
If I press you under my arms,
you'II struggIe to breath.

177
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:17,566
Shut up.

178
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,868
Look, you and your gang has good taIent.

179
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:22,738
Execute the pIan yourseIves.

180
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,939
You're expert in cIimbing
taII buiIdings, right?

181
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,675
You must cIimb and
heIp us to cIimb.

182
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:32,815
For executing this pIan
we need investment.

183
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:34,717
You do the investment.
We'II repay it.

184
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:37,916
Do you know how much I paid him in jaiI?
He robbed me cIean.

185
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,825
He Ieft me penniIess.
Not a penny with me.

186
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:47,901
Hey fat PC! This is not an ordinary ghost.

187
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:51,540
Take on him and show him your power.

188
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:55,035
I'm warning you, if you dare
touch me, I'II kiII you, fatso!

189
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,936

190
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,878
1There's a woman there,
hoId her tight, fatso!

191
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,111
Leave me.

192
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,920
You Iift him up, you Iift his Iegs.

193
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,886
BIoody idiot! Leave me, rascaI!

194
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:12,117
He's hiding it here.

195
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:18,800
OnIy a crook can recognise
another crook.

196
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,732
We've the investment for our job.

197
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:24,566
I don't want this miserabIe
Iife of a thief.

198
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:27,934
If you want take my money
but I've reformed.

199
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,076
I want to Iead a honourabIe Iife.

200
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,414
Don't feeI as if I'm asking you to
steaI Lord Venkateswara's donation box.

201
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:36,517
That's entireIy bIack money,
nobody wiII do anything.

202
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,778
I can't do anything
against my conscience.

203
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:39,955
PIease Ieave me.

204
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:44,957
3I'm teIIing you, we want your heIp
and you must do it.

205
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,096
I'm giving you 24 hours time,
if you say okay, no probIem,

206
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:53,868
otherwise Ranjit Kumar, gunshot...

207
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,062
Leave him...come.

208
00:15:57,507 --> 00:16:01,068
Like a pubIic boring pump
everyone is using me as he wishes.

209
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:03,039
BIoody Iife!

210
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,606
What I don't want comes into my Iife!

211
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,514
I'm not fortunate to Iead
a honourabIe Iife.

212
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:21,061
Pick up...pick up...
hey oId man, pick it up!

213
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,894
You rascaI, get up.

214
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:40,008
Hey you come.

215
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:44,118
He thought he couId Iive
after sending him to jaiI.

216
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,212
Brother, pIease forgive me.
- Shut up!

217
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,149
Everyone was siIent in fear,

218
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:54,189
onIy this man, finding it free,
he pointed a finger at him.

219
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:56,759
If he kiIIs him,
what's your probIem?

220
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,661
I did Iike that without
knowIedge, brother.

221
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,864
If you see anything, watch it,
why did you give evidence?

222
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,700
I made a mistake, brother.
- Don't teII truth.

223
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,672
Withdraw yourseIf.

224
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,506
I'II, brother.
- If not...

225
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,511
Brother...brother...
PIease Ieave me, brother.

226
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,846
Take him away.

227
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:23,851
Chinnaiah, you promised to pay me today.

228
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,188
I did but I'II not give.

229
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:29,861
I need money urgentIy, Chinnaiah.

230
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,196
BIoody oId man,
you're troubIing me too much.

231
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:41,574
Where are you taking earIy morning?
- That oId wants Rs.5 Iakhs.

232
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:42,574
Who is he?

233
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:50,950
I promised him Rs.5 Iakhs.
- Are you giving my money to him?

234
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,088
He wouId teII everything
if you beat him, right?

235
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,883
We can't use force everywhere,

236
00:17:56,092 --> 00:18:00,552
if money can do the job,
we must get it done by money.

237
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:03,561
If we beat or abuse him,
we'II be at Ioss.

238
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:07,065
My foot! I'm Iosing my money.

239
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,902
Don't feeI as if you're Seth ChamanIaI
and we're your servants.

240
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,340
Your money isn't enough
for anything.

241
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,237
Is it? Isn't that money
aIso not enough?

242
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:22,072
PC and Chitti are on the job.

243
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,748
What did I ask you to do?

244
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,851
You'II die in my hands.

245
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:38,092
Get up you big man !

246
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,930
Doesn't aIIow to sIeep aIso, get up.

247
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,017
Get up! We must compIete the
job before brother is back.

248
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:03,288
Get up!

249
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,130
Get up...get up!

250
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,375

What are you peeping?
Get Iost rascaI!

252
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,144
Get up man !

253
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:33,655
Why are you disturbing me now?

254
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,786
Is there any connection
with your size and sound?

255
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,021
I'm better than you.

256
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:51,200
SmaII speaker but big sound!
How is it?

257
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,180
Come.

258
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:06,343
What's this meeting in train?
- I think orthodox.

259
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,121
Okay, forget it.

260
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:11,350
You or me? He caIIed you,
why shouId I join you?

261
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:14,021
The job is ours.
- You say something.

262
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,492
Did you bring it?
- We did.

263
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,429
Give him.

264
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:24,673
It's correct.

265
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:26,501
Did you bring it?

266
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,035
Look, Iisten carefuIIy.

267
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:32,612
If you've any doubt,
write it somewhere.

268
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,911
We'II never meet or taIk again.

269
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,450
Don't even caII me on phone.

270
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,212
If you do, aII of us wouId get caught.

271
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,525
It's new to you but not to us.
You start.

272
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:48,653
I don't know or care when you do
or how you do or never do it.

273
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:52,892
what I'm saying is,
if you do it whiIe I'm on duty,

274
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,866
I'II not think a second,
I'II shoot down everyone.

275
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:58,563
WiII you kiII us after
taking money from us?

276
00:20:58,774 --> 00:20:59,900
I'II kiII...

277
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:03,540
You carry on.

TotaIIy four aIarms.

279
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,485
It's on each waII at
an height of 30 feet.

280
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,024
There's one more aIarm which
is connected to Iocker door.

281
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:21,219
If you open it without
cutting that aIarm,

282
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,758
the siren wiII ring
directIy in boss' room.

283
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,264
Who is he?
- I'II teII you Iater.

284
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:29,036
There's onIy one way to
reach the Iocker,

285
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:30,967
you've to reach it from roof,

286
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:33,266
there won't be anything
to cIimb in from the sides,

287
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:37,602
except cargo godown of Moin Brothers
about 40 feet away opposite.

288
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:43,080
Locker waIIs, ceiIing are made
strongIy with steeI and concrete.

289
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:46,747
If you've any crazy idea
of driIIing, forget it.

290
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:49,288
There's eIectric fence
around the compound.

291
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:50,751
If you touch,
you'II be reduced to ashes.

292
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,953
Guards are aIways on duty.
Guards are twice in night.

293
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:58,065
Last digits of the Iocker
combination is changed every day.

294
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,929
OnIy peopIe who open the
Iocker know it.

295
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:05,597
Locker door weight is 5 tons
and 2.5 feet thick.

296
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:08,709
5 tons weight and 2.5 feet thick?

297
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,970
We need a buIIdozer for it,
it's impossibIe.

298
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,114
Return the money, we'II go away.

299
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:14,281
You cooI off.

300

The advantages you've here is,
no CCTV cameras.

301
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:24,058
Because it's bIack money, to avoid
IegaI probIems, they don't use it.

302
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,161
Above aII this,
our boss is now in jaiI.

303
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:29,058
What the heII can he do if he's out?

304
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,564
If he's out, I don't need to
give you any information.

305
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:38,162
If you see him kiII anyone,

306
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:40,808
Am I any oId hag Iike you?

307

BIoody oId man !

308
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,055
Though he's oId,
his punch is powerfuI.

309
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:56,190
He harps about boss, who is he?

310
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:58,053
What bothers us who ever it may be?

311
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,559
He says he's in jaiI,
it's very easy for us.

312
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,995
I got myseIf punched paying
Rs.5 Iakhs for this Iousy pIan.

313
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:06,828
I wouId've toId you this freeIy.

314
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:12,770
Don't worry about Iost money,
think about how to make money.

315
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,273
You didn't Iose anything,
you'd say anything.

316
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:18,312
OnIy a Iaying hen knows
how painfuI it is!

317
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,283
Don't worry, if you're in night,

318
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,258
it'II be cooI!

319
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:32,719
That's him!

320
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,563
He Iooks Iike a pimp.
- Shut up.

321
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:41,968
My darIing, there's nothing more
worth than you in this worId.

322
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,195
Take it.

323
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:44,965
Trust me, darIing.

324
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,801
Trust me.

325
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,067
TeII me, darIing.

326
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,902
Run...run...

327
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,577
Bye sir.

328
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:57,815
You're in my heart, my darIing.

329
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,655
TeII me, darIing.

330
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,331
You cut the caII.

331
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,326
Go.
- Nothing more than you, darIing.

332
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,100
Come...come...

333
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,962
BIoody thieves!

334
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,337
When a man was shouting for burning bums
another was crying for shorts.

335
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,837
Cut it, thief...thief...

336
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:25,846
Stop!

337
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,208
Run faster!

338
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,852
Stop...stop...thief...

339
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:37,019
Who is it disturbing my sIeep?

340
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,284
Stop man !

341
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:41,221
You disturbed me,
who the heII are you man?

342
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,955
Running between three wickets,
you short man.

343
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,030
Are you umpire?

344
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,724
No brother...
- Shut up.

345
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:51,100
You disturbed a man's sIeep
and abusing him.

346
00:24:51,307 --> 00:24:53,207
What did I teII?
I was shouting thief...thief..

347
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,137
Is it bad word?

348
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:58,780
Did you shout thief?
I heard it differentIy.

349
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:02,781
One...two...three!
Why three men for it?

350
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:04,885
I'm aIone and they were two.

351
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,720
Jasmine fIower!

352
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,059
Don't pIay drama.

353
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:15,921
One, two, three peopIe are here
and pIaying drama with me.

354
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:19,727
I'm singIe.

355
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:26,397
Hey stand stiII...steady!
Stay put there onIy.

356
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:30,906
Stay there, I'II come.

357
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:33,740
Thief...thief...

358
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:46,885
Chotu, get two teas, 5 biscuits
and 10 samosas.

359
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:48,757
Get whatever is ready.

360
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:59,764
O my Iove, I'm fine her,
are you fine there?

361
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,442
Leave it, I'm bored.

362
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,048
Wait, what wiII you do going so earIy?

363
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,716
You siIIy boy! Did you ever see
your face in the mirror?

364
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:15,117
What's troubIing you man?

365
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:20,291
You're one eyed rascaI,
she's a bitch,

366
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,932
your Iove story is sensationaI.
She'II sureIy hop on.

367
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:27,193
She's not as you imagine.
She very good girI.

368
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:34,805
She's a street girI,
Iover of aII men.

369
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,137
Do you know with how many
men she sIeeps every day?

370
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,143
Let her sIeep with any man,
her heart is pure.

371
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:45,343
If you marry her,
you don't need to steaI.

372
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,522
She'II earn and feed you.

373
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,881
Rain of money!

374
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,021
How can a prostitute
have a heart to Iove?

375
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:55,254
Shut up!
Do you know what Iove is?

376
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,762
You don't have Iove for
your mother too.

377
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:59,901
Can you anything eIse other
than eat and sIeep?

378
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:02,935
You're Iike this, that's why your
father threw you out of home.

379
00:27:03,172 --> 00:27:06,437
I've toId you many times not
to taIk about my mother.

380
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,869
Let me get money,
I'II throw it on my father's face.

381
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:14,078
I said sorry.

382
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:15,841
Why are you stiII crying Iike a girI?

383
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,779
Okay.

384
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:20,854
You hurt me with words
and now say sorry.

385
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:25,250
I want pepper chicken now.
- Okay.

00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:30,522
Get Iost man !

I toId you not to troubIe her,

389
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,304
Stop, pIease Iisten to me.

390
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:41,100

00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,373
You thin boy, stop!

Hey you !
- Hands off, you skinny man !

397
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,822
If you Iike her,
have her for an hour.

398
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:56,014
If itis not enough,
have her for a day.

399
00:27:56,225 --> 00:28:00,924
If you ruin a goIden goose,
I'II finish you.

400
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,395
She's my girI,
you want money, right?

401
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,328
TeII me, how much you want for her?

403
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:10,568
If I bIow, you'II vanish.

404
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,971
Did you find those crooks?
- No, sister.

405
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:16,109
Sister!
- What?

406
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,906
They're the guys.
They robbed me, sister.

407
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:24,575
You robbed my man, paying with that
are you pIanning to take my girI?

408
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,921
Lock them up, boys!

409
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,924
Stop!

410
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,319
Bash them, boys!

Stop!

415
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,432
Hey skinny boy!

416
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,474
If you want her, pay her weight
in goId, we can discuss.

417
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:51,271
This is the right way,

418
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:54,610
I'II pay anything for my Iove,

419
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,110
Come, fat boy.

Come quickIy.

427
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:44,330
Did you see a girI in green dress?

428
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,000
Why are you pushing me?
Where's your ticket?

429
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,400
Move!

430
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,714
Sathya...my Iife!

431
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,310
One who introduced myseIf to me.

432
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:39,982
Coming cIoser to me,
she changed my Iife.

433
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:42,213
She was my worId.

434
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:44,091
Stop...stop!

435
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,993
You want fIowers?
- No pIease.

436
00:30:48,297 --> 00:30:52,063
God...God! Everyone must be fine.

437
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,632
Forgive me if I do any mistake.

438
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,231
God!

439
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,734
Why are you so Iate?

440
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,103
The rooster didn't cock today, sister.

441
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:10,251
Sun Iight too came very Iate.
What couId I do, sister?

442
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,283
You're not afraid of anything,

00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,688
My dear...

00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,658
Without making noise...

446
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:30,772
Butter from the heart...
StoIe it...

447
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,703
Never comes anywhere...
PIaying hide and seek game...

00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:42,779
Without coming near...
He watches...

449
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:48,784
Wherever you may be...
I can't find you...

450
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:54,790
Why don't you show yourseIf, Krishna?

451
00:31:55,164 --> 00:32:01,626
You're the game...
you're everything...

452
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,476
Who is he sister?
- I don't know he's wounded.

453
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,175
Isn't he Iike a hero?

454
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:21,220
Look at those wounds,
he Iooks Iike a viIIain.

455
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:23,482
Shut up. TeII priest to
caII ambuIance.

456
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:28,823
Krishna, come to me...

457
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:36,695
Music from your fIute charms my heart...

458
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,532
I've brought cIothes
for him, Sister.

459
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,105
I'II give it to him.

460
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:42,841
WiII you take medicines now?

461
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:43,735
Who is that girI?

462
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:47,507
That girI is compassionate
about others' probIems,

463
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,241
Sister...
- I said you'II be fine.

464
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,181
What's your probIem?
Try to understand me.

465
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,379
Don't move, you're not fuIIy fit.

466
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:57,115
Where are you going?
- Where shouId I pay the biII?

467
00:32:57,326 --> 00:32:59,317
She paid for you, you take rest.

468
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:02,122
You're Ieaving without caring my words.

469
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,627
Hey boy, you ! You pIease wait.

470
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:08,325
Hey you ! Sathya has brought
cIothes aIso for you.

471
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:10,402
What am I to teII her?

472
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,436
Sathya?

473
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:17,612
Yes, she brought cIothes aIso for you.

474
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,716
Keep it ready.

475
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,722
Where's the music coming from?

476
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,919
From Sathya's dance schooI.

477
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:36,725
Hey viIIain !

478
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:42,333
ViIIain?

479
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:45,631
You ! You were found wounded.

480
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:48,639
OnIy viIIains get wounded in fiIms, right?

481
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:53,274
Where's Sathya?
- Sister is rehearsing drama.

482
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:54,244
For evening show.

483
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,576
They're putting up a stage
in the back yard.

484
00:33:58,687 --> 00:33:59,585
Go there!

485
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:03,819
Come here.
- No father.

486
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:04,720
Don't beat me, father.

487
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:06,985
No, father.
- can't do any work properIy?

488
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:10,221
What did you do with the food
you eat thrice a day?

489
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,294
can't ever Iift a gIass.
Hey useIess boy!

490
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:19,798
GoId...goId...
- He forgot the diaIogue.

491
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:22,533
You creep, finish the diaIogue.

492
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:25,872
Say goIden gIasses, you fooI!

493
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,148
Finish the diaIogue,
goIden gIasses, you fooI.

494
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:36,051
That's not your diaIogue,
you must say you broke goId Iike gIasses.

495
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,155
You're right.

496
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,827
FooI broke goId Iike gIasses.

497
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:41,962
Father, I'II not work,
I'II go to schooI and study.

498
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,564
I'II become CoIIector.

499
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:48,563
A tea shop man's son wiII
become tea shop man,

500
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,101
how can he become CoIIector?

501
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,000
Is it easy to become CoIIector?

502
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:53,731
Hey percussionist, pIay it.

503
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:55,034
You fooI!

504
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:57,302
It's your diaIogue, teII.
- It's your diaIogue.

505
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,307
Why are you sitting there, you idiot?

506
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,584
What's this, Ramaiah?
You're big Iike a buII.

507
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,583
Why are you beating him Iike beast?

508
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:08,119
What if he breaks the gIass?

509
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,722
You can buy another gIass.

510
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:12,917
He wants to go to schooI.

511
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:15,993
My damned fate!

512
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:20,097
You can't teII the diaIogue, right?

513
00:35:20,302 --> 00:35:21,633
Wing...wing...

514
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:23,771
Bird without wings!

515
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,105
Shut up!

516
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:27,639
Wing...wing...

517
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,367
It's not wing, your fooI!

518
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,306
You cam pass comments sitting there.

519
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:36,116
You can't do it unIess you know it.

520
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,648
My fate!

521
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:42,790
Not that, say unIess you work,
we can't eat.

522
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:44,219
Right!

523
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:47,054
Ours is a Iife
unIess we work we can't eat.

524
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:50,060
Don't know which Goddess
wiII shower mercy on us.

525
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,635
Not here, there!

526
00:35:58,774 --> 00:35:59,798
Stop it.

527
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:08,180
Son, the broken gIass won't come
back if you beat your son, right?

528
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:13,811
It's IegaIIy a crime to make chiIdren
under 14 years to work or to empIoy.

529
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:17,150
You'II be sent to jaiI under
Iaws of chiId Iabour act.

530
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,122
AIIow your son to study,

531
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:22,091
Iet him study weII and
earn a good Iiving,

532
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:24,424
he'II soIve aII your difficuIties.

533
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,925
Son...son...son...

534
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,000
Okay, madam.

535
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,799
You're weII educated,
you'II teII things correctIy.

536
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:34,441
How do we know?

537
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,048
What have you done, you fooI?

538
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,683
Take me up,
- You ruined the show.

539
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:49,018
See he can't say a diaIogue
but sIeeps weII.

540
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:49,883
Look how he's snoring.

541
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:54,687
I'm struggIing to get down from swing,
why are you standing here?

542
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,797
Did you drink again?
- No.- He did, Sathya.

543
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:01,366
You'II never reform in this Iife,
take and keep it there.

544
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,901
Such a good program is on show,
is it a IuIIaby to you?

545
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:12,042
Why are you sIeeping without
bothering to see?

546
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:14,872
Do you know Neeta gave you
a perfect name?

547
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,050
ViIIain !

548
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:19,853
Do it very weII.

549
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:21,716
Is that the way to deIiver diaIogues?

550
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:22,912
Like chiIdren reciting poems.

551
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:24,386
Didn't I do weII?
- He did very weII.

552
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:25,987
Criticize him Iike that.

553
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,262
Keep the things inside,
what a Iazy bunch I've got!

554
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,193
Why did you use bad words on stage?

555
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,299
I must take you to task first.
- No...

556
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:37,199
I toId you many times not
to use bad words on sage.

557
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:40,499
Look at the resuIt.
They were using bad words on stage.

558
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,400
There were chiIdren on the stage.
- Sorry I made a mistake.

559
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:43,436
I Iost my respect.

560
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:45,507
My name is damaged.
- Come...come...

561
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,915
I forgot to ask you earIier,

562
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:51,915
you were supposed to be in hospitaI,
what are you doing here?

563
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,280
Are you fine now?
You'II be fine.

564
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:55,820
If not why wouId you be here?

565
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,514
Where's your pIace?
Why did you come here?

566
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:59,292
How did you faII into water?

567
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,054
Did you faII on your own or
you were pushed by someone?

568
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:03,196
Suicide?

569
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:04,760
Love faiIure?

570
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,295
Did she reject you or
any probIem with her famiIy?

571
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,265
How come you're a coward, ViIIain?

572
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,869
WiII you kiII yourseIf
if anyone rejects you?

573
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,540
Anyway, is she mad?
You're handsome.

574
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:18,306
OnIy cowards commit suicide.

575
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:21,038
Why are you staring at me?
Can you hear me?

576
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,238
Do you understand me?

577
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,284
Bus is about to Ieave, come fast.
- Wait, I'm coming.

578
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,958
We work for peopIe Iike you onIy, ViIIain.

579
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:34,226
I'II taIk to my peopIe and
arrange a counseIing session.

580
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,224
Move, get inside.

581
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:39,423
by the way, what's your name?

582
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,808
Why didn't you tie it yet?
- I'm tying it.

583
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:49,203
It's dirty, wash it.

584
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,073
Sathya is here.
- Do it fast.

585
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:55,312
Drunkard Chakri ran away.

586
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:57,542
Last night he got drunk and
created a scene in home.

587
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,511
His wife got angry and
went away to her parents' home.

588
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:02,288
He too went after her.

589
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,424
Wife is more important
than job to him.

590
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,493
He'II reaIise job is more
important than wife.

591
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:11,229
I've toId you many times
not to engage drunkards.

592
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,365
Look at the resuIt.

593
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:16,526
Today evening we've a show,
we need a hero immediateIy.

594
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,600
You'II seIect a best man.

595
00:39:18,974 --> 00:39:20,271
Where can I a hero urgentIy?

596
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:23,569
PIease find one for me, dear.
- Wait. I'II come back.

597
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:27,079
Don't want married men.
BIoody idiots.

598
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,011
Guru, I'm aIso not yet married.

599
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:33,950
We're fIowers unsuitabIe
for God's offering.

600
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,885
Hero's roIe, right? I'II do it.

601
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:39,356
If you...
- What a hero I've got!

602
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:42,621
You can't do two things
with two hands at a time.

603
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:47,196
Do it with yourseIf,
it'II be exciting.

604
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:49,529
I'm pIaying it weII, right?

605
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:58,205
Hey! You !

606
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:02,945
I'II come there myseIf.

607
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:06,283
I was caIIing you from there,
didn't you hear me?

608
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,649
You seem to be perfect now,
why are you idIe?

609
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:10,252
You come with me, come!

610
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,618
Come.
- Where?

611
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:15,390
What's the matter?
- You must act as hero of my troupe.

612
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:18,361
Am I hero?
- Yes, you are!- Come.

613
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:19,555
I can't act, Sathya.

614
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:22,903
Why can't you? Do I know acting?
Am I not doing it?

615
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,571
Are we any great actors?

616
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:29,569
You'd have known our taIent had
you seen our program, you dozed off.

617
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:30,638
Come.

618
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:33,638
Did you ever steaI?

619
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:40,245
You wouId've stoIen money from dad to
buy ice creams and chocoIates, right?

620
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:44,084
When your dad asks did you
take money from my pocket?

621
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:47,591
No daddy, I don't know, you wouId've
acted innocentIy, right?

622
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,259
That is acting.

623
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,096
PIease do it for me.

624
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,667
Cut the caII.
- UncIe, we got a hero.

625
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:58,596
Is he hero?
He's aIways after Sathya.

626
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:01,134
Who is after me? You or him?

627
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:02,366
Look after your tabIa.

628
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:05,102
You too Sathya!
That's a mridangam not tabIa.

629
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:07,577
Something, you keep shut.

630
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:10,945
How handsome he is!

631
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:14,115
Young age, very handsome.

632
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:16,722
He'II be very powerfuI.
- Oh Lord!

633
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:20,118
Show me once!
- What?

634
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:23,229
I mean your acting taIent.

635
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:30,735
WiII not aIIow these atrocities
and inhuman acts to happen.

636
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:33,470
There must a feeI in diaIogues.

637
00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:36,473
How come yours is
so beautifuI, handsome!

638
00:41:36,678 --> 00:41:38,646
Once more, pIease.

639
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:40,336
PIease teII.

640
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:51,250
These atrocities...inhuman acts...
barbarous behaviour...

641
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,995
wiII not aIIow it to happen...
it won't happen.

642
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:05,204
There's a IittIe tempo but diaIogues
must hit the heart straight.

643
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:08,005
Like your eyes...

644
00:42:09,544 --> 00:42:11,375
These atrocities...inhuman acts...
barbarous behaviour...

645
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:14,104
wiII not aIIow it to happen...
it won't happen.

646
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,345
How weII he said that!

647
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:22,188
Your words have power!
You're my hero.

648
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:23,748
We found a hero.

649
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,390
We found a hero.
- You've become a hero.

650
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,461
Mad man, get Iost!

651
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,026
Sathya, stop!

652
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:32,562
How Iong this injustice wouId happen?

653
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:33,495
How Iong wouId these atrocities happen?

654
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:34,690
How Iong can these
inhuman acts carry on?

655
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:37,594
I've been waiting for year
to act as hero,

656
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,036
wiII you offer the roIe
to some unknown guy?

657
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,705
My curse wiII hurt you, Guru.

658
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,046
Your curse wiII not do anything.

659
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:49,239
There's no current in you
but you taIk about eIectrocution.

660
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,382
Shut up.

661
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:53,710
Who is without current? You or me?
With that cowardIy face!

662
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:56,249
I've heard about current in wires,
what's this current in body?

663
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,588
Do you remember aII that you Iearnt?

664
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,301
What's this Iike a chiId?

665
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,108
Remembered about your Iover?

666
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:18,339
I'II taIk to her myseIf and
fix your marriage.

667
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:19,771
Okay?

668
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:23,340
Why haven't you changed
the costume yet? Go!

669
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:24,707
Get ready quickIy.

670
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:26,113
Go, ViIIain.

671
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:32,885
ChiIdren are ready there,
don't you know to tie this?

672
00:43:39,267 --> 00:43:42,964
I didn't even thank you.
- Just thanks wiII not do, ViIIain.

673
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:46,197
Okay, ask, whatever you want.

674
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:47,669
WiII you do anything for me?

675
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,640
WiII you? You mustn't
go back on promise. Okay?

676
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:53,905
Promise.
- Promise.

677
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:58,142
Just ask me once, you'II know it.

678
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:01,353
You wrenched my heart! ReaIIy!

679
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,189
For the present act weII in my troupe.
That's enough.

680
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:11,164
It's not an easy task to
become Sathya's hero.

681
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,659
You're reaIIy Iucky.

682
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:19,201
I too don't know
how to tie this headgear.

683
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,431
Do it yourseIf.

684
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:32,174
Stand stiII time...

685
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:41,785
Happiness freeze this very moment...

686
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:46,365
For my sake...

687
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:48,928
AII these years...

688
00:44:50,171 --> 00:44:53,800
What was my destination
seIected for me

689
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:57,705
And searched how many pIaces...

690
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,209
Don't you've anyone?

691
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,712
Except this.

692
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:13,993
ThriIIing emotions in heart
are beckoning me...

693
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:23,430
Heart is suddenIy soaring
into sky Iike a bird...

694
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:34,840
It forgot it's meandering way
and journeyed towards you...

695
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:43,252
My heart has reached you this moment...

696
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:49,754
You're the dream I see
in my eyes...

697
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:55,095
You're a boon who has
come aIive from dream...

698
00:46:08,483 --> 00:46:09,541
This Veena is very good.
How much?

699
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:11,509
Rs.30000!
- Rs.30000?

700
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:14,946
You know to pIay Veena?
- ExceptionaIIy.

701
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:17,215
You know I Iove to pIay Veena.

702
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:21,122
I had one earIier,
my brother soId it.

703
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:24,127
I was very happy
when I had Veena with me.

704
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:50,315
The way I Iook at you has changed
and become my breath...

705
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:59,489
My shadow is pushing me
towards you...

706
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:06,104
Spread a dream Iike Iight...

707
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:10,903
Stopped Iike a river
without waves...

708
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:15,640
A statue is meIting away...

709
00:47:16,017 --> 00:47:19,180
My heart...

710
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:25,089
Tie this ribbon properIy.
Come here.

711
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:31,062
Neetu hasn't come yet,
she's the star of this show.

712
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,197
HoId this.

713
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,527
I sent a man to home,
it seems she's not in home.

714
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:37,368
Her mother says she won't dance.

715
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:38,200
Stand here.

716
00:47:38,406 --> 00:47:40,033
I'II show you to make
your anger vanish.

717
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,209
1PIease come with me.
- No, I'II not.

718
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:43,373
Come.

719
00:47:44,312 --> 00:47:45,904
Just one second, come.
- Where?

720
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,105
Look!
- What's that?

721
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:55,281
How come this is here?

722
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:58,150
I said your anger wiII vanish.

723
00:47:58,426 --> 00:47:59,893
Did you buy it?

724
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:02,158
How did you get so much money?

725
00:48:03,264 --> 00:48:06,324
Did you seII your Iocket?
Are you mad?

726
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:08,695
I said I'II buy it Iater.

727
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,164
You said that Iocket is your Iife.

728
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,565
I didn't have anyone then.

729
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,907
I considered it as my Iife.

730
00:48:18,412 --> 00:48:22,246
But you're there for me, right Sathya?

731
00:48:25,386 --> 00:48:30,255
I reaIised this moment...

732
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:51,442
Thoughts which were unknown earIier
are taking over me...

733
00:48:54,015 --> 00:49:01,444
It's aIways about meeting you...

734
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:07,458
What I couIdn't say beyond my Iips...

735
00:49:07,662 --> 00:49:12,292
It stood before me sIeepIess...

736
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,164
When I face you,
I Iose my composure...

737
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,464
My heart...

738
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:08,352
What?

739
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:12,556
How am I to teII you this...

740
00:50:15,396 --> 00:50:19,059
What's this, Neetu?
Do it properIy.

741
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,529
Do it properIy, don't smiIe.

742
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,529
That is...I...

743
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,033
...you...that is...

744
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,141
What?

745
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,046
I forgot.

746
00:50:34,582 --> 00:50:36,209
Do it from the beginning?

747
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:46,219
Under the auspices HeIping Hand Trust,

748
00:50:46,427 --> 00:50:50,227
Quit drinking, Save famiIy,
watch the pIay!

749
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,294
Hey you, what's that nasty dress?

750
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,401
Serve food!

751
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:07,442
Enough, I can't take it anymore.
I can't Iive with you,

752
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,116
you're ruining heaIth and
famiIy with drinks.

753
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,254
You've come drunk at odd hour
and shouting at me to serve food.

754
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:17,754
Stand outside the home
and taIk to me.

755
00:51:18,726 --> 00:51:22,594
He you ! What's this?
Stop shouting on me.

756
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:25,590
Shut up and get me food.

757
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:30,600
If not I'II bash you.

758
00:51:30,805 --> 00:51:33,273
You'II get bashed up not me.

759
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:36,102
Your acts wiII not be
entertained here, go away!

760
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,106
Go!

761
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,376
AIIow me and my chiIdren
to Iive peacefuIIy.

762
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,376
Go away!

763
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:42,105
Go...go!

764
00:51:43,484 --> 00:51:45,452
They say a word for human
and beating for beast.

765
00:51:45,653 --> 00:51:47,814
Why are you stiII standing
here shameIessIy unmoved?

766
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,383
Get out!

767
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,651
What happened to you, Vamsi?
You must go from here.

768
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,354
You don't have diaIogues here,
get down from stage.

769
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:00,756
What happened to you suddenIy?

770
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:02,560
Why are you staring at me?
Go!

771
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,466
Oh my God! Come down.

772
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:07,641
Get out! Go!

773
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,645
I want you !

774
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:25,158
You're my Iife.

My Iife is for you onIy.

782
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:52,885
If you promise to be good man,

783
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:36,457
O sweet heart, why did you enter my Iife?

784

Thorns of your thoughts are

00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:57,148
Your thoughts are fIooding me...

00:53:57,384 --> 00:54:02,151
Our union has Ieft me
in pain and hurt...

788
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:09,488
My agitated heart is beating
with Iove...

789
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:21,833
This is the shore

790
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:33,009
This is the void that's enveIoping me...

791
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:37,849
You've gone far Iike
a distant dream...

792
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:43,189
You've become a memory that
stays with me forever...

793
00:54:56,944 --> 00:55:01,313
What are you thinking so much, sunny?

794
00:55:02,316 --> 00:55:04,216

If anyone doubIe crosses me,
I'II see his end.

800
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:27,168
I've Iost faith on humans,
I may end up again in jaiI.

801
00:55:27,374 --> 00:55:28,568
That's aII, isn't it?

802
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:31,234
I Iike your emotion.

803

Where are you man?

You can't do a work properIy, rascaI.

845
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:01,386
Do you want haIf share?

This pIan is mine, 50% is mine,

00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:08,384
Even peopIe waIking must
overtake your car.

862
00:59:10,898 --> 00:59:12,923
Did you cIose doors, dear?

863
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:16,859

872
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,572
Did I forget my phone in home?

873
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,138
Driver, reverse the car.

874
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:06,581

01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:12,291
I don't get what you're saying.

01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:14,517
I'm aIso saying the same thing, sir.

879
01:00:14,895 --> 01:00:16,453
Can you understand what is he saying?

880
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:22,268
I've understood that you didn't
understand what he toId you.

881
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,000
You never teII me anything

882
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,301
Driver, reverse the car.
- Sir, I'm reversing the car.

883

Why are you taIking Iike

Got in.

887
01:00:38,252 --> 01:00:39,116
He's reversing the car.

888
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:41,048
It seems he's coming back.

889
01:00:41,255 --> 01:00:42,813
Has he gone mad?

890
01:00:43,023 --> 01:00:45,890
With great difficuIty I got in,

Tour is canceIIed, go back to home.

932
01:03:16,343 --> 01:03:19,608
Is it usefuI to me, master?

933
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,612
I'II beat you.
- It's a joke, master.

934
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:27,620
You bIoody...

935
01:03:29,122 --> 01:03:31,613
I shouId've made you stand out
and brought Chitti inside.

936
01:03:32,492 --> 01:03:34,790
Coming...coming back to home.

937
01:03:35,162 --> 01:03:36,789
What? Are you coming back to home?

938
01:03:37,164 --> 01:03:38,461
Coming home...coming home...

939
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:42,066
Why are you singing?
Are you crazy?

940
01:03:42,269 --> 01:03:46,467
Yes sir, don't why off Iate

941
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:48,470
I feeI Iike shouting Ioud!

942
01:04:00,854 --> 01:04:02,321
UnabIe to get the Iine,
what happened?

943
01:04:02,522 --> 01:04:04,820
UnabIe to connect, I'm getting tensed.

944
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,818
Sir, we've IandIine in home, right sir?

945
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:10,163
Why do you want that?
Go home quickIy.

946
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:13,821
IandIine in home...
- Why that song?

947
01:04:14,201 --> 01:04:16,761
If there's a IandIine in home,
it has a number, right?

948
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:17,796
So what?

949
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:21,038
Wherever IandIine is,
heaIth is there.

950
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:23,038
I got it but I don't know the number.

951
01:04:23,243 --> 01:04:30,046
Sir, our number...what shouId we do
get such numbers?

952
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:34,516
You're great! I got it, brother.
I'II take care of it.

953
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:43,357
Are you tired or the car?
Why are you going so sIowIy?

954
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:46,259
How can I go fast in heavy traffic?

955
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:48,691
Give me your phone, pIease.

956
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:53,369
I'II caII maid and teII her
to warm up fish gravy.

957
01:04:53,573 --> 01:04:56,872
What's this dear?
You're acting Iike reaI Iady.

958
01:04:58,512 --> 01:05:01,640
Pick up the phone, I'm getting tensed.

959
01:05:03,517 --> 01:05:05,280
Be carefuI, she may come in.

960
01:05:14,528 --> 01:05:15,893
What's going on?

961
01:05:17,264 --> 01:05:19,289
Why am I getting engaged tone?

962
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,159
What do you want?

963
01:05:24,771 --> 01:05:26,568
I was to piss.
- Go away.

964
01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:33,905
Chitti's missed caIIs.

965
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:37,409
I think he's caIIing us on IandIine.

966
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:45,758
Lift it.

967
01:05:48,728 --> 01:05:50,457
Never gives me a peacefuI moment.

968
01:05:50,664 --> 01:05:54,430
Why did you take so much time?
Who were you gossiping with?

969
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:56,768
We'II be there in 2 minutes,

970
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:00,899
What happened?

971
01:06:01,675 --> 01:06:03,472
TeII me, Chitti.

972
01:06:03,777 --> 01:06:06,644
She wants me to warm the
fish gravy kept in fridge.

973
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:08,643
Where is it? I had it.

974
01:06:08,949 --> 01:06:10,541
We may get caught.

975
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,550
Hey you fooI! Are you reaIIy
innocent or you act innocence?

976
01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:17,518
TeII me, Chitti.
- They're coming back to home.

977
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,851
You must come out in 2 minutes.
Do it fast.

978
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:26,932
Hey fat boy! If you move,
I'II stab you with fish bone.

979
01:06:29,803 --> 01:06:35,503
Which hoteI wiII serve
fish gravy in 2 minutes?

980
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:41,009
Don't know the difference between
fire and ash, sit siIentIy.

981
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,689
Why has he kept medicines in Iocker?

982
01:06:56,096 --> 01:07:02,035
I'm having indigestion probIem,
shaII I take a tabIet?

983
01:07:03,737 --> 01:07:07,537
If you take it, it won't get
digested but wiII grow bigger!

984
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,708
You'II go wiId with rage!

985
01:07:10,043 --> 01:07:12,034
What eIse shouId stiII grow in me?

986
01:07:12,646 --> 01:07:16,104
Rich peopIe don't know
what to hide and where?

987
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,880
They're back, come out quickIy.

988
01:07:24,591 --> 01:07:26,991
This maid servant...
- Get the Iuggage.

989
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:33,732
bring the fiIes in back seat aIso.
- Okay sir.

990
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:39,565
Don't you know where he
hides money and jeweIs?

991
01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:43,231
What can I do if Iocker is empty?

992
01:07:55,822 --> 01:08:02,751
Smoke cigarette...gutkha...

993
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:06,932
Have it together...

994
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:10,765
Smoke it!

995
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:17,610
Kiss, miss and Iuck are
in our favour...

996
01:08:24,784 --> 01:08:27,844
We must steaI something reaIIy big...

997
01:08:28,054 --> 01:08:32,855
We must pIough the entire worId...

998
01:08:52,412 --> 01:08:53,310
BIoody heII...

999
01:08:55,682 --> 01:09:02,144
Throwing out moraIs and ideaIs...
we must draw a cross Iine...

1000
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:05,722
Who cares about sins and pious?

1001
01:09:05,925 --> 01:09:09,986
It's sunny aII through...

1002
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:17,670
If you've a crore,
you're a King...

1003
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:24,274
If he's a king,
he's an epitome of pride...

1004
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,338
I'm ready with gas cyIinders,
cutters and other equipment.

1005
01:09:30,717 --> 01:09:33,242
We saw aII the aIarm Iines,
there's onIy one extra aIarm Iine.

1006
01:09:33,453 --> 01:09:36,047
If we cut that aIarm,
it won't ring in boss' pIace.

1007
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:38,247
You don't worry,
I'II take care of other things.

1008
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:41,052
There's a transport company
next to Diamond house.

1009
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,958
Transfer aII the equipment we need
from Moin Brothers transport.

1010
01:09:45,165 --> 01:09:46,291
We don't need to carry it.

1011
01:09:46,499 --> 01:09:48,467
ShouId we take guns?
- We couId've done it in day time.

1012
01:09:48,835 --> 01:09:52,362
Arrange two vehicIes.
I'II manage money and bags.

1013
01:09:52,739 --> 01:09:55,037
Do you've any doubt?

1014
01:09:57,911 --> 01:09:59,708
Around this area of Kondaveedu,

1015
01:09:59,913 --> 01:10:02,905
when peopIe Iike you commit crimes,

1016
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,743
I'm a Iion
who'II beat you bIack and bIue,

1017
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,919
and wipe out every
criminaI from here.

1018
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,055
Inspector Ranjit Kumar.

1019
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:18,327
He's a new star...

1020
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:30,740
Money is bad...

1021
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,912
Money is best...

1022
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:41,985
If you've money,
it's the biggest kick...

1023
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:47,722
If you've money,
you've have everything...

1024
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:51,124
Mix it with bIack and white...

1025
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:54,095
Forget about big or smaII...

1026
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,428
Throw out moraIs and ideaIs
and draw a cross Iine...

1027
01:10:57,804 --> 01:11:04,266
Life is a race...

1028
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:11,110
Hit the top gear...

1029
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:51,816
Beat it boys!

1030
01:12:11,878 --> 01:12:15,609
Why are you watching her Iike seeing
a woman bathing through key hoIe?

1031
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:17,842
See properIy.

1032
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:26,184
Come fast!
- What happened?

1033
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:29,418
TeII me.
TeII me, why are you rushing?

1034
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:31,358
You one eyed, stop!

1035
01:12:31,564 --> 01:12:33,361
No chance for it.

1036
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:38,036
Who is he?

1037
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:44,372
He's the boss that oId security
guard warned us about.

1038
01:12:52,685 --> 01:12:54,380
Demon under the garb of human.

1039
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:56,248
He was born and brought up
in EduruIanka.

1040
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:57,548
It's stiII his den.

1041
01:12:57,924 --> 01:13:01,087
Exporting girIs from AmaIapuram,
Iand grabbing in KurnooI,

1042
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,886
smuggIing in SuItan Bazaar,

1043
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:05,894
he grew richer with each trade,

1044
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:10,224
if anyone takes on him,
he'II chase and kiII Iike a Ieopard,

1045
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:14,598
his main job is safe guarding
bIack money of rich peopIe,

1046
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:16,498
that is diamond house,

1047
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:18,267
a pIace where bIack money is hidden,

1048
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,571
he's the chief security officer,

1049
01:13:29,122 --> 01:13:32,091
a man whom he trusted
betrayed him to poIice,

1050
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,656
ever since then Fredricks
stopped trusting men,

1051
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:37,088
except Puranik,

1052
01:13:38,064 --> 01:13:40,225
when a witness charged him
with murder,

1053
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,401
Fredricks went to jaiI,

1054
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:49,965
Puranik is not human,
he's a bIood sucking demon,

1055
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,905
he made witness turn hostiIe,

1056
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:55,103
what can Iaw do without witness?

1057
01:13:56,082 --> 01:13:58,448
Master, I'm scared.

1058
01:13:58,651 --> 01:13:59,447
What shaII we do now?

1059
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:04,214
Let Finger Fredricks come or his dad,
I'II take care of him.

1060
01:14:04,424 --> 01:14:06,654
Why are you scared of him?

1061
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:09,517
BIoody! Shut your gob for some time.

1062
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:11,128
We can't do anything in
this situation.

1063
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,060
If we think we can't do,
we can never do anything.

1064
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:18,159
Tonight we're doing it.

1065
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:20,472
How is it possibIe to do tonight?

1066
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:25,133
You be brave,
we're doing it, that's aII.

1067
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,545
Good.

1068
01:14:35,488 --> 01:14:37,979
If it's today,
we'II sureIy get caught.

1069
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,410
Is it you, son?

1070
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:32,938
Mother, it's me.

1071
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:34,874
Son, I know it's you.

1072
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,082
Mother!
- How are you, son?

1073
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,278
Are you eating on time or not?

1074
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,021
Son, I'm worried about you.

1075
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,420
Mother, you don't worry about me.

1076
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:50,752
Father!
- I said that in an angry mood.

1077
01:15:51,197 --> 01:15:53,893
WiII you Ieave us for that?

1078
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:57,895
Your mother cries everyday
thinking about you, son.

1079
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:01,439
Your sister's marriage
is fixed, son. - Is it?

1080
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:05,107
I'II never scoId you,
I don't mind if you do nothing.

1081
01:16:05,278 --> 01:16:09,772
I'II earn weII, I'II conduct
sister's marriage grandIy myseIf.

1082
01:16:10,016 --> 01:16:13,179
I'II show to the worId
who Bujji is!

1083
01:16:19,358 --> 01:16:23,317

Go away from here.

1155

01:28:24,952 --> 01:28:27,614
Before guards see, get PC's body.

Get up!

1177

Keep his hand on steering

Nobody wiII get any doubt.

Start the car.

01:36:46,086 --> 01:36:49,214
I'm very happy today.

1244
01:36:49,422 --> 01:36:50,821
PIease cIose your eyes once.

1245
01:36:51,191 --> 01:36:53,056
Why shouId I cIose my eyes
if you're happy?

1246
01:36:53,259 --> 01:36:56,490
I must taIk here and
you must onIy Iisten. Okay?

1247
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,324
CIose your eyes.

1248
01:37:11,578 --> 01:37:12,875
How did you get it?

1249
01:37:13,246 --> 01:37:15,077
You said this was your Iife, right?

1250
01:37:15,715 --> 01:37:18,081
From now this is my Iife too.

1251
01:37:18,852 --> 01:37:19,648
Okay?

1252
01:37:34,334 --> 01:37:35,266
That is...

1253
01:37:37,804 --> 01:37:38,668
What?

1254
01:37:38,872 --> 01:37:39,896
Want me to drop you?

1255
01:37:40,273 --> 01:37:43,106
No need to take troubIe,
Vamsi is here.

1256
01:37:44,811 --> 01:37:47,336
Is he trying for you?

1257
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,113
Can I take on him?

1258
01:37:49,315 --> 01:37:51,783
No, he's not that worth.

1259
01:37:58,591 --> 01:38:01,560
Upstairs...I forgot my keys.

1260
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:17,573
Did you find it?

1261
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:25,140
What have you hidden in heart?

1262
01:38:25,351 --> 01:38:28,149
See properIy, it's you Sathya.

1263
01:38:38,064 --> 01:38:44,162
I met you in this happiness
and won over you...

1264
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,708
I spread my heart...

1265
01:38:51,945 --> 01:38:54,311
I forgot words...

1266
01:38:54,747 --> 01:39:00,708
Look at my faItering youth
and its struggIes...

1267
01:39:32,585 --> 01:39:33,279
Let my wishes and my breath
remain in your heart forever...

1268
01:39:33,653 --> 01:39:44,587
Let your mischievous thoughts
remain in my eyes Iike a dream...

1269
01:39:44,797 --> 01:39:52,363
Let our souIs and body
merge into one body...

1270
01:39:55,775 --> 01:40:03,204
Let happiness join and
stay with us aII our Iives...

1271
01:40:12,792 --> 01:40:13,383
Look!

1272
01:40:23,703 --> 01:40:24,795
What did you wish for?

1273
01:40:25,004 --> 01:40:26,232
What did you wish for?

1274
01:40:26,839 --> 01:40:28,306
Never ask secrets from girIs.

1275
01:40:28,675 --> 01:40:31,109
They Iadies first, right?
You teII me first.

1276
01:40:31,311 --> 01:40:34,303
I made a wish to be with you aIways.

1277
01:40:46,192 --> 01:40:48,251
Stop...stop it!

1278
01:40:48,461 --> 01:40:51,089
This marriage wiII not happen, no way!

1279
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:53,296
You come here.

1280
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:54,291
Father!

1281
01:40:57,837 --> 01:41:00,806
Don't stop the marriage
for shortage of dowry.

1282
01:41:01,007 --> 01:41:03,441
Don't ruin my daughter's Iife.

1283
01:41:04,143 --> 01:41:07,943
If you carry on Iike that,
won't you Iisten to my diaIogues?

1284
01:41:10,249 --> 01:41:13,218
Come on teII, as if you'II
give a deadIy performance.

1285
01:41:13,986 --> 01:41:14,782
Come on.

1286
01:41:15,755 --> 01:41:19,282
Hey you deIiver the diaIogues,
take out the paper and read the diaIogues.

1287
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,283
DeIiver!

1288
01:41:25,231 --> 01:41:26,858
Don't stamp my Ieg.

1289
01:41:27,734 --> 01:41:32,296
I didn't struggIe to get him educated
for your daughter to marry,

1290
01:41:32,505 --> 01:41:33,403
who wiII pay for it?

1291
01:41:33,773 --> 01:41:36,742
Why shouId I pay dowry for your son?

1292
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:40,809
I'm not a man who deIivers
diaIogues reading from paper bits.

1293
01:41:41,013 --> 01:41:42,810
Don't act too much.
- You wait.

1294
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:44,380
Father! Don't go.

1295
01:41:45,852 --> 01:41:47,444
Why are Ieaving the scene midway?

1296
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:50,152
I can't hoId on anymore, very urgent.

1297
01:41:51,357 --> 01:41:52,415
Who wiII teII the diaIogues then?

1298
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:57,422
If you want I'II deIiver it
from toiIet.

1299
01:41:57,797 --> 01:42:00,698
BIoody short man !

1300
01:42:01,534 --> 01:42:02,728
Why did he come?
- What's this?

1301
01:42:02,935 --> 01:42:05,426
Why did you come?
Are you going to pIay his part?

1302
01:42:05,805 --> 01:42:07,067
You keep quiet.

1303
01:42:07,807 --> 01:42:08,933
He's my father.

1304
01:42:09,809 --> 01:42:12,369
But if he comes.
- Don't confuse me.

1305
01:42:12,745 --> 01:42:16,272
Why confusion? I'm your mother.

1306
01:42:17,917 --> 01:42:21,353
What shouId I caII him now?

1307
01:42:21,554 --> 01:42:22,521
Father-in-Iaw or mother-in-Iaw?

1308
01:42:22,889 --> 01:42:28,191
What eIse wouId you caII wife's
mother other than mother-in-Iaw?

1309
01:42:28,394 --> 01:42:31,363
You wait.
- I'II deIiver my diaIogues.

1310
01:42:31,564 --> 01:42:33,930
Why shouId I pay him dowry?

1311
01:42:34,133 --> 01:42:39,298
Won't he have to spend for Iiving
comfortabIy after marriage?

1312
01:42:39,505 --> 01:42:44,169
Won't my daughter toiI in your house?

1313
01:42:44,377 --> 01:42:46,971
She'II do cooking,
washing utensiIs, cIothes...

1314
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,206
Don't act too much,
do you've to teII me everything?

1315
01:42:50,416 --> 01:42:54,546
If they've chiIdren,
she'II wash them.

1316
01:42:54,954 --> 01:42:57,479
Chicken on Sunday,
mutton on Tuesday,

1317
01:42:57,857 --> 01:43:02,123
by that way, you must...
- Father, I don't want to marry.

1318
01:43:02,462 --> 01:43:05,056
I hate men who take dowry.

1319
01:43:05,264 --> 01:43:07,755
I wouIdn't have agreed to marry
if I knew he wouId take dowry.

1320
01:43:07,967 --> 01:43:13,064
I wouIdn't have agreed!

1321
01:43:13,272 --> 01:43:16,867
You siIIy girI!
- You come here with me.

1322
01:43:17,977 --> 01:43:23,244
Father, I don't want dowry,
I Iike her very much.

1323
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:28,587
Whether anyone accepts or not,
I'II marry her onIy.

1324
01:43:29,989 --> 01:43:32,423
Priest, chant the hymns.

1325
01:43:36,295 --> 01:43:37,353
You Iike me?

1326
01:43:38,865 --> 01:43:43,029
You managed it weII,
what are you doing now?

1327
01:43:43,402 --> 01:43:44,130
Tie the knot.

1328
01:43:44,337 --> 01:43:45,599
ShaII I tie 3 knots?

1329
01:43:45,972 --> 01:43:52,434
I'm feeIing strange Iike in dreams...

1330
01:43:54,013 --> 01:44:04,548
It is good to enjoy...

1331
01:44:04,924 --> 01:44:10,294
It happened with you and me...

1332
01:44:16,903 --> 01:44:18,461
Hey you dramatist!

1333
01:44:20,907 --> 01:44:25,276
My sister is roaming with some guy,
have you become her pimp?

1334
01:44:25,478 --> 01:44:27,639
Hide Vamsi somewhere, go.
- Okay, uncIe.

1335
01:44:28,014 --> 01:44:29,641
Hey you bIoody!

1336
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:32,245
You're dead meat today.

1337
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:37,150
It seems he's pIaying hero roIes
and he's after my sister.

1338
01:44:38,524 --> 01:44:41,493
Sir, we don't know anything.

1339
01:44:42,628 --> 01:44:46,496
TeII me.
- We don't know anything.

1340
01:44:47,066 --> 01:44:52,333
She's doing her job sincereIy,
how dare you go after her!

1341
01:44:52,705 --> 01:44:55,173
I'II hack that bastard.

1342
01:44:59,545 --> 01:45:01,342
Not a hero of pIays,

1343
01:45:01,547 --> 01:45:05,677
you and that man are buffoons.

1344
01:45:10,156 --> 01:45:11,680
Where is Sathya?

1345
01:45:12,592 --> 01:45:13,957
Where is Sathya?

1346
01:45:19,265 --> 01:45:20,095
Brother!

1347
01:45:21,601 --> 01:45:22,533
Come.

1348
01:45:22,935 --> 01:45:23,367
Why did you shout now?

1349
01:45:23,569 --> 01:45:25,264
Come.
- I'II not come with you.

1350
01:45:25,471 --> 01:45:27,029
I'II not come.

1351
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:30,268
Try to understand me.
- Leave my hand.

1352
01:45:30,476 --> 01:45:32,034
Come.
- I'II not come.

1353
01:45:32,244 --> 01:45:33,711
Come I say!

1354
01:45:34,747 --> 01:45:35,213
Brother!

1355
01:45:35,414 --> 01:45:36,381
What is he doing here?

1356
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:38,382
Move!

1357
01:45:40,052 --> 01:45:40,984
Leave me!

1358
01:45:42,254 --> 01:45:43,050
Leave me.

1359
01:45:43,255 --> 01:45:44,381
Come.
- Where's Vamsi?

1360
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:47,485
Brother!

1361
01:45:50,596 --> 01:45:51,722
Come I say!

1362
01:45:55,501 --> 01:45:57,492
Brother-in-Iaw, he's here onIy.

1363
01:45:59,071 --> 01:46:05,943
You're my breath...
you're my thought...

1364
01:46:09,015 --> 01:46:12,951
She's roaming with a man on streets,

1365
01:46:13,152 --> 01:46:16,246
what the heII were you
doing sitting in home?

1366
01:46:16,455 --> 01:46:18,423
She's my sister.

1367
01:46:20,026 --> 01:46:22,187
You come and go
when you remember us.

1368
01:46:22,395 --> 01:46:23,327
Why are you bothered about sister?

1369
01:46:23,529 --> 01:46:25,429
Don't you've shame to cIaim that?
- Shut up!

1370
01:46:27,299 --> 01:46:31,099
You're forgetting that I'm your
husband, I'II rip out your skin.

1371
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:34,204
Stop! You'II Iose respect
if you dare beat her.

1372
01:46:34,407 --> 01:46:35,271
Get out!

1373
01:46:35,474 --> 01:46:37,601
Who gives you this courage?

1374
01:46:39,245 --> 01:46:44,308
Ask him to come, I'II settIe
the issue once for aII.

1375
01:46:44,517 --> 01:46:48,453
He's not a crook to fight
a crook Iike you.

1376
01:46:49,422 --> 01:46:50,980
He's a good man.

1377
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:53,181
Everyone is good to himseIf.

1378
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:57,621
I'm a very good man for myseIf.

1379
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:59,559
If I marry him,

1380
01:46:59,765 --> 01:47:05,067
nobody wouId caII me as thief's wife
Iike peopIe caIIed sister-in-Iaw.

1381
01:47:06,138 --> 01:47:10,802
Roam with anyone you Iike,
but must marry the man of my choice.

1382
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:13,201
I've seIected a rich man,

1383
01:47:13,345 --> 01:47:17,406
Iet anyone come, your marriage
wiII happen with him onIy.

1384
01:47:18,584 --> 01:47:19,482
Got it?

1385
01:47:19,685 --> 01:47:21,152
I'II die but not marry him.

1386
01:47:21,353 --> 01:47:23,378
You can marry him and then die.

1387
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:28,658
AII I want is money!

1388
01:47:32,765 --> 01:47:36,758
Your set up is very good!
BIoody famiIy of thieves.

1389
01:47:37,169 --> 01:47:39,228
Who is she? Your sister?

1390
01:47:40,506 --> 01:47:42,701
I'm sure she wouId've found
a thief onIy.

1391
01:47:44,543 --> 01:47:49,776
I smeIt about a robbery
in this area.

1392
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:51,741
Don't know why I suddenIy

1393
01:47:52,118 --> 01:47:55,849
Come, Iet's discuss IeisureIy

Come.

Buying me drinks?

1396
01:48:07,433 --> 01:48:10,061
Sister, ViIIain gave you this Ietter.

1397
01:48:12,772 --> 01:48:16,868
Sorry Sathya, though I was to forget,
past is fast catching up with me,

1398
01:48:19,145 --> 01:48:21,773
unabIe to teII you truth and
unabIe to avoid teIIing truth,

1399
01:48:22,148 --> 01:48:24,480
I know I'm going through heII,

1400
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:30,145
I didn't know what is happiness
before I met you,

1401
01:48:30,356 --> 01:48:32,722
After I met you I forgot
about pain and sorrows.

1402
01:48:36,195 --> 01:48:39,460
I'm not right choice for you,
but my Iove for you is true.

1403
01:48:40,633 --> 01:48:43,761
I shouIdn't do this
but I don't have choice.

1404
01:48:44,136 --> 01:48:45,569
I'm Ieaving this pIace.

1405
01:49:03,789 --> 01:49:04,756
Hastinapuram

1406
01:49:10,496 --> 01:49:11,861
I ran away Iike a coward.

1407
01:49:12,665 --> 01:49:14,758
But Maya wouId sureIy be
somewhere here onIy.

1408
01:49:15,668 --> 01:49:16,930
I'II not spare him.

1409
01:49:17,469 --> 01:49:23,271
How couId you thriII my heart
with your music?

1410
01:49:23,475 --> 01:49:28,879
Come fast hearing my pIeas...

1411
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:16,987
You Ieft me.

1412
01:50:17,363 --> 01:50:18,591
You've come now.

1413
01:50:18,797 --> 01:50:21,357
Are you here to see
if I'm dead or aIive?

1414
01:50:22,434 --> 01:50:24,664
Why did you Ieave me aIone?

1415
01:50:25,537 --> 01:50:28,438
I hate to see your face.

1416
01:50:28,607 --> 01:50:30,336
AII men are same.

1417
01:50:30,976 --> 01:50:32,500
You gain our trust and then betray.

1418
01:50:32,711 --> 01:50:33,769
PIease Iisten to me.

1419
01:50:33,979 --> 01:50:35,776
I'm not a cheat.
- Shut up!

1420
01:50:35,981 --> 01:50:39,007
Don't teII me anything,
I don't want to hear anything.

1421
01:50:39,618 --> 01:50:42,246
When my brother created
such a big scene,

1422
01:50:42,454 --> 01:50:47,721
you shouId've heId my hands
and toId him I'II marry her,

1423
01:50:47,927 --> 01:50:50,293
you ran away Iike a coward, right?

1424
01:50:51,497 --> 01:50:53,397
I'm ashamed of it, Vamsi.

1425
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:55,362
PIease Iisten to me.

1426
01:50:55,567 --> 01:50:57,228
Enough of getting cheated
Iistening to you.

1427
01:50:57,436 --> 01:50:59,028
I'II not Iisten, no!

1428
01:50:59,405 --> 01:51:01,873
AIIow me to teII, Sathya.
- I'II not Iisten.

1429
01:51:03,842 --> 01:51:06,037
I was in jaiI with your brother.
You know that?

1430
01:51:17,289 --> 01:51:21,453
EIder one! I found the boy!

1431
01:51:27,099 --> 01:51:28,066
Look there!

1432
01:51:29,001 --> 01:51:30,400
There...there...

1433
01:51:33,472 --> 01:51:34,700
KiII him...kiII him!

1434
01:51:36,675 --> 01:51:38,404
Are you here for money?

1435
01:51:39,278 --> 01:51:40,575
No, Sathya.

1436
01:51:40,779 --> 01:51:42,747
Don't Iie to me again.

1437
01:51:43,515 --> 01:51:46,484
My brother isn't just a thief,
he's a murderer too.

1438
01:51:47,019 --> 01:51:48,486
Are you aIso Iike him?

1439
01:51:49,054 --> 01:51:50,248
You want onIy money, right?

1440
01:51:50,456 --> 01:51:53,254
Take everything that's in
my home, Iive happiIy.

1441
01:51:53,492 --> 01:51:57,087
PIease Iisten to me.
I'm not here for money.

1442
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,988
Don't know how to teII you...

1443
01:52:01,233 --> 01:52:04,031
Sathya, I've changed, trust me.

1444
01:52:04,236 --> 01:52:07,330
That too after hearing about
your marriage, I couIdn't bear it.

1445
01:52:07,539 --> 01:52:09,234
Am I married?

1446
01:52:11,377 --> 01:52:13,106
This sacred thread was tied by you.

1447
01:52:14,079 --> 01:52:16,707
How couId you imagine I wouId
marry another man?

1448
01:52:17,449 --> 01:52:21,385
It may be a pIay to you
but it is reaI for me.

1449
01:52:21,587 --> 01:52:23,214
Go away, Vamsi.

1450
01:52:23,489 --> 01:52:24,513
Go away!

1451
01:52:57,489 --> 01:53:00,287
You're waste!
Why did you Ieave him?

1452
01:53:00,492 --> 01:53:02,084
You shouId've kiIIed him.

1453
01:53:03,362 --> 01:53:05,387
There's an advantage with gun.

1454
01:53:06,131 --> 01:53:07,655
When you press the trigger,
there's a big sound,

1455
01:53:07,866 --> 01:53:11,302
the sound wiII send
shivers down the spine.

1456
01:53:12,504 --> 01:53:14,563
He must know Fredricks is here.

1457
01:55:52,397 --> 01:55:52,954
Get up!

1458
01:55:53,332 --> 01:55:56,233
You can sIeep forever
after sometime.

1459
01:56:00,339 --> 01:56:02,239
Why are you rushing?

1460
01:56:05,611 --> 01:56:06,839
Where is Maya?

1461
01:56:08,013 --> 01:56:09,605
Where's the money?

1462
01:56:09,815 --> 01:56:12,477
She doesn't know anything.

1463
01:56:13,051 --> 01:56:14,518
Leave her.

1464
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,278
She has no connection to this.

1465
01:56:24,496 --> 01:56:28,227
You don't know about me
since you never saw me, right?

1466
01:56:28,433 --> 01:56:34,429
This is my punch,
one punch and you're dead.

1467
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:37,268
ReaIIy I don't know.
Leave us.

1468
01:56:37,476 --> 01:56:41,435
I want my money back if not
I'II shred you to pieces.

1469
01:56:43,682 --> 01:56:46,947
If my opinion Ieaving means kiIIing.

1470
01:56:47,653 --> 01:56:50,019
She's innocent, Ieave her.
Leave her.

1471
01:56:50,656 --> 01:56:55,821
How can she not know?
She's that crook's sister, right?

1472
01:56:57,562 --> 01:57:00,895
Get my money and take her.

1473
01:57:01,767 --> 01:57:04,065
I'm giving you 2 days time.

1474
01:57:04,536 --> 01:57:07,027
You know my hideout, right? Lanka!

1475
01:57:07,406 --> 01:57:08,703
EduruIanka!

1476
01:57:15,347 --> 01:57:16,507
Leave me!

1477
01:57:19,918 --> 01:57:20,885
I must save Sathya,

1478
01:57:21,086 --> 01:57:22,280
I don't have anyone other
than Sathya.

1479
01:57:22,487 --> 01:57:25,047
Where's money with me?
How do I know where Maya is?

1480
01:57:25,424 --> 01:57:27,324
Where is he?
Where?

1481
01:57:27,526 --> 01:57:30,359
He toId me to find,
did I miss anything?

1482
01:57:30,562 --> 01:57:33,395
How did Fredricks know Maya
is in Hastinapuram?

1483
01:57:33,598 --> 01:57:35,657
That oId hag wouId've toId him.

1484
01:57:36,468 --> 01:57:38,834
I'm sure Ranjit Kumar wouId've known
about this pIan from the beginning.

1485
01:57:39,037 --> 01:57:40,436
Master, poIice are here.

1486
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:42,664
I suspected something fishy
that day itseIf.

1487
01:57:43,575 --> 01:57:47,341
He's a crook, I'm sure they
both are hand in gIoves.

1488
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:49,808
How couId he come to my room?

1489
01:57:50,015 --> 01:57:51,573
I'm sure he wouId've toId him.

1490
01:57:51,783 --> 01:57:52,943
Did he find Maya?

1491
01:57:53,151 --> 01:57:54,846
Why did Fredricks shoot?

1492
01:57:55,087 --> 01:57:56,418
Why did he ask about money?

1493
01:57:56,621 --> 01:57:58,851
It means nobody has found Maya.

1494
01:58:00,592 --> 01:58:02,082
He wouId've pIanned it
from the beginning.

1495
01:58:02,461 --> 01:58:04,952
He brought a gun warning us
not to bring.

1496
01:58:05,163 --> 01:58:07,028
But stiII gun was empty!

1497
01:58:07,499 --> 01:58:10,764
It means he Ioaded it
without my knowIedge.

1498
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:12,869
He made the entire pIan.

1499
01:58:13,438 --> 01:58:16,464
I said Iet's cIimb from other side,
he said from transport buiIding.

1500
01:58:18,944 --> 01:58:21,037
I'm sure he wouId've hidden
it somewhere.

1501
01:58:21,413 --> 01:58:22,345
But how?

1502
01:58:22,547 --> 01:58:23,411
Where?

1503
01:58:23,615 --> 01:58:24,479
How couId he do it?

1504
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:26,414
Now I remember.

1505
01:58:26,618 --> 01:58:30,145
We went to buy bags, he wouId've bought
extra bags from the same shop.

1506
01:58:33,558 --> 01:58:35,116
How many bags do you've Iike this?

1507
01:58:36,128 --> 01:58:37,720
Three is enough, right?

1508
01:58:40,832 --> 01:58:42,163
Pay the biII.

1509
01:58:43,001 --> 01:58:45,663
Yes, which route did we
go to dump PC?

1510
01:58:46,071 --> 01:58:47,971
He wouId've escaped definiteIy
in that route onIy.

1511
01:58:48,173 --> 01:58:53,907
Moinabad! He toId us to parceI
gas cutters from Moin Brothers.

1512
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:57,806
Moinabad, Moin Brothers,
there's some connection.

1513
01:59:01,219 --> 01:59:04,655
When we took PC,
he went aIone for a minute,

1514
01:59:05,557 --> 01:59:07,582
he wouId've changed the bags then,

1515
01:59:20,138 --> 01:59:22,936
It means bags are in Moinabad.

1516
01:59:23,508 --> 01:59:25,032
Moin Brothers Cargo Company.

1517
01:59:26,144 --> 01:59:28,612
DefiniteIy money is stiII there onIy.

1518
01:59:44,262 --> 01:59:45,559
Where's my parceI?

1519
01:59:46,531 --> 01:59:48,795
Where's my parceI that
came from Hyderabad?

1520
01:59:49,134 --> 01:59:51,227
Your parceI, okay?
What's your name?

1521
01:59:51,603 --> 01:59:53,628
MayaIori Madan.
- MayaIori Madan?

1522
01:59:53,839 --> 01:59:56,467
The man who came two days ago,
was he Mayadari MaIIigadu?

1523
01:59:58,009 --> 02:00:01,809
He sent me, pIease teII me
where's the parceI?

1524
02:00:02,013 --> 02:00:04,140
We'II not deIiver to anyone
who comes here.

1525
02:00:08,053 --> 02:00:12,990
That's my parceI, teII me
if not you'II die in my hands.

1526
02:00:13,191 --> 02:00:15,591
KiII me! You've seen
how big the godown is!

1527
02:00:15,794 --> 02:00:17,056
It'II take 2 days to find it.

1528
02:00:17,262 --> 02:00:20,493
Get the LR, I'II get it
for you in 2 minutes.

1529
02:00:22,734 --> 02:00:28,263
If you teII him that I was here,
you're a dead man.

1530
02:00:53,665 --> 02:00:54,859
Are you fine?

1531
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:58,194
PIease turn and
show your handsome face.

1532
02:01:02,107 --> 02:01:05,770
Are you shocked to see me here?

1533
02:01:12,651 --> 02:01:14,676
You're a crook.

1534
02:01:15,353 --> 02:01:19,221
I'm a crook and
aIso a poIice officer.

1535
02:01:19,925 --> 02:01:23,554
It seems you're in Iove!

1536
02:01:24,095 --> 02:01:28,054
Can you dare take money and
save her when I'm here?

1537
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:33,737
She'II die anyway, give the money
to me and save your Iife.

1538
02:01:33,939 --> 02:01:37,568
If Sathya isn't there
then I'm aIso not there.

1539
02:01:37,809 --> 02:01:39,743
Go to heII!

1540
02:01:39,945 --> 02:01:40,741
Come on !

1541
02:01:43,648 --> 02:01:45,582
Where's he?
- He Ieft just now.

1542
02:01:56,761 --> 02:02:01,255
OnIy a crook knows about another crook.

1543
02:02:17,015 --> 02:02:18,607
Stop...stop...

1544
02:02:18,817 --> 02:02:20,785
PIease Iisten to me.
I don't have time.

1545
02:02:21,019 --> 02:02:22,646
He has taken Sathya to EduruIanka.

1546
02:02:22,854 --> 02:02:24,788
EduruIanka?
- Yes.

1547
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:30,622
Both Ieave it here,
you can't escape from here.

1548
02:02:30,862 --> 02:02:33,729
Hey crooks, I'm warning you
the Iast time,

1549
02:02:35,333 --> 02:02:37,358
Leave the money and

Vamsi, come...come.

02:02:50,949 --> 02:02:52,644
PIease stop...Iisten to me.

1553
02:02:53,685 --> 02:02:55,312
Maya, we must go away from here.

1554
02:02:55,687 --> 02:02:56,346
We don't have time,

02:02:56,721 --> 02:02:59,884
if we don't return the money
by morning, he'II kiII your sister.

1556
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:06,890
Who wants sister?

1557
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,827

My money...my money...

1563
02:03:48,273 --> 02:03:50,332
BIoody crook!

1564
02:03:51,209 --> 02:03:53,074
You wanted to me, right?

1565
02:03:53,678 --> 02:03:57,341
You became a crook after
becoming a poIice officer,

1566
02:03:57,649 --> 02:04:00,345
I'm a born criminaI!

1567
02:04:01,453 --> 02:04:05,583
I'm a crook!

1568
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:25,441
Body is tiII thirst ends...

1569
02:04:27,412 --> 02:04:30,848
Lightning is tiII darkness onIy...

1570
02:04:33,384 --> 02:04:37,445
Listen to the truth of Iife's secret...

1571
02:04:39,357 --> 02:04:43,259
Turns and twists are
Iessons of Iife...

1572
02:04:56,374 --> 02:05:06,409
As my Iove you chiseIIed
my heart as you desired...

1573
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:19,321
My heart Ioves you...

1574
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:31,393
Time wiII not to now...

1575
02:06:31,603 --> 02:06:37,564
It'II not teach you moraIs...

1576
02:06:37,775 --> 02:06:40,437
A crime has thrown you far away...

1577
02:06:40,645 --> 02:06:43,478
It hurt your heart and
seething with revenge...

1578
02:06:43,681 --> 02:06:48,948
Sky, water and earth are aII mine...

1579
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:55,184
Youth has decIared a war
and raising a war cry...

1580
02:06:56,895 --> 02:06:58,760
Hey you bastard!

1581
02:06:59,330 --> 02:07:01,264
Brother, he's here.

1582
02:07:01,966 --> 02:07:03,763
KiII him, brother!

1583
02:07:11,476 --> 02:07:12,943
KiII him...kiII him!

1584
02:07:20,518 --> 02:07:24,784
To puII the trigger
you don't need great courage,

1585
02:07:25,056 --> 02:07:26,990
any kid can do it,

1586
02:07:27,458 --> 02:07:29,289
if you're a gun, use it,

1587
02:07:29,494 --> 02:07:31,394
if you're a reaI man,
throw it and come.

1588
02:07:32,997 --> 02:07:34,794
Come, Iet's settIe it today.

1589
02:07:41,372 --> 02:07:42,304
Come on !

1590
02:07:54,752 --> 02:07:56,310
You said something, right?

1591
02:07:57,555 --> 02:07:58,419
Come on !

1592
02:08:36,027 --> 02:08:37,858
Don't Ieave him...kiII him!

1593
02:08:45,069 --> 02:08:46,058
Get up!

1594
02:08:47,739 --> 02:08:48,865
KiII him!

1595
02:09:07,759 --> 02:09:08,885
What did you wish for?

1596
02:09:10,061 --> 02:09:12,393
I wished to die in you Iap.

1597
02:09:57,141 --> 02:09:59,439
Why are you throwing sand on me?

1598
02:09:59,644 --> 02:10:02,044
Who said I'm not a crook?

1599
02:10:03,014 --> 02:10:04,675
I'm a crook!

1600
02:10:32,577 --> 02:10:34,636
One who wishes to Iive wiII die in fear.

1601
02:10:35,713 --> 02:10:41,151
One who decides to die wiII kiII
the other man before dying.

1602
02:10:45,022 --> 02:10:46,649
EIder one!

1603
02:11:25,663 --> 02:11:29,531
You aIways thought I was
a viIIain, it is true.

1604
02:11:31,235 --> 02:11:33,533
I'm a reaI viIIain.

1605
02:11:34,972 --> 02:11:37,941
No Vamsi...no...

1606
02:11:38,643 --> 02:11:41,043
You're aIways a hero to me.

1607
02:11:45,516 --> 02:11:45,982
Come.

1608
02:11:54,292 --> 02:11:57,284
Did you fight that day for him?

1609
02:11:57,662 --> 02:12:01,063
When you said my sister is in
troubIe, I thought something eIse.

1610
02:12:01,265 --> 02:12:04,291
You paid me in my own coin.

1611
02:12:04,669 --> 02:12:07,570
How can a thief's sister
become a Iady?

1612
02:12:07,772 --> 02:12:08,898
Where's my money?

1613
02:12:09,307 --> 02:12:12,799
I want Sathya not money.

1614
02:12:14,645 --> 02:12:17,773
Take her...Ieave the money behind.

1615
02:12:17,982 --> 02:12:18,744
Take her away!

1616
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:21,510
I'm ashamed to be your sister.

1617
02:12:21,719 --> 02:12:24,244
You've made brother's
reIationship meaningIess.

1618
02:12:24,622 --> 02:12:27,147
You want money, right?
- Yes.

1619
02:12:27,358 --> 02:12:28,689
Come, I'II show you.

1620
02:12:34,298 --> 02:12:35,287
Take it.

1621
02:12:36,801 --> 02:12:40,293
What are you Iooking at?
This is my money.

1622
02:12:40,771 --> 02:12:41,999
Mine!

1623
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:44,604
Never again show up before me.

1624
02:12:44,875 --> 02:12:45,933
Go!

1625
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:49,609
You toId me you'II go away
with her, right?

1626
02:12:50,014 --> 02:12:51,106
Go away!

1627
02:13:15,673 --> 02:13:19,109
I'II give you a Iakh,
take that boat aIso.

1628
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:21,301
Rs.1 Iakh? Okay sir.

1629
02:13:21,946 --> 02:13:22,674
Start the engine.

1630
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:25,872
You're damn Iucky, you crook.

1631
02:13:27,785 --> 02:13:28,877
Go quickIy.

1632
02:13:40,398 --> 02:13:41,660
I'm tired, Sathya.

1633
02:13:45,102 --> 02:13:47,161
I'm tired after running aII my Iife.

1634
02:13:48,372 --> 02:13:49,361
Enough !

1635
02:13:56,747 --> 02:13:58,271
I've hidden something from you.

1636
02:13:59,717 --> 02:14:01,685
It's my money.

1637
02:14:03,287 --> 02:14:05,812
You bIoody crook!

1638
02:14:19,103 --> 02:14:23,039
My name is Koti, you crook!
