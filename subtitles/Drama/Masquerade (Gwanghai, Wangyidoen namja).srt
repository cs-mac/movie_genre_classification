00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,199
Ja Soo, you

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,269
realize the gravity of this matter
but still you utter nonsense?!

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,260
The importance of this
I comprehend better than you.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,450
But I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,309
Something swept over sideways,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,940
and suddenly he disappeared.

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,069
He could not have left the palace yet.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,749
I will call the guards,

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,010
so you find your own way out.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,709
It would be wise

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,869
to place all the blame on him instead.

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,200
Otherwise, how would it be possible
to capture him in this huge palace?

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,889
This is impossible, Eunuch.

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,900
What are you doing?
Hurry and disappear!

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,989
I thought he was just a weak scholar.

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,390
What magic did he use?

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,930
Excuse me.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,939
What's your role?

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,730
Which role will you be playing?

22
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,840
Ah.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,259
I'm also one of the actors in this drama.

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,009
Queen In Hyun.

25
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm the one and only Queen In Hyun.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,989
You haven't heard yet, right?

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,790
It was decided just a while ago.

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,050
30 minutes ago.

29
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,349
It actually hasn't been publicly announced
yet, so I shouldn't be telling you.

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,799
But I'm so happy, I can't stop myself.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,849
You're the only one who knows.

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,059
Ah, please have this.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,840
I bought some snacks for the staff.

34
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,680
You don't like donuts?

35
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,200
Excuse me.

36
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,040
Are you not an actor from this drama?

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,670
Excuse me.

38
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,670
Are you all right?

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,900
Wait.

40
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,099
Maiden, do you know...?

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,989
What?

42
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,840
...if I am dead or dreaming?

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,130
What?

44
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,289
Are you asking
because you sincerely want to know?

45
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,330
I am asking...

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,699
because I sincerely want to know.

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,899
Then don't get angry.

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,229
I'm saying this because
you asked me for an answer.

49
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,219
To me...

50
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,770
you're not dead or dreaming,

51
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,940
but you do seem a little off.

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,780
No,

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,779
you just look like that.

54
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,239
I'm not saying
that you're actually a little off.

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,939
Um... It looks like you don't
understand my joke.

56
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,549
What I mean is that's how
strange your question is.

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,379
What I said wasn't serious.

58
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,339
Choi Hee Jin?

59
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,059
Yes?

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,409
The director asked you to wait 10 minutes.

61
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,760
Okay, I'll be right here.

62
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,500
Hm?

63
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,049
What's this?

64
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,189
He looked normal.

65
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,450
He's really crazy.

66
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,699
Shi, do, tong, rae,
(Time, path, connect, come,)

67
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,110
gan, pil, gu, in
(space, must, rescue, man)

68
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,499
<i>Who dares</i>

69
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,779
<i>use a sword in the palace?</i>

70
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,999
This is clearly a conspiracy!

71
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,290
You must certainly find who the man is.

72
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,730
I am sure he has yet to leave the palace.

73
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,309
Give me my sword.

74
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,509
Lord of Doctrines,

75
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,440
something unforeseen
has occurred in the palace.

76
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:23,829
There is an order that no one is
allowed to leave the palace.

77
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,199
I cannot leave?

78
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,559
For now, you must wait here...

79
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,379
I did not wear my official uniform,
yet you let me enter the palace.

80
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,510
If others were to know about this,

81
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,589
then you will be chased out of the palace
without being able to utter a word!

82
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,140
Pardon?

83
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,309
Lord, you said it was an order, so...

84
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,779
We were doing it for your sake...

85
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,079
I do not want to hear any excuses.
Do not tell anyone I was here tonight.

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,310
Hand me my sword!

87
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,669
Whoever asks, do not say you saw me tonight.

88
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,439
That is the only way you will live.
Do you understand?

89
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,190
Yes.

90
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:59,147
<i>Your Highness, congratulations.</i>

91
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:01,328
Cheers!

92
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:10,437
Congratulations on your enthronement.

93
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:15,827
May you continue to do well, Your Highness.

94
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,917
Thank you, Court Lady Jo.

95
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,107
If Your Highness is successful,

96
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,827
don't you think Soo Kyung
will attain success too?

97
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:27,397
I knew this day would come one day,
so I have invested everything in you.

98
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:31,908
However, it has been a weary journey.

99
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:37,547
The fact that you and I would hit the
jackpot is a will by the heavens.

100
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:40,757
From now on,
we will continue to move forward.

101
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:43,467
You are correct, Your Highness.

102
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:44,477
Let us drink to that.

103
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:45,997
Let's do it in English.

104
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,628
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

105
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,488
Wow!

106
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:57,667
Who knew that this could happen?

107
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,047
You were never casted for supporting roles,

108
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:02,557
so how did you manage to
become the lead in one try?

109
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:03,547
Amazing!

110
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,197
You're ridiculous.

111
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,447
You said that if Han Dong Min was Sukjong,

112
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:07,857
if is best if I don't do it.

113
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:08,938
Now that I have the lead,
you're that happy?

114
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,167
Hey.

115
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:12,627
That was only to comfort you.

116
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,517
It's even better if it's Han Dong Min!

117
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:16,287
Truthfully speaking, he is a bit of an ass,

118
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,147
but we need to go along with him

119
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:20,517
to make money.

120
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:24,668
The current trend is Han Dong Min!

121
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,057
It's all right if I don't
make money right away.

122
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:30,677
I'm just starting out.

123
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,617
Don't think about using him.
I don't want that.

124
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:36,018
You sure know how to joke, Your Highness.

125
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,997
First of all, it's great you got the role,

126
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:41,517
but in the future, you need to get
intensive training from me.

127
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:44,227
All this while, you were half unemployed,
which is why I took care of you.

128
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:47,488
Now, get ready.

129
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,618
Here, here, eat this also.

130
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:54,946
Who is it at this time of night?

131
00:08:58,749 --> 00:08:59,762
Who is it?

132
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:00,796
<i>Is it you, Soo Kyung?</i>

133
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:02,418
Who are you?

134
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,499
<i>It's Dong Min oppa.</i>

135
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,989
Who?

136
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:09,105
- Hey, it's Han Dong Min!
- What?!

137
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh my!

138
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,349
It really is Dong Min oppa!

139
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,506
Hi.

140
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,271
Long time no see.

141
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,242
What brings you here at this time?

142
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,386
Hee Jin is ignoring my calls.

143
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,856
I have something to talk to her about.

144
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,122
What?

145
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:28,382
What...?

146
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:31,822
The director said he wants to give
Queen In Hyun's role to Hee Jin,

147
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:34,789
but I'm a little worried.

148
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,472
What?

149
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:41,622
What is it?

150
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,669
What are they talking about?

151
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,607
Why is he here, huh?

152
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,217
He is using an unthinkable method.

153
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,318
What?

154
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,835
He says he doesn't like the fact
that you're Queen In Hyun.

155
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:59,399
What do we do?

156
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:01,984
That man is unbelievable till the end!

157
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,333
Wait, the director, chief,
and president all chose me;

158
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,264
so who is he to say
whether he likes me or not?

159
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,925
Hey, that's not exactly the case...

160
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:12,154
If it's Han Dong Min,
he has a say in who his partner will be.

161
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:14,389
If he insists that it can't be you,

162
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,095
then the problem becomes serious.

163
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:18,812
First, start by talking to him.

164
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,910
He said he called, but you ignored him.

165
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,808
- Go out, hurry, hurry!
- What am I supposed to say to him?

166
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,845
Did I go to audition knowing that
Han Dong Min was Sukjong?

167
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,284
Why do I need his permission?

168
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,044
Who is he?

169
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,533
He's the king.

170
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,900
Jeez.

171
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:57,749
I didn't think you'd still be living here.

172
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,219
Looks like you haven't saved up any money.

173
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,271
Where's the flower pot I bought you?

174
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,349
My signature was on it.

175
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,232
If I still had a present from
a cheating ex-boyfriend,

176
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,389
doesn't that make me a crazy girl?

177
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:13,734
You, how can you ignore me?

178
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:15,807
When was our relationship one where
I came out when you told me to?

179
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,279
We had no contact for 2 years,

180
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,110
so isn't this a bit ridiculous?

181
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,095
For me,

182
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,655
Queen In Hyun being a newbie is okay

183
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,941
and being my ex-girlfriend is
not a big deal either.

184
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:26,435
Then why are you being an obstacle?

185
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,014
In the end, it's your lack of acting
skills that worries me.

186
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:29,468
What?

187
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:30,838
Everyone knows you for your bad acting.

188
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,096
Oh my! That was from so long ago!

189
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:36,007
Didn't you see me earlier?
Everyone was praising me.

190
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:38,057
That short scene...
By memorizing it endlessly,

191
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:39,616
anyone can do it well.

192
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,893
Do you think you can deal with a
50-episode historical drama?

193
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:44,181
In no time,
your bad acting will get the better of you.

194
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:46,039
I am not the old Choi Hee Jin.

195
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,500
- Will Choi Hee Jin go anywhere-
- So?

196
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:50,114
Are you saying you're going to fire me?

197
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,216
I'm going to determine
that after seeing you.

198
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,415
Here.

199
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,909
I told the Director that I'd decide
after seeing if we're in tune.

200
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,496
Look at page 78.

201
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:02,036
Are you telling me to act right now?

202
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:05,155
If you act alone,
it's awkward, so I'll act with you.

203
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,154
This is too much!

204
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,337
- Even if you are the main actor-
- Hurry.

205
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,630
I'm also a busy person.

206
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:15,022
People are waiting for me downstairs.

207
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,477
I'm starting.

208
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:22,835
Why not criticize my hastiness earlier?

209
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:25,693
Why are you always enduring?

210
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,242
Queen.

211
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,505
Queen.

212
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:33,146
Hurry and give me an answer, Queen.

213
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,628
I...

214
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:39,951
was ignorant,
so I was unable to grasp the opportunity,

215
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:44,204
please blame my ignorance for everything.

216
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:48,669
Was it really because you were
unable to find the right timing

217
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,988
or did you pretend to not know?

218
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:51,222
How could I?

219
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:54,260
I am a sinner, Your Majesty.

220
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,508
Come here.

221
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,505
[Unable to go over]
Come here.

222
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,654
Didn't I tell you to come here?

223
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:01,886
If my Queen will not come,

224
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:04,375
must I go to you?

225
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,888
What are you doing? Don't come.
Just read the script.

226
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,727
Should we see each other again?

227
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:12,185
What did you say?

228
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:13,994
What about meeting again?

229
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:15,426
That entertainment program you watch,

230
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,394
there are no scandals about me lately,
right?

231
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,014
I have no one right now.

232
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:22,160
This is all your fault.

233
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:23,979
Actually, since earlier,

234
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,082
the image of you stripping
has been stuck in my head,

235
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,571
so how could I focus on acting?

236
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,885
Looks like you still see me as a fool.

237
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,106
I think we're in tune.

238
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,377
Okay. I like it.

239
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:44,864
You pass.

240
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,960
That bastard!

241
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,502
Hey, you ass...!

242
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:03,836
Hyung, start the car.

243
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:04,553
What are you doing?

244
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:06,390
Hurry. Hurry.

245
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,302
You really!

246
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:15,793
Choi Hee Jin!

247
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,448
Queen In Hyun is yours!

248
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:18,735
What did you say?

249
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:22,148
Queen In Hyun is yours!

250
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:24,369
Even if you don't appoint me,

251
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,783
Queen In Hyun was mine!

252
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,243
How irritating!

253
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,746
Hey, what are you doing?

254
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,345
We haven't signed the contract yet,

255
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:39,691
and you're already entering the actress'
house to create a scandal?

256
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,512
Hyung.

257
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,464
Hyung, it's been a while since
I've felt my heart flutter.

258
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:45,930
What?

259
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:47,933
Stop fluttering.

260
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:50,946
Every time you say your heart flutters,
I break out in a cold sweat.

261
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,920
I remember the past.

262
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:55,117
Those were the best.

263
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,337
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

264
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,022
Why did he leave so quickly?

265
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,616
I'm speechless, really.

266
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,344
What did he say?

267
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:10,918
I was completely fooled.

268
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:14,108
I really should report him to the police.

269
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,659
He thinks I'm still the old Choi Hee Jin.

270
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,542
He's got another thing coming!

271
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,473
What are you saying?
Did something happen?

272
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:56,084
They say fortune and misfortune
come together. Seriously.

273
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:04,246
You don't like donuts?

274
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:07,175
But, who is he?

275
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,397
He didn't seem like an actor.

276
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:10,384
Do you happen to know...

277
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:14,461
if I am dead or dreaming?

278
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,672
Yeah, the way he talked was weird too.

279
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:22,443
He spoke in a completely historical way.

280
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:26,588
He must have gone crazy because he really
wanted to be an actor but couldn't.

281
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:30,974
That's why he comes to the shoot and
wears those clothes and says lines.

282
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:36,156
That's awful. Awful.

283
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:43,251
<i>We have searched every
possible hiding place,</i>

284
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,766
but he was not there.

285
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:45,613
Furthermore,

286
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:48,144
we have observed the movements
of the Seo-in* (*Western faction)

287
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:51,413
but it seems as if no one is
aware of this incident.

288
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:52,688
In other words,

289
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,103
the officer alone contrived such a bold act?

290
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,173
Don't you believe it was His Majesty's wish?

291
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:03,770
His Majesty is using
this competition as an excuse

292
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:07,318
to view the friction between the factions.

293
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,564
He is...

294
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:11,334
acting according to His Majesty's orders...

295
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,440
surely.

296
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:16,297
But letting go of Kim Boong Do was unwise.

297
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:19,875
He too lost his family members, did he not?

298
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:22,596
<i>The criminals shall consume poison.</i>

299
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:25,177
<i>Oh my!</i>

300
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,083
<i>What is this?</i>

301
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:27,350
<i>My Lady!</i>

302
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,405
<i>My Lady!</i>

303
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:30,619
<i>Please awaken, My Lady!</i>

304
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:43,584
<i>Oh my. Oh my! My Lady!</i>

305
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:44,899
<i>My Lady!</i>

306
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,935
After that,

307
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:48,526
it is evident
that he has been plotting revenge.

308
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:53,331
How can a scholar be so
exceptional in martial arts?

309
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,565
His actions are His Majesty's orders...

310
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:01,602
His Majesty wants to attack me first...

311
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:03,036
My Lord,

312
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:04,262
it is Ja Soo.

313
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,648
Enter.

314
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,680
Do you have any new information?

315
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,906
Yes.

316
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,807
While investigating the people
with relations to Kim Boong Do,

317
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,849
we found an unexpected person.

318
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,573
Unexpected person?

319
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:23,348
Who is that?

320
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:38,376
<i>The path of time bridges to the future,</i>

321
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:41,605
<i>that gap must certainly save man.</i>

322
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:51,541
How are you feeling?

323
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,868
I am well.

324
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:59,951
Forgive me for always troubling you.

325
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,525
You never cease to startle me.

326
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:04,954
When Yoon Wol worried for you,
I thought she was overreacting.

327
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:07,993
I have something I wanted to ask you.

328
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,116
This talisman that Yoon Wol gave me,

329
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,728
what exactly does it mean?

330
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:20,151
The path of time bridges to the future,

331
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,521
that gap must certainly save man.

332
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,882
It is a brilliant verse.

333
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,752
A brilliant verse...

334
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:29,818
I am unsure.

335
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,120
It is Master who wrote this.

336
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,383
He has gone to Bohyunsa Temple.

337
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:36,307
Yes.

338
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,170
But,

339
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,442
why are you interested in the talisman?

340
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,660
I must confess that I experienced
a very strange event.

341
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,844
A strange event?

342
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:55,311
<i>At first, I thought I had died,
but I was not dead.</i>

343
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,894
<i>After that, I thought I was dreaming,
but I was not.</i>

344
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:07,041
<i>...gan pil gu in.
(space, must, save, man)</i>

345
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,574
I had not fallen asleep and I was fine,

346
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:17,306
so how would I explain this?

347
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:18,929
It is a strange event.

348
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,660
The things I saw were very strange and new,

349
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:23,912
so they would not leave my mind.

350
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:25,427
Even so, I am envious of you.

351
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,729
Perhaps, you saw the immortal world.

352
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,705
Although it was brief,

353
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,898
it seems you saw a fairy there as well.

354
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,464
A fairy?

355
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,377
I am curious as to why you laugh.

356
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:39,917
I did meet a woman,

357
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,781
but her appearance was...

358
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,756
I could not have met a fairy.

359
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:49,843
She must not be.

360
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,995
If a fairy really looks like that,

361
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,228
then the immortal world is not immortal.

362
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:57,417
Even if you do not speak in detail,
I understand.

363
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,859
I will leave once it gets dark.

364
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:02,121
Please take care of your body.

365
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:04,852
You must think of your family.

366
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,293
I do this because of my family.

367
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:09,525
You have already experienced many things.

368
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:10,731
In any case,

369
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:12,674
it seems this talisman saved my life,

370
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:14,927
so I must keep it safe.

371
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:17,986
As you have said, after experiencing a lot,

372
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:20,587
it feels as if anything may happen,

373
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:23,737
and nothing can be trusted.

374
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:26,138
To Yoon Wol...

375
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:29,068
I will not tell her you have come.
Please do not worry.

376
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:30,702
If she knew you were wounded,

377
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:34,241
she may ask for a hundred talismans
to give to you.

378
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,214
Yoon Wol.

379
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,445
Oh my.

380
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,648
Your Excellency.

381
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,079
Without any notice, what brings you here?

382
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,932
I have been too busy,

383
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:29,092
thus I have been unable to see you.

384
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:32,021
I have missed your voice.

385
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,138
My Lord.

386
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:36,307
Yes, what song were you playing?

387
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:38,331
Let us hear it.

388
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:40,866
Do you know Kim Boong Do?

389
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:46,027
Pardon?

390
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:49,356
Do you not know Officer Kim Boong Do
of Hongmungwan?

391
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:53,223
Officer of Hongmungwan?

392
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:55,386
Oh!

393
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,095
I believe I have seen him a few times.

394
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:02,361
He came with his superiors a few times.

395
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:04,883
You are skilled at lying.

396
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:06,347
Pardon?

397
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:07,493
I heard,

398
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:11,381
you were the slave girl of
Kim Boong Do's late wife.

399
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,716
I learned today that you have
a deep relationship with him.

400
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:18,087
That...

401
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,870
is incorrect.

402
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:22,084
You were misinformed.

403
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:24,166
A slave girl?

404
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,149
We were unable to execute a murder

405
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,933
because of you.

406
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,926
It is unimaginable.

407
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,321
You have misunderstood, Your Excellency.

408
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,856
I do not know where you heard such words.

409
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:36,852
Had I known earlier that I had
a traitor in my household,

410
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:40,660
I would not have given you any affection.

411
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:47,495
You are a crafty witch!

412
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:48,422
Come in!

413
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:50,147
Yes!

414
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:53,475
Your Excellency, My Lord!

415
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:54,850
Tie her up!

416
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:56,265
Yes!

417
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:57,471
Why are you doing this?

418
00:24:57,472 --> 00:24:59,843
In order to capture Kim Boong Do,
I must capture you first.

419
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:04,766
I heard that he placed you here when
you were on the brink of death.

420
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:07,307
As he cherishes you very much,

421
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:10,368
he will certainly come to find you,
is that not so?

422
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:12,250
That is a misunderstanding.

423
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:13,177
I was just a slave girl.

424
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,220
Who would care for me?

425
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,941
This is an unthinkable
misunderstanding, My Lord!

426
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:19,975
My Lord!

427
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:28,594
We have imprisoned her as you have ordered

428
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:30,956
and told the servants to keep an eye on her.

429
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:33,019
She did not resist?

430
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,674
Yes.

431
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,684
You can leave.

432
00:26:05,508 --> 00:26:08,926
<i>His Royal Majesty has arrived.</i>

433
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,529
Exactly how many days has this been?

434
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,522
Did those criminals

435
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:20,914
still not admit to their treacheries?

436
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:22,559
Your Majesty,

437
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,010
among them, please show Kim Boong Do
special leniency.

438
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:29,873
What do you mean by that?

439
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:31,687
There is no doubt

440
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:36,112
that he was unaware of his father's crime.

441
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:37,218
As it stands,

442
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:39,371
his whole household has
received just punishment.

443
00:26:39,372 --> 00:26:43,288
Kim Boong Do is their only son.

444
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:45,938
Please have compassion on their lineage

445
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:49,227
and grant him an unconditional pardon.

446
00:26:49,228 --> 00:26:50,652
Do you really...

447
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:51,918
mean what you say?

448
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,427
I am sincere, Your Majesty.

449
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,840
Why did you let him live?

450
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:05,522
Such a useless act!

451
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:08,849
Your Majesty,

452
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,427
Kim Boong Do is one of His Majesty's
most favored officers.

453
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:14,729
If he were to be exiled as well,

454
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,430
His Majesty will pity him
well after punishing him.

455
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,825
Your Highness,

456
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:25,552
please understand His Majesty's intentions
and sympathize with him.

457
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:29,867
Would that not be compassion
most befitting of Your Highness?

458
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:34,222
It will be of great help in changing
the people's minds.

459
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:35,926
Will it really be like that?

460
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:39,992
A fatherless Kim Boong Do is
a bird without wings.

461
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:43,271
Giving him an official position out of view

462
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:47,666
will show the fairness
and tolerance of the court.

463
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:52,001
There is nothing he can
accomplish on his own.

464
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:55,749
Please do not worry.

465
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:08,924
This is all...

466
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:11,295
a result of your kindness.

467
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:13,737
One day,

468
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:15,490
I will return your favor.

469
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:18,840
There is no need to call it grace.

470
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,764
<i>After that,</i>

471
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:35,223
<i>it is evident
that he has been plotting revenge.</i>

472
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:41,043
<i>How can a scholar be so
exceptional in martial arts?</i>

473
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:45,568
What a foolish ignorant man.

474
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,119
Stop.

475
00:29:18,794 --> 00:29:20,566
Does it not please you?

476
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,739
Then, I shall prepare another song.

477
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,978
From the first time I saw you
at the gisaeng house,

478
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:29,726
I found your face to be oddly familiar.

479
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,207
Where is your hometown?

480
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,546
That is...

481
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,063
for a lowly gisaeng with no true roots,

482
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:45,462
could I have a hometown?

483
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:51,530
After hearing your response,
you are quite humorous.

484
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:53,443
Oddly familiar.

485
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:58,207
Isn't that a trick
used by youths 19 years of age?

486
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,712
With you in front of me,

487
00:29:59,713 --> 00:30:03,550
I feel as if have become
a student 19 years of age.

488
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:08,901
Come closer and pour me a drink.

489
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,771
Oh, this girl!

490
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:41,837
How dare a gisaeng be shy?

491
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:43,441
Forgive me.

492
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,062
Because I am in front of
a man of such high status,

493
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:48,057
I was flustered.

494
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:00,882
Being old is my sin.

495
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:03,753
I have become slow-witted.

496
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,904
Repulsive brats,

497
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:14,545
how dare you!

498
00:31:29,494 --> 00:31:32,494
Monk! Monk!

499
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,363
What brings you here?

500
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:36,439
Miss Yoon Wol,

501
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,984
Miss Yoon Wol has been captured!

502
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:39,279
What should we do?

503
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,206
What did you say?

504
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,948
Did you just say Yoon Wol has been captured?

505
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:45,249
Lord of Doctrines!

506
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,385
Who did it?

507
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,558
Everyone is searching for you!

508
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,491
That is why Miss Yoon Wol was captured.

509
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,474
They did not know that you were here.

510
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:53,451
Who did it?

511
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:55,892
Is it the Right State Councilor?

512
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:56,799
What about the letter?

513
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,447
Pardon?

514
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,792
They will be searching for something.

515
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,656
Have they found anything?

516
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:02,001
I do not know.

517
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:04,852
They said you had it.

518
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:14,338
<i>This is your ringtone.
This is your ringtone.</i>

519
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,654
Hello?

520
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:18,768
Yeah, I'll be taking pictures soon.

521
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:20,214
Did Yoon Na Jung come yet?

522
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:21,191
No, not yet.

523
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:22,438
Jeez.

524
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:26,150
Why won't they tell us what she's wearing?

525
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:28,395
Are they competing with us?

526
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:31,578
No way! Does she have no one else to compete
with that she is competing with me?

527
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:34,011
If Consort Jang is Queen In Hyun's rival,

528
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:36,845
then you and Yoon Na Jung are rivals too.

529
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:39,818
Does becoming a star
depend only on experience?

530
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:41,234
I don't know. I have to worry about myself.

531
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:43,050
I don't have time to worry
about other people.

532
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:45,895
I'm so nervous.

533
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:47,900
<i>Yoon Na Jung is here.</i>

534
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,306
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Make sure you properly greet her.</i>

535
00:32:49,307 --> 00:32:51,121
They say her attitude is no joke.

536
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:52,628
I'm hanging up.

537
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:54,834
Hello.

538
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:04,261
I can sit here, right?

539
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:06,307
What? Oh...

540
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:12,304
I will go over there.

541
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,103
Um, please accept my greeting.

542
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,397
Hello. I am Choi Hee Jin.

543
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:25,712
I will be Queen In Hyun.

544
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,438
Miss Hee Jin,

545
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,262
please come over here.

546
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,154
She must be very tired.

547
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:47,651
Here.

548
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,231
Look a bit into the distance.

549
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:54,315
Look far into the distance again.

550
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:55,612
Look farther with your eyes.

551
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,768
Passionately.

552
00:33:57,888 --> 00:33:59,333
All right.

553
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:02,318
Excuse me, Queen In Hyun, please come in.

554
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,181
Oh, my wife.

555
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:09,180
Okay, I'll be taking pictures.

556
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,108
Queen In Hyun, smile a bit.

557
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:12,614
Okay, I'm shooting.

558
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,406
Queen In Hyun,

559
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,132
lean into Sukjong's shoulder.

560
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,989
Yes.

561
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,528
More naturally.

562
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:24,884
Yes.

563
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:27,448
My Queen, why are you being so shy?

564
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,073
Come closer.

565
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:34,522
I'll start shooting now.

566
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,712
For me, this is the first time
I eagerly waited for a shoot.

567
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:40,707
You know we'll be filming
together every day.

568
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,351
I just need to endure it
until the 25th episode.

569
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:44,378
The 25th episode?

570
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:46,684
The scene where Queen In Hyun
gets stripped of her title.

571
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,308
After that,
there's no need to film together.

572
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:53,397
Writer, since this is the new Consort Jang,

573
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:55,084
how about going a bit trendy?

574
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:57,998
Like this or like this?

575
00:34:58,048 --> 00:34:59,454
Or V?

576
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:01,700
V, V, V?

577
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:05,370
Both of you are done.

578
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,815
Consort Jang, please come here.

579
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:11,127
Ugh.

580
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:12,913
See you later.

581
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:17,972
Has Your Highness arrived?

582
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:26,940
What is this?

583
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,436
Is she trying to mess with me?

584
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:30,981
Both of you, please stand close.

585
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,469
Since you are rivals,

586
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,004
I think a cut with your backs
facing each other will be good.

587
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,759
Queen In Hyun,
please turn to the other side also.

588
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,845
Hold on a moment. Lights...

589
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:52,391
You must be happy about becoming
the lead so easily.

590
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:53,249
What?

591
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,502
After waking up, you're already a lead.

592
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:57,958
It's fun, right?

593
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:01,769
What are you talking about?

594
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,841
Do you even think or not?

595
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,625
If someone treats you well,

596
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:10,848
you should think about why.

597
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:13,772
I'm taking the shot.
Please don't move.

598
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:17,233
Excuse me,

599
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:19,887
please explain so I can understand.

600
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,294
We've only met,
why are you saying such things?

601
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:23,378
What do you think I'm saying?

602
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:26,352
You're an idiot, so you're annoying me.

603
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,858
Please don't turn your heads.

604
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:31,052
Just stare at each other.

605
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:36,080
Did you greet her well?

606
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:38,166
What did she say?

607
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:40,130
It didn't start off well.

608
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,425
What? Why?

609
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:45,339
I think it's going to be
difficult to work with her.

610
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:47,882
See. What did I say?

611
00:36:47,883 --> 00:36:49,209
She is competing with you.

612
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,053
It's competing for a lead,
so there's no senior or junior.

613
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:56,024
This is not just competing.

614
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:57,600
Then?

615
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:15,699
Hello, I am Pak Se Il, the host of the
New Consort Jang press conference.

616
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,194
On such a beautiful afternoon,

617
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,117
I am happy to greet the reporters
here at the palace.

618
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:20,995
I feel very honored.

619
00:37:20,996 --> 00:37:24,317
10 minutes later, we will officially
start the press conference.

620
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:29,267
Before that,
let's have a look at the trailers.

621
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,669
[New Consort Jang]

622
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,259
Hello.

623
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:39,533
Hold on a moment.

624
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,456
Hello.

625
00:37:44,522 --> 00:37:47,723
Whoo, wow.

626
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,568
Don't fall while going on stage.

627
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:51,294
You're used to falling down.

628
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:53,090
Did you say anything to anyone?

629
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:53,998
About what?

630
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,475
By any chance,

631
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:57,679
did you get involved with the audition?
So I would get selected?

632
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,152
Didn't I tell you Queen In Hyun is yours?

633
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,805
Originally, the percentage was similar,

634
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:06,280
so I helped them make the decision.

635
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:07,228
Kid,

636
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:08,944
I have that much of an influence.

637
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:10,999
Who told you to help? Who?

638
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,877
Hey!

639
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:14,011
Like you said, the levels must be similar

640
00:38:14,012 --> 00:38:16,686
so the fans don't complain.

641
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,395
I'll make you more famous than Na Jung,

642
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:23,051
just wait and see.

643
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,149
Dong Min.

644
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,816
Yes.

645
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:30,664
Hee Jin, we have to finish up,
so please come here quickly.

646
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:37,637
Don't tremble.

647
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:38,954
I'm not trembling.

648
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:42,078
But you are trembling.

649
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:23,302
I still have about 10 minutes
before it starts, right?

650
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:27,401
Hey, where are you going?

651
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:29,137
For a walk...

652
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:31,633
I'm too nervous.

653
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:37,618
Why is she such a wimp?

654
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,588
Get a hold of yourself, Choi Hee Jin.

655
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:44,352
How did you get this opportunity?

656
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:46,668
Think about it later.

657
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:50,758
Now is not the time to think about this.

658
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:01,304
What's this? Why is it so windy suddenly?

659
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:35,544
Did you get hurt?

660
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,710
Seeing as I have met you twice,

661
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,486
it is clear this is not a dream.

662
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:05,753
This...

663
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,080
is fake blood, right?

664
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,105
You're currently filming, right?

665
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,932
Right?

666
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:17,008
What is this "filming" you are referring to?

667
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:20,648
Last time, Maiden,
you said I seemed a little off.

668
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:22,874
I did not understand,
so I thought carefully.

669
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:27,094
Does it not mean the same as food being
spoiled and that I am not of sane mind?

670
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,818
Is that what it means?

671
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,438
Yes, what other meaning would it have...?

672
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:35,615
If so, then Maiden, you are incorrect.

673
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:37,539
I am not crazy.

674
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,014
Death I must rule out, so I am not dead.

675
00:41:40,015 --> 00:41:44,644
I am not dead or dreaming.
I am not crazy as you have said.

676
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,948
Where am I?

677
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:54,360
<i>We have introduced the director.</i>

678
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:55,547
<i>Following that,</i>

679
00:41:55,548 --> 00:41:57,234
<i>it is time to introduce the cast.</i>

680
00:41:57,235 --> 00:41:59,259
Han Dong Min, this side please.

681
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,544
<i>This drama's title role...</i>

682
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:03,069
<i>Our country's famous actor...</i>

683
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,337
Next is Choi Hee Jin.

684
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:05,625
Yes.

685
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:09,026
Why isn't she coming?

686
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,783
Did Choi Hee Jin go somewhere?

687
00:42:10,813 --> 00:42:14,833
- Hold on a moment. Hold on a moment.
<i>- Introducing Yoon Na Jung.</i>

688
00:42:27,424 --> 00:42:28,979
Choi Hee Jin. Find Choi Hee Jin!

689
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,596
- Hold on a moment.
<i>- Next is...</i>

690
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:32,861
- Is that girl crazy?
<i>- the man who is in a love triangle...</i>

691
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,546
<i>with Queen In Hyun and Consort Jang...
Our drama's hero.</i>

692
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:36,093
Find Choi Hee Jin quickly!

693
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:38,159
<i>I think we'll have to get ready
just in case she doesn't come.</i>

694
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,555
<i>I think he will make a handsome king.</i>

695
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,011
<i>Sukjong's role...</i>

696
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:43,606
<i>Han Dong Min!</i>

697
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,677
<i>Look over here!</i>

698
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:52,994
<i>A little brighter!</i>

699
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:54,091
<i>Look here!</i>

700
00:42:54,092 --> 00:42:56,906
<i>Here! Here! Here! Here!</i>

701
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:05,635
Next is the final lead who is involved
In the love triangle with these two.

702
00:43:05,636 --> 00:43:07,281
Giving us a fresh look,

703
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:10,095
a new face...

704
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,507
Oh, wait.

705
00:43:17,508 --> 00:43:18,944
Just a moment.

706
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:20,870
What is this?

707
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,384
What's wrong with her now?

708
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:37,142
Ah, she's really such a troublemaker.

709
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:42,788
Then...

710
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:46,022
this person is dead?

711
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:48,385
He is really dead?

712
00:43:48,386 --> 00:43:50,411
Did I not question you first?

713
00:43:50,412 --> 00:43:52,656
Where exactly is this place?

714
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:16,969
Did you see that?

715
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,560
I myself cannot comprehend what
I have seen with my own eyes.

716
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:23,764
Is this by any chance something
that happens often here?

717
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:25,510
No.

718
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:29,539

<i>I thought he was just a scholar,</i>

726
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,885
<i>but he has extraordinary skills.</i>

727
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,748
<i>There was no body, not even a trace.</i>

728
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:54,880
<i>The Kim Boong Do I know
has always been like this.</i>

729
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:57,644
<i>- His nature is despicable-
- You are slanderous!</i>

730
00:44:57,645 --> 00:45:00,917
<i>How many years has passed since
Joseon Sukjong's reign?</i>

731
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:04,419
<i>From about 300 years ago,
he is a person from Joseon.</i>

732
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,623
<i>He came here through time travel.</i>

733
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:07,431
<i>That's not possible.</i>

734
00:45:07,432 --> 00:45:09,806
<i>Are you asking me to believe that?</i>

735
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,350
<i>I am quickly losing my mind.</i>

736
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:14,505
<i>I think she still likes me.</i>

737
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,790
<i>She's not as cool as I thought she was.</i>

738
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,805
<i>A person like you is an actress too!</i>

739
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:21,380
<i>Do I have to look at you
and say my lines with you?</i>

740
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:23,177
<i>Why are you doing this?!</i>

741
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:28,534
<i>Why am I being attacked
when I don't know what I did?</i>
