1
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,654
He had this stack
of Gilbert and Sullivan records...

2
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:06,785
that just sat there next to a broken turntable
he never bothered to fix.

3
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,352
He said he didn't have to,
because he could close his eyes...

4
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:15,528
and hear the entire score
of <i>Pinafore</i> whenever he wanted to.

5
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,698
I told him I could too,
and I didn't have to close my eyes.

6
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,708
That made him smile,
and he put his arm around me...

7
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,404
and we sat there
and sang it together.

8
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,470
We slept together the day we met.

9
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,775
Or... maybe it was the day after.

10
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,613
Who remembers?

11
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,351
I remember actually.

12
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,329
I held back for a day,
because, well—

13
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,764
because I wanted something
to look forward to, I guess.

14
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,325
When I first met him,
he was wearing...

15
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:53,669
a brown corduroy jacket
with elbow patches and wingtip shoes.

16
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,405
God, he really oversold tradition.

17
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,846
About a week later,
I found a package outside my door.

18
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,941
It was a...

19
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,283
first edition of poems
by Rupert Brooke.

20
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,789
None of this
"Ode on a Grecian Urn"...

21
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,883
"My candle burns at both ends."

22
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,862
This was Rupert Brooke.

23
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,196
We wanted a baby someday, and I knew
I would have to name him Rupert.

24
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,635
I really had to push myself.

25
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,674
I really did want it
to work though— I think.

26
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,710
I mean—

27
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,613
You know, I've still got that stack
of goddamn Gilbert and Sullivan records.

28
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,387
He's gonna need someone.
I don't think he'll make it alone.

29
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,583
It's good to be alone again.

30
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,149
I can have the whole
bowl of popcorn to myself.

31
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,661
I feel helpless.

32
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,822
I would like to call him.

33
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,835
No more phone calls.

34
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,337
No more excuses.

35
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,406
I'm free.

36
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,740
Damn you, Zack!
Damn all your integrity.

37
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,075
I might call Zack sometime...

38
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,240
and give him back his records.

39
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,514
What do I need with a stack
of Gilbert and Sullivan records?

40
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,012
<i>- He found the key.</i>
- Oh. Good. I hope he likes it.

41
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,108
- Well?
- It's not bad.

42
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,846
- Oh!
- I love it!

43
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,048
- I'll get the papers!
- Wait a minute, Lila. Not so fast.

44
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,557
<i>- Let's go through it.</i>
- Okay. Wow. It's so big.

45
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,992
- You scared me.
- It's beautiful.

46
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,360
It has everything
we've been looking for.

47
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,889
And it is so underpriced for today's market.
Don't you think so, Doctor?

48
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,335
Well, talk to my wife, Lila.
She's the big executive. She makes all the money.

49
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,237
It is a perfect location.
I mean, you have a view from every window.

50
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,867
It is the ideal
young married couple's home.

51
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,571
It's so traditional,
but so contemporary.

52
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,671
You've got your
indoor-outdoor feeling...

53
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,080
your quiet, relaxed atmosphere.

54
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,243
I find this room captivating...

55
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,344
particularly the P&G floors.

56
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,651
- P&G floors?
- Peg and groove.

57
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,919
Aha! Oh, great chandelier.

58
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,223
- I know. I know.
- Oh, Claire, I love these beams.

59
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,729
Have you ever seen a house
with a layout like this before?

60
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,822
Really, have you ever seen a house
with a layout like this?

61
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,094
- Oh! Right here. Perfect! The piano.
- Yes.

62
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,193
- Perfect—with the light.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

63
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,172
- Okay, where are we gonna
put the couch from New Haven?
- Uh, right there.

64
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,675
- Right in that corner.
- Great. And you know what?

65
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,372
- What?
- This wall will be perfect...

66
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,437
for the prints
that we got on our honeymoon.

67
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,745
Yeah!
Wait.

68
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,014
- What?
- What are we doing?
You know how much this place costs?

69
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,715
Lila, would you excuse us
for just a minute? Hmm?

70
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,621
- Come with me.
- What?

71
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,422
- This will do it.
- What?

72
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:05,363
- Ta-da!
- You finally found a fireplace
in the bedroom, huh?

73
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,866
- These are great tiles.
It's everything we've been talking about.
- I know.

74
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,426
<i>Claire.! The tile.!</i>
<i>Show him the tile in the bathroom.!</i>

75
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,939
Okay, Zack.
What do you think, really, huh?

76
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,305
- Can we do it?
- No.

77
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,436
- I just don't think we can afford it.
- Oh, look, come on.

78
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,538
You can think of something.

79
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,606
We could economize
in other areas.

80
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:27,120
Look. Who needs three meals a day, right?
And we could walk to work.

81
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,883
I mean, I know we'd have to get up
at 4:00 in the morning...

82
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,447
but just think how thin we'll be.

83
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,756
Mm.

84
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,093
All right. I know you're right.
We have to be sensible.

85
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,224
Yep.

86
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,569
Damn.

87
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,266
Never find another house
with a fireplace in the bedroom.

88
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,331
Would you settle
for an extra blanket...

89
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,071
and an all-night hug?

90
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:56,445
Ohh. You two look
so perfect together in this house.

91
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,349
I just know you'll have
a long, happy life here.

92
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,081
- We can't do it.
- You're a tough act to turn down...

93
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,350
but I'm afraid
you're gonna have to keep looking.

94
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,858
I gotta get back. I have one more patient.
I'll see you later.

95
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,988
Bye. I'm sorry.

96
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:15,000
Why do we always think
it can never happen to us?

97
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,696
Arlene, will you do me a favor?

98
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,831
Will you?

99
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,774
Will you let me
make the diagnosis? Hmm?

100
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,507
You haven't even been biopsied.

101
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,015
Maybe I can join a circus sideshow.

102
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,278
Oh, now, now, now.

103
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,346
Let's get some fresh air.
Come on. I'll walk you to your car.

104
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,988
Okay?

105
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,053
You know,
if this happened to Claire...

106
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,895
I think it would
bring us closer than ever.

107
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,060
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

108
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,628
We would know that every time
we made love, I was making love to her...

109
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,697
that her body, no matter what...

110
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,300
was the only body
I wanted to hold.

111
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,368
Do you mean that?

112
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,347
Arlene, it may be benign.

113
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,043
But if we have to operate...

114
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,485
I think old Harry is gonna feel more needed
than he's felt in 20 years.

115
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:14,015
- You really think so?
- Yeah, I really do.

116
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,565
Now I know why women fall in love
with their doctors.

117
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,638
- We're getting the house!
- Zack, really?

118
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,808
I can't live without P&G floors.

119
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,943
Oh, you!

120
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,112
- You sure? Huh? You sure?
- I'm sure! Mm-hmm.

121
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,622
- Oh!
- Oh, my dears, I'm sorry.

122
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,125
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
- Oh! Winnie, it's okay.

123
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,890
- No. Come on in.
- I only just brought back the Hemingway
for Claire.

124
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,330
- Ahh.
- Winnie, Zack said we're getting the house.

125
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,163
- What?
- Zack said we're getting the house!

126
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,673
Ohh. Oh, my dear, but that's splendid!

127
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,732
Oh, that's lovely.

128
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,903
<i>- That's wonderful.</i>
- Winnie.

129
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,607
Winnie, we will still
be over for dinner every Tuesday.

130
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,115
Yes, of course.
It was foolish of me...

131
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,153
to think that you'd
stay here forever.

132
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,348
I suppose I got used to you living upstairs.

133
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,951
Hmm. Well, I hope you realize...

134
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:59,192
that you're going to miss some of my stories
about Lawrence Hayden-Ford...

135
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:03,703
the one Romantic poet
that Rupert Brooke held in high esteem.

136
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,262
Oh, Winnie, then you must sit down
and tell us one right now.

137
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,436
And spoil
that delicious anticipation?

138
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,344
No.

139
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,906
Well, I suppose it was time...

140
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,578
for a new coat of paint.

141
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,155
Remember.

142
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,421
There's great fortitude
in these old walls.

143
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,620
Right?

144
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,835
Well, we—we could ask her
to move in with us.

145
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:45,003
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Yeah. There's that extra
little room right on the side.

146
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,069
No, I love her too.

147
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,614
But that room is for Rupert.

148
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:57,314
- Since we're getting the house—
- Uh-huh.

149
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,381
- What do you think—
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,484
Mm-hmm?

151
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,995
- Mm.
- Mmm. Did you just have a cookie?

152
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,396
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm!

153
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,016
You awake?

154
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,717
Yeah.

155
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,419
Can we buy a new house
every week?

156
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,760
Zack, what is it?

157
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,295
Nothing.

158
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,168
One of my patients.

159
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,281
All right. Clear back. Switch.

160
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,149
All right!

161
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,462
- Get in!
- Ah!

162
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,002
All right!

163
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,664
<i>Take that, Zack.! Drive 'em.!</i>

164
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,276
Hey! Over here!

165
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,403
<i>- Good shot.</i>

166
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,908
- Hey, Ben.
- Mm-hmm?

167
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,851
I was talking to Alan Baker the other day.
You'll never guess who he ran into.

168
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,787
- Who?
- Maxine DeMarco.

169
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,121
She used to drive up from Bridgeport
every weekend, take on the whole dorm.

170
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,785
Ah, but she made these
great oatmeal cookies.

171
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,852
Yeah, Charlie. What'd we call her?
Betty Crocker!

172
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,797
What's the difference? A meal's a meal.

173
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,857
Geez. Nobody grows up anymore.

174
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,960
It's a lost art, Charlie.

175
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,665
- Your game was a little off tonight.
- Yeah, I know.

176
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,765
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,833
I'm just wiped out, that's all.

178
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,936
We just moved
into the new house this week.

179
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:04,040
- Man, the giris are waiting for us.
- All right! I'm coming!

180
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,096
Hey. I like these guys.

181
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,724
- Hi.
- Are you next?

182
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,432
I'm gonna get up on that stage
and I'm gonna sing my heart out.

183
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,374
- And they're gonna like me, I just know they are.
- All right.

184
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,003
- I hope they do.
- That's the spirit, kid. Get right up there.

185
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,010
And now our final contestant—
from Chatsworth.

186
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:19,616
<i>- All right.!</i>
- Let's have a big hand for Lucie Lee Prescott!

187
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,160
<i>Okay. Good luck.!</i>

188
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,808
# It's easier to sing a sad song #

189
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,111
#Than it is to just walk away #

190
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,277
<i>Take a walk.!</i>

191
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,757
<i>- Get off!</i>
<i>- Get off, honey.!</i>

192
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,099
- She's hopeless.
- She's trying.

193
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,937
<i>Go home.!</i>

194
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:16,175
<i>Aw. Well, well, well.</i>

195
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,419
<i>It ain't hard to guess</i>
<i>who's gonna be taking home...</i>

196
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,421
that booby prize tonight,
is it, folks?

197
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,016
But you keep practicing, honey,
and come back real soon.

198
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,653
- We can do worse than that.
<i>- Let's award the first prize</i>—

199
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,596
- Oh! Wait a minute!
- Oh, no! No, no, no!

200
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,498
- No, no.
<i>- Warm up your hands. Get ready for these folks.</i>

201
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,196
<i>Now, where's</i>—
<i>Oh, now, what's going on here, folks?</i>

202
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,035
- We want to enter the contest.
- Well, what can I call you?

203
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,132
- Uh, Captain.
- And Buttercup.

204
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,440
All right, folks. Looks like we got
one more final contestant here...

205
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,812
so let's really hear it now
for the Captain and li'I Buttercup.

206
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,977
- What do you wanna do?
- <i>Pinafore.</i>

207
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,381
Ahhh.

208
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,622
Very good. Very good.

209
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,530
<i> Oh, no.!</i>

210
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,663
- Get 'em off!
- Come on!

211
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,331
Shit.

212
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,841
They don't like us any better.

213
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:30,355
Well, it looks like Lucie Lee ain't gonna be
taking home that booby prize after all.

214
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,419
<i>More left hand, Zack.! More left</i>—

215
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,963
## </i>

216
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,873
<i>- Hi, Mag. 271.</i>

217
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,919
- Where is the bathroom?
- That way. The room with the toilet in it.

218
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,080
I keep forgetting. Of course!

219
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,282
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- Yeah.

220
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,383
Okay. Thank you.

221
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,054
You got four calls
from Arlene Powers.

222
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,927
- Huh?
- Who's Arlene Powers?

223
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,024
Oh.

224
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,695
She's the woman
that had the mastectomy.

225
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,332
Four?

226
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,839
Arlene? Dr. Elliot.

227
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,481
Arlene. Arlene, settle down.

228
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,782
Stay right there.
I'll be over in 10 minutes.

229
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,113
Damn it!

230
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,091
Her husband left her.

231
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,063
That night in bed, he stayed so close
to the edge, I thought he was gonna fall off.

232
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,363
I must've lost my knack, huh?

233
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,664
<i>Huh, Doc?</i>

234
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,832
What do you think?

235
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,741
You think I lost my knack?
You think that's what did it?

236
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,110
What do you think? Oh, shut up!
I don't need your false comfort!

237
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:06,584
<i>Why didn't you level with me in the first place?</i>
<i>Why did you get my hopes up?</i>

238
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,023
Damn!

239
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,899
- Howdy. Where you headed?
- I'm on my way home.

240
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,963
Wanna stop by for a drink?

241
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,968
Hop in.

242
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,840
- Name is Ken.
- Frank.

243
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,976
How you doin'?

244
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,748
I live two blocks from here.

245
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,321
Hey. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Uh—

246
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,057
I'm sorry.

247
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,330
- I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

248
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,338
Okay. Some other time, huh?

249
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,467
Catch you around.

250
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,574
Mm.

251
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,778
- Hi.
- Hi.

252
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,327
<i>"Don't look at me like that, darling."</i>

253
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,735
Darling, don't look at me like that.

254
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,830
- Close.
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,932
"Why didn't you tell me?"

256
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,137
- Why didn't you tell me?
<i>- "If it had to be one of us</i>—

257
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,340
<i>- If it had to happen to one of us</i>—
- "Why'd it have to be you?"

258
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,508
<i>- Why did it have to be you?</i>
<i>- "Did</i> it have to be you."

259
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,677
Ohhh.

260
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,778
<i>"It was nobody's fault but my own."</i>

261
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,846
It was nobody's fault but my own.

262
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,619
"I was looking up."

263
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,684
I was looking up.

264
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,787
- "It was the nearest"—
- "It was the closest— nearest thing to heaven."

265
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,855
It was the nearest thing to heaven.

266
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,866
- "You were there."
- You were there.

267
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,962
- Oh, darling.
<i>- "Don't</i>— <i>Don't worry, darling."</i>

268
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,029
Don't— Don't worry, darling.

269
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,701
- If you can paint—
- "If you can paint...

270
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,802
- I can walk."
- I can walk.

271
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,313
- Anything—
- "Anything's possible, don't you think so?"

272
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,042
- Yes, darling.
- "Yes, darling."

273
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,812
<i>- "Yes, yes."</i>
- Yes, yes.

274
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,047
<i>I love that movie.</i>

275
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:36,052
Mm.

276
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,200
<i> The great love of my life</i>
<i>was Melanie Franklin.</i>

277
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,001
<i>She was the only other person I know who</i>
<i>could sit through six movies in one day.</i>

278
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,702
We would start about 2:00 in the afternoon
and go through the night.

279
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,078
I wanted to marry her.

280
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,616
She wanted to go to grad school.

281
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:04,013
<i>I could never understand</i>
<i>why she picked school over me.</i>

282
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,354
<i>Well, I mean,</i>
<i>now I can, I suppose, but</i>—

283
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,156
<i>Anyway, it took me a while</i>
<i>to get over it.</i>

284
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:16,591
<i>I still haven't found anyone like her,</i>
<i>even with all the movie freaks around.</i>

285
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:25,903
<i>You know, I sometimes wonder</i>
<i>what my life would be like today...</i>

286
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,412
<i>if she had said yes.</i>

287
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,081
<i>Oh, what the hell.</i>
<i>Why wonder? I'm happy.</i>

288
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,748
<i>There's a lot to be said</i>
<i>for being single.</i>

289
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,803
Hey, Danny. Hey, Danny!

290
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,739
- Did you get that part?
- Oh, they tell me Tuesday.

291
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,799
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

292
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,937
Hey.

293
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:04,278
- Hey! I thought you were gonna call.
- It's been a rough week.

294
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,784
- Next week, huh?
- Yeah, sure.

295
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,746
- Hey, Michael. How you doing?
- Hi.

296
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,053
Can I have a light beer, Pete?

297
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,320
Tsk. I'm doing lousy.

298
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,419
What's the matter?

299
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,556
See that number in the corner
over there— in the red?

300
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:23,625
I've been cruising him for about an hour,
and he won't even look at me.

301
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,001
<i>Hey, what are you wasting</i>
<i>your time on that guy for?</i>

302
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,940
<i>Hey, Michael, you look great.</i>
<i>You gotta move around though.</i>

303
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,035
So, get going.

304
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,287
Bart, you're still coming
to the party on the 15th, right?

305
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,415
- Right.
- Okay.

306
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,126
- What's going on?
- Not much.

307
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,371
- My name's Bart.
- I'm Timmy.

308
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,576
- How come you won't spend the night?
- Maybe next time.

309
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,416
What kind of stuff do you write?

310
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,182
I don't know.
All different kinds of stuff.

311
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,656
- Anything I've heard of?
- Probably not.

312
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,928
You know what I could
go for right now?

313
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,330
A big fat hamburger with chili sauce.

314
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,097
- You wanna go get one?
- You're crazy.

315
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,331
<i>You know what time it is?</i>

316
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,398
Can we get together again?

317
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,670
Why not?

318
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,807
Let me give you my number.

319
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,388
Will you call?

320
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,121
Sure.

321
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,619
<i> There was this guy</i>
<i>at Columbia</i>— <i>the college, not the studio.</i>

322
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,425
<i>And he was something</i>
<i>of a legend with women.</i>

323
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,899
<i>And he used to score</i>
<i>five nights out of the week...</i>

324
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,596
<i>with the most beautiful coeds on campus.</i>

325
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,662
<i>A different one every night.</i>

326
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,809
Mm.

327
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,339
<i> The only thing was,</i>
<i>he wasn't particularly good-looking.</i>

328
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,946
<i>And, uh, I know he wasn't rich.</i>

329
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,958
<i>And word had it</i>
<i>that he was even a little, uh...</i>

330
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,052
<i>shall we say, "short-changed"?</i>

331
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,868
<i>When will you be back?</i>

332
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,935
<i>I don't know.</i>

333
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,507
Maybe never.

334
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,015
Tell me about the Raintree.

335
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,284
- Where did you hear about that?
- You think you'll ever find it?

336
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,053
<i>You don't think it's a joke?</i>

337
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,561
<i>Well, then finally one day...</i>

338
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,894
<i>someone went up to him and asked him</i>
<i>how he got away with it.</i>

339
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,493
<i>I mean, what he had that</i>
<i>no one else seemed to have.</i>

340
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,061
And he looked him
right in the eye...

341
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,574
and he said, very proudly...

342
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,937
"Imagination."

343
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,981
Ah. Mr. McGuire. I'm Dr. Elliot.
What can I do for you?

344
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,318
- Where's Dr. Bloom?
- He's on vacation. I'm covering for him.

345
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,585
That's funny.
They didn't tell me that when I called.

346
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,321
Well, we like surprises, Mr. McGuire.

347
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,590
What's with this "Mr. McGuire"?

348
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,326
- How old are you anyway?
- I'm 30.

349
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,028
- A 30-year-old doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,264
Ah. Dr. Jekyll or Dr. Dolittle.

351
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,034
Now, those guys were doctors.

352
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,099
So, what can we
do for you today?

353
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,202
Oh. I'm just here
for a little checkup.

354
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,737
Ah. Well, come on around the table.
Just sit here on the end.

355
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,908
You can leave your jacket
right here.

356
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,212
Well, it says here on your chart...

357
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,723
you just had a complete physical
four months ago.

358
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,782
I like to be on the safe side.

359
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,920
Ah. Well, has anything changed
since you were here last?

360
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,226
Any new symptoms
that I should know about?

361
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,529
No. Matter of fact,
I feel pretty good.

362
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,592
Okay. Well, we'll just take a look.

363
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,763
Careful, McGuire. That is not a toy.

364
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,801
Hey, Doc. I can't hear anything.

365
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,338
Maybe they're right.
Maybe I don't have a heart.

366
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,979
- Doctors— they bring out the best in me.
- Yeah, I can see that.

367
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,286
Would you turn to the right, please?

368
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,816
Okay. Very good.

369
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,988
And to the left.

370
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,290
That's fine.

371
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,831
Now, look straight ahead.

372
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,930
Just, uh, pick a spot on the wall...

373
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,441
and don't look directly
at the light, okay?

374
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,500
Straight ahead now.

375
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,012
I read your first book.

376
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:13,074
- Straight ahead<i>. Final Reunion.</i>
That was your first book, wasn't it?
- That's right.

377
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,814
- Good tough writing.
- Thanks, Doc.

378
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,857
I've been meaning to read the others.
Open up now.

379
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,950
And give me an "Ahhh."

380
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,587
- Ahhh.
- Thank you.

381
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,823
Okay. Roll up this sleeve.

382
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,391
- What for?
- I'm just gonna take your blood pressure.

383
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,834
Really, I feel pretty good, Doc.

384
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,000
- I swim about a mile every day.
- Oh, yeah?

385
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,704
Take lots of vitamins,
don't eat any fried foods.

386
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,009
Look at that stomach.
Hard as a rock.

387
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:47,211
- That's great. You do any drugs?
- Why, you got any to sell?

388
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,345
Very funny.

389
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:52,390
Actually, I'm very conscious
about not fucking up my system.

390
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,359
I'll smoke a little dope once in a while.

391
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,741
Maybe a line or two of coke.

392
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:59,055
Maybe a line or two of coke.

393
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,690
A Quaalude or two now and then.

394
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,791
Maybe a Percodan once in a while.

395
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,166
A little acid.

396
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:10,264
But if you mean am I <i>into</i> drugs,
no way.

397
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,372
Okay. You can roll
the sleeve down now.

398
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,638
- Hey, Doc.
- Mm-hmm?

399
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,309
As long as I'm here, could you
take a look at something over here?

400
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:23,876
- Sure.
- This is something I saw the other night.

401
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,389
Uh, it's sorta swollen up,
and it hasn't gone away.

402
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,857
- See that right there?
- Yep.

403
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:31,827
- It's a tumor, isn't it?
- No. It's not a tumor.

404
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:34,524
- Lymph node?
- An ingrown hair.

405
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,589
Are you sure it's not a tumor, Doc?

406
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,034
Well, if you'd like, I could call in
Dr. Dolittle for a second opinion.

407
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,504
You mean it can just
swell up like that?

408
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:44,666
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

409
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,404
Go home and write.

410
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,038
Great. No more anxiety.

411
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,548
How am I supposed
to get through the rest of the day?

412
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:56,017
- Just have a long lunch.
- Who eats lunch?

413
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,681
Well, I do,
and I'd like to get out of here.

414
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,949
As a matter of fact,
I am feeling kinda hungry.

415
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,559
<i>- You from New York?</i>
<i>- Queens.</i>

416
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,898
<i>That's where people from the Bronx go</i>
<i>when they wanna move to the country.</i>

417
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,961
<i>How long you been out here?</i>

418
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,473
I came out
after I graduated Columbia.

419
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,874
I figured as long as I had to suffer,
I might as well get a tan.

420
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,205
The bun's not gonna kill you,
you know.

421
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:27,910
- White flour— poison.
- Mm.

422
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:31,443
It's not white flour.
Seven-grain stone-ground wheat.

423
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,320
Gimme a break, Doc.

424
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,293
If I say this is poison,
this is poison.

425
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,320
You see a shrink?

426
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,231
- What is that, a question or a suggestion?
- Mm.

427
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,828
So, tell me about you and your wife.
How long you been married?

428
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:52,301
- Eight years.
- Got any kids?

429
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:55,504
- No, not yet.
- That's a long time to wait.

430
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:59,015
Well, we—we wanted
to get our careers going first.

431
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,483
What about you?
You, uh—You see anyone?

432
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,850
Sure. I see a lot of people.

433
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,751
- Eight years, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,025
Hmm.

435
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,259
The money for these cookies
will help send needy children to camp.

436
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:18,358
Please help us out.
Please, friends.

437
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,870
<i>Hey.! What's the matter</i>
<i>with you people?</i>

438
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,998
- Can't you see this poor girl
is asking for your help?

439
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,100
Are you gonna let her down?

440
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,372
Is that the American way?

441
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,778
Come on. Dig into those pockets!

442
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,284
Send these kids to camp!
Send this girl here home with a smile!

443
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:36,979
<i>Come on.! Fork it over.!</i>

444
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:41,787
<i>Thanks a lot, big shot.</i>
<i>You just lost me two customers.</i>

445
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,794
<i>Why don't you stick around?</i>
<i>Maybe you'll scare off the rest of the city.</i>

446
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,226
Hey. Come on in here.
I wanna show you something.

447
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,167
- I can't. I gotta be downtown
at the clinic by 2:00.
- Aw, come on.

448
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,534
This will only take a second.
Come on.

449
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,458
- You know, I really didn't mean
for you to buy that.
- Sure, you did.

450
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:23,698
Tell me,
how much of this do you get?

451
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:26,395
I just spent it
on the burger back there.

452
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,904
Hey, you want me
to write something in it?

453
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,101
Someday. I enjoyed the lunch.

454
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,370
Sure thing, Doc.

455
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,438
<i>When I was in the fifth grade...</i>

456
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,781
<i>I had this gorgeous teacher,</i>
<i>Mr. Canizarro.</i>

457
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:44,286
<i>I had an enormous crush on him.</i>

458
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,689
And every morning, uh,
I would stand in the same spot...

459
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,525
and he would walk by me and say,
"Ready for a happy day, princess?"

460
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:59,927
<i>I used to dream that when I grew up...</i>

461
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,462
<i>we'd get married</i>
<i>and live happily ever after.</i>

462
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:12,549
<i>Valentine's Day, I made this giant heart</i>
<i>out of crepe paper.</i>

463
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:15,244
<i>And I was about to</i>
<i>give it to him...</i>

464
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:19,312
<i>when he announced</i>
<i>to the class that...</i>

465
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,824
<i>He was getting married.</i>

466
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,552
<i>I was crushed.</i>

467
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,892
<i>I wasn't what you'd call...</i>

468
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,959
<i>an "understanding kid"...</i>

469
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:37,337
<i>where, uh,</i>
<i>romance was concerned.</i>

470
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,673
Crepe paper is a bitch to tear.

471
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,292
Mm. I'm worried about it, Claire.

472
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,527
What are you worried about?
If it doesn't work, we just dump it.

473
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,263
- But let's at least give it a shot.
- Out of the question.

474
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,532
<i>You're dreaming, honey.</i>
<i>No one's going to watch...</i>

475
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,098
a weekly anthology of great American plays,
not on network prime-time.

476
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,201
They'd rather watch junk.

477
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,304
We can change that.
Look, it's our fault.

478
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,441
They want junk because
we've taught them to want junk.

479
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:23,281
If we give them quality,
if we give them a choice...

480
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,345
<i>and if we present it</i>
<i>in the right way...</i>

481
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:27,447
we can teach them
to want something better.

482
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:30,516
I'm not talking Shakespeare.
I'm just talking quality.

483
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:33,358
Did they watch Olivier and Joanne Woodward
in <i>Come Back, Little Sheba?</i>

484
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,332
<i>It was the lowest-rated program of the week.</i>
<i>I don't think it did a 15 share.</i>

485
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,835
Well, it was on New Year's Eve,
wasn't it, Marty?

486
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:42,701
Now, what about <i>Playhouse 90?</i>

487
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:47,142
Mm.

488
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,907
Don't you have any respect
for the public mentality?

489
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,972
- Honey, what mentality?
- A flexible one, Donald.

490
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,646
We have the power and resources to raise it
to whatever we want and we're not even trying!

491
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,712
Donald, stop calling me "honey."

492
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,987
I think she belongs back at P.B.S.

493
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,554
No. I don't wanna go back to P.B.S.

494
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:10,600
They don't need me at P.B.S., damn it.

495
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,398
- How'd it go?
- Down the drain.

496
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:20,500
- Harrington called. Says it's important.
- Oh.

497
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:24,843
Yeah. He probably wants another pilot
on sex and corruption among the rich.

498
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,076
Get Zack for me, will you?

499
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,033
Wait. Don't tell me.
He's, uh...

500
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,877
not back from lunch yet, not at home...
and not at the clinic.

501
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,980
Third time this week.

502
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,173
How ya doin'?

503
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,447
- I'm okay.
- You work around here?

504
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,682
No, no.

505
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:17,554
- What are you drinking?
- Scotch.

506
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,763
Excuse me.

507
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,470
I think I left my, uh— my keys in my car.
Excuse me.

508
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,510
Are you okay?

509
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,021
Sure. Come on.

510
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:21,182
- Let's get dressed.
- We've got time.

511
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,954
We're supposed to be there at 8:00.
You know my father if we're not on time.

512
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:26,052
- We'll be on time.
<i>- That's what you always say.</i>

513
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:28,120
<i>It takes you an hour to get ready,</i>
<i>we're late, and he blames me.</i>

514
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,723
Zack, you wanna tell me what's wrong?

515
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,895
There's nothing wrong. I'm just trying
to avoid an unnecessary reprimand.

516
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,303
Oh, come on. Look.
I know your father. He's harmless.

517
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,398
What do you know about my father?
You don't even know your own father.

518
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:40,670
- You talk to him twice a year!
- Stop it.

519
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,974
I'm sorry.

520
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:49,041
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

521
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,145
<i>Just in a lousy mood,</i>
<i>I guess. I'm sorry.</i>

522
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:54,588
Are you sure you don't
wanna talk about it?

523
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:59,322
There's nothing to talk about.
L— Rough day, that's all.

524
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,296
- Okay.
<i>- Come on. Up and at 'em.</i>

525
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,792
Come on.
We gotta go to dinner.

526
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,895
- We gotta get some meat on these bones.
- Don't tickle me!

527
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:10,963
- Don't tickle me!
- Come on! Meat on these bones!

528
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,066
- You're too skinny!
We gotta fatten you up!
- It makes me mad!

529
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:16,135
<i>Well, I'm concentrating</i>
<i>on the Romantic poets...</i>

530
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,238
<i>primarily Shelley.</i>

531
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,079
I'm sure you're rereading Virgil,
if only as a foundation.

532
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,779
Actually, I'm using Milton
as a foundation.

533
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:27,017
I think you'll find Milton
used Virgil as a foundation.

534
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,584
Ah. I can see how seriously
you're taking this Ph.D. Business.

535
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,653
I'll have two sons the doctors.

536
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,164
The internist and the externist.

537
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,463
So, how is the—
the new guy working out?

538
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,526
- Alan Milgrom?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

539
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,629
- Oh, he's coming along fine.
<i>- Good.</i>

540
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,697
It'll take time, of course.

541
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,107
I, um, had to take him off a case.

542
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:51,443
- That's too bad. How come?
- He made five errors on the first set of contracts.

543
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,506
Dad, the guy's fresh out of law school.

544
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,552
Why don't you just
give him a break?

545
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:02,184
What if you had a patient
with, uh, leukemia?

546
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,523
He showed symptoms
and you did a—

547
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,620
- What, white-cell count?
<i>- That's right.</i>

548
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,063
But your new lab technician
misread it.

549
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:11,157
So that you diagnosed anemia...

550
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:14,499
<i>and your patient died</i>
<i>without receiving treatment.</i>

551
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,630
Would you put the error
down to inexperience...

552
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,835
and permit the technician to continue,
possibly misread again?

553
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,037
It's not the same thing.

554
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,637
Now you're talking about a human life,
not a contract.

555
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,811
Performance is performance. You have to
instill that in the people who work for you.

556
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:31,080
<i>If you can't, you have no business</i>
<i>assuming responsibility.</i>

557
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,417
Would anyone care
for any more meat?

558
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:40,395
- Pam?
- No. Thanks, Christine. I'm fine.

559
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:44,662
I've already put Alan on another job—
newspaper monopoly.

560
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,898
Matter of fact, we're flying to Milwaukee
on Saturday for a week.

561
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:50,235
- This coming Saturday?
- Mm.

562
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:54,505
What about dinner?

563
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:58,776
- Dinner?
- You're supposed to come see
what we've done to the house.

564
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,979
Oh. I'm sorry, Zack. Well, we'll have to
do that the following week.

565
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:06,484
- Okay.
- Sure.

566
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:29,201
Bart? Zack Elliot.
How you doing?

567
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:31,474
I was just calling to, uh—

568
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,846
to find out
if your famous tumor went away.

569
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,386
You see?
What did I tell you?

570
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:42,516
Look, I was, uh, wondering if maybe
you wanted to grab some dinner tonight.

571
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:49,397
Great. How about, uh, 8:00
at, uh, La Masia?

572
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,793
I'll see you then.

573
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,847
Susan? It's Zack. Hi.

574
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,486
Um, is Claire busy? Thanks.

575
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,625
Hello.

576
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,691
Great.

577
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,496
Oh?

578
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,736
Sure.

579
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,507
Yeah. See you later.

580
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:56,356
Oh, she married some guy
she met in grad school.

581
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,459
Well, I really haven't been involved
with anybody since then.

582
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:03,665
Come on.
Come on.

583
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,731
I'm a famous writer, my boy.

584
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,039
I have a reputation to live up to.
That takes time.

585
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:10,341
That takes concentration.

586
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:15,749
No time for frivolous liaisons
or forced encounters.

587
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,049
Sure.

588
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:23,252
What, you can't accept the idea
that someone might wanna be alone?

589
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:27,228
Well, not when you try that hard
to make a case for it, no.

590
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,357
Aha. And you have
the consummate marriage.

591
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:33,061
No. I didn't say that.

592
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:35,570
We've been together eight years.

593
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,267
- So have me and these boots.
- Oh, yeah?

594
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,174
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I hope you're very happy together.

595
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:48,281
So, where do you go
to meet people?

596
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:50,819
I don't know. Around.

597
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,946
You always wanted to write?

598
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,049
Before I could speak.

599
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,117
I used to write these
amazing short stories—

600
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:02,256
really salacious—
all about adultery and incest.

601
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,960
Can you imagine a 10-year-old kid
writing about incest?

602
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,595
I used to have the brother and sister
doing it under the lemonade stand.

603
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:15,202
You ever want a family?

604
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:19,146
Not really.

605
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,913
I used to.
I had the whole picture.

606
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,420
A big ol' house in the country.

607
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:27,683
Couple of Irish setters.
You know.

608
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:33,755
It's still possible.
It's not like you're 80 or anything.

609
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,458
Somehow,
I just don't think it's in the cards.

610
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,628
I don't know.

611
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:44,400
I, uh— I've been through
a lot of changes.

612
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:48,171
<i>- Oh, yeah? What kind of changes?</i>
- You know. Changes.

613
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:52,180
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

614
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:54,182
What are you trying to get at?

615
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,184
<i>What are</i> you <i>trying to get at?</i>

616
00:45:56,252 --> 00:45:57,742
- Me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

617
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,811
- I'm not trying to get at anything.
- Oh, no?

618
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:03,791
- You brought it up.
- Well, I just meant that I'm happy, that's all.

619
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,294
- Ah.
- What about you, pal?

620
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:08,796
- You happy?
- Ahh.

621
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:11,333
For the most part, yeah.

622
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,392
Oh, yeah?
What about the other part?

623
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:18,235
What are you grinning at?

624
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,366
I don't know.

625
00:46:21,444 --> 00:46:25,073
I just find a certain charm
in your confusion.

626
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,048
Okay. I've got, uh—

627
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,179
I've got a few mysteries.
Big deal. Doesn't everybody?

628
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:36,191
Oh, I love a mystery.

629
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:38,284
So, are you solving them?

630
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:40,761
Do you solve yours?

631
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:44,226
- I never said I had any.
- No?

632
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:51,468
Okay. I admit it.
I have done some experimenting.

633
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,510
- Like what?
- A little bit of everything.

634
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:57,307
- You name it.
- You name it.

635
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:03,843
Okay. The truth is, I have gotten into
a lot of different scenes.

636
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,583
I'm a writer. I have to open myself up
to new things...

637
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,387
expand my horizons.

638
00:47:12,662 --> 00:47:16,291
- Bart.
- Zack?

639
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,095
Why don't you just say it?

640
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:24,164
I'm gay.

641
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,935
Thank you.

642
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,671
You're welcome.

643
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:34,081
So, tell me about your mysteries,
my friend.

644
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,847
<i>- How much longer are you gonna wait?</i>
- Wait?

645
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,354
Oh, life's too short to play games.

646
00:47:40,423 --> 00:47:42,618
What are you talking about?

647
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,887
I'm talking about the eyes...

648
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:49,295
<i>the probing,</i>
<i>the impulse to have dinner.</i>

649
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:51,799
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>you develop an instinct, Doc.</i>

650
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,969
You wanna talk about it?

651
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,044
It's easier when you talk about it.

652
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,848
I know.

653
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:24,331
So, you read any good books lately?

654
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,630
Hey. I'm married, Bart.

655
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:32,668
If it feels good, do it.

656
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:37,244
You don't get any points
for playing by the rules.

657
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:39,372
Look. It's not—

658
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:44,582
It's not as if I'm gay.

659
00:48:44,654 --> 00:48:47,316
I mean, I'm—
I'm just curious, you know?

660
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:53,526
I'm in love with Claire. I don't know
what kind of a life I could have without her.

661
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:56,531
I mean, I love her.
I don't wanna be without her.

662
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,830
I'll get some more scotch.

663
00:49:04,874 --> 00:49:08,674
Physician, heal thyself.

664
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,180
<i>Hey.</i>

665
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,551
Are you sure you wanna
spoil the mystery?

666
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:10,463
I'll do that.

667
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:01,209
- How you doin'?
- I'm great.

668
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,117
- How you doing?
- I'm great too.

669
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,148
I didn't realize how late it was.

670
00:52:09,225 --> 00:52:12,058
It's not even midnight.

671
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,995
I gotta get up early.

672
00:52:15,064 --> 00:52:17,123
Yeah. Me too.

673
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,873
So, how do you like
being a doctor?

674
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:30,844
How do I like being a doctor?

675
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:33,143
Well, after four years of college...

676
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:36,878
four of med school, a year of internship,
and two of residency...

677
00:52:36,952 --> 00:52:40,649
I'd say I've developed a certain degree
of fondness for the profession.

678
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:42,884
Okay. I was just trying
to make conversation.

679
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:45,722
Yeah? Well, don't exert the energy.
You gotta be up early.

680
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,888
So what's with all the sarcasm?

681
00:52:47,963 --> 00:52:49,988
- Forget it.
<i>- No.</i>

682
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,330
Let's talk about it.

683
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:55,427
Okay. I was just expecting
a little more, that's all.

684
00:52:55,504 --> 00:52:57,529
That's always been
a problem with me.

685
00:52:57,606 --> 00:53:01,269
Zack, in years to come...

686
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,836
when you talk about this,
and you will...

687
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:08,447
be kind.

688
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,887
I was just trying
to make a little joke.

689
00:53:11,954 --> 00:53:14,514
- How do I get out of here?
- Where you going, Westwood?

690
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,582
No. That must have been
last night's trick.

691
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:20,992
Hey. Ease up, will ya?

692
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:31,734
<i> What did he want from me?</i>
<i>What did he want me to be?</i>

693
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:36,210
<i>Teacher? Tour guide?</i>
<i>Father confessor?</i>

694
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:40,982
<i>Hey. I don't wanna be anyone's teacher.</i>

695
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,247
<i>I guess I shouldn't have</i>
<i>encouraged him.</i>

696
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,948
<i>I mean, one night,</i>
<i>the guy's all ready to move in.</i>

697
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:51,553
<i>Hey. I mean, who needs it?</i>

698
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:55,085
<i>You know, I can score five nights</i>
<i>out of the week, no problem.</i>

699
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:59,396
<i>So it's a different person every night.</i>
<i>So what? I like diversity.</i>

700
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:03,199
<i>I like the challenge, the adventure.</i>

701
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:16,575
I just don't feel like dealing
in anyone else's identity crisis, that's all.

702
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:43,501
I got a question to ask.
I'm only gonna ask you once.

703
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:45,570
- You ready?
- Shoot.

704
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:47,673
- Do you walk in your sleep?
- What?

705
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,741
Walk in your sleep.
Do you sleepwalk?

706
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,844
Does anybody know? Does anybody
get the chance to find out?

707
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,685
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you want from me anyway?

708
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:58,215
There are 40 million guys out there,
and they're all just waiting for you.

709
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:02,162
Oh, that's it, huh? One night per person.
Those are the rules, huh?

710
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:04,222
That's right.
Those are the rules.

711
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,530
Well, to quote the words
of a well-traveled visionary...

712
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:08,627
"You don't get points
for playing by the rules."

713
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:11,798
Oh, boy.
Talk about visionaries.

714
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:15,640
You wanna see something badly enough,
you see it whether it's there or not.

715
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:19,112
You were probably shattered to find out
that the tooth fairy was really your mother.

716
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:25,381
Yes, as a matter of fact, I was.

717
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:32,321
So was I.

718
00:55:32,394 --> 00:55:35,830
Let me get back to work, okay?
I'm right in the middle of something.

719
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:38,059
We'll get together
later in the week, all right?

720
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:44,896
<i>Hey, Zack.</i>

721
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:50,242
How 'bout Friday?

722
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:59,518
<i>Oh, he was very tall.</i>

723
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:03,217
And his hair was so dark,
it glistened in the sunlight.

724
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:08,459
And I was playing Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night.</i>

725
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:13,195
And one evening, he presented himself
at the dressing room door.

726
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:17,831
Captain, the Honorable
Lawrence Hayden-Ford.

727
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,535
A soldier of the sword...

728
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:23,203
<i>but a slave of the heart.</i>

729
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,715
<i>And he said</i>—

730
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:29,273
<i>Nothing he said that evening...</i>

731
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:34,721
<i>moved me more than the verse</i>
<i>he recited of one ofhis poems.</i>

732
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:39,951
<i>"Farewell, my Dover maiden...</i>

733
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:44,625
<i>"alabaster and lapis lazuli.</i>

734
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,466
<i>"Adieu, channel cliffs of Albion.</i>

735
00:56:48,537 --> 00:56:52,871
<i>And my</i> belle dame, avec merci."

736
00:56:56,712 --> 00:56:58,839
And you know the rest of the story.

737
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:02,077
Tell it, Winnie.

738
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,552
Château-Thierry.

739
00:57:08,657 --> 00:57:10,750
Hmm? And he never came back.

740
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:18,057
<i>But... he never died.</i>

741
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:24,196
Ah, this is it. Here we are.

742
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:29,836
"Farewell, my Dover maiden,
alabaster and lapis lazuli."

743
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:32,881
- Can you believe that line?
- Oh, come on. Give her a break.

744
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:36,714
- Oh, I mean, it's a great line for her.
- I know that's what you meant.

745
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:39,913
- Did you think I was mocking it?
- No, I didn't think you were mocking it.

746
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,617
That's what it sounded like.
If she wants to live in a fantasy worid...

747
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:45,888
- then that's up to her.
- Come on, Zack, relax.

748
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:49,089
- I told you I didn't think you were mocking it.
- Yes, you did.

749
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:51,257
I didn't.
What is the matter with you?

750
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:54,302
What's with you? Hey, I'm under
a lot of pressure at the office.

751
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,134
<i>Bloom is still on vacation.</i>

752
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:02,075
- Forget it. Let's just go to bed.
- I don't wanna go to bed.

753
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:04,578
- What do you mean?
- I mean I don't wanna go to bed.

754
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,810
Fine, don't go to bed. But don't tell me
how tired you are in the morning.

755
00:58:07,883 --> 00:58:10,750
<i>What's this? Why do you keep buying</i>
<i>toothpaste with stripes?</i>

756
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:13,754
You know I don't like stripes.
How many times do I have to tell you?

757
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:16,086
I forgot.

758
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:21,152
What is wrong with a simple,
old-fashioned, plain toothpaste? White!

759
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,755
I'll even go blue, as long as it
doesn't have goddamn stripes!

760
00:58:23,832 --> 00:58:27,165
Look. Why don't you just do us a favor
and buy your own fucking toothpaste?

761
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:29,966
I will!

762
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,666
- How you doing, Claire?
- Morning.

763
00:58:34,743 --> 00:58:38,076
- You look lovely.
- I need some time off, Alex.

764
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,676
Personal privilege.

765
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,775
You and Zack?

766
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:45,843
Yeah.

767
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,912
Timing's bad.

768
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,128
- You've got terrific potential here.
- Oh. Well, look.

769
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:55,857
If I've got it now,
won't I have it in a year?

770
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:58,263
Year? You know the momentum
of this business.

771
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,530
Ayear from now you could walk in and have
trouble getting your parking ticket validated.

772
00:59:01,603 --> 00:59:04,834
<i>Sweetie, be rational.</i>

773
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:08,775
- You're the sharpest mind I got right now.
- Oh, Alex, come on.

774
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:11,108
What are you talking about?
Every time I come up with an idea...

775
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,648
that's fresh or unconventional,
I just get shot down.

776
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,184
At least you come up with it.

777
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:19,311
Look. I didn't come here
to express any discontent with my job.

778
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:21,686
- You want money, more control?
- That's not what I'm talking about.

779
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:24,658
I'm telling you that you can be
a head of the network someday.

780
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,820
God knows you could be sitting
at this chair by August.

781
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:32,026
Alex, I'm almost 30. I'm beginning
to wonder where I'm gonna be when I'm 40.

782
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:35,070
Clock's not gonna stop.

783
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:37,867
I love my work.

784
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,341
But I'm afraid I'm gonna end up going home
to an empty bed in an empty house...

785
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:45,039
with my pilot scripts and my Betamax
and all my potential.

786
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,546
Zack and I have a dream.

787
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:56,250
I need a year.

788
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,093
- I'm gonna make life difficult.
- No. Don't say what I think you're gonna say.

789
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:08,034
- I'm making you head of Program Development.
- You bastard.

790
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:12,540
<i>I put Marty in charge therejust temporarily</i>
<i>until I could get a replacement for Brinkman.</i>

791
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:16,408
- You're the best man for the job.
- Alex, don't do this to me.

792
01:00:16,478 --> 01:00:19,777
<i>Don't make it sound like</i>
<i>I'm sentencing you to Devil's Island.</i>

793
01:00:19,848 --> 01:00:23,909
<i>- I'm giving you a shot.</i>
- No, you're taking it away, and you know it.

794
01:00:23,986 --> 01:00:26,420
Will you think about it? Please?

795
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,491
<i>Hmm?</i>

796
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:37,224
Why don't you go to New York
this weekend?

797
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:39,426
Meet the guys.

798
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:42,993
Talk to Zack.
I'm sure he'll support it.

799
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:48,777
Of course he'll support it.

800
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,816
Claire?

801
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,087
- We gotta talk, Zack.
- What is it? What's wrong?

802
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,993
- We need to talk.
- Okay, okay. Let's go for a walk.

803
01:01:08,062 --> 01:01:10,428
No, I don't wanna go for a walk.
I'm not one of your patients.

804
01:01:10,498 --> 01:01:13,092
- I wanna stay right here.
- All right.

805
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:15,159
What?

806
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:17,864
Harrington made me
head of Program Development.

807
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:21,608
- That's fantastic.
- Mm-hmm.

808
01:01:21,676 --> 01:01:24,839
Congratulations.

809
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:29,812
What?

810
01:01:29,884 --> 01:01:32,318
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

811
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:37,153
What about Rupert?

812
01:01:37,225 --> 01:01:40,126
- Rupert will just have to wait.
- I'm almost 30.

813
01:01:40,195 --> 01:01:44,996
Well, you can't turn this down. You've worked
years for this. You'd hold it against the kid.

814
01:01:45,066 --> 01:01:47,398
Would it make it easier for you?

815
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:54,470
Sorry.

816
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:57,204
I just want you to tell me
how you can't wait...

817
01:01:57,278 --> 01:01:59,678
to teach Rupert
how to shoot a basket...

818
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:01,772
or ride a horse...

819
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:05,513
or just walk around on his—
his little legs.

820
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:15,962
They want me to go to New York
this weekend.

821
01:02:21,435 --> 01:02:24,029
<i>Right from the snack bar.</i>

822
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:29,099
- Eat it while it's hot.
- Yeah.

823
01:02:32,479 --> 01:02:34,572
You know, you're a hell of a writer.

824
01:02:34,648 --> 01:02:37,173
- You read the book?
- Yeah. It's amazing.

825
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:40,880
You're like two different people.
You got a lot buried in there.

826
01:02:40,954 --> 01:02:44,082
What are you talking about?
It's a work of fiction.

827
01:02:44,157 --> 01:02:47,320
- And none of those people are you, huh?
- Well—

828
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:52,088
Where'd you get your imagination?

829
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,961
You develop it.

830
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:03,399
Oh, yeah?

831
01:03:09,182 --> 01:03:11,548
You didn't play any sports as a kid?

832
01:03:11,618 --> 01:03:16,078
The most active thing I ever did
was jump to conclusions.

833
01:03:16,156 --> 01:03:20,115
Well, I just figured the way you work out,
you know? Swimming.

834
01:03:20,193 --> 01:03:23,890
- I guess I give that impression.
- Yeah, you got the weights and everything.

835
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:26,432
No, actually, I never did.

836
01:03:28,602 --> 01:03:32,038
- There was Little League.
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>

837
01:03:32,105 --> 01:03:34,539
Oh, yeah.

838
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:37,543
There was Little League, all right.

839
01:03:37,611 --> 01:03:39,806
My father was determined
to make a man out of me.

840
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,817
<i>God, I fought it all the way.</i>
<i>But on this, he would not budge.</i>

841
01:03:48,021 --> 01:03:52,822
I'll never forget the time he asked the guys
to come down from the office to watch me play.

842
01:03:52,893 --> 01:03:56,294
He gave me batting practice for a week.
He said, "Kid, you better not strike out."

843
01:03:58,298 --> 01:04:03,930
<i>The only thing was,</i>
<i>he forgot that I couldn't catch.</i>

844
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:07,405
So there we were,
2- and-2 pitch, bases loaded.

845
01:04:07,474 --> 01:04:11,171
Me out in right field,
praying for a strikeout.

846
01:04:11,244 --> 01:04:13,974
When sure enough,
fly ball coming right toward me.

847
01:04:14,047 --> 01:04:19,610
<i>I held out</i>
<i>my brand-new Spalding mitt.</i>

848
01:04:19,686 --> 01:04:23,782
I got that— that feeling in the pit
of my stomach. You know when—

849
01:04:23,857 --> 01:04:27,953
- Yeah.
- I just closed my eyes.

850
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:30,724
It came down
about three feet from me.

851
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,868
The old man said he couldn't
go to the office for a week...

852
01:04:35,936 --> 01:04:38,404
because he was so ashamed.

853
01:04:39,873 --> 01:04:41,864
Jesus.

854
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:47,603
The night he died, l—

855
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:51,549
I went into a gay bar
for the first time.

856
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,749
I didn't do it to—
to celebrate or anything.

857
01:04:58,692 --> 01:05:00,717
I did it 'cause I was pissed.

858
01:05:02,295 --> 01:05:04,456
Pissed that I never got
the chance to tell him...

859
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:08,558
that his all-American right fielder
liked to get it on with other right fielders.

860
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:15,540
I really wanted to see
the look in his eyes.

861
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:21,440
God, I wanted that scene.

862
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:27,944
Hey.

863
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:33,215
Thanks.

864
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:40,658
Mm. I want you to read
that new outline of mine.

865
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,895
Great. I'll—
I'll come by tomorrow.

866
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:45,233
You're not on call tonight,
are you?

867
01:05:46,673 --> 01:05:48,698
- No.
<i>- Your wife's in New York.</i>

868
01:05:48,775 --> 01:05:53,109
- Mm-hmm.
- So, uh, why don't you stay the night?

869
01:05:55,582 --> 01:05:57,777
<i>Hell, why don't you stay</i>
<i>the whole weekend?</i>

870
01:06:01,254 --> 01:06:03,279
Great.

871
01:06:24,778 --> 01:06:28,111
Time-out. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
You pay for dinner.

872
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,222
<i>- Coming at you. Look out.</i>
<i>- I got you now.</i>

873
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:48,631
<i>Come on. Look out. Here it comes.</i>

874
01:06:48,702 --> 01:06:51,296
- Oh, no!
- Yee-hee-hee!

875
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:54,738
This is it! This is it!

876
01:06:57,677 --> 01:07:00,237
Look out now.

877
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:02,781
All right.
Look out! Look out!

878
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:05,545
<i>Ooh.! All right.!</i>

879
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:17,826
- So?
- Hang on.

880
01:07:28,842 --> 01:07:31,333
I think you can do better.

881
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:33,936
<i>Itjust doesn't have the same honesty</i>
<i>your other work has.</i>

882
01:07:34,014 --> 01:07:36,346
- Honesty?
- Yeah, I don't think you believe in it.

883
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:39,544
It— It reads like you wrote
to get a big movie deal or something.

884
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:42,281
Oh, Jesus. I don't know why
I let you read it in the first place.

885
01:07:42,355 --> 01:07:44,516
What do you know?
A fucking doctor!

886
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:47,651
If all you wanted was approval,
I'm sorry.

887
01:07:47,727 --> 01:07:49,718
I thought
you wanted an honest opinion.

888
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:52,560
Honest? Oh, you're a great one
to talk about being honest.

889
01:07:52,632 --> 01:07:55,396
- What do you mean?
- Forget it.

890
01:07:55,468 --> 01:07:58,369
No, I wanna know
what you mean by that.

891
01:07:58,438 --> 01:08:01,896
All right.
What are you doing here?

892
01:08:01,975 --> 01:08:04,000
What am I do—

893
01:08:04,077 --> 01:08:06,136
You invited me.
I'm here because I wanna be here.

894
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:10,148
Right, but you're not gay or anything,
are you? You're just curious, right?

895
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:12,207
Yeah, I'm curious.
So what?

896
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:16,187
Well, I'm getting sick of all this curiosity.
It's so fucking convenient.

897
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:19,316
What are you talking about?
What, because I didn't like your outline?

898
01:08:19,392 --> 01:08:22,156
I'm just getting sick
of all the games you're playing.

899
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:24,662
I mean, first you're here,
then you're back to your wife.

900
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:27,723
Why don't you just admit it instead of
running away like a fucking coward?

901
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:30,770
Me, the coward?
Me, running away?

902
01:08:30,837 --> 01:08:34,204
I'm not out there every night
cruising bus terminals for a little validation...

903
01:08:34,274 --> 01:08:36,902
and then taking off
before anybody gets too close.

904
01:08:36,977 --> 01:08:40,936
At least I know who I am.
I'm not afraid to admit it.

905
01:08:41,014 --> 01:08:43,676
<i>And for your information,</i>
<i>wiseass...</i>

906
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:46,275
I've never cruised
a bus terminal in my life.

907
01:08:46,353 --> 01:08:48,947
Hey, sport, have you thought about
what it's gonna be like in 10 years...

908
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:51,354
when you can't walk into any bar
and grab the first guy you see?

909
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:54,359
Well, by then,
I'd have a great tape collection...

910
01:08:54,427 --> 01:08:57,089
and you'll still be
solving your mystery.

911
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:01,565
Okay. Let's just drop it.

912
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:03,626
Oh, that's great.
That's perfect.

913
01:09:03,703 --> 01:09:06,934
Let's just drop it.
Let's just block it out!

914
01:09:32,365 --> 01:09:35,027
I've been there, Zack.

915
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:39,266
It doesn't work.

916
01:09:39,339 --> 01:09:42,001
You can talk yourself into it.
You can say, "Okay, I'm curious."

917
01:09:42,075 --> 01:09:44,873
Or "It's just a phase"
or "I'll get over it."

918
01:09:44,944 --> 01:09:46,935
But every time
you make love to her...

919
01:09:47,013 --> 01:09:49,243
you're gonna be thinking about the number
you cruised that afternoon.

920
01:09:49,315 --> 01:09:53,012
Bart, I want it.

921
01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:56,578
I want it, but I-I don't want
the one-night stands...

922
01:09:56,656 --> 01:09:59,147
the phony names,
going home alone.

923
01:10:01,695 --> 01:10:03,686
Things may be shaky
between Claire and me in bed...

924
01:10:03,763 --> 01:10:06,698
but at least we're
there for each other in the morning.

925
01:10:06,766 --> 01:10:09,428
Well, what makes you think
you can't have that with another guy?

926
01:10:17,777 --> 01:10:21,543
Zack. Are you awake?

927
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:24,811
Yeah.

928
01:10:24,884 --> 01:10:27,182
I'm not gonna
submit the outline.

929
01:10:27,253 --> 01:10:29,881
You were right.
The idea stinks.

930
01:10:32,392 --> 01:10:34,860
- Hey, Bart?
- Hmm.

931
01:10:36,396 --> 01:10:38,387
I love you.

932
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:46,264
You don't have to say anything.

933
01:10:59,486 --> 01:11:01,511
- Morning.
- Morning. Sleep okay?

934
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:04,318
- Yeah, great.
- Grab some juice in the refrigerator.

935
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,551
Oh.

936
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:08,890
Anything in the news?

937
01:11:08,962 --> 01:11:12,159
Oh, you know.

938
01:11:12,232 --> 01:11:14,427
What do you wanna
do today? Huh?

939
01:11:14,501 --> 01:11:17,527
I've got this great new idea for a book.
I think I'm gonna write it up.

940
01:11:17,604 --> 01:11:21,734
- How long will that take?
- Probably most of the day.

941
01:11:21,808 --> 01:11:24,072
Wanna get together for dinner?

942
01:11:24,144 --> 01:11:27,443
I'd love to, but I can't.
I made other plans.

943
01:11:27,514 --> 01:11:29,948
I really don't think
I can break them.

944
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:33,544
Why don't we get together
later in the week?

945
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,747
Claire's coming back tomorrow.

946
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,022
I'm gonna have that talk with her.

947
01:11:43,096 --> 01:11:45,462
Well...

948
01:11:45,532 --> 01:11:48,296
that's a step
in the right direction anyway.

949
01:11:48,368 --> 01:11:50,359
Here. You want this?

950
01:11:54,874 --> 01:11:59,072
I guess, uh, I'll just take off.

951
01:11:59,145 --> 01:12:01,613
Oh, don't forget your records.

952
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:04,946
You keep 'em.
I brought 'em for you.

953
01:12:05,018 --> 01:12:09,352
Thanks, but, uh, I'm really not
into Gilbert and Sullivan.

954
01:12:12,392 --> 01:12:15,190
Zack?

955
01:12:17,163 --> 01:12:19,791
I really think you're gonna like
that new outline.

956
01:12:31,978 --> 01:12:35,846
We spent the day Saturday
going over the fall schedule.

957
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:38,509
Of course, my real impact wouldn't
be felt until next year.

958
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:41,281
But I think I could probably
get a few good things going.

959
01:12:41,354 --> 01:12:44,289
I mean, for instance, they were nervous
about the interracial marriage pilot.

960
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:48,259
And they were thinking
about dumping it, so, uh...

961
01:12:48,328 --> 01:12:51,024
I suggested that they make the couple
import-export dealers...

962
01:12:51,097 --> 01:12:55,830
and that way they could get in
some good international intrigue.

963
01:12:55,902 --> 01:12:58,302
They bought it.

964
01:12:58,371 --> 01:13:00,669
You just have to know
how to handle them.

965
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,452
All right, look.

966
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:22,016
Uh, we're gonna cut this out,
and we're gonna talk.

967
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:25,155
You cannot do this to me.
It's not fair.

968
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:29,395
Now, I don't know what to do. I don't know
what to say. I don't know how to hold you.

969
01:13:29,469 --> 01:13:31,460
I don't know whether I should
even try to hold you.

970
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:37,532
<i>God, Zack, we've always</i>
<i>gotten each other through...</i>

971
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:41,569
because we've never
been afraid to share.

972
01:13:41,648 --> 01:13:43,741
You've closed yourself off,
and I feel helpless.

973
01:13:43,816 --> 01:13:46,250
I don't know what to do.

974
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,153
<i>You gotta tell me.</i>
<i>Are you</i>—<i>Are you sick? Are you in trouble?</i>

975
01:13:50,223 --> 01:13:54,159
<i>Look. Whatever it is,</i>
<i>I can handle it.</i>

976
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:56,593
I can handle it
no matter what it is.

977
01:13:56,663 --> 01:13:59,564
But I cannot handle the silence.

978
01:14:14,814 --> 01:14:18,011
Hi, Daddy. Did I wake you?

979
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:20,109
It's Claire.

980
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,984
No, everything's all right.
I just want to say hello.

981
01:14:28,461 --> 01:14:30,452
He's fine.

982
01:14:32,365 --> 01:14:34,458
Um, look. I'm really sorry
I called so late.

983
01:14:34,534 --> 01:14:37,469
I just forgot
all about the time difference.

984
01:14:38,938 --> 01:14:40,929
Well, um—

985
01:14:43,509 --> 01:14:47,639
I was just, uh,
thinking about you and, uh—

986
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:52,311
Well, I was thinking about that time
that we went skiing.

987
01:14:52,385 --> 01:14:54,785
Remember we went
for two weeks?

988
01:14:54,854 --> 01:14:57,584
And I couldn't—
I couldn't stand up.

989
01:14:57,657 --> 01:15:00,956
Remember I couldn't stay up on my skis,
and you finally had to hold me up.

990
01:15:02,562 --> 01:15:05,156
Yeah.

991
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:08,166
Uh—

992
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:10,759
Daddy, could I just
tell you one more thing?

993
01:15:10,837 --> 01:15:15,968
Um, did you see
<i>Roman Holiday?</i>

994
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:18,476
Yeah, it was a wonderful old movie.

995
01:15:18,544 --> 01:15:21,638
Remember it was, uh, Gregory Peck
and Audrey Hepburn.

996
01:15:21,714 --> 01:15:25,309
And, uh, he was a reporter,
and she was a princess.

997
01:15:25,385 --> 01:15:28,650
We were thinking about
making a series out of it.

998
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:31,747
Um, he was a reporter,
and she was a princess.

999
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:35,123
And she had run away,
and he didn't know.

1000
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:37,754
Only in the series,
he'd have to know.

1001
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,924
Um, and every week,
they'd have a new adventure.

1002
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,801
And he'd have to help her keep her—
her disguise...

1003
01:15:45,872 --> 01:15:48,670
so nobody would find out.

1004
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:50,732
Um—

1005
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:57,007
Sorry I woke you up.

1006
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,588
Thank you for listening to me, Daddy.

1007
01:16:08,061 --> 01:16:12,521
I thought about being alone
a lot as a kid. Yeah.

1008
01:16:12,598 --> 01:16:15,362
When you're the last one
standing there at choose-up...

1009
01:16:15,435 --> 01:16:19,303
and both teams are arguing
about which one has to take you...

1010
01:16:19,372 --> 01:16:21,863
you're usually on your own a lot.

1011
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:23,966
And you have a lot of time
to think about it.

1012
01:16:26,112 --> 01:16:28,876
<i> Since I didn't have</i>
<i>anyone to share it with...</i>

1013
01:16:28,948 --> 01:16:33,908
<i>- all this pain and confusion...</i>
<i>- Lock the door.</i>

1014
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:37,979
<i>I shared it with Natalie Wood</i>
<i>or, uh, Elizabeth Taylor.</i>

1015
01:16:39,392 --> 01:16:42,884
<i>Or Marilyn Monroe.</i>

1016
01:16:42,962 --> 01:16:46,762
<i>Since I couldn't talk about it,</i>
<i>I wrote it all down.</i>

1017
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:49,097
<i>Hey, I had a lot to write down.</i>

1018
01:16:51,104 --> 01:16:55,507
<i>He came on so strong.</i>
<i>Expected so much.</i>

1019
01:16:55,575 --> 01:17:00,410
<i>If I could havejust said to him, "Hey, man,</i>
<i>this is as new to me as it is to you. "</i>

1020
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:06,775
<i>It did feel good</i>
<i>to be with him, though...</i>

1021
01:17:06,853 --> 01:17:08,980
<i>to have someone around</i>
<i>who cared.</i>

1022
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:14,759
<i>I don't think I ever felt</i>
<i>that way about anyone before.</i>

1023
01:17:16,796 --> 01:17:20,197
<i>I mean, what the hell.</i>

1024
01:17:20,266 --> 01:17:22,962
<i>He's confused.</i>
<i>He's just coming out.</i>

1025
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:25,469
Who needs it?

1026
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:35,246
Goddamn him!

1027
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:38,147
I mean, it was going so well.

1028
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:41,488
Why did he have
to tell me that he loved me?

1029
01:17:53,533 --> 01:17:56,730
<i>Well, welcome home.</i>

1030
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:03,134
<i>Oh, Zack, where have you been?</i>
<i>I've been worried about you.</i>

1031
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:05,473
I called your brother.
I even tried to call your father.

1032
01:18:05,545 --> 01:18:09,106
- I spent the night in my office.
- Couldn't you have called?

1033
01:18:09,182 --> 01:18:12,015
Claire, we're gonna have that talk.

1034
01:18:12,085 --> 01:18:15,145
- All right.
- We better sit down.

1035
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:19,382
Gonna be a sit-downer, huh?

1036
01:18:30,703 --> 01:18:34,639
Look, Zack. Whatever it is,
I'm your wife and I love you.

1037
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:44,276
So tell me. What is it?

1038
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:47,319
I don't believe it.

1039
01:18:47,387 --> 01:18:49,548
I've gone over this
and I've rehearsed it...

1040
01:18:49,622 --> 01:18:51,783
and now I don't know
how to say it.

1041
01:18:54,294 --> 01:18:56,387
Just say it.

1042
01:18:59,966 --> 01:19:02,230
I've made a few discoveries
about myself.

1043
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:07,962
I've had, I guess what
you would call, desires...

1044
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:12,239
that I've been repressing,
and they're starting to surface.

1045
01:19:18,284 --> 01:19:20,275
I find that I'm attracted to men.

1046
01:19:22,555 --> 01:19:25,353
<i>I suppose that...</i>

1047
01:19:25,425 --> 01:19:27,552
I have been most of my life,
but I never knew what it was.

1048
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:29,720
Or maybe—

1049
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,660
Maybe I just never admitted it...

1050
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:35,826
or allowed it
to come through before.

1051
01:19:35,902 --> 01:19:38,735
<i>Claire, I don't know</i>
<i>where these feelings come from...</i>

1052
01:19:38,805 --> 01:19:41,740
<i>but the fact is that I have them.</i>

1053
01:19:41,808 --> 01:19:44,834
<i>And I've gotta stop denying it.</i>

1054
01:19:50,016 --> 01:19:53,577
I've gotta call Barbara. She wants to know
if we can have dinner with them on Saturday.

1055
01:19:53,653 --> 01:19:58,022
- Claire, did you hear what I just told you?
- What should I tell them?

1056
01:19:58,091 --> 01:20:00,525
Claire, listen to me.

1057
01:20:00,593 --> 01:20:03,687
I have stopped denying it.
I've been with someone.

1058
01:20:06,799 --> 01:20:08,926
What do you want for dinner?
Do you want veal or fish?

1059
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:11,470
- Last night, you said you could handle anything.
- Stop it!

1060
01:20:11,537 --> 01:20:14,301
- Shut up!
- You said you could handle anything last night!

1061
01:20:14,374 --> 01:20:17,036
What are you telling me?
That our whole marriage has been a lie?

1062
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:20,978
No! What are you saying?
We have always— Claire, look at me.

1063
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:24,210
- We have always been there for each other.
Always!
- Like friends?

1064
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:27,047
Yes, like friends.
It's the best thing we can have.

1065
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,315
- No! What about passion?
- What about support?

1066
01:20:29,389 --> 01:20:32,290
What about betrayal?

1067
01:20:32,358 --> 01:20:34,451
God!

1068
01:20:34,527 --> 01:20:37,894
I thought I knew you.
Who are you?

1069
01:20:37,964 --> 01:20:41,400
- I'm the man who's loved you for eight years.
- Loved me or used me?

1070
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:44,231
- You are not listening to me.
You don't understand!
<i>- I'm listening.!</i>

1071
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:46,965
I do understand. You used me.
You hid behind me for eight years.

1072
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,498
<i>Oh, God, you wanna hear something?</i>
<i>I thought it was another woman.</i>

1073
01:20:50,576 --> 01:20:53,511
- Claire, no, you're wrong. It's not true.
- I don't wanna hear anymore.

1074
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:55,945
Why don't you leave, Zack?
Just leave!

1075
01:20:56,015 --> 01:20:58,006
It's something you don't
have any control over.

1076
01:20:58,084 --> 01:21:00,518
I mean, whether you're born with it
or acquire it, who knows?

1077
01:21:00,586 --> 01:21:03,646
But there's something in me
that needs to be with a man.

1078
01:21:03,723 --> 01:21:06,920
- My God!
- Maybe it's his— his strength.

1079
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:10,656
H- His attitude.
Maybe he's everything I'm not.

1080
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,857
I don't know. Maybe it's brotherhood,
bonding, release.

1081
01:21:12,932 --> 01:21:16,129
Maybe it's just the need
for another man's approval.

1082
01:21:16,202 --> 01:21:18,932
- But it's that feeling—
- Stop it!

1083
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:23,072
God.

1084
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:29,837
<i>You know how I feel</i>
<i>right now, Zack?</i>

1085
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,941
Radio City when I was eight years old.

1086
01:21:32,018 --> 01:21:35,681
- My father, he hated Radio City.
- Claire, don't.

1087
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:39,191
But I kept begging him to take me.
I begged him until he finally said yes.

1088
01:21:39,258 --> 01:21:42,318
- It's not the same, Claire.
<i>- And then the day that we were supposed to go...</i>

1089
01:21:42,395 --> 01:21:46,957
I went up to their room, and his closets
were empty and all his clothes were gone.

1090
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:51,470
And my mother told me that my father
had to go on a long trip.

1091
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:55,874
So, see, he never did
make it to Radio City.

1092
01:22:01,247 --> 01:22:04,148
Hell of a way to say good-bye.

1093
01:22:25,938 --> 01:22:27,929
That's a hell of an exit line.

1094
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:29,770
Yeah.

1095
01:22:31,577 --> 01:22:35,570
Yeah, she thinks
that our whole marriage is a deception...

1096
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,116
that I'm a complete fraud.

1097
01:22:38,184 --> 01:22:41,483
Give her time.
She'll get over it.

1098
01:22:45,825 --> 01:22:48,350
I'm gonna need a place
to stay for a while.

1099
01:22:50,663 --> 01:22:54,759
What do you say I put a movie on, huh?
Take your mind off things.

1100
01:22:54,834 --> 01:22:59,567
Hey, Bart, is it okay if I stay?

1101
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:02,199
<i>Bart?</i>

1102
01:23:02,275 --> 01:23:05,904
Well, you picked
a really bad time.

1103
01:23:05,978 --> 01:23:08,879
I mean, any other time,
hey, no problem.

1104
01:23:08,948 --> 01:23:13,476
<i>But, uh, I'm working on this new idea.</i>
<i>I think we oughta talk about it.</i>

1105
01:23:13,553 --> 01:23:16,351
- I really think you're gonna like it.
- Are you ever gonna stop?

1106
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,781
- Stop what?
- Fighting us. Pushing us out.

1107
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:22,259
- Us?
- Yeah, you know, us, us.

1108
01:23:22,328 --> 01:23:26,128
Like people, as in "people who need people."
Your favorite lyric.

1109
01:23:26,199 --> 01:23:29,600
Would you stop giving me this guilt number
just because I don't want to get involved?

1110
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:32,661
- What is your problem, huh?
- Problem?

1111
01:23:32,738 --> 01:23:35,172
- Yeah.
- Why does everybody think there's
a problem when you wanna be alone?

1112
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:37,266
Maybe that's just the way
I choose to live my life.

1113
01:23:37,343 --> 01:23:41,211
Right.

1114
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:46,246
Zack.

1115
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:48,913
I don't want a relationship.

1116
01:23:50,089 --> 01:23:52,080
I'm happy just the way I am.

1117
01:24:19,418 --> 01:24:23,013
<i> Damn it, there was</i>
<i>something there, and I don't mean the sex...</i>

1118
01:24:23,089 --> 01:24:25,080
<i>or the challenge.</i>

1119
01:24:27,126 --> 01:24:31,620
<i>Because after all those years</i>
<i>of one-night stands and easy pickups...</i>

1120
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:35,155
<i>I think I finally met someone</i>
<i>that I really believed...</i>

1121
01:24:35,234 --> 01:24:37,998
<i>was making love to me.</i>

1122
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:40,470
<i>Maybe that's why</i>
<i>I had to destroy it.</i>

1123
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:48,508
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe next time it'll be easier.</i>

1124
01:24:48,581 --> 01:24:50,776
<i>Maybe I needed</i>
<i>to go through this.</i>

1125
01:24:52,318 --> 01:24:56,584
<i>It's funny. I mean,</i>
<i>I'm not pissed at anyone.</i>

1126
01:24:56,656 --> 01:24:59,090
<i>But if I ever do decide</i>
<i>to have a relationship with someone...</i>

1127
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:02,059
<i>I know I'd better be willing</i>
<i>to open myself up a little...</i>

1128
01:25:02,128 --> 01:25:05,461
<i>and, uh, not be afraid</i>
<i>that he's gonna run away.</i>

1129
01:25:06,732 --> 01:25:09,360
<i>Zack didn't run away.</i>

1130
01:25:09,435 --> 01:25:12,768
<i>- I pushed him out.</i>

1131
01:25:12,838 --> 01:25:15,136
<i>He did leave me</i>
<i>with something though.</i>

1132
01:25:17,476 --> 01:25:23,108
<i>Look. I'm not sure having a relationship</i>
<i>is the most important thing in the worid.</i>

1133
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:27,516
<i>I have my work, my friends.</i>

1134
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:30,111
<i>I'm pretty happy.</i>

1135
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:33,716
<i>But if I ever do decide</i>
<i>to explore that other area...</i>

1136
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:37,627
<i>Zack gave me some hope</i>
<i>that I can care about somebody else...</i>

1137
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:40,257
<i>at least as much</i>
<i>as he cares about me...</i>

1138
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:43,598
<i>that I don't have to live</i>
<i>with my imagination alone.</i>

1139
01:25:44,637 --> 01:25:46,798
<i>Hey, what the hell.</i>

1140
01:25:46,872 --> 01:25:49,932
<i>- Who knows?</i>
- Hey, Bart, where you been?

1141
01:25:50,009 --> 01:25:52,637
- Been around.
- Well, where are you goin'?

1142
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:55,237
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Hey, Bart.

1143
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:57,407
- Paul, how are you?
- Will I see you later?

1144
01:25:57,483 --> 01:25:59,474
Maybe.

1145
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:33,006
<i>Zack was my strength.</i>

1146
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:35,411
<i>He was my protector.</i>

1147
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:37,915
<i>Nothing could hurt me</i>
<i>if Zack was there.</i>

1148
01:27:37,983 --> 01:27:41,976
<i>- I remember the first Christmas</i>
<i>that we spent together.</i>

1149
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:44,545
<i>Zack wanted to go</i>
<i>to a dinner party...</i>

1150
01:27:44,623 --> 01:27:49,083
<i>but I had to wait in my room in the dorm</i>
<i>for my father to call.</i>

1151
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:51,356
<i>I told Zack to go on without me,</i>
<i>but he wouldn't go.</i>

1152
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:54,160
<i>He came and waited with me.</i>

1153
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:57,464
Course, my father never called,
but Zack stayed.

1154
01:27:59,572 --> 01:28:04,009
We ended up eating potato chips,
and he stayed with me the whole night.

1155
01:28:04,076 --> 01:28:08,445
<i>I spent the next day</i>
<i>reading Rupert Brooke.</i>

1156
01:28:08,514 --> 01:28:11,278
<i>And I decided</i>
<i>that no matter what...</i>

1157
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:15,411
<i>if I ever had a son,</i>
<i>I would name him Rupert.</i>

1158
01:29:08,707 --> 01:29:11,335
- What can I do you for, honey?
- Are you Ted?

1159
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:14,937
- In the flesh.
- Um, could I talk to you for a minute?

1160
01:29:15,014 --> 01:29:17,073
Depends on what you're selling.

1161
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:20,912
- I'm Zack's wife.
- Who?

1162
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:24,888
- Zack Elliot.
- Okay. I give up. Who's that?

1163
01:29:30,095 --> 01:29:32,427
- Did you write that?
- Uh, yeah. So?

1164
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:34,728
Please, I have to talk to you.

1165
01:29:36,502 --> 01:29:38,493
Come on in. Come in.

1166
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,434
<i>You have to excuse this place.</i>
<i>Can I get you something to drink?</i>

1167
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:46,637
- Glass of white wine maybe?
- No, thank you.

1168
01:29:46,712 --> 01:29:48,703
Do you live here alone?

1169
01:29:48,781 --> 01:29:51,875
Yeah, I sure do.
What's your name?

1170
01:29:51,951 --> 01:29:54,283
- Claire.
- Claire.

1171
01:29:54,353 --> 01:29:57,516
Why don't you just
have a seat, honey?

1172
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:59,615
I tell you. I hate to spoil
this little party of yours...

1173
01:29:59,692 --> 01:30:02,627
but I don't know anybody named, uh, Zack?

1174
01:30:04,763 --> 01:30:06,924
Look. I have a picture of him.

1175
01:30:08,567 --> 01:30:13,368
Maybe you could just, um,
take a look at it, and...

1176
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,636
see if, um—

1177
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:18,700
Oh, yeah. I know this guy.

1178
01:30:18,777 --> 01:30:20,972
<i>Only his name isn't Zack.</i>

1179
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:23,708
At least it wasn't
when he was with me that night.

1180
01:30:23,782 --> 01:30:26,376
It was Frank.
That's it— Frank.

1181
01:30:26,452 --> 01:30:29,182
- Where did you meet him?
- Uh, I met him at the bar.

1182
01:30:29,255 --> 01:30:32,247
You sure you don't want a drink
or a hit off this joint or something?

1183
01:30:34,126 --> 01:30:37,687
So, what happened?
Y- You met him and y-you talked...

1184
01:30:37,763 --> 01:30:39,924
and then you
ask him back here?

1185
01:30:39,999 --> 01:30:43,400
It's that simple.
Just the way boys and giris do it.

1186
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:49,065
- What did you talk about?
- If it was worth remembering...

1187
01:30:49,141 --> 01:30:51,302
I don't think his name
would have been Frank, would it?

1188
01:30:55,948 --> 01:30:58,781
What happened
when you got back here?

1189
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:04,084
Look. Can I be honest with you?
I really don't remember.

1190
01:31:04,156 --> 01:31:06,681
I got more tricks coming in and out
of this apartment in one day...

1191
01:31:06,759 --> 01:31:10,422
it looks like a bargain day
at Woolworth's.

1192
01:31:10,496 --> 01:31:14,091
I'll tell you one thing. He must have been
a pretty hot little number...

1193
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:16,498
or I never would have given him
my home phone number.

1194
01:31:19,538 --> 01:31:23,201
Could I ask you to try to remember
just one other thing?

1195
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:25,300
Did he tell you
that he was married?

1196
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:28,312
Nope. Now, that much
I would have remembered.

1197
01:31:31,383 --> 01:31:33,817
Could I ask you a stupid question?
Are you happy?

1198
01:31:35,487 --> 01:31:37,614
Well, let me put it
to you this way.

1199
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:39,783
I lose my temper in traffic.

1200
01:31:39,858 --> 01:31:42,292
Uh, I bleed
when I cut myself shaving.

1201
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:46,627
I don't enjoy giving up half my salary
to pay for a hamburger.

1202
01:31:46,699 --> 01:31:49,361
Otherwise, I would say,
yeah, I am pretty happy.

1203
01:31:51,503 --> 01:31:53,801
Where'd you find that matchbook?

1204
01:31:53,872 --> 01:31:56,773
Coat pocket.

1205
01:31:56,842 --> 01:32:00,801
Would have been a lot simpler
if he just handed it to you, wouldn't it?

1206
01:32:05,918 --> 01:32:08,478
Thank you.

1207
01:32:12,524 --> 01:32:16,483
Is it my fault?
I should have been more of a wife.

1208
01:32:16,562 --> 01:32:19,827
And in what way? Hmm?
Give up your career?

1209
01:32:22,267 --> 01:32:25,293
- I thought we had the worid's greatest marriage.
- Oh.

1210
01:32:25,371 --> 01:32:30,104
It's crazy, isn't it? How you can kid yourself
and only see what you wanna see.

1211
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:35,545
Well, what I see
is magic in your marriage.

1212
01:32:35,614 --> 01:32:40,642
Well, then why didn't I see
that Zack was breaking inside?

1213
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,951
Because, dearest, he obviously
didn't want you to see.

1214
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:48,015
But I should have been able to.

1215
01:32:48,093 --> 01:32:52,962
L— Instead of romanticizing
and idealizing...

1216
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:55,898
and expecting so much...

1217
01:32:55,968 --> 01:32:58,562
I should have just let him be human.

1218
01:32:58,637 --> 01:33:00,662
Well, you didn't.

1219
01:33:00,739 --> 01:33:02,900
And he is.

1220
01:33:04,943 --> 01:33:08,381
Then why do I feel
that I've done something wrong?

1221
01:33:08,514 --> 01:33:12,211
Dearest, dearest,
you haven't done anything wrong.

1222
01:33:12,284 --> 01:33:14,582
Zack is still Zack, you're you...

1223
01:33:14,653 --> 01:33:19,090
and you both still have
something very special.

1224
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:25,996
Zack's the only man
I've ever been with, Winnie.

1225
01:33:26,065 --> 01:33:29,193
He's the only man
I've ever wanted to be with.

1226
01:33:29,268 --> 01:33:31,759
Then damn it, girl.
What are you sitting here for?

1227
01:33:33,172 --> 01:33:35,163
Hmm?

1228
01:34:00,099 --> 01:34:02,090
The manager let me in.

1229
01:34:03,602 --> 01:34:05,661
I told him that I'm your wife.

1230
01:34:12,545 --> 01:34:16,276
- I think we can make it work, Zack.
- No, it can't work.

1231
01:34:16,348 --> 01:34:18,782
We can get help. There are plenty
of good psychiatrists around.

1232
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:22,378
It's not an illness.
I am not gonna change.

1233
01:34:22,455 --> 01:34:25,982
All right. Then we'll accept it.

1234
01:34:26,058 --> 01:34:29,289
We'll accept it and live with it.
I know there are other marriages who do.

1235
01:34:29,361 --> 01:34:32,956
Claire, no.
It wouldn't be fair to you.

1236
01:34:33,032 --> 01:34:37,230
You're entitled to a good sex life,
an honest one.

1237
01:34:37,303 --> 01:34:39,396
What if I said
that it didn't matter?

1238
01:34:39,472 --> 01:34:41,565
That wouldn't be fair to me.

1239
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:44,900
I don't want a double life.

1240
01:34:44,977 --> 01:34:48,777
One foot in one place, one foot in another.
I don't want that.

1241
01:34:48,848 --> 01:34:50,907
- Zack.
- No.

1242
01:34:52,218 --> 01:34:56,211
You gotta let go...
for both of us.

1243
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:13,464
I heard about an opening on the staff
at Sloan-Kettering in New York.

1244
01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:16,804
It would mean working
with cancer patients full time.

1245
01:35:16,876 --> 01:35:19,106
What do you think?

1246
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:21,442
I think they'd be lucky
to have you.

1247
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:27,148
It would mean we wouldn't get to see
each other very much though.

1248
01:35:27,219 --> 01:35:30,780
That's right. If it's too easy
to fall back on each other...

1249
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:33,347
we'd keep ending up
where we started.

1250
01:35:35,027 --> 01:35:39,464
- No contact? Nothing?
<i>- No. Not till we're ready.</i>

1251
01:35:39,532 --> 01:35:42,399
Maybe a month. Ayear.

1252
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:47,739
Even if we're never ready, we'll always
be together. You know that.

1253
01:35:59,485 --> 01:36:02,716
Hmm. It's such a pretty view.

1254
01:36:06,325 --> 01:36:09,852
I'm not afraid to be alone.

1255
01:36:09,929 --> 01:36:12,022
I love my work.

1256
01:36:12,097 --> 01:36:14,156
I think I can make it on my own.

1257
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:19,065
I would like to have a baby.

1258
01:36:19,138 --> 01:36:23,507
But I-I don't want to do it
until it's really right.

1259
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:29,538
I guess I'm looking
for somebody like Zack.

1260
01:36:29,615 --> 01:36:33,073
Somebody that my baby
could look up to.

1261
01:36:33,152 --> 01:36:36,121
Maybe I'll find him,
and maybe I won't.

1262
01:36:36,188 --> 01:36:40,124
And maybe he...
just doesn't exist.

1263
01:36:43,829 --> 01:36:47,265
I think about Zack a lot.

1264
01:36:47,333 --> 01:36:49,460
Sometimes, when I lie in bed
at night, I think about him...

1265
01:36:49,535 --> 01:36:51,935
and I know that,
at that very moment...

1266
01:36:52,004 --> 01:36:54,097
he's thinking about me too.

1267
01:36:57,843 --> 01:37:01,404
It wasn't easy to do...

1268
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,471
what he had to do.

1269
01:37:05,684 --> 01:37:08,676
But I know that he had to, and l—

1270
01:37:11,023 --> 01:37:14,789
I really have
every reason to believe—

1271
01:37:23,802 --> 01:37:25,895
I miss him.

1272
01:37:28,207 --> 01:37:31,836
I miss the lousy piano playing.

1273
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:34,777
And I miss the corny old movies.

1274
01:37:34,847 --> 01:37:37,475
And I miss his compassion.

1275
01:37:37,549 --> 01:37:40,177
And I know that's the way
it has to be.

1276
01:37:42,821 --> 01:37:45,722
I just want him to be happy.

1277
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:15,118
I'll get it.

1278
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:25,654
Hello. Josh, how are you?

1279
01:38:25,731 --> 01:38:27,995
It's good to hear your voice.

1280
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:32,128
Great. No, we're doing fine.

1281
01:38:32,204 --> 01:38:34,866
Yeah, of course you can. Hang on.
I'll, uh— I'll call him for you. Zack!

1282
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:37,807
- Yeah.
<i>- It's your brother.</i>

1283
01:38:37,876 --> 01:38:40,106
- I'll get it in here.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1284
01:38:43,048 --> 01:38:45,846
Hiya, kiddo. How's it going?

1285
01:38:45,918 --> 01:38:47,909
What's up?

1286
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:54,816
Oh, God.

1287
01:38:57,596 --> 01:38:59,621
When's the funeral?

1288
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,158
How is Claire?

1289
01:39:05,571 --> 01:39:08,335
Did she say anything
about my coming in?

1290
01:39:13,245 --> 01:39:16,544
Yeah, okay. Listen, Josh. Um—

1291
01:39:16,615 --> 01:39:19,846
I'm gonna have to think about it,
and I'll let you know, okay?

1292
01:39:29,928 --> 01:39:32,692
What's wrong?

1293
01:39:32,765 --> 01:39:35,598
Winnie Bates died.

1294
01:39:35,667 --> 01:39:38,431
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She was an old friend of Claire's and mine.

1295
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:40,495
Yeah, you told me all about her.

1296
01:39:41,673 --> 01:39:43,698
Yeah.

1297
01:39:46,478 --> 01:39:50,278
Claire just called Josh and said
that the funeral is tomorrow.

1298
01:39:53,051 --> 01:39:56,987
- Mm. So what do you think?
- I don't know.

1299
01:39:57,055 --> 01:39:59,990
She's married.
She's got a kid. She's—

1300
01:40:01,493 --> 01:40:04,155
What do you think?

1301
01:40:04,229 --> 01:40:07,062
I think you should go.

1302
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:17,275
Yeah.

1303
01:40:18,744 --> 01:40:22,805
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1304
01:40:22,881 --> 01:40:26,078
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1305
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:28,779
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

1306
01:40:28,854 --> 01:40:31,345
"He restoreth my soul.

1307
01:40:31,423 --> 01:40:35,189
"He leadeth me in the paths

1308
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:38,821

1316
01:41:03,922 --> 01:41:06,083
<i>- Amen.</i>
<i>- Amen.</i>

1317
01:41:25,077 --> 01:41:27,068
- Zack.
- Hi, Claire.

1318
01:41:27,145 --> 01:41:31,081
Hi. Don't I get a hug?

1319
01:41:36,889 --> 01:41:39,881
I thought she was...

1320
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:42,324
gonna live for another 80 years.

1321
01:41:42,394 --> 01:41:46,091
I'm really gonna miss her.

1322
01:41:46,164 --> 01:41:48,428
I still went to her house
every Tuesday night for dinner.

1323
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,333
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1324
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:55,396
"Alabaster and lapis lazuli."

1325
01:41:57,676 --> 01:41:58,970
<i>She never changed.</i>

1326
01:41:59,005 --> 01:42:00,265
<i>She never changed.</i>

1327
01:42:03,446 --> 01:42:06,279
- Tell me. How have you been?
- I've been fine. Just fine.

1328
01:42:06,349 --> 01:42:09,216
- Good.
- You look fantastic.

1329
01:42:09,286 --> 01:42:12,380
- Thank you.
- Josh has been keeping me posted.

1330
01:42:12,455 --> 01:42:14,446
- Married and a baby, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1331
01:42:14,524 --> 01:42:16,549
Larry's terrific.
I think you'd like him.

1332
01:42:16,626 --> 01:42:18,924
- What does he do?
- Architect.

1333
01:42:18,995 --> 01:42:22,590
- How long will you be here?
- My plane leaves at 5:00.

1334
01:42:24,367 --> 01:42:27,894
Why don't you stop by the house
on your way to the airport?

1335
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:30,701
I'd like that.

1336
01:42:30,774 --> 01:42:32,799
Come on.
You can follow me.

1337
01:42:54,898 --> 01:42:56,923
Come on.

1338
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,458
Oh, look at you run.
Oh, how's my big boy, huh?

1339
01:43:00,537 --> 01:43:03,267
- How's my other big boy?
- This one's pooped. The other one's raring to go.

1340
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,570
Zack, this is Larry.

1341
01:43:05,642 --> 01:43:07,633
- Larry, this is Zack.
- Zack, good to meet you.

1342
01:43:07,711 --> 01:43:09,736
- Good to meet you, Larry.
- Claire's told me a lot about you.

1343
01:43:09,813 --> 01:43:12,407
- And this is our little guy.
- Hey, how you doing, slugger? Huh?

1344
01:43:12,482 --> 01:43:14,473
I'm— I'm Rupert.

1345
01:43:16,586 --> 01:43:20,215
- What's his name?
- Rupert.

1346
01:43:22,926 --> 01:43:25,019
- Here. Wanna stay with your dad?
- Come here, Rup.

1347
01:43:25,095 --> 01:43:27,188
I'm gonna go in the house.
I'll be right back.

1348
01:43:27,263 --> 01:43:29,959
Claire had a thing about that name.
He must be the only kid in America with it.

1349
01:43:30,033 --> 01:43:33,799
- Right?
- Hey, Rupert. How you doing, huh?

1350
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:36,304
You don't know me,
but I'm an old friend of your mom.

1351
01:43:36,373 --> 01:43:39,308
- This is Zack. Can you say hi to Zack?
- Hi, Zack.

1352
01:43:39,376 --> 01:43:42,937
Hey, you're a pretty tough-looking kid.
You know that?

1353
01:43:43,012 --> 01:43:47,039
- Pick me up there.
- Pick you up here? How high? That high?

1354
01:43:47,117 --> 01:43:50,052
- Yeah! Put me down.
- Okay.

1355
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,849
- Down we go.
- Wanna play ball?

1356
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:55,516
- Yeah.
- Okay. You're staying for dinner, aren't you?

1357
01:43:55,592 --> 01:43:59,619
- Oh, thanks, Larry, but I can't.
I gotta catch a 5:00 plane.
- Okay.

1358
01:43:59,696 --> 01:44:02,358
- Just stopped by to say hello. Maybe next trip.
- Okay, let's play football!

1359
01:44:02,432 --> 01:44:06,129
- Claire seems real happy.
- She's a super lady, Zack.

1360
01:44:06,202 --> 01:44:10,138
I know.
Take good care, huh?

1361
01:44:10,206 --> 01:44:12,640
You bet.

1362
01:44:12,709 --> 01:44:15,143
Well, can we get you something to drink?
You hungry or anything?

1363
01:44:15,211 --> 01:44:17,702
No, thank you.
I gotta get going.

1364
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:19,806
- Why don't I walk you to your car?
- Okay.

1365
01:44:19,883 --> 01:44:22,511
- Take it easy, Zack.
- You too, Larry.

1366
01:44:22,585 --> 01:44:24,576
Be right in.

1367
01:44:27,323 --> 01:44:30,759
- Rupert, huh?
- Yeah.

1368
01:44:30,827 --> 01:44:33,159
- Larry seems like a good man.
- Oh, well...

1369
01:44:33,229 --> 01:44:36,824
he runs out of the room every time
I put the Gilbert and Sullivan on.

1370
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,334
He never read Rupert Brooke.
He stopped at Carl Sandburg.

1371
01:44:39,402 --> 01:44:44,362
But it's good.
It's real good, Zack.

1372
01:44:44,441 --> 01:44:46,500
How about you?
Anybody in your life?

1373
01:44:46,576 --> 01:44:51,275
Yeah. We've been together—
It's uh, almost two years now.

1374
01:44:51,347 --> 01:44:53,508
- It's really working out.
- That's good.

1375
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,574
- You know what?
- What?

1376
01:44:55,652 --> 01:44:58,883
He can't stand
Gilbert and Sullivan either.

1377
01:45:04,027 --> 01:45:06,461
- Josh tells me you're still at Sloan-Kettering.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1378
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:10,226
- How's it going?
- Fine. It's, uh—Well, it's tough work.

1379
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:13,133
- But I'm hanging in there.
- Good.

1380
01:45:14,804 --> 01:45:18,035
- Are you happy, Zack?
- Yeah.

1381
01:45:18,107 --> 01:45:20,098
Yeah, I really am.

1382
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:24,470
I guess we both did okay,
didn't we?

1383
01:45:24,547 --> 01:45:26,879
Mm-hmm.

1384
01:45:31,387 --> 01:45:35,448
I'm happy too, Zack, for both of us.

1385
01:45:37,227 --> 01:45:39,491
- So long, Claire.
- Mm.

1386
01:45:46,369 --> 01:45:48,837
So long, Zack.
