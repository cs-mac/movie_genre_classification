1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,200
THE END

2
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>Love stories are all the same.</i>

3
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,400
<i>Happy beginning and an unhappy ending.</i>
<i>My story is quite different.</i>

4
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,400
<i>My birth for example.</i>
<i>No mother, no father.</i>

5
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,000
<i>So this is me.</i>
<i>My first photo.</i>

6
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,700
<i>You were on the blanket kicking your little feet,</i>
<i>but I didn't even have legs.</i>

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,900
<i>I've only got a head.</i>

8
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,400
<i>What a state of being.</i>

9
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,300
<i>But that's getting ahead of myself.</i>

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,200
<i>At that moment I was yet unborn.</i>

11
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,400
<i>And then there was... click...</i>

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,300
<i>And I was born.</i>

13
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,200
One.

14
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
Has he got any children?

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Five - seventeen.

16
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,300
What's the time?

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,700
Be brave my son,

18
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,800
soon you'll stand before Our Lord
and the Virgin Mary.

19
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
That's disgusting.

20
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,200
One last cigarette?

21
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,000
<i>Such beauty!</i>

22
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,900
<i>It was a bit cold,</i>
<i>but the birds were singing, and this smell...</i>

23
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,300
<i>So this is the world!</i>

24
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,400
According to section...
[speaking backwards]

25
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,400
<i>Nice, very nice.</i>
<i>And it is only the beginning.</i>

26
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,800
<i>When I grow up I'll learn to play</i>
<i>violin, or start bullying cats.</i>

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
<i>Oh Lord, so many opportunities!</i>
<i>I can't wait!</i>

28
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
According to section 836
[speaking backwards]

29
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,700
<i>But there are formalities,</i>
<i>the world is not a pigeon loft,</i>

30
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,800
<i>I understood from the very beginning.</i>

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
...in the name of republic.

32
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,000
<i>Finally entered the real world.</i>
<i>Supported on both sides.</i>

33
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
<i>Left, right, left...</i>

34
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,200
<i>My legs were rubberlike,</i>
<i>I still could not walk properly,</i>

35
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,100
<i>but these gentlemen were patient.</i>

36
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,600
<i>The one with the umbrella</i>
<i>gave me life advice.</i>

37
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,900
<i>First of all they had to untie me.</i>

38
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,700
Bring out the prisoner!

39
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,800
-I hope so.
-May God forgive you.

40
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Let us pray, my son.

41
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,300
-Do you know all of the Ten Commandments?
-I threw 'em out of the window.

42
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,200
What did you do to that man?
He died?

43
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,200
Eternal life awaits only those
who sincerely regret their sins.

44
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
That would take a long time.

45
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,700
Confess, my son!
Tell me everything.

46
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,100
Get up! The execution!

47
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,200
<i>The lyceum I was brought up in</i>
<i>had an excellent reputation.</i>

48
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,500
<i>The educational system was sophisticated.</i>
<i>Boys and girls were separated.</i>

49
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,100
<i>Headquarters understood</i>
<i>our natural playfulness.</i>

50
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,600
<i>We horsed around all day long!</i>

51
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,800
<i>Through play, we were brought up</i>
<i>to become sturdy individuals,</i>

52
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,000
<i>who in future could hold positions</i>
<i>of responsibility in society.</i>

53
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,800
<i>As I was looking around</i>
<i>at the other kids,</i>

54
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,400
<i>I thought: there are generals to-be,</i>

55
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,300
<i>ministers to-be among us...</i>
<i>Who knows what else?</i>

56
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,500
<i>One educational method</i>
<i>was returning food.</i>

57
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
<i>When we handed over</i>
<i>every last grain of rice,</i>

58
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,300
<i>we all gave the same.</i>

59
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>We were untouched by selfishness,</i>
<i>and other ugly vices</i>

60
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,000
<i>which spoil one's character.</i>

61
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,900
<i>I was encouraged to be self-reliant.</i>
<i>My work became my pleasure.</i>

62
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,000
<i>I couldn't imagine my life</i>
<i>without unsticking those sacks.</i>

63
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,900
<i>Every sack was a piece of my youth.</i>

64
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,400
<i>"What are you going to be, Bedrich?"</i>
<i>my mates often asked me.</i>

65
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,600
<i>And I said: an "unsticker".</i>

66
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,500
<i>Those boyish dreams!</i>
<i>The smell of glue was everything to me.</i>

67
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,400
<i>Little did I know how fond</i>
<i>of meat and blood I'd become.</i>

68
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,000
<i>When I was almost ready</i>
<i>to enter real world,</i>

69
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
<i>I felt a desire to revolt,</i>
<i>when they said...</i>

70
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,300
-Take the condemned.
-No, please!

71
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Anything you want to say?

72
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,100
The court found the defendant guilty
and condemns him under section 382...

73
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,200
[speaking backwards]

74
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,900
...the death penalty.

75
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,800
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

76
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
What do you think, doctor?

77
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
The court will now retire
for deliberation.

78
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,600
Finally something sensible.

79
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Yes, I did it.

80
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So, you did it?
How long will you continue to deny?

81
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
-We know everything.
-But this is a lie!

82
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Silence!
Or I'll clear the court.

83
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,500
As I said before,
I didn't kill anybody!

84
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm asking for the last time:
Did you kill your wife and her lover?

85
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
I didn't notice anything.

86
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,400
And you didn't notice the
suitcase was dripping blood?

87
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,100
Landlord maybe, or the laundress.

88
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
And who put the corpse
into your suitcase?

89
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
The judge.
He already asked me.

90
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,500
-Who asked you?
-I don't know what else you want from me.

91
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,100
The judge asked me about everything.

92
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,200
One more question for the defendant.

93
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,200
My name is Bedrich Frydrych,
a butcher,

94
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,900
born on 1st of September 1889 in Trumberk.

95
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,500
What's your name and occupation?
You were born...

96
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,700
Not at all!

97
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,900
You don't suffer any mental disorders?

98
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,700
So let's begin.

99
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,600
<i>A few formalities</i>
<i>and goodbye for good.</i>

100
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,900
<i>You know, leaving the place</i>
<i>where you've learned the basics,</i>

101
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,300
<i>how to sit and how to walk,</i>
<i>where you know every grate,</i>

102
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,500
<i>it is not easy.</i>

103
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,500
<i>It's easy to say,</i>
<i>go and take care of yourself.</i>

104
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,700
<i>Fortunately they give me</i>
<i>something to start with.</i>

105
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
<i>A ring from a principal,</i>

106
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
<i>a comb,</i>

107
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,100
<i>a knife, 11.60 in change,</i>

108
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,100
<i>a watch, keys,</i>

109
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,400
<i>an older handkerchief,</i>

110
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,300
<i>but also beautiful</i>
<i>silver bracelets.</i>

111
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,300
<i>Very kind of them.</i>

112
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,800
<i>Farewell, my native courtyard, farewell.</i>

113
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,800
<i>The gates to the world stood</i>
<i>open in front of me,</i>

114
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,400
<i>with all the fairytale</i>
<i>possibilities ahead.</i>

115
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,400
You're under arrest!

116
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,300
How do you know?

117
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,000
You did this!

118
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,600
A hand!

119
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,000
This is your wife!

120
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Sadly, she isn't whole.

121
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
Cigarette?

122
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,900
Ugh!

123
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,200
A head!

124
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,000
A leg!

125
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,200
This is a woman!

126
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
I don't know.

127
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,300
Birdseed maybe.

128
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,100
What do you have in this suitcase?

129
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,700
Hand it over!

130
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,800
I've brought a fishy man
with very suspicious luggage.

131
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Buzz off!

132
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm sorry, inspector.

133
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,200
<i>This was my first experience</i>
<i>with ordinary people.</i>

134
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,400
<i>Oh, how much kindness</i>
<i>is hidden under rough skin!</i>

135
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,400
<i>They took my hand.</i>

136
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,900
<i>I couldn't hitch my wagon to a star</i>
<i>because they furnished me with a porter.</i>

137
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,900
<i>But when I desired for</i>
<i>my independency,</i>

138
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,500
<i>they let me go.</i>
<i>Oh please, please try it yourself.</i>

139
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,000
<i>How proud my guide was,</i>

140
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,400
<i>watching me doing</i>
<i>better and better.</i>

141
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,700
<i>Among people like that</i>
<i>I'll never be alone. No!</i>

142
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,100
<i>There will always be someone</i>
<i>to rely on and confer with.</i>

143
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,700
<i>Someone to share my joy with.</i>

144
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,000
<i>They knew I need a wife and handed</i>
<i>her to me. Including the suitcase.</i>

145
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>I was standing there confused</i>
<i>over my bride-to-be,</i>

146
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,500
<i>Not knowing how to express my thanks.</i>

147
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,900
<i>This good man sensed my abashment.</i>

148
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,200
<i>He backed away discretely.</i>

149
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,200
<i>Eagerly I grabbed my wife,</i>
<i>and ran towards life,</i>

150
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,900
<i>love and happiness.</i>

151
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
<i>They allotted me a flat in</i>
<i>a well-built house.</i>

152
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,100
<i>This comforted me.</i>

153
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,400
<i>I couldn't bring my wife</i>
<i>just anywhere.</i>

154
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,800
<i>She's still dismantled</i>
<i>and I didn't know much about her.</i>

155
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,200
<i>Only that she weighs about 70 kilos.</i>
<i>Not bad.</i>

156
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,300
<i>Much better than some 20 kilogram weed.</i>

157
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,700
<i>The flat looked also good.</i>

158
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,700
<i>At the lyceum we had</i>
<i>much smaller windows.</i>

159
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,100
<i>But it wasn't nearly this messy.</i>

160
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
<i>But I'm not going to clean up.</i>
<i>First I'm gonna make my wife.</i>

161
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,200
<i>We can tidy up together and</i>
<i>it'll be done in no time.</i>

162
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,000
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

163
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,700
<i>It was the first woman</i>
<i>I've ever met.</i>

164
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
<i>At first she looked</i>
<i>quite ordinary.</i>

165
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,400
<i>I used to see women from the lyceum window,</i>
<i>but they were already assembled.</i>

166
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,800
<i>I've got no instructions.</i>

167
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,000
<i>She'll be the way I put her together.</i>

168
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,200
<i>One little mistake</i>
<i>and I could create a monster,</i>

169
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,900
<i>which I couldn't allow out onto the street.</i>

170
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,600
<i>What name should I give her?</i>
<i>Natalia, or Eulalia?</i>

171
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>No, it's too long.</i>
<i>Life is short.</i>

172
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,500
<i>I've got it!</i>

173
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,000
Julia. Julia!

174
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,100
<i>I felt like the Creator,</i>
<i>like God.</i>

175
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,200
<i>And then I made up my mind.</i>

176
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
<i>I'll be a butcher!</i>

177
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>She was beautiful.</i>

178
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,300
<i>And I knew that I loved her.</i>

179
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,800
<i>She was divine.</i>

180
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,100
<i>She was glamorous.</i>

181
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,600
<i>She was assembled very well.</i>
<i>Our happiness can begin.</i>

182
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,900
<i>But not in the bathroom!</i>

183
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>Hm...</i>

184
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,700
<i>Her body was so flexible!</i>

185
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,500
<i>And light, soft and supple...</i>

186
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,900
<i>I was smitten with her supplenesses.</i>

187
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,100
<i>Hop!</i>

188
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
<i>Also the finger.</i>
<i>I almost forgot.</i>

189
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,600
<i>She might think I</i>
<i>can't count to five.</i>

190
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
<i>She was charming.</i>

191
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
<i>Those movements...</i>

192
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,800
<i>That grace, that charm...</i>

193
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,700
<i>Those gestures, that nobility,</i>
<i>that temperament!</i>

194
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,300
<i>Now to remove</i>
<i>this little blemish...</i>

195
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,300
<i>and finally I've heard</i>
<i>her first sweet words.</i>

196
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,000
You brute, you killed him!

197
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,700
<i>Then I realized that life,</i>
<i>is full of tricky surprises.</i>

198
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,200
<i>Instead of enjoying my first</i>
<i>pleasant afternoon with Julia,</i>

199
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,300
<i>something totally</i>
<i>unexpected happened.</i>

200
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,200
<i>That dandy showed up,</i>

201
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,200
<i>who apparently thought</i>
<i>that Julia was made for him.</i>

202
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,800
<i>With symptomatic arrogance</i>
<i>he flew in through the window,</i>

203
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,400
<i>just to spoil my happiness.</i>
<i>His name was Birdie.</i>

204
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,300
Watch this!

205
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,200
<i>And he watched.</i>

206
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,400
<i>I forced him to help</i>
<i>me with the tidying up.</i>

207
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,900
<i>He was quite good at it.</i>

208
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,200
<i>He took half of the room</i>
<i>and was pretty fast.</i>

209
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
Pray!

210
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,900
For salvation of your soul!

211
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,200
-Such a trash-talker!
-Mangy dog!

212
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,400
<i>But he started to act obtrusively.</i>

213
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,200
-Without any wicked intention!
-What?

214
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,800
You got into my bed?

215
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Bedrich, for heaven's sake!
He just came to play cards!

216
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>Oh, please!</i>
<i>First the bed, now cards.</i>

217
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,200
<i>What a lazybones!</i>

218
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,900
<i>This slacker was just interfering.</i>
<i>I shut him in the closet.</i>

219
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,400
<i>I hope, he's not going to<i>
</i>steal my spatterdashes!</i>

220
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,300
Like a woodshed!

221
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,500
Bedrich, be reasonable!
What will the flat look like?

222
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm gonna pluck the very last
feather out of him!

223
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,200
What are you doing, sweetheart?
It was so nice here!

224
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,300
<i>She was acting like a puppy.</i>

225
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,500
<i>I had to teach her the difference</i>
<i>between order and mess.</i>

226
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,200
-He is there! I know it!
-I don't know what you are talking about.

227
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,500
-I was crocheting just now.
-What a surprise, huh?

228
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,300
Finally I caught you napping,
you... you...

229
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,200
He is there!

230
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,000
-You're not in Pardubice, Béda?
-Open up!

231
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,200
<i>How does he impress her?</i>
<i>Maybe because he can fly...</i>

232
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,900
<i>I was never into</i>
<i>these fopperies.</i>

233
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,800
<i>But she wanted to be alone with him</i>
<i>and I was thrown out.</i>

234
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,900
I'm coming, sweetheart.

235
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,100
Who is it? Mrs. Slavickova?

236
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,900
<i>See? Now I'm Mrs. Slavickova for her.</i>

237
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,200
<i>I don't know why,</i>
<i>but it's wiser to retreat,</i>

238
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>I don't want to start</i>
<i>the marriage with a fight.</i>

239
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,900
<i>It's not Julia's fault,</i>
<i>she's been there only a few minutes.</i>

240
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,300
<i>I had to explain her,</i>
<i>it's not suitable behaviour</i>

241
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,100
<i>for young lady to throw</i>
<i>her husband out of a flat,</i>

242
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,200
<i>making excuses about Pardubice.</i>

243
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,900
-Julie, you're awakening a beast inside of me!
-Impossible.

244
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
He is sitting on the train now.

245
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,300
Are you sure your husband won't return?

246
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,200
-I can't resist the passion.
-I'm a married woman!

247
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,600
I'll be ashamed. No!

248
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
-No...
-Don't resist!

249
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,600
-What are you doing, Jene?
-Let's make ourselves comfortable.

250
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,400
This is not possible Jene, no, no, no...

251
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
No.

252
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
This will be much nicer.

253
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,400
Where are you dragging me?
It was so innocent.

254
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,700
No, this can't be, Jene!

255
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,500
-A souvenir.
-Oh...

256
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,400
A ring!

257
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,900
Oh, you didn't have to.

258
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,000
Why? Might there be something wrong with that?

259
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Excellent!

260
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm afraid we will cross
the bounds of pure friendship.

261
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,000
Do you know what I'm dreaming of?

262
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,500
Kissing you at least once in my life, Julia.

263
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
I baked those!

264
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Delicious!

265
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,100
Wonderful, really wonderful.

266
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I'm glad you like it.

267
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,400
I always have an appetite.

268
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
Special!

269
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,600
Delicious!

270
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
Do you like it?

271
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,500
Excellent!

272
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,400
A delicacy!

273
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,500
Well done!

274
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,400
Thank you, Julia.

275
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,900
Okay, you can call me Julia.

276
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,000
I'd like to call you Julia.

277
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,300
And you can call me... Jenik.

278
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,600
Or dominoes.

279
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,700
Why don't we play game of cards,
Mrs. Frydrych?

280
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
There's nothing to hide Mr. Birdie.
You've just come for a visit.

281
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,000
Your husband should be happy
that we've become friends.

282
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,200
<i>I started to get nervous.</i>
<i>What if there was familiarities?</i>

283
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,400
<i>Julia was just in her nightie,</i>
<i>what if he wants to dress her up?</i>

284
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,800
<i>No! He can't be that daring!</i>

285
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,600
Do you mind if I pull down the blinds a bit?

286
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,500
It's by my uncle,
he died of gout.

287
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,600
Lovely!

288
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,800
-Oh, how noble!
-We can sit in the lounge,

289
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,300
-Do you like coffee?
-Not at all.

290
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,300
It's perfect orderliness.

291
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,600
Come in. Please don't look around.
I didn't expect you.

292
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
It's little messy.

293
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,800
-It means you're alone.
-Pig.

294
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,800
-Calf?
-My husband went to the relatives. To butcher.

295
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,600
This is something for you, flowers.

296
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,800
Is your husband at home?

297
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,500
Welcome.

298
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,200
-That's lovely!
-Hm...

299
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Hello!

300
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,000
Coming! Just a second!

301
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
<i>At last!</i>

302
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,300
<i>But my relief was</i>
<i>soon jolted.</i>

303
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,900
<i>Isn't it suspicious?</i>
<i>He arrived without a tie,</i>

304
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,500
<i>and now he is strutting around</i>
<i>in my spatterdashes?</i>

305
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,400
<i>Usually I'm good-tempered,</i>
<i>but this is too much.</i>

306
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,500
<i>My own wife is handing</i>
<i>out my wardrobe?</i>

307
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,600
<i>There should be a good reason.</i>

308
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,500
<i>Yes, no doubt.</i>
<i>In these tragic moments</i>

309
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,000
<i>of my life, a rival</i>
<i>between Julia and I.</i>

310
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,400
<i>At home I found out that I have</i>
<i>a child. It struck me numb.</i>

311
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,600
<i>Is Birdie behind this,</i>
<i>or had I just not noticed before?</i>

312
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,100
<i>Damn discursiveness!</i>

313
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,800
<i>I had to pretend</i>
<i>that nothing was amiss.</i>

314
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,600
Ta ta, sweetie.

315
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Papa's off to slay a piggy.

316
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah! I can't wait
to see that cousin.

317
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,100
Excuse me! The woods are full of them,
we tramped through them.

318
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
You bought mushrooms, hmm?

319
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,000
-What are you gonna do?
-My cousin.

320
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
Where?

321
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,500
In the woods, with my cousin.

322
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,500
You're here at last!

323
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,700
I'd like to know where
you've been all this time!

324
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,900
I was playing with the kid
instead of going to Pardubice!

325
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,600
<i>Calm down, I said to myself.</i>

326
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,100
<i>Let's check this cousin out.</i>

327
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,400
It annoys me a lot,

328
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,000
that we have to lie,

329
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,900
ma'am.

330
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,800
True friendship goes hand in
hand with truth. Doesn't it?

331
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,400
-My cousin.
-Whom will you say you've been with?

332
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,900
I think I stepped on a splinter.

333
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,800
Really?
You can't imagine how glad I am.

334
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,600
You can visit me,
my husband is going somewhere.

335
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,100
<i>It's true!</i>
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

336
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,100
<i>But there's no point in covering my eyes</i>
<i>from the truth, however ruthless.</i>

337
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,900
I feel like a little girl.
Do you like me?

338
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,500
Yes, it's disgusting.

339
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,700
Sand is better.

340
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,600
There used to be no mud at the lake,
do you remember?

341
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,000
Hop!

342
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,900
My husband can never do that.

343
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,800
<i>She was right.</i>

344
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,900
<i>Even as a child I didn't like</i>
<i>to jump legs first out of water.</i>

345
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
<i>One never knows where one's gonna</i>
<i>land. You could jump on somebody.</i>

346
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,600
<i>I think it's irresponsible,</i>
<i>but Mr. Birdie's view seems to be different.</i>

347
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,100
<i>That's typical.</i>

348
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,600
Don't you feel sorry for her?
Such a beautiful fish!

349
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,900
Just like you Mrs. Frydrych.

350
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,200
What a gorgeous day!

351
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,000
-There's strange magic in it.
-It's just a matter of practice.

352
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,800
-Goodness, where do you get all these fish?
-<i>I knew. I knew right where they were coming from.</i>

353
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,300
<i>He earned his living this way!</i>
<i>He steals from poor animals in the zoo.</i>

354
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,400
<i>He was hiding his loot</i>
<i>in the pram of our Pavlinka.</i>

355
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,500
<i>He doesn't care that she could be</i>
<i>in serious trouble if found out.</i>

356
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,200
Oh, how generous they are.

357
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,600
Trainers give them
tons of fish.

358
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,100
It's not easy to teach them
such an unbelievable trick.

359
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,800
Do you think every animal
can learn this, Mr. Birdie?

360
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,200
A whole loaf.
It's nothing for him.

361
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,100
May no one spot us.
It's strictly forbidden.

362
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,900
That's why I come here for lunch.
It's very cheap.

363
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,400
I see, but why among the animals?

364
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,600
-I was anxious to see you again.
-What did you say?

365
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,800
You're exaggerating.

366
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,000
Since I almost drowned,

367
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,900
I've been thinking about you all the time.

368
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,400
Two o'clock exactly.

369
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,700
-I'm punctual, am I not?
-Hmm, rather hungry.

370
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,400
-Those animals are violent, did you hear?
-As I said, just like you.

371
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,000
I didn't understand.
Can you speak louder.

372
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700
<i>That day I noticed</i>

373
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,300
<i>a trace of alienation towards</i>
<i>Mr. Birdie on the part of my wife.</i>

374
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,200
<i>The reason is pretty clear.</i>

375
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,000
<i>His petty theft removed</i>
<i>the rose tint from Julia's eyes.</i>

376
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,100
<i>To steal from a bank is okay.</i>
<i>But to pauperise a hippo</i>

377
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,100
<i>is a different story.</i>

378
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,300
<i>This mute creature,</i>
<i>so vulnerable,</i>

379
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,800
<i>helped my wife to understand,</i>

380
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>that cruel villain can't</i>
<i>compensate for a husband</i>

381
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,900
<i>who's been working hard</i>
<i>to feed his family</i>

382
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,300
<i>and make his wife happy.</i>

383
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,100
"Fresh meat delivery"

384
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,200
<i>I felt I'd won.</i>

385
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,800
<i>In a few days only fragments of</i>
<i>memories of Mr. Birdie will remain.</i>

386
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,000
<i>Maybe a date or two</i>
<i>and then it's over.</i>

387
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,700
Thank you.

388
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,000
-Thank you.
-Okay, you can go then.

389
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,600
-At the lion's cage, two o'clock.
-Your wife?

390
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,900
She's got a date with the other man.

391
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,800
What a surprise!
It was Franta's duty, wasn't it?

392
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,900
Can I go to the zoo?!

393
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,000
Boss.

394
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,600
<i>I was happy again.</i>

395
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,800
<i>The work was pleasurable. The cows</i>
<i>started to grow under my hands,</i>

396
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
<i>and I was thinking</i>
<i>about my sweetheart.</i>

397
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,700
<i>I was thinking about our</i>
<i>plans for the future.</i>

398
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,700
<i>When Birdie disappears,</i>
<i>I'll buy clothes for Julia.</i>

399
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,700
<i>A nice tight dress</i>
<i>which fits her closely.</i>

400
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,600
<i>I also decided</i>
<i>Juli will get a maid.</i>

401
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
<i>So she can have a lie down</i>
<i>in peace.</i>

402
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,700
<i>She can get up after ten</i>
<i>then go shopping,</i>

403
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,100
<i>or for slaughter,</i>
<i>uh, I mean a stroll.</i>

404
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,300
<i>We can spend our holidays</i>
<i>somewhere far away.</i>

405
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,800
<i>Julia loved mountains.</i>

406
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,000
<i>And I wasn't against it.</i>

407
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,700
-Oh, that's amazing!
-<i>Yeah, it is amazing.</i>

408
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
<i>It was amazing.</i>

409
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,300
<i>Because soon will be</i>
<i>the end of Julia's acquaintance.</i>

410
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,600
<i>Mr. Birdie's stumble in the zoo</i>
<i>built an obstacle between them,</i>

411
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,800
<i>and Julia wasn't willing</i>
<i>to overcome it.</i>

412
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,300
<i>Finally, the day</i>
<i>of their last meeting.</i>

413
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,900
<i>He thought I couldn't see him.</i>

414
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,200
<i>But I was closely observing</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

415
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,800
<i>This tragedy was a pleasure to watch.</i>
<i>You should've seen his rueful face!</i>

416
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,600
<i>That's your problem, man!</i>

417
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,600
<i>That's for flying</i>
<i>into the third floor!</i>

418
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,400
<i>Now you're gonna find out</i>
<i>what true love really means.</i>

419
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,900
<i>The world is full of swindlers</i>
<i>and lazybones,</i>

420
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,800
<i>who pursue their mingy goals,</i>

421
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,600
<i>but true love will always prevail.</i>

422
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
Oh!

423
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,500
Horse butchery, my dear.

424
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,900
-Whatcha you gonna buy, Béda?
-A chimney-sweeper.

425
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,000
-What? Who did you meet in the morning?
-What a fortune!

426
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,800
<i>I could hardly forget this day.</i>

427
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
<i>It brought me top-notch luck,</i>
<i>but also great disaster.</i>

428
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,800
<i>That day at the races</i>
<i>I gambled away all my money.</i>

429
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
<i>Well, that's life.</i>

430
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,400
I'll drop you a note.

431
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Get lost!

432
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,200
-You're very generous.
-Me? Yes.

433
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,800
Do you think of me and
the lake sometimes?

434
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
You know how much I love horses?

435
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
What a surprise, Mr. Birdie?

436
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,900
<i>Mr. Birdie left our life,</i>
<i>but poverty arrived instead.</i>

437
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,000
<i>It was hard to pretend,</i>
<i>that nothing happened.</i>

438
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,900
<i>I was heartbroken</i>
<i>giving away</i>

439
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:43,800
<i>hard earned money, which could</i>
<i>secure our happy childhood.</i>

440
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,000
<i>But when the stress overcomes us,</i>
<i>there was our Pavlinka.</i>

441
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,200
<i>She was really talented.</i>

442
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,500
<i>She had a sense for</i>
<i>our financial problems.</i>

443
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,100
<i>All she needed was a small fire.</i>

444
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,500
<i>She could pull bills out of it.</i>

445
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,500
<i>Sometimes a hundred koruna,</i>

446
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,500
<i>or at least five.</i>

447
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,800
<i>Thanks to her we were</i>
<i>doing better and better.</i>

448
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,600
<i>She was able to give us almost 2 litres</i>
<i>of milk per day. That's 700 litres a year.</i>

449
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,800
<i>After a while we obtained</i>
<i>quite a fortune.</i>

450
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,800
<i>She was rewarded well.</i>
<i>We tried hard.</i>

451
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
<i>We patiently sucked</i>
<i>the air from balloons,</i>

452
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:39,200
<i>just to hear laughs of excitement</i>
<i>from this humble little being.</i>

453
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,300
<i>But soon there was an end to our joy.</i>

454
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,100
<i>Our lovely child got</i>
<i>smaller and smaller.</i>

455
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,900
<i>She can't start fires anymore,</i>
<i>she lost her teeth and can't walk.</i>

456
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,400
<i>She lay down more often,</i>
<i>and finally can't even get up.</i>

457
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,500
<i>She's only 3 kilos.</i>

458
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,700
<i>The end was inevitable.</i>

459
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,100
<i>One day we lost</i>
<i>Pavlinka for good.</i>

460
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,500
<i>Our mourning</i>
<i>didn't have to last long.</i>

461
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,700
<i>We receive a message that our</i>
<i>father-in-law is going to be born.</i>

462
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,000
<i>Julia won't be an orphan anymore.</i>

463
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,200
<i>Of course, we were curious</i>
<i>as to what he will be like.</i>

464
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,800
<i>They said he was gonna be a very rich man.</i>
<i>At that moment he was elegantly wrapped.</i>

465
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,800
<i>Full of anticipation,</i>
<i>we brought him home.</i>

466
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,500
<i>We couldn't be present</i>
<i>for his birth.</i>

467
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,800
<i>I was with Julia far away,</i>
<i>while he was still in the incubator.</i>

468
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,100
<i>News of his birth reached us</i>
<i>at a mountain lake.</i>

469
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,100
<i>While we toasted</i>
<i>to his happy life,</i>

470
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,700
<i>I realised how lucky I was.</i>

471
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,300
<i>It was wise of me to excuse</i>
<i>this little misdemeanour of Julia.</i>

472
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,000
<i>My deliberation finally paid off.</i>

473
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,400
<i>We were happy.</i>

474
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,600
<i>You can surely understand</i>
<i>the outburst of anger in my heart,</i>

475
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,600
<i>when this dandy</i>
<i>appeared again</i>

476
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,600
<i>to take my Julia.</i>

477
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,100
<i>I was astonished by his arrogance.</i>

478
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,200
<i>Hurt deep inside, I kept</i>
<i>asking myself,</i>

479
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,200
<i>why is he doing it?</i>

480
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,900
<i>Does he really think</i>

481
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,800
<i>I'll sit here with idle hands,</i>
<i>watching my happiness crumple?</i>

482
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm so happy that you were rescued.

483
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,600
-Hm...
-Oh!

484
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,000
<i>And then I made up my mind.</i>

485
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,500
<i>This man must die!</i>

486
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,200
<i>It's horrible to say that,</i>
<i>but it must be done.</i>

487
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,200
<i>Otherwise this gadabout</i>
<i>will never learn his lesson.</i>

488
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,000
He's alive!

489
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,800
<i>I didn't feel like a murderer</i>
<i>at all.</i>

490
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,800
<i>No, no, no!</i>

491
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,500
<i>I wasn't murdering in secret.</i>

492
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,900
<i>I decided to drown him in public,</i>
<i>like adulteresses were drowned in the past.</i>

493
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,500
<i>It didn't surprise me much</i>
<i>that the others approved of this.</i>

494
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,000
<i>He was well known, this Birdie!</i>

495
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,900
<i>They knew him as irritating vermin.</i>

496
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,800
<i>They were glad.</i>
<i>He'll finally stop being a bother.</i>

497
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,300
<i>That's it!</i>

498
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,400
Béda...

499
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,400
Béda!

500
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,100
Someone is drowning!

501
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,600
<i>I didn't feel guilty.</i>

502
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,800
<i>But Julia gobsmacked me.</i>

503
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,800
That was quite a stunt, Béda.

504
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,400
<i>It was almost unbelievable.</i>

505
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,200
<i>She was laughing!</i>

506
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,600
<i>Only moments after the man for whom</i>
<i>she was willing to betray the family</i>

507
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,300
<i>disappeared into the waves!</i>

508
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,000
<i>Her treachery shocked me.</i>

509
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Trump!

510
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,300
<i>I run away from the place where</i>
<i>I discovered the true face of my wife,</i>

511
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,000
<i>the wife I loved until yesterday.</i>

512
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,800
<i>Under the circumstances</i>
<i>we can't live together anymore.</i>

513
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,000
<i>Yes, I will leave Julia.</i>

514
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,900
<i>I will leave her when</i>
<i>we arrive home.</i>

515
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,700
You have to eat something
before your difficult journey.

516
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,000
I don't need a remedy, Julinka.

517
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,600
-Give it to me!
-Just a second, Béda!

518
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,400
-Patience is the best remedy.
-<i>She was crazy.</i>

519
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,400
<i>I was hungry.</i>

520
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,100
<i>Any other woman could roast a turkey,</i>
<i>she couldn't even butter bread.</i>

521
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,200
One moment!

522
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,000
<i>She was acting like a lunatic.</i>

523
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,300
What's taking you so long?

524
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
I'm almost blind from hunger!

525
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,500
Julinka!

526
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,400
Juli!

527
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,800
I'm your kitchen girl, eh?

528
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,900
That too, but rather a fried egg.

529
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,900
-Do you like sardines?
-Hm.

530
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:58,400
Also Prague Woman, Her Daily 
and Czech Word.

531
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,400
The landlord will take care of it.

532
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,900
We have to cancel the milk.

533
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,000
So, what is Bedrisek going to eat?

534
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,000
A dressing gown.

535
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,400
-Looking for something?
-Soft-boiled eggs.

536
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,900
-I'm gonna make a delicious breakfast.
-I wonder what.

537
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,600
You know what? Good morning.

538
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,600
<i>Our last wedding night began.</i>

539
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,800
<i>It wasn't easy</i>
<i>restoring her virginity.</i>

540
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,600
You hurt me a lot.

541
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,900
Other way around, Julia.

542
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,200
I won't be your baby girl anymore.

543
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,500
-And that's my point.
-Why don't you think about my happiness?

544
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,400
-A few seconds more.
-Please, Bedrichu, what are you doing?

545
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,300
-Are you a virgin?
-No, I don't want to!

546
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,200
-I don't want to, Béda, no...
-You'll get used to it.

547
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,100
Turn the lights off, Béda!

548
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,800
-Do you really love me?
-Not at all.

549
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,600
-I'm afraid, it will be awful.
-You're gonna like it, believe me.

550
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,900
Why are you hurrying so much?
I'm starting to dislike it.

551
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,400
It makes me happy.

552
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Calm down, sweetheart.

553
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,800
No man saw me in
my nightie before.

554
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,100
You can't be serious.
Another button...

555
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,700
I'll be ashamed.

556
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,400
No, this is terrible.
What are you gonna do?

557
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,800
Take your time,
it was so nice until now.

558
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,800
No, no... Béda!

559
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,000
We can sleep separately
today, don't you think?

560
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,400
-Yes and forever.
-Do you love your baby girl?

561
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
<i>Finally I can return</i>
<i>Juli to her family.</i>

562
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,900
<i>I can do it with honour.</i>

563
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,300
<i>She was intacta.</i>

564
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,100
<i>Cheers and questions were endless.</i>
<i>What was her marriage like?</i>

565
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,500
<i>When she goes to the pulpit, will she</i>
<i>be looking forward to her innocence?</i>

566
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,900
<i>Topsy-turvy, you can imagine.</i>

567
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,100
<i>When all those aunties, nieces and</i>
<i>cousins come to see</i>

568
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,300
<i>how a married woman enters</i>
<i>single status.</i>

569
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:09,000
[speaking backwards]

570
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
...my poor wife Bozka...

571
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:16,000
[speaking backwards]

572
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,100
Let's eat!

573
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,700
<i>I grasp the opportunity to get rid of</i>
<i>the junk that hampered me for years.</i>

574
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,800
-Very nice, thank you.
-Thank you.

575
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,400
Thanks, really!

576
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,900
Thank you.

577
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,600
A moorcock, thank you.

578
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,400
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Amálka.

579
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,400
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

580
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,100
-Oh, a big knife, what for?
-Thank you, Auntie.

581
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,500
It's for killing.
For the meat, Julia, the meat.

582
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,300
<i>Only formalities</i>
<i>before God remained.</i>

583
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,200
God bless you.
May you live a happy life.

584
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,800
What God puts together,
man cannot separate.

585
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,500
-I do.
-I'm asking you, Julia, here in the presence of God,

586
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,100
do you take Bedrich to be your husband?

587
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,300
-I do.
-I'm asking you, Bedrich, here in the presence of God,

588
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,300
do you take Julia to be your wife?

589
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,500
-No.
-You're not too uncomfortable?

590
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,900
<i>One part of my life is finished.</i>

591
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,300
<i>Now I was drinking from</i>
<i>the cup of freedom.</i>

592
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,000
<i>I took the last trinkets</i>
<i>I'd forgotten about.</i>

593
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,900
<i>It's time to say goodbye to</i>
<i>the biggest mistake of my life.</i>

594
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,800
<i>Farewell, may we never meet again.</i>

595
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,700
<i>At this moment my heart</i>
<i>started pounding like mad.</i>

596
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,700
<i>I spotted a girl</i>
<i>who put a spell on me.</i>

597
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,500
<i>Her name was Anezka.</i>
<i>She was a window-dresser.</i>

598
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,800
<i>I fell in love with her immediately.</i>

599
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,700
<i>From that moment I could only think</i>
<i>about how to ask for her hand.</i>

600
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,000
<i>Is it just coincidence, or my destiny?</i>

601
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,300
<i>When I saw her lovingly</i>
<i>touching those limbs,</i>

602
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,100
<i>I knew she could understand</i>
<i>my complicated soul.</i>

603
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,600
<i>She will be a better</i>
<i>wife than Julia.</i>

604
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,100
<i>I didn't know how many obstacles</i>
<i>I'd have to overcome</i>

605
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,900
<i>before we could embrace each other.</i>

606
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,300
<i>I celebrated my freedom</i>
<i>a little bit wildly.</i>

607
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,600
<i>So what, I'll be okay in few days,</i>
<i>and start my new life with Anezka.</i>

608
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,400
<i>But that horror of seeing</i>
<i>Julia next to me again.</i>

609
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,600
<i>It can't be!</i>

610
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,600
<i>This must be a bad dream!</i>
<i>What is going on here?</i>

611
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,500
<i>Huh! Father-in-law is here too!</i>

612
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,400
<i>I hope he doesn't want to return Julia.</i>
<i>Although, he doesn't look like he does.</i>

613
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,900
So, my children.

614
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,500
If I am correct,
you already made up your mind,

615
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,200
-and don't get in my way.
-I'm afraid to say,

616
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,700
-that Mr. Bedrich is right.
-If ma'am was reasonable,

617
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,500
this wouldn't happen.

618
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,900
<i>Father-in-law had no objections.</i>
<i>But disaster struck!</i>

619
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,200
<i>Just at that moment,</i>
<i>mother-in-law was born.</i>

620
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,800
It had been so much better for her.
She was a nice and quiet person.

621
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,900
<i>Every time I see new life begin,</i>

622
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,600
<i>no matter if it is a chickling</i>
<i>or a crocodile I'm happy.</i>

623
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,300
<i>But not this time.</i>
<i>I felt something wicked.</i>

624
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,400
Help!

625
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,900
Over my dead body!
Fortunately I'm still here!

626
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,100
I cannot allow something like this!

627
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,900
Surely not, what are you saying?

628
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,500
I made up my mind,
and I will do what I want.

629
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,400
I'm gonna thwart your plans!
You can be sure!

630
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,300
You'll see who I am!

631
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,100
[speaking backwards]

632
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,900
<i>She had the gift of a gab!</i>

633
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,200
<i>She's not even in school yet.</i>
<i>She'll grow to be a vixen.</i>

634
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,100
<i>Another good reason to get</i>
<i>away from this family.</i>

635
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,200
<i>If not by fair means then...</i>

636
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,500
<i>I'll return Julia by force</i>
<i>and get away.</i>

637
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,600
<i>If one can kidnap,</i>
<i>then one can give back.</i>

638
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,800
<i>It was cunning.</i>
<i>Julia blended in with the geese,</i>

639
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
<i>so her parents wouldn't know</i>
<i>she was nearing their house.</i>

640
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,600
<i>Julia had no idea</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

641
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,800
<i>That dull creature thought</i>
<i>that it was only fun.</i>

642
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,900
<i>She's sound asleep</i>
<i>to the world.</i>

643
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,800
<i>They will be surprised</i>
<i>to find Julia in her bedroom.</i>

644
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,600
<i>It was a great success.</i>

645
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,200
<i>Now I'm free to be</i>
<i>with my beloved.</i>

646
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,100
<i>Hurry up! Anezka's waiting!</i>

647
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,800
<i>But alas!</i>

648
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,200
<i>How could I have anticipated that</i>
<i>they'd send Julia back in no time?</i>

649
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,100
<i>It was like a game of ping pong.</i>

650
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,100
<i>Before I could pack my things,</i>
<i>she was back again.</i>

651
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,000
<i>They were faster than me.</i>
<i>I was desperate.</i>

652
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,300
Oh Bedrich,
we are together again.

653
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That's terrible.

654
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
My parents are opposed to our love.

655
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,100
<i>My ex-wife was still</i>
<i>gibbering about love.</i>

656
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,600
<i>They probably talked her down.</i>

657
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,500
<i>Seems there is only one solution.</i>
<i>Mutual settlement.</i>

658
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,100
Our decision is definitive.

659
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
I won't budge an inch.

660
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,800
-I have the character for this.
-What an assurance!

661
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,400
Do you know what it means
to our family?

662
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,700
Well, cows, pigs and stuff like that.
Simply the stock, Mr. Councillor.

663
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,500
Bedrich slaughters calves
you know, mother?

664
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,500
That's my interest too. Just like any
good mother I know what is important.

665
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,500
This is nice indeed, but
I want to know something else.

666
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,500
What is your occupation,
Mr. Frydrych?

667
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,800
Memories, but primarily the
grandchildren Mrs. Councillor.

668
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,300
I knew it.

669
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,200
But what does that leave us?

670
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,300
Your daughter.
Julie.

671
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,500
Far from it!

672
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,600
And what it is Mr. Frydrych?
Carpet or something?

673
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,800
Probably some antique, right?

674
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,900
Mr. and Mrs. Councillor,
I have a fervid request.

675
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,600
Our daughter hinted that you
have some kind of request.

676
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,600
Yes, a few drops of rum.

677
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,600
Do you want to pour
something into your tea?

678
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,500
Well, Julinka, propose
something to our guest.

679
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,500
I hope you'll be a friend
of our family forever.

680
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,900
-No way!
-We should make public your deed.

681
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,700
You're a brave man.

682
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,900
Please, come in.

683
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,100
Good evening madam.
Frydrych.

684
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,400
Papa, Mammy,
This is Mr. Bedrich, my rescuer.

685
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,800
Who could it be?

686
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,100
<i>I went to the cabaret.</i>

687
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,900
<i>This one is experimental but my</i>
<i>favourite for their moral efforts.</i>

688
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,700
<i>Girls are dressing up in</i>
<i>warm clothes, set to music.</i>

689
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,100
<i>Sometimes rheumatically.</i>
<i>I was thrilled.</i>

690
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,000
<i>Suddenly I was petrified!</i>

691
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,900
<i>Julie was there again.</i>
<i>I felt like swooning.</i>

692
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,800
My life is desolate
when I know you're not mine.

693
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Are we all supposed
to commit suicide?

694
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,900
Why not? You can start.

695
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,900
Julie, don't you want
to have a serious talk?

696
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
I think I could never do that.

697
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,100
<i>I almost succumbed to despair,</i>

698
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,200
<i>but the man on stage</i>
<i>gave me an idea.</i>

699
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,400
<i>Julia must disappear.</i>

700
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,400
<i>I remembered how easily</i>
<i>I got rid of Mr. Birdie.</i>

701
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,500
<i>Ok, one more murder.</i>
<i>There's no other way.</i>

702
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,400
<i>I needed an alibi.</i>

703
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,600
<i>My love, your suicidal tendencies</i>
<i>are tearing my heart apart.</i>

704
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,000
<i>I love you and</i>
<i>would like to persuade you.</i>

705
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,200
<i>Come to the cabaret tonight.</i>
<i>You need to have fun.</i>

706
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,300
<i>Loving Bedrich Frydrych.</i>

707
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,400
<i>But cautiousness made</i>
<i>me destroy this alibi.</i>

708
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,000
<i>I covered all my tracks.</i>

709
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,300
<i>It was time for action.</i>

710
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,900
<i>This place was great,</i>
<i>not a soul around.</i>

711
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,400
<i>It will look like a suicide.</i>

712
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,900
<i>But she fights back,</i>
<i>so I was unable to do it.</i>

713
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,000
<i>Ok.</i>

714
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,000
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

715
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,800
<i>They had to follow their schedule</i>
<i>and didn't want to go back.</i>

716
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,400
<i>My fault.</i>
<i>Next time I'll be faster.</i>

717
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,600
<i>Julia just turned deaf a little,</i>
<i>but that was all.</i>

718
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,100
<i>My next plan was more canny.</i>

719
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,700
<i>And...</i>

720
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,600
<i>...success!</i>

721
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,000
<i>Julia! Oh my god!</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

722
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,400
<i>Don't do it!</i>

723
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,600
<i>She did it.</i>
<i>My second attempt was a failure.</i>

724
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,400
<i>As a hitman I was useless.</i>

725
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,600
<i>Downcast with failure and tormented by</i>
<i>desire I decided to take an action.</i>

726
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,000
<i>I simply moved Anezka</i>
<i>the window-dresser to my place.</i>

727
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,800
<i>She was truly touched</i>
<i>that she could stay.</i>

728
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,000
<i>Seeing her trousseau,</i>
<i>I recalled distant events.</i>

729
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,200
<i>My heart ached.</i>

730
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,500
<i>Why didn't they have this</i>
<i>girl in stock at the time?</i>

731
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,900
<i>Everything would be different.</i>

732
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,800
<i>But what happened next!?</i>

733
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,400
<i>That tiresome Julia was here again.</i>
<i>It was the last straw!</i>

734
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,000
What have you done to me,
Mr. Frydrych?

735
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,600
-I thought that you loved me.
-Out of the question!

736
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,000
-I will finally kick you out!
-You promised me a wedding!

737
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,200
Indeed! Of course!

738
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,800
You allow her to slouch here...

739
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,200
Enough!

740
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,200
<i>My Anezka was simply good.</i>

741
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:59,900
<i>For all the trouble Julia caused,</i>
<i>she gave her several wiglets.</i>

742
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,200
-<i>I had to call her to order.</i>
-That's enough!

743
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,500
<i>She could give away everything.</i>

744
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,200
-You have another?
-You have another!

745
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,500
Who is this woman, Mr. Frydrych?

746
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,900
What is she doing here?

747
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,900
That gimmer? Bedrich!

748
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Anezka, I told you not to come.

749
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,600
<i>Well! Julia expelled</i>
<i>my lovely Anezka?</i>

750
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,900
<i>I was mad!</i>

751
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,400
<i>I will kill her right now!</i>
<i>With anything at hand.</i>

752
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
<i>This is it!</i>

753
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,800
<i>Soon, she will kick the bucket.</i>

754
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,400
<i>And I can run after Anezka</i>
<i>screaming: come back!</i>

755
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:01,600
<i>The urge to stab her</i>
<i>throat was strong.</i>

756
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,300
<i>Here!</i>

757
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,400
<i>Okay...</i>

758
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,900
<i>Little bit deeper.</i>

759
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,000
<i>Okay!</i>

760
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,900
<i>The bone is in there,</i>

761
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,500
<i>Just to nail it in a little...</i>

762
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,400
<i>Here we go!</i>

763
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,800
<i>Okay...</i>
<i>But wait!</i>

764
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,000
<i>I assure myself via palpation.</i>
<i>The finger is the most delicate instrument.</i>

765
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,500
<i>Finished.</i>

766
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,300
<i>Now, I'll just wait</i>
<i>for her last breath.</i>

767
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,300
That's okay, Mr. Frydrych.

768
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,800
Bonelet maybe.

769
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,000
It's delicious.

770
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,200
That taste!

771
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,600
<i>Wellaway!</i>
<i>She had the lives of a cat.</i>

772
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,400
<i>She could even swallow</i>
<i>a combine harvester.</i>

773
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,400
<i>My mind was possessed with one thought.</i>
<i>What if she's immortal?</i>

774
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,800
You're neat-handed.

775
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,300
You're experienced.

776
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,500
<i>What irony!</i>

777
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,600
<i>Once I was able to assemble great things.</i>
<i>Not these miserable tiddlers.</i>

778
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,700
<i>-What a shame!</i>
-You're not just a fireman.

779
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,200
You're also a cook.

780
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,700
<i>That insult helped me to come up</i>
<i>with fantastic idea,</i>

781
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,000
<i>That doesn't come to mind every day.</i>

782
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:52,500
<i>Now I was sure that Julia</i>
<i>was finally finished.</i>

783
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,900
When I saw you for the first
time you had it on, Frydrych.

784
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,000
I felt that it was the start of
something beautiful,

785
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,400
-something eternal.
-You were wrong,

786
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:17,000
-only a few seconds and it'll all be over.
-This ladder is so long.

787
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,700
But in your arms I feel safe.
Nothing can happen to me.

788
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,700
-Well, we will see.
-The damage will be substantial, won't it?

789
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,500
I'm starting to believe that you
were sent to my arms by fate.

790
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,100
Maybe it was the cat.

791
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,200
Someone had to start the fire.

792
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,800
It was horrible!
What if I died in the fire?

793
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,400
-It doesn't matter, miss.
-I owe you my life.

794
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:50,500
Who are you, brave fireman?

795
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,800
Close your eyes to
avoid getting dizzy.

796
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,400
Oh my god!
It's so high.

797
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,100
Don't be afraid.

798
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,600
The worst is behind you.

799
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Hop!

800
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,000
<i>May your ashes rest in peace, Julca.</i>

801
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,400
<i>Free again, I chased after Anezka.</i>

802
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,900
<i>But when I reach my goal</i>
<i>I was overwhelmingly hesitant.</i>

803
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,100
<i>I knew that I'd be punished for</i>
<i>killing Julia. Jail awaits me.</i>

804
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,600
<i>It was a long goodbye</i>
<i>with my true love.</i>

805
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,100
<i>I was under the conviction</i>
<i>that she'd wait for me.</i>

806
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,700
<i>I spent the next 30 years in prison.</i>

807
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,200
<i>It was tough,</i>
<i>just water and bread...</i>

808
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,700
<i>I survived thanks to</i>
<i>my love of Anezka,</i>

809
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,100
<i>who waited</i>
<i>30 long years for me.</i>

810
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,200
<i>And there was the day</i>
<i>when the gates of prison opened!</i>

811
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,900
<i>Us both with greyish hair,</i>
<i>old man and old woman,</i>

812
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,700
<i>tramping through senility,</i>
<i>babbling sweet nonsense.</i>

813
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,500
<i>Happy at last!</i>
