Some players increase
their chatter when nervous or anxious-

3
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,931
This usually happens with extroverts,

Furrowing of the forehead.

7
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,762
Furrowing of the forehead
is a good indicator

8
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,049
that something is amiss
or the person is insecure.

9
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,606
It is also seen when
people are concentrating

10
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,001
or trying to make sense of something.

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,768
It is usually associated with
doubt, weakness, or concern.

Number 13. Sneaking a nose touch.

rubbing the nose with the index Hngen..

I'm from all over,
but I knew Tony Roundtree up at Detroit.

This guy, he loved to play poker,

but he kept dodging
my invitations to play in the casinos.

Apparently Tony, he had a little bit of
a gambling problem before I met him.

Okay, well, in some states,
you can put yourself on this list

if you're trying to quit gambling. Right?

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,764
(STUTTERING)
That's not losing, that's entertainment.

308
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,969
MAN: We're gonna play or what?
CURTIS: We're gonna play.

309
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,566
And We're gonna... We're gonna play, huh?

310
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,730
You want to be entertained?

311
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,366
-50 bucks. Let's play for 50 bucks.
-CURTIS: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

312
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,881
Gerry! Play nice now.

313
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,201
Okay, 50 bucks. You like that?

314
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,521
500.

315
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,326
1,000_ Let's play for $1,000.

316
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,841
(CHUCKLES)

317
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,530
That's enough.
You fellows don't belong here, do you?

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,650
-I'm... I'm really... I'm not very good.
-CURTIS: Okay...

319
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,802
-I'm really...
-Hey, hey, hey, no...

320
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,121
Easy, easy, We're good.
We're good. We're good.

321
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,283
We don't want to upset your
beautiful highness, thank you very much.

322
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,607
(LAuGHING)

323
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,926
-And what're you doing tomorrow?
-(LAUGHS)

324
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,491
What are you doing tomorrow?

325
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,369
Well, I think it's Machu Picchu time for me.

326
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,329
Time for me to hit the road.

327
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,687
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

328
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,967
Okay, well, it was great to meet you.

329
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,690
You too, Gerry.

330
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,605
-Hey, do you want a ride someplace?
-No.

331
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,404
No, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna steal a bike.

332
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,764
Hey. Hey.

333
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,207
Man, you, uh, you got a light?

334
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,601
Uh, no.

335
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,285
-What's that for?
-Give me the money.

336
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,488
-I don't have any money.
-Bullshit.

337
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,047
$1,000 bets? Yeah, I heard you back there.

338
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,009
-No, no, no, fuck...
-Just give it to me.

339
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,923
Hey, I told you, I don't have any money.

340
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,604
Okay, I lost it on Rollin' Roosevelt.

341
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,444
-Don't make me cut you.
-Take it easy, buddy.

342
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,367
Okay? Take it easy. I'm gonna show you.

343
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,369
-Hurry up!
-Here, here, here.

344
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,169
See, I don't have any money.

345
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,970
-Do I look stupid?
-(DOOR OPENS)

346
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,450
Ahh!

347
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,645
Damn it! (GROANS)

348
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,642
-Damn...
-MAN: You all right, man?

349
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,563
-Shit.
-Hey, man, you want us to call somebody?

350
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,725
Hey, you forgot your knife, asshole!

351
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,482
Hey-hey!

352
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,970
Gerry, hey! (LAUGHS)

353
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,243
It's so great to see you, man.
So, how long's it been?

354
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,482
Oh, I don't know. A couple of months.

355
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,081
Too long. It's been too long.

356
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,162
Yeah, I know.

357
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,205
-Have you been avoiding me, Gerry?
-No, no, I...

358
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,885
Can I bring you something to drink?

359
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,928
GERRY: Um, yeah, I'll take a coffee.

360
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,761
Oh, forgive me, but I got here early.

361
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,525
I ordered a salad, order whatever you want.

362
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,886
-It's on me.
-No, it's fine.

363
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,247
I know it's fine, but I insist.

364
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,691
Okay. Sure.
I'll take a burger, medium-rare. And fries.

365
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,681
WAITERZ All right.

366
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,887
-Hey, and how are you?
-You know, same old grind.

367
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,048
I would like to retire soon,

368
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,811
but it doesn't seem to be
heading that direction.

369
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,927
Uh...

370
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,528
-How's the real estate?
-Oh. Slow and low.

371
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,203
-I'm sure it'll pick up soon.
-Yeah. Eventually.

372
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,404
Don't make me ask, Gerry.

373
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,406
Um, so,

374
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,481
last night I had $800.

375
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,881
I go out into the parking lot,

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,082
fucking guy robs me. Meth head.

377
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,761
With a knife, he stabs me.

378
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,564
-In the gut. See.
-Oh!

379
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,324
Oh, God, Gerry, put that down.

380
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,210
You need to have somebody look at that.

381
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,525
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

382
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,042
-I can't imagine.
-It was pretty scary.

383
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,970
-At least you're okay.
-Yeah, it's just a scratch.

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,570
It could have been a lot worse, you know?

385
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,040
-Hmm.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

(lNDlsTINCT)

387
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,924
I got to take it.

388
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,808
Hey! Oh, Jesus, Lord. No.

389
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,929
I'm not bringing it to the school.

390
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,284
I'm in a meeting, ask your dad.

391
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,442
I don't know where he is.

392
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,166
You know, it's not my fault that you forgot it.

393
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,203
Teenagers! God.

394
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,203
Hey... srm!

395
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,965
Okay, I'm... I will, I'm gonna bring it.

396
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,129
This is the last time though.
I'll be there in half an hour.

397
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,010
Do not keep me waiting out front.

398
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,211
You're so lucky
you don't have to deal with that shit.

399
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,721
-Gerry, I tell you.
-Oh, fuck...

400
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,367
So, what do you have for me today?

401
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,843
This is about $80. I had the rest, but...

402
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,010
-Meth head.
-Fucking meth head.

403
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,128
-Bad beat.
-The worst.

404
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,407
-Things will look up.
-They always do.

405
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,167
Well, not always.

406
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,728
Couple of weeks.
Couple of weeks, don't worry about it.

407
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,765
-Tomorrow.
-IVlmm, no.

408
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,888
Tomorrow, Gerry.

409
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,324
I'll send Tim to drop you a visit.

410
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,086
Oh, no, no. There's no need
to bring him into all of this.

411
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,564
Couple of days
I'll have a commission, and, uh...

412
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,484
-Get it together.
-I had the money.

413
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,210
-Yeah.
-This time it wasn't my fault.

414
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,846
SAM: I understand.

415
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,522
-Take care.
-Yeah.

416
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,009
-Gerry.
-Hey!

417
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,845
Curtis, I know you're probably
halfway to New Orleans...

418
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,729
Crazy day. Gerry I ended up in Chicago.

419
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,486
I won a ticket to the Bulls game shooting
dice this morning. So, I went.

420
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,324
But now I'm back
in your neck of the woods.

421
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,845
You are? Where?

422
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,049
I'm at the same, uh, same place.
Same place we met the other night.

423
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,725
What place? No.

00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,921
-(LAUGHS)
-Gerry.

425
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,926
Gerry would you be so kind
as to order me a Woodford?

426

(LAuGHING)

427
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,249
A Woodford! Two Woodfords!

428
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,606
Have you seen a NBA game up close?

429
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,170
-Those guys are tall!
-Hey, man.

430
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,729
-it's a sign.
-What is?

431
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,564
It's a sign!

432
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,122
You walking in the door
while I'm calling you on the telephone

433
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,164
-is a sign, I'm telling you, it's a sign.
-All right.

434
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,608
Okay, look what happened to me
after you left last night.

435
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,690
-What is that?
-In the parking lot.

436
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,569
-Some guy cut me.
-Are you okay?

437
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,051
(STUTTERS) It's not serious.
What I'm getting at...

438
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,201
Did you know the guy?

439
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,489
Yeah, yeah, I know him,
we play some softball on the weekends.

440
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,608
-That's a fair question.
-No! It's not a...

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,523
-He was mugging me.
-That's gonna hurt like hell.

442
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,807
It stings a little bit,
but what I'm getting at is...

443
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,881
CURTIS: Shit.

444
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,167
Hey, hey, Curtis,
what I'm trying to get at here,

445
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,730
is that good things happen
when you're around,

446
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,121
and when you're not, when you leave...

447
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,362
-(LAUGHS) You get stabbed.
-Yeah!

448
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,845
(BOTH LAuGHING)

449
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,130
I've been thinking, you know?
That home game, uh, New Orleans,

450
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,725
-disassociated guy...
-Tony Roundtree?

451
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,484
Boom! I want in.

452
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,685
That game has a $25,000 buy-in, Gerry.

453
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,690
-Which is a lot. That's a lot.
-Yeah.

454
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,842
-But I got a plan.
-I'm listening.

455
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,328
-We go down the Mississippi.
-Okay.

456
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,726
Yeah. We go down
the Mississippi like Huck-fucking-Finn

457
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,848
-and Jim...
-On a raft.

458
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,647
-No, we take my car. Okay.
-Okay.

Didn't know he'd be
hemorrhaging money on this thing.

He's got to register it with

I don't know about St. Louis.

615
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,171
I've only been here a few months.

616
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,881
That's no excuse.
I was only in Iowa for a few days.

617
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,688
I can tell you that Marion Robert Morrison

618
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,001
was born in Winterset, Iowa, 1907.

619
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,085
Am I supposed to know who that is?

620
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,288
You might know him
by his stage name, John Wayne.

621
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,041
John Wayne.

622
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,924
I can also tell you
that Iowa is the only state in the country

623
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,331
that begins with two vowels.

624
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,805
And that the National Balloon Museum
in lndianola

625
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,203
chronicles over 200 years
of guess what?

626
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,203
Right, ballooning history.

627
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,125
Okay. Okay, fine.
So, I don't know if this is true...

628
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,043
I don't care. Lay it on me.

629
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,560
You know when you're in a hotel room

630
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,325
and they put the little
chocolate on the pillows?

631
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,324
-IVlmm-hmm.
-That was started in St. Louis by...

-You're supposed to guess who.
-Okay, Ben Franklin.

634
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,369
Close. Cary Grant.

635
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,087
Really?

636
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,289
He was staying at the Mayfair
and wooing a certain lady friend

637
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,960
by putting chocolate on her pillow.

638
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,121
Who told you that?

639
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,491
-A friend.
-Who?

640
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,924
I don't remember.

641
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,205
-Take a guess.
-What are you getting at?

642
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,208
Were you in a hotel room
when this friend told you

643
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,051
-about Cary Grant's chocolate...
-I don't remember.

644
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,844
-...seduction technique?
-So what if I was?

645
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,329
Six months is a long time, Curtis.

646
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,129
Six months? It hasn't been six months.

647
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,244
Six months. September,
October, November, December,

-Yeah.
-Okay? There was an Earl of Sandwich.

673
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,130
He was a gambler.

674
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,001
He was standing at the tables all day long.

675

Oh, I'm a bit hungry. What am I gonna do?

He had a collared shirt
and a missing button.

What do you have against Jorge?

01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,491
Just take a moment of your time?
I'd like just to have a word.

929
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right back, you beautiful losers.

930
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,891
I don't know what it means.
I don't know what it means.

931
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,640
What, what means?

932
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,567
Okay.

933
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,806
(CHUCKLING) This is gonna sound crazy.

934
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,522
I was all in on this monster pot.

935
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,242
Okay? I was down to the river, I was gone,
I mean, I was wiped out.

936
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,331
And all I needed was a queen and...

937
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,049
A queen, the only thing that could save me,

938
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,250
and I made myself a promise
and I know this sounds so stupid,

939
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,491
but I made myself a promise
that if I got a queen,

940
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,531
I'd go and... I'd go to Little Rock.

941
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,445
I'd make things right,

942
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,125
you know, with my queen.

943
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,567
You know what I mean?

944
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,761
Your ex-wife.

945
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,167
-You were right.
-Of course...

946
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,368
A woman. What did I tell you, huh?
it's always a woman.

947
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,965
(SOFTLY) I don't know what to do.

948
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,603
I know what to do.

949
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,368
We go to Little Rock. That's what we do.

950
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,443
It's not on our way. It just seems crazy.

951
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,851
Am I crazy?

952
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,485
-Oh, you're a fucking lunatic.
-(CHUCKLES)

953
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,204
-But I love it.
-You don't mind?

954
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,768
Gerry, I don't...

955
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,526
A beautiful woman right in there,
asked me to go home with her tonight.

956
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,801
-And?
-And I turned her down.

957
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,041
-You did?
-Yep.

958
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,360
Why?

959
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,691
When you come to a fork in a road,
you take it.

960
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,200
Let's go to Little Rock.

961
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,443
-Gerry.
-Hey, Dorothy.

962
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,724
What are you doing here?

963
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,209
I was just driving through Little Rock.
I thought I'd stop by.

964
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,165
Oh, you were just stopping
through Little Rook.

965
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,322
Look, I don't have to stay. I just...

966
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,769
Thought it did be nice to see you.
Even if it is just for a minute.

967
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,204
Come on in, I guess.

968
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,128
I was just making some tea.

-Yeah, yeah. Sure. Absolutely.

971
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,970
Hey, darling. Did I wake you? I'm sorry.

972

SIMONE: No, it's okay. Where are you?

973
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,407
We're... We're on a little
detour in Little Rock.

01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,444
-Little Rock?
-Yeah .

975
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,087
What happened to New Orleans?

976
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,369
No, I'm sitting in a car right now,
outside Gerry's ex-wife's house,

977
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,767
and he just went in there to win her back.

978
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,647
And he got me thinking about you.

979
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,328
Me and St. Louis,

981

-School.

982
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,561
That's good.

983
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,488
Hmm. How are things with Gary?

984
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,481
We got married.

985
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,930
Oh, oh...

986
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,686
Congratulations.

987
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,249
Did you ever think it was funny
that you traded me in for a Gary?

988

You know, Gerry, Gary...

989
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,764
Well, where is he?

990
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,050
-Working.
-What does he do?

991
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,167
He's an electrician.

992
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,325
That's a good job.

993

That's my hand.
You cut me out of this picture.

998
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,286
I didn't want you on my wall, Gerry.

999
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,770
Well, okay, but you have to cut me
out of my daughter's life

1000
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,763
-so that she can't see me?
-Is that a joke?

1001
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,889
You cut yourself out years ago.

-No, no.
-Yeah, yeah.

Or sent a present on her birthday?

1005
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,330
Well, I had been having some

-it's not about money.

How about checking her homework,
or making dinner

1008
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,166
or, uh, calling? (CHUCKLES)

Sing me a song.

1592

NAVARRO ON CD2 Number 199.

1593
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,530
Relaxed and squared.

1594
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:20,602
Shoulders that are
suddenly relaxed and squared are saying,

1595
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,125
"I am com7dent. "

1596
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,647
If someone goes from slumped shoulders

01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,848
to squared relaxed shoulders,

1598
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,285
I would be concerned

1599
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,727
as they are likely to be strong.

Number 1. Hat lift to ventilate.

1602
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,041
Men will suddenly lift up their hat

1603
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,565
to ventilate their head

1604

or stressed or have concerns.

1606
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,284
Look for other conHrming tells

1607
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:38,331
such as the tense face,
high shoulders, etcetera,

01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,721
to help you.

Ear lobe pulling or massaging.

1611
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,846
Pulling on or massaging the ear lobe

1612
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,605
tends to have a subtle, soothing effect on us

1613
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:53,127
when we are stressed or merely
contemplating alternatives.

1614
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:56,121
I would associate ear lobe rubbing

1615
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,083
with doubt or hesitation.

1616
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,247
Number three. Head scratching.

1617
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,723
Head scratching paciHes us

1618
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:07,088
when we have doubts or stress or concern.

1619
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,491
When pondering a situation
or when perplexed

1620
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:12,927
is usually when you see this behavior:

1621
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,207
Number 4. Botox.

1622
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,882
Because the forehead
gives away so much information

1623
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,167
about stress and anxiety

1624
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,164
some players, and I highly recommend it,

1625
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,402
have been Botoxing their foreheads-

1626
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,842
It is very effective at
hiding tells of the forehead

1627
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:32,684
even though it may leave them

1628
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,730
totally void of forehead expression.

1629
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:39,687
One way to detect
if players have been using Botox,

1630
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:43,284
is to look to see if there is
a quarter-inch area

1631
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,203
just short of the hairline

1632
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:49,171
that reacts to the emotions
in the normal way.

1633
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,805
This is a fairly good indicator
not to look for cues of the forehead

1634
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:57,487
because they have been
literally Botoxed out.
