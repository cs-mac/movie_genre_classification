1
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,413
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,666
Ma'am?
Ma'am, can you give me your location?

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,543
Clearly, people here want some answers.

4
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,837
- Breaking news...
- We have confirmed...

5
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,423
- And the robbery happened around...
- At this time, information...

6
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,634
...don't go near this area.

7
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,970
...into the buildings here behind us...

8
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,805
The question on everyone's mind

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,391
is how did this situation
get out of control here?

10
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,520
...so the pictures you're seeing,
this is a major incident.

11
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,021
...police have a suspect in custody.

12
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,232
What drives a person to commit a crime?

13
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,652
To destroy?
To weaken someone's resolve?

14
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,114
Vengeance? Spite?

15
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,448
Religion?

16
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,659
Money?

17
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,120
Communities, cities, entire countries

18
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,290
are put beneath microscopes
and analyzed for their flaws,

19
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,585
their weaknesses,
so that one individual

20
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,588
can find the smallest chink
in the system's armor

21
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,173
and benefit from it.

22
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,263
Clearly, this has been
done by an explosives expert.

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,557
- Police say...
- My name is Lucas Nolan.

24
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,393
I'm an interrogation specialist.

25
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,604
I elicit useful information
from a suspect,

26
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:50,610
build a rapport, and utilize
any techniques necessary to gather data.

27
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,820
At least,
that's what the book says.

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,363
I'm good at it.

29
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,034
No, I'm great at it...

30
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,536
Peeling away every layer
of a person's mind

31
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,913
and uncovering a clue
at the root of a problem.

32
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,083
And if you know
what you're looking for...

33
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,422
...you can prevent it
all from ever happening.

34
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,055
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Code 236, we're under fire!

35
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,524
Shots fired! Shots fired!

36
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,194
Officer pinned down, taking heavy fire!
Need backup!

37
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,864
All units, all units, please
respond. Officers need assistance.

38
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,327
Shots fired. Go to this location:
2543 North 6th Avenue.

39
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,038
All units, officers need assistance.
Shots fired.

40
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
Where the hell is that backup?!

41
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,257
Who the hell are you?

42
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,177
Nolan, FBl. What do we got?

43
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,930
Suspect robbed the Bank of America.
Tracked his car here.

44
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,034
Four seconds a clip.
Probably an M4 automatic.

45
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,957
Five seconds to reload.

46
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,385
Hope he's consistent.

47
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,221
Hey, where are you going?

48
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,559
One, two, three, four...

49
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,494
- What the hell is he doing?!
- I have no idea.

50
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:14,003
One, two, three, four.

51
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,134
Four seconds. You're out.

52
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,219
Shit.

53
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,070
How'd you know he was out?

54
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,864
Lucky guess.

55
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,079
Can I help you?

56
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,874
Are you in charge of bomb threats?

57
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,586
- Excuse me?
- You know,

58
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,464
this bomb is going to go off
at this place, at this time.

59
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,758
You should be really scared
type of thing.

60
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,180
When exactly is this bomb gonna go off?

61
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,436
Now.

62
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,947
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands now!

63
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,198
Son of a bitch.

64
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,117
On the ground.
On your knees now!

65
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,468
All right, go through.

66
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,263
- Next. ID?
- Good to go.

67
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,600
- How bad is it?
- No casualties, but bad enough.

68
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,560
Sixty square blocks with no electricity.

69
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,063
It'll take at least 12 hours
to get it back online.

70
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,148
Good news, we still got power.

71
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,484
That's not good news.
We could have the day off.

72
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,027
Yeah, I heard that.

73
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,366
Next. All right, go through.

74
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,159
Next.

75
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,764
We should get this started.

76
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,935
A man who gives himself up like that
knows he's about to be interrogated.

77
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,940
- Who's our guy?
- He's a memory savant.

78
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,650
He remembers anything and everything.

79
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,319
And he plays back
highlights in his mind better than ESPN.

80
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,530
He's a walking, talking encyclopedia.

81
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,033
Never pretends he has
more knowledge than the suspect

82
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,743
to gain the upper hand
because he does.

83
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,162
How is that possible?

84
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,040
What'd I miss?

85
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,708
Nice of you to join us.

86
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,626
Luke, you know Special Agent Sara Ward.

87
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,545
Anti-terror, right?

88
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,759
So what do we got on this guy?

89
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,135
Not much.

90
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,387
- Prints?
- Nope.

91
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,140
- He filed them off.
- Or burned them.

92
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,642
We're running his face through
the Bureau databases right now,

93
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,895
- but so far...
- I get it.

94
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,324
We got one wallet, empty.
Some kind of paint smudge on it

95
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,910
and a key with the letters
"MS" scratched onto it.

96
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,289
- How much time I got?
- You don't.

97
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,542
You think there's
another bomb out there?

98
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,344
You two better be right about him.

99
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,504
I'm Lucas Nolan.

100
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,548
What's your name?

101
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,468
You tell me.

102
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,222
You read people for a living, don't you?

103
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,727
Dave. No, or is it Bob?

104
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,772
Or maybe a good old Tommy.

105
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,483
- You don't look like a Tommy.

106
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,611
I read books. Far less annoying.

107
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,614
Then let's talk about books.

108
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,325
"If a tree falls in a park
and there is no one to hear,

109
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,371
it is silent, invisible, nameless.

110
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,040
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.

111
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,960
All meaning would vanish along with us. "

112
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,424
Let's talk about books now.

113
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,134
What's he doing?

114
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,677
Searching his memory house.

115
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,764
Am I the only one in here
who doesn't know

116
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,433
what the fuck a memory house is?

117
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,269
It's a memorization technique.

118
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,021
You see, our visual memory
is the strongest,

119
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,441
so Lucas has created a home in his mind
to remember anything and everything.

120
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,401
That sounds like bullshit to me.

121
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,155
"If a tree falls in the park...

122
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,619
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.

123
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,121
All meaning would vanish... "

124
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,167
William Fossett.

125
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,296
Natural States,
originally published in 1754.

126
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,715
However, he stole his line
of thinking from Berkeley,

127
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,675
who asked the same question
44 years earlier

128
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,386
with his Treatise on the
Principles of Human Knowledge.

129
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,640
Section 45, if you wanna have a look.

130
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,559
He's a game-changer.

131
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,775
So you are familiar with the work.

132
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,611
It is a simple question, really.

133
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,821
Either you believe physical phenomena

134
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,867
can exist outside the realm
of human perception or you don't.

135
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,624
Come on.
You must have an opinion.

136
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,254
I'll answer one of your questions,
you answer one of mine.

137
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,297
Sure.

138
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,384
- Where were you born?
- That's his question?

139
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,053
Iraq.

140
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,265
Match up immigration records,
photos, whatever you got.

141
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,432
Got it.

142
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,437
Iran, Syria, Egypt, Gaza.

143
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,273
He's playing us.

144
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,733
Does it matter?

145
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,319
Would you even be able
to tell the difference?

146
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,697
- Okay.

147
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,617
- So you came here when you were-

148
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,370
You're going to have to
earn your next question.

149
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,871
I don't have time for games.

150
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,541
No, you don't,
but you're going to play anyway.

151
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,171
- What do you want?
- I want to be heard.

152
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,925
But for that to happen,
I need someone to listen.

153
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,719
And if I don't?

154
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,474
You'll find out in 27 minutes.

155
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,809
Becky?

156
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,062
Done.

157
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,106
America doesn't negotiate
with terrorists.

158
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,943
It does today.
And there are rules.

159
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,195
Do we understand each other?

160
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,947
I understand.

161
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,991
Good.

162
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,619
The rules are simple.

163
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:55,334
They are based on truth
in a world where everybody lies.

164
00:13:55,418 --> 00:14:00,088
With the biggest liars winning elections
and the greediest companies thriving,

165
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:06,053
I am going to tell you the truth
about who I am and what I want.

166
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,849
Then I'm going to ask you a question
based on that truth.

167
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,395
You get it right, you win a prize.

168
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,274
You get it wrong,
people die right now.

169
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,028
I want electronic countermeasures
on this building.

170
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,613
No wireless signals in or out.

171
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,073
Got it.

172
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:33,038
This whole nightmare of a country
is built on lies.

173
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,459
Everywhere you look,
women with fake tits.

174
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,588
You turn on the television,
all you see are reality shows,

175
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,507
homes none of us own,

176
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,843
a leader who says
he's going to take care of people.

177
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,888
Online, you have a thousand friends,
and not one in real life.

178
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,848
All lies.

179
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,352
And do you know
which ones are the worst?

180
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,272
The ones you come to believe.

181
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,691
And what is
the biggest lie of all?

182
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,530
...the biggest lie of all.

183
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,707
The American Dream.

184
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,793
Well done.

185
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,088
For that, you get a prize.

186
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,552
- One question, one answer.
- Where's the next bomb gonna go off?

187
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,846
Corner of Nicollet and 5th.

188
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,598
Get PD to evac the buildings

189
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,434
for one square block
and set up a hard perimeter.

190
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,602
I want SWAT and EOD
on Nicollet and 5th now.

191
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,396
What's there, Becky?

192
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,858
Offices, storefronts,
a tower, apartments.

193
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,651
- Too much.
- What are you doing?

194
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,611
You can't just walk away from him.

195
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,656
- We're both coming with you.
- Absolutely not.

196
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,658
- Why did he come in here?
- What?

197
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,078
- Why did he give himself up?
- Because he's a psychopath.

198
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,455
Yes. No. Maybe.

199
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,165
But what he is doesn't matter.

200
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,625
Why did he come in here?
Why did he give himself up?

201
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,003
Why did he just tell us
where the bomb is?

202
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,006
He doesn't think
we'll find it in time.

203
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,217
And what, you think he's just
gonna show you where it is?

204
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,220
Yes, but not from in here.
I need him on-site.

205
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,805
He'll unconsciously give up more there

206
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,849
- than he ever would here.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

207
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,768
What if he is just lying
to get out of here?

208
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,354
You're right. He is by definition,

209
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,732
but that doesn't mean a bomb
isn't about to go off.

210
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,776
If we wanna stop him, we have to
let him think he's in control.

211
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,362
And what if he is the one in control?

212
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,741
He's not.

213
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,872
Just let me do my thing.

214
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,169
He's coming with.

215
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,508
If this goes south, it's on you.

216
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,698
Hey, in here!

217
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,872
Exciting, isn't it?

218
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,625
Oh, come on.

219
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,420
You could be stuck at your desk
talking about the lousy weather

220
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,839
or how the T-wolves are losing again

221
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,633
or what poisonous fast food
you're going to pick up for lunch.

222
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,683
Stuck in the same
bullshit conversations

223
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:27,314
with the same bullshit people
as every other day of your life.

224
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,698
Nothing like a ticking bomb
to get the blood pumping.

225
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,284
- Ever heard of a treadmill?
- Do I look like a hamster?

226
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,995
Do you really want to waste
your precious energy

227
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,372
spinning a wheel that goes nowhere?

228
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,760
The bigger the crime,
the bigger the challenge.

229
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,512
And everybody wants
to beat the best.

230
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:04,392
The faster your precious promotion,
your hollow pay-raise comes.

231
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,478
What do you think?

232
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,147
I think you talk too much.

233
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,651
Hey, it's just my two cents.

234
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,533
I wish you'd chose a different path

235
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,036
'cause there was a fork
in your road somewhere.

236
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,664
You think you're walking
the righteous path, the right path,

237
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,124
but you're not.
Your map's all wrong.

238
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,501
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

239
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,587
but this path is just gonna
see you at the bottom of a grave.

240
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,174
And how can you be so sure?

241
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,259
Because I've seen others
walk it before you.

242
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,682
Just my two cents.

243
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,193
Road clear.
Area has been evacuated.

244
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,153
- Explosives team is on the way.
- On the way?

245
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Get the barrier!

246
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,595
Move! Let's go, let's go!

247
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:07,891
Four minutes.

248
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,310
How do you wanna play it?

249
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,313
Let's see your work
up close and personal, shall we?

250
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,362
What are you doing?

251
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,072
My job.
What are you doing?

252
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,616
You better not screw this up.

253
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,868
I wasn't planning on it,
but thank you.

254
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,247
- What now?
- We walk.

255
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,500
Then you take this.
Keep the receiver open.

256
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,376
I wanna hear everything.

257
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,968
You ever consider
maybe I'm not afraid to die?

258
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,264
You think I'm just
going to tell you where it is?

259
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,349
You already have.

260
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,810
Here I am, an open book,

261
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,813
all the information
right there in front of you,

262
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,523
and still you need my help.

263
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,817
You don't want this bomb
to go off any more than I do.

264
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,028
- And why would that be?
- 'Cause you're not done yet.

265
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,154
No.

266
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,659
Who are these innocents to you?

267
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,078
Do they really mean anything to you?

268
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,790
But, more importantly,
do you mean anything to them?

269
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,042
Do you think any one of them
would stop on the street

270
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,044
and give you a quarter
if you were starving?

271
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,633
No. You're not doing this for them.

272
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,511
A town like these people,
you are far too intelligent

273
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,555
to lie to yourself
about what you really are.

274
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,140
You know the truth
about yourself.

275
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,017
What's that?

276
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,270
You're having fun.

277
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,278
Lucas.

278
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:50,159
I am going to tell you the
truth about who I am and what I want.

279
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:56,583
This whole goddamn nightmare of
a country is built on lies.

280
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,671
Women with fake tits.

281
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,049
All you see are reality shows,

282
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,595
a leader who says he's going
to take care of people.

283
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,973
Online, you have a thousand friends,
and not one in real life.

284
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,475
All lies.

285
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,687
What is the biggest lie of all?

286
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,440
Everybody knows a house is
nothing without a neighborhood.

287
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,067
Talk to us about
your mortgage options today.

288
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,154
Live your dream.
The American Dream.

289
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,032
What is the biggest lie of all?

290
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,992
The American Dream.

291
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,956
Mortgage office.

292
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,043
Mortgage office, let's go!

293
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,094
- Guess you're a hero now, Lucas.
- Am I?

294
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,221
You are if you believe in causality.

295
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,225
Cause and effect, you fire a gun,
the bullet hits something or someone.

296
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,561
You cross the wrong man,
he wants to kill you.

297
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,688
You disarm a bomb, you become a hero.

298
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,779
The thing about causality
is that it cuts both ways.

299
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:37,243
Given a different effect, the same cause
can make a hero into a fool.

300
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,005
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, hey!

301
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,426
Get down!

302
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,061
Where did he go?!

303
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,313
Can you see him?
Can you see him?

304
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,608
Don't let him get away!

305
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,708
Okay, okay!

306
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm out.

307
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,679
Drop it.

308
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,729
On your knees.
Now!

309
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,522
Okay.

310
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,804
Nobody move!

311
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,474
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hands up now! Hands up!

312
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,831
We're training your mind,
Lucas, so you can do anything.

313
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,083
Washington, Jefferson,
Buchanan, and Coolidge.

314
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,043
Good.

315
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,548
And now tell me, when you go
inside your memory house,

316
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,758
is there anything more beautiful?

317
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,637
Yes. A real house.

318
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,889
Money isn't everything, Lucas.

319
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,392
- God will provide-
- Well, can He buy us a house

320
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,394
or a car or clothes?

321
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,812
Because you can't.

322
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,411
Dad, what did you do?

323
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,831
Dad, it was my fault. I'm sorry.

324
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,642
Why didn't you shoot him, Lucas?

325
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,229
Because he has more bombs out there.

326
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,112
- All right, Becky, what did he do?
- Not sure.

327
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:50,741
- Whatever this is, it's encrypted.
- Well, if you had to guess.

328
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,910
Well, this office is a data hub,

329
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,037
so that means the servers
connect to bank alarm systems,

330
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,455
to hospitals, to the airport.

331
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,583
Might be information or a virus.

332
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,836
I won't know until
I crack the code and pull it apart.

333
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,130
Well, if it was a virus,
wouldn't the firewall stop it?

334
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,173
He was already in the system.

335
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:10,594
So you're telling us that
whatever he did can't be stopped?

336
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,556
Yeah, short of unplugging everything
and causing a complete shutdown

337
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,685
in our financial, health, security,
and transportation system? No.

338
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,189
Get back to the office.
Do whatever you have to do.

339
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,442
- Just crack it.
- On it.

340
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,281
He's done.

341
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,410
He's just starting.

342
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,329
He's lived his entire life
for this moment. You understand that?

343
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:42,168
What I understand is that we've done
exactly what he wanted us to do.

344
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,795
I'm taking over this interrogation.

345
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,172
Then you might as well
tell everybody to go home

346
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,924
and start praying right now
because you're not gonna stop him.

347
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,343
And you are?

348
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,220
He has been toying with you

349
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,140
since the minute you walked
into that interrogation room.

350
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,685
Two hours, and we know
exactly nothing about him.

351
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,397
Not his name, where he lives,
what he wants, what his next target is.

352
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,608
You're missing the point.

353
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,902
It's not who his name is
or what he wants

354
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,989
or even what he's gonna blow up next
because that is going to happen.

355
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,951
Get him the hell out of here.

356
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,130
Go home, Luke.

357
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,550
Have a drink.
We'll take it from here.

358
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,555
Luke.

359
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,402
Lucas.

360
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,248
Hey!

361
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,749
What the hell are you doing?

362
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,793
- I know where he lives.
- You got an address?

363
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,878
No, but I'll get you
within a quarter mile.

364
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:14,176
- I'll bet my career on it.
- You just did. Well, let's go!

365
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,103
No one in there is going to talk to you
with me looking like this.

366
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,855
Come on, this is undignified.

367
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,023
Yeah.

368
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,776
Well, here's your dignity.

369
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,995
Hey, friend, spare a dollar?

370
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,409
Hey!

371
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,120
- Bullshit.
- Hey, man.

372
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,164
Special Agent Bennett.

373
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,708
So?

374
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:14,004
So... ass-face,

375
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,049
I want you to tell me
if you have seen this man before.

376
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,926
No.

377
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,515
You sure about that?

378
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,643
Someone not quite
so rosy white walks in here,

379
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,061
I'm pretty sure you'd remember that.

380
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,729
I'm sure.

381
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:34,900
If that face showed up in here,
I'd remember.

382
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,696
So whatever you assholes
came in here for, it ain't here,

383
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,491
so why don't you do a little 180
and get the hell out of my bar?

384
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,828
Unlike you, most people know
where they're not wanted.

385
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,333
So what do you make of that?

386
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,627
Looks like he was exactly
where he was wanted.

387
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,188
So you believe all this garbage?

388
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,524
What, that whites are superior?

389
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,068
Better.

390
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,238
You know, I read a lot.

391
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,866
Even disgusting crap like Mein Kampf.

392
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,576
You know what I know for sure?

393
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,454
Is that behind hate is fear.

394
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,498
You're just a coward.

395
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:37,254
Yeah, behind all this bravado,
you're just a scared little cunt.

396
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,674
- Hey, don't move!
- Stay back!

397
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,553
- Don't move!
- Sit down. Now.

398
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,847
- Don't move.
- I know you've seen him.

399
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,433
Fuck you!

400
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,019
- Hey!
- Don't move.

401
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,353
Sit down.

402
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,610
What about you?
Have you seen him?

403
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,695
'Cause I've got all day
to bounce your head off this bar.

404
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,532
Yeah, I've seen him a few times.

405
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,034
Where does he live?

406
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,454
- I know the dude. I don't fuck him.
- Why was he here?

407
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,998
I'm guessing it wasn't for
the hospitality and hors d'oeuvres.

408
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,251
- Freeze!
- Don't move.

409
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,884
The feds, man! Heads up!

410
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,334
Detonators.

411
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,343
Thanks, man.

412
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,934
Well, that was stupid.

413
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,395
Probably.

414
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,439
No, definitely.

415
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,652
You should've waited for backup.
You're too smart to let it get personal.

416
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,279
You get stupid again
and you're out.

417
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,075
The detonators are military grade.

418
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,535
- Digital timers.
- Explosives?

419
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,287
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

420
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,582
This place is clean.
No explosives anywhere inside.

421
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,459
You gotta give me
something better than that.

422
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,004
Well, one of the detonator units
was missing from the box.

423
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,382
- That's the best I got.
- Shit.

424
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,759
I'm gonna go see
if they know anything.

425
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,638
They won't know anything more.

426
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,390
He kept his bomb components separate

427
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,225
so only one can be
compromised at a time.

428
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,561
But he lives close.
I bet we'll find our explosives there.

429
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,690
- How can you be sure?
- He has no ID, no driver's license.

430
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,858
He doesn't come up
on any CCTV matches,

431
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,360
so he doesn't take the bus or train.

432
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,112
Too much surveillance.

433
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,326
You keeping it together, Luke?

434
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,456
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

435
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,460
'Cause you don't look fine.

436
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,175
Come on, this is undignified.

437
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,302
I've seen him a few times.

438
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,637
Where does he live?

439
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,015
Do you think
any one of them would stop on the street

440
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,975
and give you a quarter
if you were starving?

441
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,768
Unbelievable.

442
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,488
No, I've never seen him before.

443
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,032
What's he doing?

444
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,660
Proving that no good deed
goes unpunished.

445
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,502
Oh, thanks.

446
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,838
Yeah, he lives
right around the corner...

447
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,591
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go.

448
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,342
Prepare to move.
Follow where they're going.

449
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,595
You're the boss. Let's go.

450
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,564
Talk to me.

451
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,984
Had one wallet, empty.

452
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,779
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.

453
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:56,490
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.

454
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,325
"MS" was scratched into the key, right?

455
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,540
Melissa Smith, apartment 34.

456
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,418
Wait.

457
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,837
He's smarter than this.
He wanted us here.

458
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:15,133
It's either part of the game
he has us playing or it's a trap.

459
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,138
I want EOD at Jackson and Grant now.

460
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,729
Yep, I got it.

461
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,648
All right, just got a hit
on Melissa Smith.

462
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,192
She's 35, clerical worker,
unmarried, no children.

463
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,736
Facebook page says she
likes cats and Internet dating.

464
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,947
No Social Security,
no driver's license.

465
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,615
It's an alias.
She doesn't exist.

466
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,034
Perfect alias.
Wouldn't raise any flags.

467
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,495
Okay, guys, this is taking too long.

468
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,455
Almost there.

469
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,541
We're all good. No booby traps.

470
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,709
- We still need a warrant.
- Yeah, you get on that, Sara.

471
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,163
What are they?

472
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:12,751
Power grid. Water mains.
Gas lines. Internet.

473
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,712
He's got a blueprint
to the entire city's infrastructure.

474
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,675
Bring him up.

475
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,221
- This is a crime scene.
- The real crime hasn't happened yet.

476
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,308
Do it.

477
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,561
Bring him up.

478
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,084
What are you?

479
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,213
Let's find out.

480
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,604
Well, make yourselves at home.

481
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,440
Be careful with that, please.

482
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,362
- Well?
- You're jerking me around.

483
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,364
You're only starting
to figure that out?

484
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,324
But you led us here on purpose.

485
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:30,120
Who says I led you anywhere?
You're calling the shots.

486
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,080
What I do know is that
you want me to keep playing.

487
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,624
You've already lost.

488
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:38,586
Well, then you won't mind if I walk.
It's hard playing against yourself.

489
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,924
Okay.

490
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,140
I want you to keep playing.

491
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,601
Then you're gonna have to make this
much more interesting.

492
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:05,780
- What do you want?
- I want to change the world.

493
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,325
Is that why you paint?
To change your world?

494
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,994
The world's an ugly place.

495
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,996
You wanna make it beautiful,
so you paint?

496
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:23,381
You need a blank canvas, am I right?

497
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:35,310
Everything around us is fake, Lucas.
Why shouldn't I burn it down?

498
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,729
You must've had a fucked-up childhood.

499
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:43,109
To end up like this, living like this,
I mean, you got some serious issues.

500
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,822
But we both know where they came from.

501
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,617
Really? And where is that, Lucas?

502
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,503
Women.

503
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,089
Did some woman break your heart?

504
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,384
Was it Mommy?

505
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:11,012
She didn't love you enough?

506
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,015
Whatever it is,
it's clear that you hate women.

507
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,770
You think you know me.
You don't know shit.

508
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,524
Just got a hit on Melissa Smith.

509
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,317
It's an alias.
She doesn't exist.

510
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,111
She likes cats and Internet dating.

511
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,279
...Internet dating.

512
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,740
Internet dating...

513
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,914
Wait, is that his laptop?

514
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,258
Not surprising.
He used private browsing.

515
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,018
Nice hack. I see Becky's been
rubbing off on you a bit.

516
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,191
We need to get her
on the phone right now.

517
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,783
- What's up?
- Beck, MNluvconnect.

518
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,952
Run any woman he might've met
in the last six months

519
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,164
against construction companies,
demolition firms,

520
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,417
commercial contractors, anyone you can
cross-reference with explosives.

521
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,504
A password would be great.

522
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:33,052
Seems to me like you have
two options, Lucas.

523
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,014
You can get a warrant,
or you can ask me.

524
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:40,185
Not enough time for one,
too much pride for the other.

525
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,646
Pity. You were doing so well.

526
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,697
If we wanna stop him,

527
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,032
we have to let him think
he's in control.

528
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,076
Shit.

529
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,120
Oh, now you've gone and done it.

530
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,414
- The fuck did you do?
- Nothing.

531
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,251
It was him. I'm sitting right here.
Fifty seconds and she blows, Lucas.

532
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,629
- Stop it.
- Shoot me.

533
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,797
- Throw it out the window.
- He can't do that.

534
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,382
He knows the answer he needs is inside.

535
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:15,428
He throws it out,
he has nothing, and I win.

536
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,597
Tick-tock, tick-tock, brother.

537
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,185
Here I am, an open book

538
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,021
with all the information
right there in front of you.

539
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,857
"If a tree falls in the park
and there's no one to hear,

540
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:31,236
it is silent, invisible, and nameless. "

541
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,247
- Philosophy.
- Do it.

542
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,891
This is seriously messed up.

543
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,943
And we are... in.

544
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,707
Got ya.

545
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,424
Yep. Thanks.

546
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,968
- Joan Marian.
- And I care why?

547
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,053
'Cause she's co-owner
of Marian Demolition,

548
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,055
and their demo is explosives.

549
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,725
Her name came up
on our boy's little sex site.

550
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,144
- Where?
- Richmond.

551
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,353
Let's go.

552
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,108
Let's move!

553
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,263
Hey, you can't go in there!

554
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,267
Joan Marian?
Special Agent Eric Bennett.

555
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,103
What is this about?

556
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,188
Oh, I think you have
a good idea what it's about.

557
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,612
Oh, God.

558
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,617
Is there anything
you wanna tell us, Mrs. Marian?

559
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:33,543
I'm unhappy in my marriage.

560
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,045
I went on a dating website
and he pinged me,

561
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,880
and so we went out on a date-

562
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,050
I could give a shit about any of this.
Did he give you a name?

563
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,054
Vasti. Vasti Radan.

564
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,932
I'm on it.

565
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,767
Oh, God.

566
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,273
If I had known it was him,
I swear I would have turned him in.

567
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,108
How much did he take?

568
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,613
- A lot.
- Oh, Christ...

569
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,115
Show us, please.

570
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,916
It's like these drums here.

571
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,419
Take him outside.

572
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,594
Okay, so he stole
two barrels off you.

573
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,387
A little over a week ago.

574
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,806
What kind?
What's its application?

575
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,433
- It's the powder form.
- Go ahead.

576
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,059
It's highly conductive.

577
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,771
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges

578
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,981
or apply it to pretty much anything.

579
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,108
Like what?

580
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,236
Plaster, concrete, paper, paint even.

581
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:46,783
We use it mainly to pour into drilled,
reinforced concrete supports,

582
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,827
then let it dry
for three days and then...

583
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,747
- ... we detonate.
- Oh, Christ.

584
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,458
Guys.

585
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,544
Don't move.

586
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,260
Vasti Radan.
Very little on him.

587
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,222
We did get a hit on his father,
a Magid Radan.

588
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,141
Tax records show that he worked for
a private security agency

589
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,101
called Simons Security.

590
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,396
It's basic rent-a-cop
that contracts out to federal agencies.

591
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,107
He was good for three years,
then he was found drunk on the job.

592
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,528
Company fired him,
he lost everything and more.

593
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,571
He was sued for unpaid debts.

594
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,157
His home was foreclosed on.
He fell off the map.

595
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,619
Two years later, he was found
dead in an alley in Chinatown.

596
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,497
- So this is personal.
- Good.

597
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,376
- How the hell is any of this good?
- That means his targets aren't random.

598
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,047
There's a... a method behind them,
a logic pattern.

599
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,550
But what pattern? That's the question.

600
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,385
I'm not sure yet.

601
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,430
All right, what do you wanna do?

602
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,600
Ask him.

603
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,236
Book her.

604
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,294
Do you miss your dad?

605
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,548
She told you my name.

606
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,468
Yep. You wanted her to.

607
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:33,806
- And why would I do that?
- So I can figure out why you did it.

608
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:41,731
What you want
is locked up in here.

609
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,066
I don't think you have the time...

610
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:50,031
...or the talents
to unlock this vault.

611
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,034
Seems a waste of water
to wash a car in the rain.

612
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,373
Power grid, water mains, gas lines.

613
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,001
He's got a blueprint to
the entire city's infrastructure.

614
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,593
- Hey, why'd you turn the water off?
- Water mains.

615
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,554
Explosion reported. 9355th Avenue.

616
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,436
- He just hit the-
- The water department.

617
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,521
And two substations.
They're shutting down the pumps.

618
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,608
- All of them. And without water...
- The fire department can't fight fires.

619
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,735
Eric, he is finished.

620
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,196
Get him in the car. We're taking him
back to the federal building.

621
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,699
What's it going to be, Lucas?

622
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,284
- More talking?
- No.

623
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,953
I've done enough of that.
It's your turn.

624
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,871
Tell me everything I know.

625
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,831
You know my father was a drunk.

626
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,751
He was fired from his job
and lost everything.

627
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,128
And you know
or should know or will know

628
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,965
that my mother died
six months after that.

629
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:53,511
I lived on the streets and was forced
to fend for myself, educate myself.

630
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:57,974
Everything I am today is because
of a system of people like you.

631
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,226
You know that I have
over a thousand pounds

632
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,478
of high explosives
somewhere in the city

633
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,522
and that I am not afraid
to detonate them.

634
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:08,067
But what you don't know
is where or really why.

635
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,319
Now, you can take me
to Gitmo and torture me,

636
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,488
but we both know that won't work.

637
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,823
And you can even offer me money,

638
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,867
but you know I would only laugh
in your smug face.

639
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:19,203
Hey!

640
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,957
Hey, hey, hey, come on!
Get him off! Get off!

641
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,084
- Come on!
- Lucas! Lucas!

642
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,585
Get him in the car.

643
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,338
You take yourself so seriously.

644
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:33,926
Go home. That's an order. Go.

645
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,605
Got a wallet with some kind of
paint smudge on it.

646
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,608
It's a powder form.
Highly conductive.

647
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,403
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges

648
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,822
or apply it to pretty much anything.

649
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,323
Like what?

650
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,367
...paint even.

651
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,580
Paint.

652
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,081
Some kind of paint smudge on it.

653
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,223
I gotta go.

654
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,767
Hey, hey!

655
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,769
It's okay, let him go.

656
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,359
What are you doing here, Lucas?

657
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:33,819
- Evidence.
- What?

658
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,780
Vasti Radan's wallet. I need it.

659
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,950
Lucas, you can't take that.

660
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,453
I need an explosives test kit.

661
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,217
There you are.

662
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,348
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a minute.

663
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,832
The paint.
He mixed explosives with paint.

664
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,292
- A building?
- Maybe.

665
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,336
There's over 200,000 in the city alone.

666
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,255
It'll take months to check
every single one of them.

667
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,714
We need to find out where he worked.

668
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:36,882
It would have
something to do with painting.

669
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,177
Commercial painting,
I need you to find out where.

670
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,096
There's no job records,
there's no EDD filings,

671
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,931
there's no tax records
for a Vasti Radan.

672
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,724
- He used an alias.
- What alias?

673
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,102
I need a name.

674
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,312
Let's talk about books, then.

675
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:54,066
"If a tree falls in the park
and there is no one to hear... "

676
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,484
William Fossett.

677
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,740
A William Fossett
was terminated from his position

678
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:04,451
at a commercial painting company
after starting three days ago.

679
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,207
His employer, Bleaker Paint Works,

680
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:14,128
filed a charge for a trespass
and illegal entry into their warehouse.

681
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,505
Seems like he stole some supplies.

682
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,052
When the PD checked the address,
it didn't exist.

683
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,388
I need his most job recent site, Beck.

684
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:34,440
They were contracted to paint
the inside of the Federal Reserve Bank.

685
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,444
- You did it, Lucas.
- I didn't.

686
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,613
- Get Eric.
- Yeah.

687
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,038
No answer. Shit.

688
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,545
I was starting to think
you weren't going to make it.

689
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,641
How are you holding up, buddy?

690
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,437
Wanna tell me
what the hell you're doing, Lucas?

691
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,689
- Solving a case.
- No, you're the case now.

692
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,399
Bring him back, turn yourself in.

693
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,109
- Can't do that, Eric.
- We talked to Becky.

694
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,695
We know about the Federal Reserve.
EOD teams are en route now.

695
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,030
They won't find it.

696
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,698
- What are you talking about?
- The paint.

697
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,784
It takes three days to dry.
He quit three days ago.

698
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,536
He's gonna detonate it and he doesn't
think we can stop him in time.

699
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,039
Hold on, hold on!

700
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,460
Shit.

701
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,841
Okay, so what do you wanna do?

702
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,552
I'm gonna give him a choice:
life or death.

703
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,846
You wanna take him inside?

704
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,848
About America. How unfair it is.

705
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,642
So he wants to burn
the Federal Reserve to the ground.

706
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,519
But I don't think
he's willing to die to make his point.

707
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,814
- And if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

708
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,740
Go, go, go, go, go!

709
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,288
Stop backseat driving!

710
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,583
Maybe he's onto something.
He hasn't steered us wrong yet.

711
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,711
Yeah, well, he hasn't steered us
right yet either.

712
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,297
Priority command,
Special Agent Lucas Nolan.

713
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,966
He's heading to the Federal Reserve
with a suspected terrorist.

714
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,634
I want them stopped.

715
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,792
Freeze!

716
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,504
Put your hands up! Knees!

717
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,048
Now!

718
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,306
Hey!

719
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,474
Put it down!
Drop it!

720
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,975
- Drop it!
- You drop it!

721
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,478
Freeze! I'm FBl.

722
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:21,690
- You put it down!
- I said drop it! Now! Now!

723
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,323
Kick it over.

724
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,755
Get up.

725
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,931
That was fun.

726
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,358
Just act normal or I'll shoot you.

727
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:50,654
Lucas Nolan, FBl.
I need to speak to someone in charge.

728
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:53,490
Edward Watson,
building facility manager.

729
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:56,034
Everyone's cleared out
of the building now.

730
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,912
Okay, good.
Was the bank painted recently?

731
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,581
Yes.

732
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,541
How much of the bank
was painted, Mr. Watson?

733
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,752
Well, everything.
Over 200,000 square feet.

734
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:09,089
- How much time do we have?
- Not enough.

735
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,552
What you want
is locked up in here.

736
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,555
I don't think you have
the time or the talents

737
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,974
to unlock this vault.

738
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,019
Did they paint the vault?

739
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,729
- Yes.
- Take us there, please.

740
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,272
This way.

741
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,359
- Do you still have power?
- Some.

742
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,029
Backup generator's enough
to run basic systems.

743
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,156
- Surveillance cameras?
- No.

744
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,409
Not until power's restored,
but that won't happen till 6:00 PM.

745
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,038
Check down there.

746
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,581
Down here.

747
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,586
Tell me about the vault.

748
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,840
Thirty feet of reinforced steel,
set 60 feet below street level.

749
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,843
It's designed to be almost
impregnable from outside attack.

750
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,678
So how much is in there?

751
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:01,099
Twenty billion in coin and currency
come through here every year.

752
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,976
Right now at the end of the month,

753
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,312
close to three billion.

754
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,439
Exterior doors are
electronically controlled.

755
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,942
No getting in or out
unless the guard inside knows you.

756
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,237
Watson, Edward.

757
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,696
This way.

758
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,451
Open it, please.

759
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,096
Please. The currency
is surrounded by an electrical field.

760
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,432
If you touch even a single bill,
full lockdown will occur.

761
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,773
No detonator.

762
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,901
God damn it, Lucas.

763
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,903
Take your weapon out,
put it on the ground.

764
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,698
- Now!
- The paint is the explosive.

765
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:00,117
We gotta stop this.
It's gonna blow somehow.

766
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,619
The detonator, it's in here.

767
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,204
Check it out.

768
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,294
Explosive is confirmed.

769
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,920
I'm not picking up a detonator.

770
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,422
I'm not finding any detonators either.

771
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,173
Okay, what else is in here
besides money?

772
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:20,053
Plates and electronic currency
wiring stations in there.

773
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:21,847
- What for?
- We can wire money

774
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,056
anywhere in the world.

775
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,558
All you need is an account number.

776
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,019
Can you feel it, Lucas?

777
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:32,107
The energy is positively electric.
We're so close, I can taste it.

778
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:35,068
Can you?
No?

779
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:39,197
Maybe you should try harder.
How am I going to do it?

780
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:42,659
How am I going to detonate
all this explosive?

781
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,914
I've given you the answer,
all the tells, everything you need.

782
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,252
Now, impress me.
How am I going to get away with it?

783
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:54,129
Or am I?

784
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,674
You still have surveillance cameras?

785
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,092
No, not until power is restored.

786
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,511
We heard that's gonna happen at 6:00 PM.

787
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,263
6:00 PM.

788
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,854
Eric, does your cell phone work?

789
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,068
No.

790
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,570
Mr. Watson, do you have
a phone line to the outside?

791
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,238
There.

792
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,127
- Hey.
- Do you have Joan Marian?

793
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,129
- She's in interview three.
- I need to talk to her.

794
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,382
- Now?
- Yes, now. Right now.

795
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,933
It's Lucas Nolan.

796
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,061
- Yes?
- Mrs. Marian,

797
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,938
you said the explosives
were highly conductive.

798
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,273
- Conductive of what?
- Electricity.

799
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,943
That's how we detonate it.
We use electrical current.

800
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,570
There's electrical current everywhere.
Why is it stable?

801
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,030
It's because of the differentials.

802
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,574
It responds to rapid
fluctuations in current.

803
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,874
The building's the detonator.

804
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,292
It's gonna blow
when the power comes back on.

805
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:18,296
We need to get out of here.
Eric, now!

806
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,799
Okay, I was wrong about him.
I didn't understand.

807
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,259
I thought he cared about living.
He doesn't.

808
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,845
In order for his plan to work,
he needs to die.

809
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,096
Oh, Christ.

810
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,098
Okay, this vault
is gonna blow at 6:00.

811
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:31,560
No, no, no.

812
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:35,439
Well done.
I must say I am impressed.

813
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,315
- Let her go.
- Then they'll shoot me.

814
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,651
- Fine, then take me.
- Why?

815
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,904
Because I'm willing to pay the price.
These people aren't. She's not.

816
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,575
Okay. Walk towards me.

817
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,373
Slowly. Slowly.

818
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,667
- Take the shot if you get it.
- Copy that.

819
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:04,593
Now the lesson is over.
Now go.

820
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,387
- We're not fucking moving anywhere.
- You need to get out of here now!

821
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,723
- Not without you.
- Eric, go!

822
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,269
Emergency. Vault shutdown.

823
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:19,691
- Move! Out! Out now!
- I'm sorry.

824
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,401
- I am so sorry.
- Go, go.

825
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,738
Eric, now!

826
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,698
- I'm not gonna fucking leave you here!
- Eric, go!

827
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,159
- Go! It's closing! Go!
- God damn it.

828
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,788
God damn it!

829
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,088
- Hey.
- Becky, what did you hear?

830
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,633
The explosive is triggered by
electrical current fluctuations.

831
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,259
Okay, get with
the power company right now.

832
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,470
Tell them not to turn the power back on.

833
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,515
That wasn't 2,000 pounds of anything.

834
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,767
- Maybe he's alive.
- Open the door.

835
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,685
- I can't.
- Open the goddamn door!

836
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,355
I can't! Nobody can.
Not until an hour after lockdown.

837
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,357
Oh, Jesus!

838
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,818
I need welders down here now.

839
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,446
- Becky?
- I can't do anything. I'm on hold.

840
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,406
God damn it!

841
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,415
Please tell me he's gonna be all right.

842
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,376
Everything's gonna be fine.

843
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,438
What the hell?

844
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,989
My computer just shut down.

845
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,866
Same here.
It's erasing the files.

846
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,910
Damn it.

847
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,915
What's happening, guys?

848
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,751
The virus, it's wiping the servers,
the backups, everything.

849
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,711
Shit.

850
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,216
Four bombs and only two casualties.

851
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:51,801
- It appears...
- Special Agent Lucas Nolan

852
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,971
is credited with saving the lives
of numerous federal agents and local...

853
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:58,099
Estimates put the paper losses
in the range of $3 billion,

854
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,685
- however, as the money never...
- FBI's Minneapolis office

855
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,312
experienced a cyber attack.

856
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,356
Their secured servers
systematically erased all data,

857
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,901
including records involving
suspected bomber Vasti Radan.

858
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:28,463
I'm honored to give the eulogy

859
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,299
for Lucas Nolan today.

860
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,301
A colleague...

861
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,972
...and a close friend.

862
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:43,353
A man who came from literally nothing
to becoming the best behavioral analyst

863
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,814
I have ever worked with.

864
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:50,193
A childhood of poverty,
a life on the streets,

865
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:54,447
and... and the ability to find courage

866
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,366
in the face of what happened
to his father

867
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,786
was a testament to Lucas's
strong-willed mind.

868
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:05,208
A mind that...
that baffled us all.

869
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:08,753
As we remember Lucas today,

870
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:13,216
let's hold him in our hearts

871
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,177
and remember him,
not just the colleague...

872
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,766
...and not just a hero,
because he was.

873
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,270
Let's remember a friend.

874
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,066
God bless Lucas and Godspeed.

875
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,531
Yep, that's quite the send-off.

876
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,663
Come on!

877
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,416
Hey!

878
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,376
Get him!

879
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,503
Get off him now.

880
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,797
- I'm Lucas.
- I'm Vasti.

881
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,521
You gonna put down my gun now?

882
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,899
Can I?

883
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,734
How do I know
you're still with the plan?

884
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:15,612
It wasn't the easiest plan to follow,
but I stayed on point.

885
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,113
Really?

886
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,157
That was some convincing shit, brother.

887
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,701
Oh, you think so?
I thought maybe I went over the top.

888
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,620
Are you kidding me? You had me
thinking you were one of them.

889
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,538
Well, what about that accent?
Where'd you pick that up?

890
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:26,873
I had five years to work on it.

891
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:27,999
And why'd you come on
so hard in the fight?

892
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:31,002
- Dude, you shot at me.
- I shot near you.

893
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,379
- Okay, whatever.
- We gotta get going. You ready?

894
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,174
Yeah.

895
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,721
Here we go.

896
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,139
Giddyup.

897
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,501
That's a lot of zeros.

898
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,634
- We good?
- Oh, we are so good.

899
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:21,928
Let's go.

900
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,311
- I hate tight spaces.
- You got this.

901
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,362
Okay, this is the only
part of the plan I was not crazy about.

902
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:41,030
- You okay?
- Yeah, I got this.

903
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:42,532
How much time before
the water comes back on?

904
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,617
We got six minutes, so we gotta book it.
Let's go.

905
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,786
- All right, ladies first.
- Yeah, suck it up, buttercup.

906
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,958
You okay back there?

907
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,587
Yeah, aside from the 2,000 pounds
of high explosives on my ass.

908
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,016
That means the water's coming.
We gotta haul ass!

909
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,190
Water's coming!

910
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,111
Go, go, go, go, go!

911
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:46,304
All right, man, we should get going.

912
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,975
- One last stop.
- Yep.

913
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,923
Knight to queen four. Checkmate.

914
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,813
I heard you were dead.

915
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:40,149
Yeah. I heard that, too.

916
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,574
Come on.

917
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:51,411
Plane's waiting.
Fake passports cost me a fortune.

918
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:54,247
Is there any rush?

919
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,045
Not anymore.

920
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:09,178
The terrorist responsible
and a hero perished in the attack.

921
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:14,100
But today, we look forward
knowing that as a people we are unbowed.

922
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,852
In other news, an anonymous donor

923
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:19,063
has pledged $100 million
for the establishment

924
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,940
of scholarships and other services

925
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,735
for homeless children in and around
the Minneapolis area.

926
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,616
So what drives a person
to commit a crime?

927
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,452
I guess I'm that individual

928
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:35,204
who found the smallest chink
in the system's armor

929
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,707
and benefited from it.
