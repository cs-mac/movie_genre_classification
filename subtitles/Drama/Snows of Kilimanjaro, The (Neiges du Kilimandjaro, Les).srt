00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,566
SKY FIGHTERS

2
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,883
Our plane can turn in the route
at 270 degrees per second.

3
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:12,188
It can reverse its course
faster than the enemy.

4
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,197
And we have the best instant rate
in the market.

5
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,131
There's only a slight difference
to the F-16.

6
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,968
In a dogfight, sir, the slightest difference
can be the one between life and death.

7
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,381
You'll be able to judge by yourself as
soon as our pilot reaches the plane.

8
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:33,574
Miss.

9
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,151
Champagne for these gentlemen.

10
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:40,185
Wonderful to have you here
but have you come to see or to be seen?

11
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:43,225
Which would you prefer, Hubert?

12
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:47,730
Is the Middle East's top weapons dealer
focusing on Europe now?

13
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:51,633
Lean closer
and our American friends behind you

14
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,260
will presume much more than that.

15
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,670
The show's about to begin.

16
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:59,833
If you need anything,
you just have to ask.

17
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:33,739
<i>Frank?</i>

18
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:36,711
If your plane isn't lined up right
away, I'll wipe you off the list.

19
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:41,878
Oh, my God.

20
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,553
Here he comes!

21
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,031
Save the excuses. Take off!
The tower's frantic!

22
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,671
Exceptionally, the plane will be flying
for you with full fuel tanks and weapons.

23
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:15,217
Excuse me, isn't that..?

24
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:17,115
Yes, it's her.

25
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,784
Your guy's losing it!

26
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,562
Marco!

27
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:43,503
Farnborough Tower to
Dassault Chalet.

28
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,344
On the radio he's saying
"Program complete, heading to Bordeaux".

29
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:48,349
Is that correct?

30
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:49,214
Is there a problem?

31
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,650
You bet there is.

32
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:53,989
Marco, answer me, damn it!

33
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:59,322
Marco!

34
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,068
The 2000, where is it?

35
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,645
I don't know, it was heading 035
and then just vanished.

36
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,845
I'll call military command.

37
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,813
North Sea

38
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,658
Sharko to Riesling, exercise over.

39
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,988
Inform Orange of arrival.

40
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,597
Message received.

41
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:10,029
You know, Walk'n,

42
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:13,295
pretty girls are never free
and free ones are rarely pretty.

43
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,564
You have to come on strong.

44
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:17,537
When I go after one,

45
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,939
the top model type, classy,

46
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:23,376
I apply an emotional shock.

47
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:25,448
Still there? Get it?

48
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,485
Tell me, kiddo,
the emotional shock is you?

49
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,020
See anyone else here?
You bet.

50
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,123
Joker!

51
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:35,748
In any case the last one...
Carla?

52
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:36,757
Clara!

53
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,452
Clara if you want...

54
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,860
Anyhow, whenever she turns up,

55
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,989
she grabs you by the nose

56
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,328
and pulls you along behind her.

57
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,266
And you just lap it up.

58
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,769
Sure, wise guy.

59
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:51,170
Watch it, I have data on you too.

60
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,542
Riesling to Sharko 21.

61
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:56,373
Sharko 21, I copy.

62
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:58,606
Seek demo Mirage 2000
from Farnborough

63
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:00,011
at 0-50 to your position

64
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,914
at 60 nautical miles, level 3-5-0.

65
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:06,281
0-50, 60 nautical miles, level 3-50.

66
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:09,688
Jet probably in flight,
possibly hostile.

67
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,920
We're onto it.

68
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:23,939
A hostile Mirage?

69
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:26,634
One of our guys blew a fuse?

70
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,041
If we spot him, you can ask him.

71
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:39,212
There's only tourist buses up here,
not a single pointy nose.

72
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:40,880
He has to be here.

73
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,021
Fahrenheit, that 340...

74
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:46,595
How many trails do you see?

75
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,594
Four.

76
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,495
Shit, five! Well spotted!

77
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:51,658
Tally ho!

78
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:14,683
Ask him what his mission is.

79
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,055
I'll radio for orders.

80
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:19,594
Hiding in the shadows, baby?

81
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,927
Sharko 22 to Mirage, request ID.

82
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,999
Sharko 21 to Riesling,

83
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:27,831
Mirage located on heading 1-1-0,

84
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:30,371
level 3-80 below an A340.

85
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:32,236
Await instructions.

86
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,843
Sharko 21, hold your position.

87
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,415
What is your mission?

88
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:45,012
Sharko 21, control unidentified jet.

89
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:47,248
What does "control" mean?

90
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:48,517
Improvise.

91
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:49,717
I guess so.

92
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,693
Mirage 2000, request you follow me.

93
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:56,425
The jerk gave me the finger!

94
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:24,019
Walk'n, I lost him.

95
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,565
He's tailing me!

96
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,241
Chill, I have you covered.

97
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,309
Sharko 22 tailed by armed suspect.

98
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:45,108
A warning shot?

99
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:45,840
Negative.

100
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,644
Control suspect.

101
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:50,948
He means business!

102
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,254
Get this bug off me!

103
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:11,939
Riesling, request permission
to open fire.

104
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,373
Stand by.

105
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,075
He's gonna fire!

106
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:20,581
Decoys away!

107
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,678
Riesling, here I go.

108
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:27,723
This is Mandrin. Abort.

109
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,224
Screw 'em!
This jerk'll shoot me down!

110
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:33,457
Mandrin, repeat!

111
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,588
Abort. That's an order!

112
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,697
He's firing! Fox two!

113
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:44,467
Walk'n!

114
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:48,174
Do you copy?

115
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:49,404
Shut it!

116
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:50,877
Move it!

117
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:55,178
Screw around and I'll cut you in two.

118
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,519
Okay, Seb? That was close.

119
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,854
Mind if we head back now?

120
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:08,624
I'd had it without you.

121
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,426
Thanks, pal.

122
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:20,038
Orange Airbase

123
00:12:02,386 --> 00:12:03,546
Captain!

124
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,052
Later, Jeff.

125
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:13,123
Stan...

126
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,287
We have visitors.

127
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:27,343
When I said go faster,
I expected you to do so.

128
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:30,073
25 minutes to get here!

129
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,007
Where now?

130
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,343
This way.

131
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:37,719
My pilots, sir,
Captain Vallois and Captain Marchelli.

132
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:39,253
Colonel Farje, CD AO A.
Ms. Coste,

133
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,584
from the PM's office.

134
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:42,953
Who was patrol leader?

135
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:44,253
I was, sir.

136
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,555
Did your radio work?

137
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:47,925
Perfectly.

138
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:49,726
You were ordered to abort.

139
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:52,334
That shit wanted to shoot me down!

140
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:53,458
Cut it out, Seb!

141
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:56,831
I received the order from Command.

142
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:59,568
But I also saw what was going on.

143
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:02,810
Give me your flight data,
for the inquiry.

144
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,949
Those who give orders may see less

145
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,075
but they know more.

146
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,220
Tomorrow, the Chief of Staff
wants to see you both.

147
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,056
Dismiss!

148
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,499
Your flight plan?

149
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:38,078
That's for Special Missions,

150
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:42,277
meaning me.

151
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:49,518
Less than five minutes
between the Mirage going missing

152
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,093
and our fighters' intervention.

153
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:55,326
This proves, if proof were needed,

154
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:58,491
that our aerial defense
cannot be faulted.

155
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:02,964
Hello.

156
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:05,870
I'm Colonel Esbly,
secretary to the Chief of Staff.

157
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,169
Please, follow me.

158
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,471
The journalists are being briefed.

159
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,275
Just a handful of the important ones.

160
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,746
The European capitals have called Paris

161
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,913
to congratulate us
for taking our responsibilities.

162
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:22,321
Our pilots from the Orange base...

163
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,020
Glad to see you, gentlemen.
Please, join me.

164
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:30,532
We regret the loss of this plane

165
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,397
and we shall explore the matter fully.

166
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,563
But, without the swift intervention
of our pilots here,

167
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:42,235
this armed fighter would make
a formidable weapon in the wrong hands.

168
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:46,910
Gentlemen, you did
what had to be done.

169
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:50,917
I wanted to congratulate you in person.

170
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,885
Thank you all for coming.

171
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:55,014
I'll join you at the buffet shortly.

172
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:04,227
Thank you, gentlemen.

173
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:24,813
We've screwed up.

174
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:26,947
Screwed up badly.

175
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,455
Show them in.

176
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,657
Do you know this man?

177
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,030
No, sir.

178
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,161
Me neither, sir.

179
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:45,740
Like us,
you'll know him as Bertrand.

180
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,037
I run Special Missions.

181
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:51,306
Maëlle Coste, the liaison
with the Prime Minister.

182
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:56,242
That Mirage you shot down
was one of our missions.

183
00:15:56,987 --> 00:16:00,821
Everything you hear in this room
is top secret.

184
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:05,257
The Mirage was on an LVE:
A Limited Vulnerability Exercise.

185
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,591
Since September 11, 2001,

186
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:12,429
we all know
how civilian aircraft can be used.

187
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:16,665
What if the next step is the theft
of an armed military plane?

188
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,438
The government has ordered us

189
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,909
to consider and implement
such a hypothesis.

190
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:25,606
This allows us to test our defenses

191
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:28,741
with a reasonable level of risk.

192
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:33,855
But if we succeed,
that means others can succeed too.

193
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:38,321
The idea is
to show our weak points.

194
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:41,191
New steps are then taken
in order to avoid the worst.

195
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:45,329
I shot down a pilot on a mission?

196
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:46,594
Exactly.

197
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:50,069
That's why you were ordered to abort.

198
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,367
And who was the pilot?

199
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,476
It's classified but I'll tell you.

200
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,773
Major Barth,
my unit's most senior pilot.

201
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:59,347
The most experienced too.

202
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:04,111
He opened fire on my team-mate.

203
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:05,152
Impossible.

204
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:08,985
He had orders to call off the exercise
if intercepted.

205
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,387
He did the opposite.

206
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,188
Captain, no one is blaming you,

207
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,957
but I have to tell the government

208
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:18,693
why we're one 40-million-euro fighter

209
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,099
and one pilot short.

210
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:23,866
The investigating committee
will determine that.

211
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,374
Good luck to you.
I wanted to tell you that too.

212
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,809
A pat on the back,
then a slap in the face.

213
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,475
You said it. A real double whammy.

214
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,019
Excuse me!

215
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,185
Can I have a word?

216
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,692
What is it?

217
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:46,796
You're France's best pilots.

218
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,160
I can help with this blunder.

219
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,324
I just did what I had to do.

220
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,834
So fly for Special Missions.

221
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,370
As family, we'll work things out.

222
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:57,768
Work things out?

223
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:00,171
Thanks, we don't work undercover.

224
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,334
See you.

225
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,136
Captain Marchelli!

226
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:06,306
I'll give you some friendly advice:

227
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,110
Two mistakes in two days is too much,

228
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:11,015
even for the best.

229
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:12,746
Have a safe trip back.

230
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:17,224
She's pretty hot.

231
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,554
Give it a rest.

232
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,492
Nice boobs too.

233
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,197
I'm on top of the world today.
What's on?

234
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:29,271
Greeting two new guys
with a combat simulation exercise.

235
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,640
Greenhorns for breakfast!

236
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:33,936
We'll make them cry for mommy!

237
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:36,671
Good night, Jeff?

238
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,110
Yes, sir.

239
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,883
Babe, we've got work.

240
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,961
Who are our clients?

241
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:56,861
They're hot from Nevada.

242
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,126
I get it.

243
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,395
F-15s, the Grand Canyon...

244
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,664
Las Vegas, Death Valley...

245
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,569
I have two contacts.

246
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,768
Full south. 10 nautical miles,
level 1-80.

247
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:13,179
We should see them soon.

248
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,111
Switching to combat frequency.

249
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,223
Let's kick some cowboy ass.

250
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,457
Why did he open fire?

251
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,461
Your pal screwed up again?

252
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:37,664
Mandrin gave the order.

253
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,936
If he screwed up,
you can't cover for him.

254
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,070
For the last time,

255
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,647
he didn't and I'm not.

256
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,012
Your ID, please.

257
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:53,985
A hit and run.

258
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,553
The ugly one's mine.

259
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,461
Where is the jerk?

260
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:09,128
Shit, he's behind me!

261
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:13,535
10 to 1 on the new guys!

262
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,701
No chance!

263
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,578
What's the score now?

264
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,877
This is getting interesting, guys.

265
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:26,180
Vallois is in the shit.

266
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:27,846
I'm in the shit!

267
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,349
Screw the Grand Canyon!

268
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,052
Ipod! What's up?

269
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,295
Ipod's back behind.

270
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:41,766
Vallois looks bad.

271
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,566
He's trying to get cloud cover.

272
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:53,407
Vallois, the clouds!

273
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,313
Goddam louse!

274
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:01,914
Vallois just got diddled!

275
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,182
That's tough.

276
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:05,987
It's dumb.

277
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,153
What can I say?

278
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:08,322
Sorry, honey.

279
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:09,989
Just shut up, okay.

280
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,828
Anyone else?

281
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:36,591
Ready for a surprise?

282
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,865
I must've done bad stuff
in a previous life.

283
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:49,938
I'm paying for it now.

284
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,041
I don't get it.

285
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:56,104
Shot down by broads...

286
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:57,304
Shut it!

287
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:58,243
What did he say?

288
00:21:58,381 --> 00:21:59,405
Forget it.

289
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:00,846
It's dumb...

290
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:02,383
Talking to me?

291
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,833
Captain Leslie Hedget,
code-name Stardust.

292
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,937
How are you doin'.

293
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:24,266
And Captain Estelle Kass,
aka Pitbull.

294
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:25,931
Meet Grizzly...

295
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:30,034
Bandit, Tala, Ipod...
Get that thing off...

296
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,168
Wanai...

297
00:22:31,314 --> 00:22:31,939
One eye?

298
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,173
Bunker...

299
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:34,476
Ankou...

300
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:35,982
Fahrenheit,

301
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,984
your escort girl...

302
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:38,917
And...

303
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:41,182
I recognize Captain Antoine Marchelli.

304
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,157
Walk'n, Fahrenheit...

305
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:48,486
I just got this.

306
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:52,431
Until the hearing,
no overseas exercises,

307
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:56,869
no sky policing.
Nothing but training work in France.

308
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:58,169
The bitch...

309
00:22:58,308 --> 00:22:59,138
Waruwa?

310
00:22:59,275 --> 00:22:59,934
Nothing.

311
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:00,940
He said nothing.

312
00:23:01,077 --> 00:23:01,668
Sure.

313
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,005
The Rafale course?

314
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,841
I'll send Bunker and Wanai.

315
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:06,676
Take their new recruits.

316
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:09,808
They want Kass in shape for Red Flag.

317
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,444
As for Hedget, she's on the exchange.

318
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:14,454
Sir, I remember that bitch on...

319
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,025
On Operation Cougar with Kass.

320
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,422
You'll fly with Hedget.

321
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:20,722
Walk'n can coach Kass.

322
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:22,353
Thanks.

323
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:23,829
I appreciate it.

324
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:28,604
Special Missions Squadron

325
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,020
Switch angle.

326
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,150
I'll refocus it.

327
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:56,893
Cold coffee?

328
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,694
Worse: Military tea.

329
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,103
How's it looking?

330
00:24:01,237 --> 00:24:04,365
Marchelli picks his trajectory
and opens fire.

331
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:07,772
Is our plane threatening Vallois?

332
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,899
Look.

333
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:12,344
Barth knows
Marchelli will shoot if he does.

334
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:13,881
It's intimidation.

335
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:18,545
Barth's counting on this deadlock
to make the other guys give up.

336
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,315
A typical aggressive ploy.

337
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:22,651
It works. Marchelli screwed up.

338
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,192
No, it doesn't work.

339
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:26,488
In that case,

340
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:28,460
why did Marchelli shoot first.

341
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,190
Why did a pilot like him.

342
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,233
Misinterpret
a typical aggressive ploy?

343
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,730
You realize who's behind this?

344
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:39,831
Don't worry, it won't stop there.

345
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:42,774
It'll be flight simulators
and latrine duty next.

346
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:46,940
If they come looking for us,
they'll find us.

347
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,675
That's for sure!

348
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:52,452
That's why I love this job too.

349
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,886
Even grounded, we get to 7th heaven.

350
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:57,219
I'd let her take my joystick.

351
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,123
Your flight suit's too tight.

352
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:01,492
I'm boiling hot in here, pal.

353
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:03,496
It'll pass.

354
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:05,456
I'm not so sure.

355
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:22,483
Sorry, my alarm didn't go off.
I hope I'm not too late.

356
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:24,245
I'll let you off, kid.

357
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:27,879
Open your flight manual
to page 32, chapter 5.

358
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:29,855
Let's see where you're at.

359
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,389
One on one,
sector 3-Charlie/3-Delta.

360
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:35,258
I enter, you lose.

361
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:38,367
3C/3D. Get your parachute ready.

362
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,847
Villette - State hunting lodge

363
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:21,269
De Seze from Dassault.

364
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:24,567
Mrs. Redgrave,
whose clients we all know.

365
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,141
General Buchanan
of the Australian Air Force.

366
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:31,406
The general helps with sales
to his part of the world.

367
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:32,742
Hello.

368
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:35,009
The general understands French.

369
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:39,588
Remember the Lindley contract?
48 long-range fighters?

370
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:40,848
We lost it.

371
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,719
To the F16-D Block 60.

372
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:44,656
We had lost it.

373
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:47,820
The general,

374
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:50,125
who knows that part of the world,
says the deal is on hold.

375
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:54,860
The client wants the plane fitted
with the new APG-80 radar.

376
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:59,873
But the Americans will only deliver it
with the standard APG-68.

377
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:03,308
Yet the United Arab Emirates
get the APG-80.

378
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:05,311
Off the record, of course.

379
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:08,349
This gives
the American plane's opponents

380
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:11,044
a case in favor of the French plane.

381
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:13,052
It's a unique opportunity.

382
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:16,886
But they don't care
if the plane can loop the loop.

383
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:18,857
They want a real demo?

384
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:22,897
To decide between the two planes,
they suggest...

385
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:24,329
a competition.

386
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:26,958
In the automobile world,
they call it a "cannonball".

387
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:34,941
Our Mirage 2000-D
would take off from here.

388
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:40,248
And the F-16 from the US Rota airbase
in southern Spain.

389
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,177
Arrival point: You there, them here.

390
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,153
4,125 miles in a straight line
to the Horn of Africa.

391
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,249
Same distance, same timing,
same flight conditions.

392
00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:54,124
The first plane
to pass over the target

393
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:57,755
and send back a satellite photo wins.

394
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,595
It's the typical "artillery race car."

395
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,730
The Americans are walking all over us.

396
00:29:03,873 --> 00:29:05,033
We need this order,
with the subcontracting,

397
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:06,835
or a load of jobs will be lost.

398
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:09,706
We can do the plane,

399
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:12,678
but not the flight.

400
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:15,375
It's over hostile territory.

401
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:16,507
To commit a plane,

402
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:18,916
I want two fighters as back-up.

403
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:21,683
So do the Americans.

404
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:24,757
It's a deal.

405
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:29,093
You're crazy,
accepting without the PM's approval!

406
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:41,373
You think someone would authorize
a thing like this?

407
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:48,473
If you play, you bet high stakes
or you're out.

408
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:51,450
I needed to get authorization first!

409
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:53,521
You know them like I do.

410
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,182
15,000 jobs.

411
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:57,155
You'll get what you ask.

412
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:59,261
And we'll take the rap.

413
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,192
That's what we're here for.

414
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:12,066
Come closer...

415
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,573
Come on, come closer.

416
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,669
Shit!

417
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:28,775
Bastard!

418
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:42,359
You've had it. 3C is mine.
Exercise over.

419
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:43,658
Shit!

420
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:11,359
I'm calling the PM.

421
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:14,121
The coded phone, please.

422
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,193
Thanks

423
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:27,476
You don't have thick arms
for an F-15 pilot.

424
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,204
The French talent for flattery.
I love it!

425
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,047
Hear the radio?

426
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:37,845
Our honor's saved.
Walk'n shot Kass down.

427
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:41,980
Screwed you, did he?

428
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,054
I saw. I was above you.

429
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:48,425
He used his John Derry Roll.

430
00:32:48,564 --> 00:32:49,428
His what?

431
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:50,930
His John Derry Roll.

432
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,500
An old Spitfire pilot trick.

433
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:54,694
He uses it often?

434
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:56,668
Only if he doesn't want
to make an effort.

435
00:32:58,207 --> 00:32:58,935
Who's that?

436
00:32:59,074 --> 00:32:59,836
Ipod.

437
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:02,603
The first pilot fitted with an MP3.

438
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:06,808
They agreed,

439
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:09,975
if the pilots
prepare their resignation.

440
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:13,545
You were right. Bravo.

441
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:18,357
The day things stop going
the way I plan them, I'll quit.

442
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:21,856
No one ever surprises you?

443
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:27,396
I have the feeling
you'll manage to do it.

444
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,960
You're often...

445
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:31,470
very close to it.

446
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,837
I'll take that as a compliment.

447
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:40,209
Ace of the Month

448
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:55,489
Morning...

449
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:56,859
Hiya.

450
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,660
Seen Seb?

451
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:01,793
He's gone to fetch croissants.

452
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:02,528
Want a refill?

453
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:03,968
No thanks.

454
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:09,940
What an honor.

455
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,445
Some never make it.

456
00:34:12,948 --> 00:34:15,007
But you do on the first day.

457
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:19,316
Estelle, why have you come to Orange?

458
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:20,979
To prepare Red Flag.

459
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:22,782
Walk'n...

460
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:27,123
We never meet on the ground.
Are you avoiding me?

461
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:28,958
No, really.

462
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:31,592
Not particularly anyhow.

463
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:33,395
You're improving.

464
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:36,237
You avoid me here, in the air...

465
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:38,135
Believe me, I don't.

466
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:40,537
Walk'n...

467
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:43,975
Your John Derry Roll...
I've watched you.

468
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:45,080
I can't do it.

469
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:47,808
I know. I've improved it.

470
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:51,977
It's better... and more effective.

471
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:53,748
Teach me?

472
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,182
If you want.

473
00:34:57,993 --> 00:34:59,290
Ready?

474
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:00,554
You swerve.

475
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:03,426
Neither too soon, nor too late.

476
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:06,659
You don't stop, you keep on pulling

477
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,136
and end up facing the other guy.

478
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,734
I need you.

479
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:19,438
Give us a second chance.
Would you follow me?

480
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:24,344
The way you fly
shows you haven't changed.

481
00:35:25,854 --> 00:35:27,549
See you later.

482
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:35,092
You've broken your word.

483
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,391
We made you, Ms. Redgrave.

484
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,501
This can unmake you!

485
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:43,562
The power of the mind cannot
twist these spoons.

486
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:49,144
But it can transport 30t of metal and
high technology to the other side of the world.

487
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:51,109
I'll welcome the outcome.

488
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:53,714
Our cells have been reactivated.

489
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:55,874
They're only waiting for you.

490
00:35:58,754 --> 00:36:00,119
That's it.

491
00:36:08,063 --> 00:36:09,291
Look.

492
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:11,160
The last minute of our flight.

493
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,699
Not the best but go on.

494
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:15,326
You, him and me.

495
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:17,962
The jerk opens fire on you. Why?

496
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:19,165
We screwed up his mission.

497
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:20,240
Exactly.

498
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:23,504
If he opened fire,
he had specific orders to.

499
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:28,413
Bertrand says he had orders to abort
if intercepted.

500
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:31,316
Maybe he's lying.

501
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:36,222
You sure don't mince words...

502
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:39,221
It's not logical.

503
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:40,521
What isn't?

504
00:36:40,662 --> 00:36:43,028
You saved a pilot. Me.

505
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:45,360
My training cost a fortune.

506
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:47,492
They should give you a medal.

507
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:50,867
We get sent out, called back...
Screw their inquiry.

508
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:53,236
You piss me off at times!

509
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,074
They're this close
to ripping our wings off.

510
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,174
You can always work for Vallois & Sons

511
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,940
but this is all I have.

512
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:05,118
I wanted to fly
before I could walk.

513
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:08,451
I won't let Miss 007
mess around with me.

514
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:12,193
You follow?

515
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:14,252
Don't I always?

516
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:15,988
Okay, let's get to work.

517
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:32,175
It's like a dogfight.

518
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:36,410
Visualize the position, then slip in.
You can't go wrong.

519
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,123
Visualizing?

520
00:37:43,258 --> 00:37:45,488
You bet I am!

521
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:53,561
Hedget!

522
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:54,794
Wait up.

523
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:57,768
I wanted to ask you...

524
00:37:57,906 --> 00:38:00,170
Where did you learn to do the splits?

525
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,041
I used to dance in bars.

526
00:38:03,178 --> 00:38:04,475
It paid for my studies.

527
00:38:04,613 --> 00:38:06,240
It's just dancing.

528
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:07,109
Oh, right.

529
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:08,341
I was thinking...

530
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:12,511
We're having a party
for Bunker and Wanai tonight.

531
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:15,418
Could you do a number for us?

532
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,252
Why not?

533
00:38:17,392 --> 00:38:18,359
Got money?

534
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:19,654
Money? What for?

535
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:22,263
You don't play if you don't pay,
baby, come on.

536
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:24,359
Oh, right.

537
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:31,033
Hurry it up!

538
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:37,076
Hedget, Hedget!

539
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,143
Go on, Hedget!

540
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:21,517
Let's move along.

541
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,015
These are Marchelli's shells.

542
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,595
But look at the tips
of the Mirage's wings. Smoke.

543
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:30,664
The missiles ignited
before Marchelli hit it.

544
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:34,166
Too late.
Marchelli's shells had struck.

545
00:39:34,303 --> 00:39:35,964
Go on. Scale two.

546
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:39,969
Five frames,
not even a quarter of a second.

547
00:39:40,108 --> 00:39:41,473
Be more precise.

548
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,137
Gunfire is the only way
to preclude a missile launch.

549
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,772
Surely Barth fired on Vallois
in reply to Marchelli.

550
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:50,179
Impossible.

551
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,880
Like this,
Barth couldn't see Marchelli's 2000.

552
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:56,081
He fired anyway.

553
00:39:56,658 --> 00:39:59,684
But what if Marchelli was wrong?

554
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:01,295
He wasn't.

555
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,025
Barth shot at Vallois,
Marchelli disarmed him.

556
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,294
No other pilot can do that.

557
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:38,089
This isn't like Barth at all.

558
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:43,671
Did the ground crew
see him board the plane?

559
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:46,631
What are you thinking?

560
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:51,405
I'm thinking the impossible,
that maybe it wasn't Barth.

561
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:54,908
Not bad.

562
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,109
Not bad for a bureaucrat.

563
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:59,550
I knew you would surprise me.

564
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,615
A Navy ship is searching

565
00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:05,693
the Forties sector
for the plane's wreckage.

566
00:41:24,946 --> 00:41:26,914
See how she eyed me?

567
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:29,279
Watch this and learn, pal.

568
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:31,916
Don't catch a chill.

569
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,544
Thanks, baby.

570
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,367
Your driver said he dropped you off.

571
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:52,437
I tried calling you.

572
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:55,134
I always walk from across the bridge.

573
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:00,478
I checked.
No one saw Barth board the plane.

574
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:03,916
What will you do about Marchelli?

575
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,849
I'll have the missile smoke erased.

576
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:07,750
What?

577
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:10,551
It's late. I'll get you a car.

578
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,759
You have three minutes to convince me.

579
00:42:24,206 --> 00:42:26,231
Sorry, I can't offer you a drink.

580
00:42:29,978 --> 00:42:33,106
They want pilots to resign
before their race?

581
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:36,445
I have better: Blacklisted ones.
The best going.

582
00:42:36,585 --> 00:42:38,746
You want them to fly for us too.

583
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:42,015
They'll work for any airline going
before us.

584
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,353
Here.

585
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:48,687
What do you see?

586
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:52,326
The only personal item
you seem to own.

587
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:55,061
They sent 15 agents and myself

588
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:57,262
to a place that'll stay secret.

589
00:42:57,405 --> 00:42:59,873
Our cover was blown and we failed.

590
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:01,441
They signed our resignations for us.

591
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:02,907
Only four men returned.

592
00:43:03,044 --> 00:43:06,343
But we all signed up for more

593
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:08,711
without any regrets.

594
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:13,687
What are you exactly?
A civilian or a soldier?

595
00:43:14,823 --> 00:43:16,791
I'm whatever you want.

596
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:19,256
What I was trying to say

597
00:43:19,394 --> 00:43:22,386
is that principles
can't resist an ideal.

598
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:25,967
They'll come
as the only one to give them a jet

599
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:28,296
will be me at Special Missions.

600
00:43:28,436 --> 00:43:31,530
Excellent plan B. Let me try first.

601
00:43:37,245 --> 00:43:39,145
We were all in Bosnia.

602
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:40,908
Operation Cougar.

603
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:43,677
A night mission
to destroy an arms dump.

604
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:47,550
Artillery, ground-to-air missiles
everywhere...

605
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:50,681
Kass went alone
to take all the credit.

606
00:43:50,826 --> 00:43:54,159
I ended up without cover
and I got hit.

607
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:58,289
I ejected in the Serbian zone.
It took me days to get back.

608
00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:00,264
God, I didn't know!

609
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:04,363
I won't fly with her.
I don't trust her.

610
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:06,133
I've known her six months.

611
00:44:06,274 --> 00:44:09,300
All she told me was about

612
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:10,934
splitting up with Marchelli after Bosnia

613
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:13,912
and her two years in the Gulf
to forget.

614
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:17,608
Do we have to talk about her?

615
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,451
Let's celebrate the death of a proverb.

616
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:22,022
What?

617
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:23,681
Pretty girls are never free

618
00:44:23,825 --> 00:44:25,053
and free ones are rarely pretty.

619
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:26,785
What does that mean?

620
00:44:26,928 --> 00:44:28,486
I'll show you!

621
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,238
Very nice...

622
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:54,247
Peaceful,

623
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:56,482
the estate agent told me.

624
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,559
But he didn't know you.

625
00:44:58,693 --> 00:44:59,785
How did you find me?

626
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:01,896
Easy for Special Missions.

627
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,989
You haven't come 400 miles
to savor such a minor success.

628
00:45:08,236 --> 00:45:09,669
I have a mission.

629
00:45:09,804 --> 00:45:12,170
Vallois and you
are the pilots it needs.

630
00:45:13,008 --> 00:45:14,441
The answer's no.

631
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:19,077
I expected such a conventional reaction.

632
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,317
You have a debt, captain,

633
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:26,977
towards us and France.

634
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:31,483
You're a man of honor.

635
00:45:31,626 --> 00:45:32,923
Of course.

636
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:35,759
Do this mission for us or...

637
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:37,923
Go on.

638
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:43,360
Or the commission will down you
like our Mirage 2000.

639
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:44,870
How about that.

640
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,978
Take my offer.

641
00:45:51,112 --> 00:45:53,046
It's an honorable way out.

642
00:45:53,181 --> 00:45:55,149
You think you know pilots.

643
00:45:55,283 --> 00:45:57,444
I know men fairly well.

644
00:45:57,585 --> 00:45:59,246
But I don't understand you.

645
00:45:59,387 --> 00:46:01,787
Meet me at the base at 1500 hours.

646
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:05,120
I imagine you can get
flight authorization.

647
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,557
All right.

648
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:25,110
Know the Luberon?

649
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:26,372
Not really.

650
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:27,708
Just wait.

651
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:29,077
It's not bad.

652
00:46:49,004 --> 00:46:50,266
Look to the right.

653
00:46:50,405 --> 00:46:52,532
The Alps.

654
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:21,432
What do you say?

655
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,865
Magnificent!

656
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:36,674
You don't feel sick?

657
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:38,149
I don't think so.

658
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:39,719
Let's carry on.

659
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:57,036
Take the controls.

660
00:47:57,172 --> 00:47:57,763
How?

661
00:47:57,906 --> 00:48:00,534
Use the throttle and the joystick.

662
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:03,635
I don't feel much.

663
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:05,177
Go on, don't be afraid.

664
00:48:07,248 --> 00:48:07,976
There.

665
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:09,583
Got it now?

666
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:12,650
Let's head to the left now.

667
00:48:13,188 --> 00:48:14,883
Over to you.

668
00:48:21,896 --> 00:48:24,797
Time for a break. I'll take over.

669
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:31,834
Pull it slowly towards you now.

670
00:48:31,973 --> 00:48:32,667
Gently.

671
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:34,172
Holy cow!

672
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,415
It's fantastic, Marchelli!

673
00:48:57,532 --> 00:48:58,260
You like it?

674
00:48:58,399 --> 00:48:59,730
I love it.

675
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,107
Chocks away, Toby.

676
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:25,991
Ready?

677
00:49:28,963 --> 00:49:30,692
Go on, reach out.

678
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:47,842
What do you say?

679
00:49:47,982 --> 00:49:49,916
It's so beautiful...

680
00:49:51,586 --> 00:49:53,110
It isn't always.

681
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:54,050
What do you mean?

682
00:49:54,189 --> 00:49:55,281
Fahrenheit?

683
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,280
Right behind you.

684
00:49:59,727 --> 00:50:00,386
What's that?

685
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:02,393
This plane will pursue us.

686
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,260
We can't fight back. Sounds familiar?

687
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,332
- Engage hostilities.

688
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:07,525
Roger.

689
00:50:11,105 --> 00:50:14,438
It's just an exercise.
You know you won't die.

690
00:50:20,448 --> 00:50:22,643
Okay, I get the message, Marchelli.

691
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:24,012
Jesus...

692
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:13,766
I get the message!

693
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,027
Let's head back.

694
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:25,605
Are you okay?

695
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:32,620
Now you know
what my partner went through.

696
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:35,848
Except you got
the safe, VIP treatment.

697
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,787
So drop the blackmail.

698
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:39,790
See you at the hearing.

699
00:51:39,927 --> 00:51:41,189
Jeff!

700
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:42,921
Look after the lady.

701
00:51:51,205 --> 00:51:52,672
You listen to me now!

702
00:51:53,574 --> 00:51:56,634
Intelligence reports the presence
of dormant terrorist cells.

703
00:51:56,778 --> 00:52:01,613
They're in places
that would terrify you.

704
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:03,910
The Mirage 2000 incident

705
00:52:04,052 --> 00:52:07,146
hints at their presence
among our pilots.

706
00:52:07,288 --> 00:52:09,153
I can't tell the hearing that.

707
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,485
I have a tough mission
and you're the only one I can trust.

708
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:13,218
I came to tell you that.

709
00:52:13,361 --> 00:52:16,819
But you can go to hell!

710
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:18,488
Welcome to Civvy Street!

711
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:25,472
Salon de Provence Airbase

712
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:39,752
Vallois first, then Marchelli.

713
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:02,902
Marchelli!

714
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:13,350
Captain Marchelli, sir.

715
00:53:13,488 --> 00:53:17,754
Please remain standing
to hear Colonel Farje's report.

716
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:30,169
Riesling sent us there.

717
00:53:30,304 --> 00:53:32,966
The counter-order came too late.

718
00:53:33,107 --> 00:53:34,734
That order was to abort.

719
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,468
That was impossible.

720
00:53:36,611 --> 00:53:38,101
My partner was under attack.

721
00:53:38,246 --> 00:53:40,077
Two to one?

722
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:45,219
Despite Special Missions' claim,
the pilot had orders to fight.

723
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:46,718
Captain,

724
00:53:46,854 --> 00:53:49,049
can you prove that?

725
00:53:49,657 --> 00:53:51,420
Go on, captain.

726
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:52,719
General,

727
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,658
perhaps someone
aware of the mission

728
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:58,231
tried to commandeer it.

729
00:53:58,366 --> 00:53:59,458
Captain Marchelli,

730
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,364
this board doesn't deal in theories

731
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:04,767
but in hard facts.

732
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:07,240
Colonel Farje?

733
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:12,309
Ignition of a Magic 2 missile

734
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:15,939
necessarily and instantly
creates a puff of smoke.

735
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:18,381
The expert's report says so.

736
00:54:27,562 --> 00:54:30,326
No smoke. The analysis...

737
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:31,955
of your flight data
shows no use of weaponry

738
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,967
against you or your team-mate.

739
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:37,536
That's impossible.

740
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:40,766
This footage
must have been tampered with!

741
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,302
General,

742
00:54:43,444 --> 00:54:47,540
someone is covering up
the theft of an armed combat fighter!

743
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:49,082
General,

744
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:52,186
Captain Marchelli's words
are so serious

745
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,982
that I request time
to investigate this.

746
00:54:55,122 --> 00:54:56,851
That won't be necessary.

747
00:54:56,991 --> 00:55:00,620
The board concludes that you chose

748
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:02,729
to ignore the order to abort,

749
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:06,300
losing us a plane and its pilot.

750
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:09,733
You are dismissed from the Air Force

751
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:14,137
and returned to civilian life
while awaiting penal proceedings.

752
00:55:42,703 --> 00:55:44,136
Well?

753
00:55:45,673 --> 00:55:47,265
Shit...

754
00:55:49,143 --> 00:55:50,872
They fired you.

755
00:55:52,747 --> 00:55:54,112
Wait!

756
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:57,748
Corporal!

757
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:10,220
You're a pilot, son.

758
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:45,655
Who goes there?

759
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:49,667
Are you with the unit, captain?

760
00:56:49,804 --> 00:56:50,964
No, sergeant.

761
00:56:51,105 --> 00:56:53,665
I'm afraid you'll have to leave.

762
00:56:54,575 --> 00:56:56,099
I know.

763
00:57:06,954 --> 00:57:10,219
Royan - 3 months later

764
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:46,526
110 knots. Is this junkjammed?

765
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:54,965
120 knots...

766
00:57:55,102 --> 00:57:56,569
It's not jammed.
I'm bored shitless here.

767
00:58:08,848 --> 00:58:10,611
Stop! That's okay.

768
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,615
There'll be no flying today.

769
00:58:13,152 --> 00:58:14,744
Do the oil-change.

770
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:23,823
You're not going to do it?

771
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:27,794
Of course I am.

772
00:58:28,268 --> 00:58:30,099
If it rains, we see to the planes.

773
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:32,127
If it's sunny, we fly.

774
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:33,796
Call this flying?

775
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,239
Look at you.
You're an elevator attendant!

776
00:58:37,377 --> 00:58:41,313
You take guys up, you come back down,
take some more up...

777
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:43,847
In mine, I could step out to pee!

778
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:48,044
No, this isn't flying.

779
00:58:50,023 --> 00:58:52,958
Before, we'd open up the throttle

780
00:58:53,092 --> 00:58:55,026
and see the sun every day.

781
00:58:57,363 --> 00:58:59,160
That's flying.

782
00:58:59,299 --> 00:59:00,857
Not this.

783
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:06,628
Why has every airline blacklisted us?
Isn't that fishy?

784
00:59:06,773 --> 00:59:08,365
We've had it, okay.

785
00:59:08,508 --> 00:59:11,238
I don't care.
I have all I need here:

786
00:59:11,377 --> 00:59:13,538
Sky, air and time to forget.

787
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,238
Split if you want.

788
00:59:15,381 --> 00:59:17,008
Sure I will.

789
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:32,955
I didn't think you'd come.

790
00:59:33,766 --> 00:59:35,131
How is he?

791
00:59:35,268 --> 00:59:36,030
In a bad way.

792
00:59:36,169 --> 00:59:38,433
You convinced him he killed a pilot.

793
00:59:39,939 --> 00:59:41,429
Can I help you?

794
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:43,599
No, I'm here to help you.

795
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:46,844
Here's how it stands.

796
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,845
Tony was right.

797
00:59:48,982 --> 00:59:52,543
You were fooled
but wouldn't tell the hearing that.

798
00:59:55,655 --> 00:59:57,145
Can you keep a secret?

799
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,758
I owe you that for coming.

800
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,427
Maybe the pilot wasn't Barth.

801
01:00:04,364 --> 01:00:07,060
We need the wreckage
to ascertain that.

802
01:00:08,067 --> 01:00:10,763
No one learns to fly a 2000
on the Net.

803
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:14,236
There can't be
more than a handful of guys.

804
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:17,002
We've watched them since 9-11.

805
01:00:17,143 --> 01:00:20,635
Outside the armed forces,
there are 25 in Europe.

806
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:24,716
One of them went missing
after the Farnborough incident.

807
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:28,120
Whose side are you on?

808
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:30,119
You have to trust me.

809
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:35,422
Will that be enough?

810
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:40,222
It'll have to be.

811
01:00:49,742 --> 01:00:51,039
Just a second.

812
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:55,943
Tony, you have a visitor.

813
01:00:58,885 --> 01:01:01,149
Don't be pigheaded, please.

814
01:01:02,388 --> 01:01:03,753
Enough.

815
01:01:08,828 --> 01:01:12,662
I sent for her
so give her five minutes, okay?

816
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:16,934
Okay, but only five.

817
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:36,714
I'm sorry about what happened.

818
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:43,455
You treated me as an enemy.

819
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,990
You were wrong. I tried to warn you.

820
01:01:54,507 --> 01:01:57,999
Are you going to sulk
and fly that crate forever?

821
01:01:58,144 --> 01:01:59,907
What a hero!

822
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:31,169
Here.

823
01:02:31,878 --> 01:02:34,142
Thanks for the clothes.

824
01:02:42,288 --> 01:02:44,279
My offer still stands.

825
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,525
Play straight with me.

826
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:50,561
I think the cannonball is at risk.

827
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:54,559
They won't fail this time.

828
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,101
I only have suspicions.
Help me to confirm them.

829
01:03:09,148 --> 01:03:10,012
Will you drive me back?

830
01:03:10,149 --> 01:03:11,844
No.

831
01:04:04,804 --> 01:04:08,604
That's the main outline.
Now meet your teammates.

832
01:04:09,675 --> 01:04:11,142
Send them in.

833
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:15,904
The government requires
prior resignation from pilots.

834
01:04:16,048 --> 01:04:19,711
You'll be reinstated on return
for services rendered.

835
01:04:19,852 --> 01:04:21,285
All right.

836
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:23,313
I must be dreaming!

837
01:04:23,456 --> 01:04:25,083
You're not.

838
01:04:25,224 --> 01:04:26,350
Something wrong?

839
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:30,656
Yes, I think Captain Kass represents
a danger for this mission.

840
01:04:31,264 --> 01:04:34,199
This isn't Orange,
but Special Missions.

841
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,597
Captain Kass has volunteered.

842
01:04:36,736 --> 01:04:38,829
Her record shows she can work

843
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:41,804
with you to pull this off.

844
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:46,642
Marchelli,
leader on the 2000-D flown by Kass.

845
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:48,644
Ipod and Vallois as back-up.

846
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:51,011
You and your planes will be armed.

847
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:55,177
No flight clearance.
4,125 miles over hostile territories.

848
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:59,655
Any rescue mission
would be even more impossible to set up.

849
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:02,192
So you're on your own out there.

850
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:03,625
A single goal:

851
01:05:03,763 --> 01:05:06,698
Our plane
must be the first over the target.

852
01:05:06,832 --> 01:05:08,197
Nothing else matters.

853
01:05:15,675 --> 01:05:18,940
Red Flag was a front.

854
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:25,646
Why did you come?
Why are you doing this?

855
01:05:25,785 --> 01:05:27,252
For the fun of it.

856
01:05:27,386 --> 01:05:29,411
For the fun of flying with you.

857
01:05:31,424 --> 01:05:35,190
Level 2-90. Direct to 3D-07.

858
01:05:35,328 --> 01:05:36,352
And at 3-70...

859
01:05:36,495 --> 01:05:39,692
Why did you follow that bitch?

860
01:05:39,832 --> 01:05:41,060
She has her good points.

861
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,328
We pass 50 nautical miles
from Tripoli?

862
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,732
That's right.

863
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:48,169
Come on, tell me.

864
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:49,640
At 3-70...

865
01:05:49,775 --> 01:05:53,836
That's not what I mean.
There's nothing at 3-70.

866
01:05:53,979 --> 01:05:57,142
She touched your ass!
I'm not stupid.

867
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:06,889
Found the wreckage?

868
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:08,288
Not yet.

869
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:13,028
Three other pilots
have vanished recently.

870
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:14,996
All qualified to fly the 2000.

871
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:17,062
It smells fishy.

872
01:06:17,203 --> 01:06:18,500
Don't worry.

873
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:48,127
Of course.

874
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:54,300
Our competitors have left.

875
01:06:54,974 --> 01:06:56,874
Every minute counts now.

876
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:08,745
Check the nav lights.

877
01:07:58,471 --> 01:07:59,768
Something wrong?

878
01:07:59,905 --> 01:08:01,338
No, I'm okay.

879
01:08:02,475 --> 01:08:04,409
Control will keep us posted.

880
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:08,001
Until they refuel
and vanish from the radar screens.

881
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:15,152
Off Sardinia

882
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,155
Hooligan 15 to Big Fat Alpha.

883
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:26,027
Can you serve some thirsty guys?

884
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:27,928
Welcome to the duty-free zone,
Hooligan 15.

885
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:31,503
Perfume? Souvenirs?

886
01:08:31,637 --> 01:08:35,198
I'll take 8 tons of S34 fuel.
With a straw for two.

887
01:08:35,341 --> 01:08:37,866
Okay, hook onto the nipple.

888
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:40,907
You wiped your mouth?

889
01:08:41,046 --> 01:08:42,536
Should I have?

890
01:08:49,822 --> 01:08:51,312
When's the next service area?

891
01:08:51,457 --> 01:08:52,924
In two hours. Why?

892
01:08:53,058 --> 01:08:54,821
I forgot to pee.

893
01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:00,122
Next rendezvous

894
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:02,234
in 6 minutes for radar erasure.

895
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:05,132
Turn the light off, honey,
I can't see the road.

896
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:06,704
Yes, sir.

897
01:09:14,747 --> 01:09:17,307
Ready to switch radar signatures.

898
01:09:19,184 --> 01:09:22,085
Note transpoder for exchange:
1536.

899
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:25,980
Manta, note transpoder:

900
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,149
2112.

901
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:28,817
2112. Roger.

902
01:09:29,762 --> 01:09:31,525
Hooligan 20 to 15 and 16,

903
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:33,291
cut transpoders.

904
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:38,695
Exchange complete. Thanks, Manta.

905
01:09:42,508 --> 01:09:46,535
Tripoli - Radar control station

906
01:09:46,845 --> 01:09:50,340
Sir, come and see.
Three unidentified dots!

907
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,412
Okay, one radar echo for three.

908
01:09:52,849 --> 01:09:54,144
Close formation.

909
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,194
There's only one dot.

910
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:08,357
It's the Airbus
and it's on the schedule.

911
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:19,140
Let's melt into the landscape.

912
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:23,915
Libyan coast

913
01:11:02,521 --> 01:11:03,647
Where are they?

914
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:05,689
They vanished 45 minutes ago.

915
01:11:05,824 --> 01:11:07,485
After the Americans?

916
01:11:07,626 --> 01:11:11,585
Ten minutes before.
The Americans had trouble refueling.

917
01:11:14,133 --> 01:11:16,931
East Africa

918
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:52,430
Fahrenheit, everything okay?

919
01:11:52,571 --> 01:11:55,836
Climb, we're using too much juice.

920
01:11:55,974 --> 01:11:58,135
Head up, we're low on fuel.

921
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:02,236
Negative. We refuel in 40 minutes,
we can make it.

922
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:05,350
With no safety margin.
Climb, okay!

923
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:20,330
What frequency do we use?

924
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:31,242
Hooligan 20,
I have a fuel emergency.

925
01:12:31,376 --> 01:12:33,901
I don't see them anywhere!

926
01:12:34,046 --> 01:12:36,139
15 minutes to playtime.

927
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:37,407
You hear, Poodle?

928
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:38,743
Negative, Walk'n.

929
01:12:38,884 --> 01:12:41,648
We land, that's an order.
The fuel's all gone.

930
01:12:42,221 --> 01:12:43,984
We're out too.

931
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:48,389
Head for Charlie emergency strip.
It's the only solution.

932
01:13:24,997 --> 01:13:27,090
I hope our diplomats are good.

933
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:30,259
You said it.

934
01:13:30,402 --> 01:13:33,838
Full weaponry and no clearance,
they'll love us!

935
01:13:52,925 --> 01:13:54,950
This is a disused strip?

936
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:58,362
Right, let's get acquainted.

937
01:14:02,968 --> 01:14:04,731
Hands up. Don't move.

938
01:14:31,697 --> 01:14:33,961
Bang on time.

939
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:35,293
What's going on?

940
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:41,334
We just gave three planes away.

941
01:14:41,907 --> 01:14:43,465
The planes haven't landed.

942
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,077
The tanker crew was killed.

943
01:15:04,096 --> 01:15:05,825
Thanks for the jets.

944
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:10,925
Around here, a French pilot
is worth 10 million bucks.

945
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:13,761
As for her...

946
01:15:23,181 --> 01:15:24,443
Take her away.

947
01:15:26,952 --> 01:15:27,816
Walk'n!

948
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:32,648
Walk'n!

949
01:15:51,109 --> 01:15:52,371
Fucking hell!

950
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:55,345
Ipod

951
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,311
Try to breathe. Look at me.
Hold on.

952
01:15:57,449 --> 01:15:58,939
Breathe, Ipod.

953
01:16:09,594 --> 01:16:12,222
Handcuff the pilot.

954
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:14,491
Bring the plane back.

955
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:16,225
We suffered enough damage today.

956
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:28,537
Our forces are on alert.
I've asked for a satellite.

957
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,944
Coste, go and hold the PM's hand.

958
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:34,280
De Seze, go with her
and find your arms dealer.

959
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:36,353
Ask Coste's help if need be.

960
01:16:36,488 --> 01:16:39,082
We know where the runway is?
We have the satellite?

961
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:41,749
It's sweeping the region, sir.

962
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:51,330
Act quickly.

963
01:16:52,537 --> 01:16:55,506
Transport the plane back.

964
01:17:04,049 --> 01:17:07,746
Not a single mayday
from any of the planes. It's crazy.

965
01:17:10,622 --> 01:17:12,021
Excuse me...

966
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:18,058
The naval office, please.

967
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:24,262
How is the search
for the wreckage of the 2000 going?

968
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:28,798
That's right. I'll hold.

969
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:34,944
You were told to search in Forties?

970
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:38,709
Dogger?

971
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,647
Who told you Dogger?

972
01:17:43,255 --> 01:17:44,984
Turn back. Hurry!

973
01:18:18,056 --> 01:18:19,421
No one.

974
01:18:28,633 --> 01:18:32,467
That's a crazy scheme.
It'll never work.

975
01:18:32,604 --> 01:18:35,004
After Estelle,

976
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,734
and Ipod...

977
01:18:37,876 --> 01:18:40,640
what if we do get taken out?

978
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,247
You're on.

979
01:18:43,381 --> 01:18:44,814
Shut up.

980
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,948
The plane won't start.

981
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:55,616
Come and do it.

982
01:19:32,197 --> 01:19:34,188
Maybe you spat in it.

983
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,512
It's okay now.

984
01:19:53,652 --> 01:19:55,586
We'll take her up to check.

985
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,120
Show me how the radar works.

986
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:01,382
Your ejector seat is off

987
01:20:01,526 --> 01:20:04,757
so if anything goes wrong, I'll eject

988
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:08,721
and you'll make a big hole
in the desert.

989
01:20:08,867 --> 01:20:10,232
Count on it.

990
01:20:22,647 --> 01:20:24,012
Perfect timing.

991
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:26,583
As precise as a pilot hitting
a target.

992
01:20:26,718 --> 01:20:29,516
Everything is fine.
The plane will be in France tomorrow.

993
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:32,782
The family grows daily
but you are its star.

994
01:20:32,924 --> 01:20:34,414
Thank you, Aziz,

995
01:20:34,559 --> 01:20:38,495
but save your compliments
for when we finish the job.

996
01:20:58,883 --> 01:20:59,611
400 knots.

997
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:01,275
The radar's clear.

998
01:21:01,419 --> 01:21:04,217
In attack mode,
we're at 150 feet, 500 knots.

999
01:21:04,356 --> 01:21:04,981
You follow?

1000
01:21:05,123 --> 01:21:06,215
Yes.

1001
01:21:11,096 --> 01:21:13,690
600 knots,
field at 15 nautical miles.

1002
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,060
Better than TV.

1003
01:21:20,105 --> 01:21:22,573
What's up?

1004
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,261
What the hell are you doing?

1005
01:22:24,402 --> 01:22:25,835
Sure, we'll tell him.

1006
01:22:27,872 --> 01:22:29,601
Everybody, move.

1007
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:46,121
Everybody, move.

1008
01:23:02,173 --> 01:23:03,868
I'll take care of this.

1009
01:23:22,093 --> 01:23:23,788
Hurry.

1010
01:23:35,073 --> 01:23:36,370
Shoot them down.

1011
01:23:39,043 --> 01:23:41,034
It's too late
Move the truck away.

1012
01:24:32,397 --> 01:24:36,265
In our job,
sorrow and joy are equally intense.

1013
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:40,770
To those who are back,

1014
01:24:40,905 --> 01:24:42,805
to the one lost,
and to one we hope will be back soon.

1015
01:24:42,941 --> 01:24:45,307
To them... and to fighters!

1016
01:24:50,648 --> 01:24:51,945
Give me a beer instead.

1017
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:52,549
Coming up.

1018
01:24:52,684 --> 01:24:56,814
Actually, I did more or less
what I did with you.

1019
01:24:56,955 --> 01:24:59,788
I attacked.
My joystick was rock hard.

1020
01:24:59,924 --> 01:25:02,620
I pushed through...

1021
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,227
Stardust!

1022
01:25:04,362 --> 01:25:05,454
Thanks.

1023
01:25:07,599 --> 01:25:08,827
Hey. Pete.

1024
01:25:08,967 --> 01:25:10,730
Babe, where are you?

1025
01:25:11,336 --> 01:25:13,065
Marseille?

1026
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:16,205
Oh sure I can, baby, sure.

1027
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:18,070
Okay, darling.

1028
01:25:18,209 --> 01:25:19,733
I love you, too.

1029
01:25:20,778 --> 01:25:24,214
Darling? Who's this Pete guy?
Your brother?

1030
01:25:24,349 --> 01:25:25,816
Not exactly.

1031
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:29,886
It's my boyfriend. A Navy pilot.
He's in Marseille.

1032
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:31,818
I don't quite get this.

1033
01:25:31,956 --> 01:25:34,891
If he's your boyfriend, who am I?

1034
01:25:35,026 --> 01:25:36,084
You?

1035
01:25:36,227 --> 01:25:38,058
Sexfriend, baby.

1036
01:25:38,196 --> 01:25:41,097
Hey listen, I'm in France for a year.

1037
01:25:41,232 --> 01:25:42,893
It's life.

1038
01:25:43,034 --> 01:25:44,661
Gotta go, baby.

1039
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:48,839
What a bitch...

1040
01:25:48,973 --> 01:25:50,770
Pretty girls are...

1041
01:25:50,909 --> 01:25:53,207
Know what? Keep your mouth shut.

1042
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,218
I don't know about you,
but generals kowtowing to us,

1043
01:26:04,355 --> 01:26:06,880
I can't get enough.

1044
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:08,390
Walk'n!

1045
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:10,084
Paris, Military School

1046
01:26:10,995 --> 01:26:12,758
Wait here for me.

1047
01:26:12,897 --> 01:26:13,522
All set, then?

1048
01:26:13,665 --> 01:26:14,529
Yes.

1049
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,133
I'll leave you.

1050
01:26:16,267 --> 01:26:17,131
No, don't go.

1051
01:26:17,268 --> 01:26:18,826
I'm not into watching.

1052
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:20,369
Cut it out. Stay.

1053
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:21,699
You're shape.

1054
01:26:21,839 --> 01:26:26,037
A week of desert heat with cool guys,
couldn't have been better!

1055
01:26:26,177 --> 01:26:28,236
Any news of Captain Kass?

1056
01:26:28,379 --> 01:26:31,644
Our teams won't give up
as long as there's hope.

1057
01:26:31,783 --> 01:26:34,616
We were all fooled.

1058
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,516
The satellite photo
backs up your reports.

1059
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:41,284
Only one Mirage was destroyed.
Where's the other?

1060
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,661
Why do they want a 2000 so badly?

1061
01:26:45,797 --> 01:26:49,790
No idea.
To attack an American ship maybe.

1062
01:26:49,934 --> 01:26:51,526
In the Gulf?

1063
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:55,366
That plane can strike
where and when it wants.

1064
01:26:55,506 --> 01:26:58,703
This weekend's European summit?
I know.

1065
01:26:58,843 --> 01:27:00,834
We have fighters, AWACS planes,

1066
01:27:00,979 --> 01:27:03,607
missiles and six choppers.

1067
01:27:03,748 --> 01:27:07,206
Paris is airtight
but can a fighter get through?

1068
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:09,616
Alone? No.

1069
01:27:11,055 --> 01:27:16,253
Senonches - Disused airfield

1070
01:27:16,995 --> 01:27:18,019
Straighten up!

1071
01:27:18,162 --> 01:27:18,992
Straighten up.

1072
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,929
Let's move it!

1073
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,237
Don't you have a TV at home?

1074
01:27:34,379 --> 01:27:36,711
I don't have friends at home.

1075
01:27:37,382 --> 01:27:40,283
You were lonely so you thought,

1076
01:27:40,418 --> 01:27:42,511
I'll go over to my pal's place
to eat some chocolate.

1077
01:27:42,654 --> 01:27:43,678
Why not?

1078
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:46,654
Don't you ever take time off?

1079
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:51,554
Live from the Champs-Elysees...

1080
01:27:51,696 --> 01:27:52,560
It's starting.

1081
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:57,400
The Air Force
has been here since dawn,

1082
01:27:57,535 --> 01:27:59,560
notably with AWACS surveillance

1083
01:27:59,704 --> 01:28:03,140
ensuring security around Paris.

1084
01:28:03,274 --> 01:28:08,541
Because of the European summit
with 25 heads of state,

1085
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,514
the security measures
have never been so important.

1086
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:16,086
Sharpshooters are in place
on the Arc de Triomphe

1087
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:20,350
to secure the President's drive
along the Champs-Elysees.

1088
01:28:21,693 --> 01:28:25,561
Seb, the 2000 won't come
from the outside.

1089
01:28:25,697 --> 01:28:27,130
It's already inside.

1090
01:28:27,265 --> 01:28:28,027
Shit!

1091
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:29,497
Call Command!

1092
01:28:36,841 --> 01:28:39,173
Sharko 21 and 22 supersonic.

1093
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:42,837
Contact established.
Radio in at subsonic speed.

1094
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,038
Copy.

1095
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:57,986
Sharko 21, all aircraft
are in the holding pattern.

1096
01:28:58,129 --> 01:29:00,495
Three minutes to parade start.

1097
01:29:24,222 --> 01:29:26,156
How's this going to play out?

1098
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:28,315
If the tanker blows,
it'll be a massacre.

1099
01:29:28,459 --> 01:29:32,520
20,000 gallons of kerosene.
It's a flying bomb!

1100
01:29:53,084 --> 01:29:56,247
I have a dot too many
in the tanker group.

1101
01:29:56,387 --> 01:29:58,912
Yes, 4 dots confirmed.

1102
01:29:59,056 --> 01:30:00,455
That's him. Go!

1103
01:30:05,096 --> 01:30:06,461
Begin parade.

1104
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,648
Seb, push 202 alpha.

1105
01:30:24,782 --> 01:30:26,306
Roger. Coding.

1106
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:27,883
6 more to go.

1107
01:30:28,019 --> 01:30:30,419
Target 5 nautical miles ahead.

1108
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:50,835
There he is.

1109
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:53,637
Get between him and the tanker.
I'll intercept him.

1110
01:30:54,645 --> 01:30:55,839
Sharko 21 to Mirage 2000.

1111
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,914
Land immediately.

1112
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:00,276
Final warning!

1113
01:31:00,418 --> 01:31:02,545
I give the orders now, Walk'n.

1114
01:31:02,687 --> 01:31:03,779
It's Kass!

1115
01:31:04,589 --> 01:31:06,580
Walk'n, okay? You hear me?

1116
01:31:07,959 --> 01:31:09,483
I'm going after her.

1117
01:31:10,228 --> 01:31:11,354
Want back-up?

1118
01:31:11,495 --> 01:31:13,292
Stay with the tanker.

1119
01:31:27,745 --> 01:31:29,440
Don't do it, Estelle!

1120
01:31:29,947 --> 01:31:31,744
There's no more Estelle. Get lost!

1121
01:31:42,026 --> 01:31:43,516
Fuck!

1122
01:31:44,362 --> 01:31:45,522
Holy cow!

1123
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:55,236
They've passed by now. Land.

1124
01:31:55,373 --> 01:31:56,772
Screw you!

1125
01:32:09,353 --> 01:32:10,513
Too late, Walk'n.

1126
01:32:12,323 --> 01:32:16,453
Sharko 21, Sharko 22,
shoot down plane immediately.

1127
01:32:16,594 --> 01:32:18,824
It's too crowded below.

1128
01:32:21,866 --> 01:32:25,324
It's heading back to Paris.
It's lost 500 feet.

1129
01:32:34,545 --> 01:32:36,740
An opening 10 degrees east!

1130
01:32:47,591 --> 01:32:49,422
Walk'n, it's Stan.

1131
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,187
Mission completed, Stan.

1132
01:32:54,332 --> 01:32:56,129
Gibraltar, Spain

1133
01:32:56,267 --> 01:32:58,292
Thank you.

1134
01:32:58,936 --> 01:33:02,497
Those planes were to be used
in the Gulf,

1135
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,039
not in France.

1136
01:33:04,175 --> 01:33:08,339
I believe that's what you call
a mission reassignment.

1137
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,004
All right.

1138
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,881
I have one for you too.

1139
01:33:51,589 --> 01:33:53,056
It doesn't matter.

1140
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:56,125
If you want to blend in with goats,
don't be a dog...

1141
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,625
but a rabbit.

1142
01:33:57,762 --> 01:33:59,889
If you want to eat with tigers,

1143
01:34:00,031 --> 01:34:02,499
don't be a lion,
but a cat.

1144
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:05,602
That way, they'll never
find you.

1145
01:34:05,736 --> 01:34:09,866
If they want beardies, they can
always try looking for them.

1146
01:34:21,485 --> 01:34:23,817
Walk'n, there's a visitor for you.

1147
01:34:27,058 --> 01:34:28,525
Thanks, Walk'n.

1148
01:34:30,227 --> 01:34:31,387
You're in Orange?

1149
01:34:31,529 --> 01:34:33,929
I couldn't resist getting here first.

1150
01:34:36,267 --> 01:34:37,234
Ready, Fahrenheit?

1151
01:34:37,368 --> 01:34:40,769
Anytime, baby. But for what?

1152
01:34:40,905 --> 01:34:42,566
An emotional shock.

1153
01:34:42,706 --> 01:34:44,003
You with me?

1154
01:34:48,145 --> 01:34:49,737
I love this!

1155
01:35:01,492 --> 01:35:02,356
Walk'n?

1156
01:35:02,493 --> 01:35:04,188
I'm on my way, beauty.

1157
01:35:04,328 --> 01:35:06,489
Sharko 21 and 22, supersonic.

1158
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:08,359
I'm waiting.

1159
01:35:49,306 --> 01:36:08,523
