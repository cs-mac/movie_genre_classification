00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,735
        All right, let's go.
        Everybody have a seat.

272
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,803
              Aw.

273
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,572
    Look who it is.

274
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,407
      You here to clean
      the blackboards?

275
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,346
        For those of you
        who don't remember me,
        my name is Eugene Brown.

276
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,881
       Does that mean
       we can call you "Genie?"

277
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,150
        That'd be the last thing
        you ever call me.

280
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,688
               This here
               is a chess board.

281
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,991
                Anybody know how
                to play chess?

283
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,194
                Hey, yo.

284
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,996
              You think you're
              pretty smart, huh?

285
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,998
       Why don't you
       come up here
       and play me a game, then.

286
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,467
        You're corny, man.
        I ain't playing
        no games with you.

287
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,801
               What's your name,
               son?

288
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,337
Clifton.
And I ain't your son.

289
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,905
                  Fair enough,
                  Clifton.

290
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,108
                Big bad Clifton.

291
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,179
            Well, okay, if you
            ain't got the guts
            to play me, Clifton,

292
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,048
              does anybody else?
              Anyone?

293
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,149
                Yo.

294
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,284
    I'll play this.

295
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,754
        You like cards?

296
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:30,855
            Fine.

297
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:31,589
          We'll play cards.

298
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,299
            Here's the deal.
            If you win...

299
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:45,169
      the whole class gets
      to do whatever they want
      for the rest of detention.

300
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,103
    What?

          [chatter]

302
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:52,476
           But if I win,
           you learn a new game.
You hustling me?

303
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,546
    Hustle?
    You're the one that
    wanted to play cards, homie.
You right.

304
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,381
      Go ahead and play
      this clown, Peanut.

305
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,749
    You'll never get beat.

306
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,556
          You know the game...

307
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,925
          find the red ace?

308
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,660
                Huh?

309
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,997
          My name is Peter Paul.
          I come from Montreal.

310
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,965
          Came to play 'em all.

311
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:19,637
            I've broken hipsters
            and slicksters,
            elbows, and a-holes.

312
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,405
Your name is Peter what?

313
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,174
              Go ahead and pick
              the one you like.

314
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,742
                Nah-ah-ah.

315
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,144
        Bet you're dead, Jack.
Man, I see it.

316
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,612
I see it.

317
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,047
Don't you worry
about me seeing it.

318
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,188
          See, here's
          what happened to you.

319
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,657
        You thought
        you knew the truth,
        but it wasn't there.

320
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,692
            And it never will be
            until you learn
            where to look.

321
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,160
He's messing
with you, Peanut.

322
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,762
Man, I can catch it.

323
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,430
I-I-I was just
screwing around, man.

324
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,565
Let me get one more shot.

325
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,900
              One more shot?
        Yeah.

326
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,071
         My name is Peter Paul.
         I come from Montreal.

327
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,773
         I came to play 'em all.

328
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,344
            Ah-ah-ah.

329
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,946
           Make sure you see it.

330
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:19,597
                This is a king.

331
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,799
              This is your life.

332
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,935
                One mistake
                and it can be
                taken away.

333
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,171
                Wha.

334
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,989
        Look, man.

335
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:48,292
        Yo, this is going
        to be the meeting spot.

336
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,760
        All you got to do
        is go in there,

337
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,961
        grab the stuff,
        and be out.

338
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,565
You get the money yet?

339
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,638
        No, man, I ain't
        seen my uncle
        in two weeks.

340
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,474
What the hell
we going to do, Cliff?
        I don't...

341
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,576
        Look, man,
        if I can't
        get the money...

342
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,814
        Forget it, man.
        We're just
        going to lift it.

343
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,985
        My cousin gave it to me.

346
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,462
You know I don't
roll like that, Cliff.

347
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:25,596
        Well, how do you roll?

348
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,167
        You don't see
        what a good
        opportunity this is?

349
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,902
                    Huh?

350
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,871
        You ain't got no job,
        you ain't got no money,

351
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,106
        you ain't
        got no opportunity,
        your mom's half gone--

352
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:40,344
Shut up about my mom, man.
        Yo, that's the truth,
        T, and you know it.

353
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,112
        Look, man,
        we pull this job off

354
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,882
        and we ain't
        got to worry about
        nothing no more.

355
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,651
        Nothing.

356
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,992
        Now, you think
        about that.

357
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:02,066
    Now, everyone on the board
    is here for one reason
    and one reason only.

358
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,400
    To protect the king.

359
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,568
        That is right.

360
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,303
        To protect the king.

361
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,973
        Now, he is old
        and has survived
        many battles.

362
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,975
        So he can only move
        one spot at a time.

363
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:15,446
So, who's got his back
if he can only move one spot?

364
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,448
            The queen.

365
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,818
        Now, she is smarter,
        faster, and stronger
        than her king.

366
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,525
The knight is the horse.

367
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,794
Now, he can move
two spots forward
and one spot to the side.

368
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,534
The trusty bishop
is his diagonal attack.

369
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,969
            The rook,
            he patrols
            the entire board.

370
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,971
        He can move
        as many spaces
        as he wants,

371
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,774
        as long as it's
        in the same direction
        he was moving.

372
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,445
Oh yes, the pawns.

373
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,314
They are the front line.

374
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,916
They will be casualties.

375
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,520
   <i>(Cliff) </i>

378
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,227
      Let me put it
      to you this way,

00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,363
   a way you'll understand.

380
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,365
    Think about it
    like this.

381
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,833
    Who's your supplier?

382
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,869
              Hey, you tripping.

383
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:14,138
Hey, I know you ain't growing
that weed you're selling

384
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,640
and so does everybody else
in here you're trying
to sell it to.

385
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,375
So, who's your guy?
Huh?

386
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,979
 <i>Your ace in the hole. </i>

387
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,647
Trying to protect your king.
I like that.

388
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,282
Okay.
All right.

389
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:30,454
Well, then let's
call this king, "Perry."

390
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,923
King Perry it is.

391
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,326
Now, King Perry has an army
and you're a part of it.

392
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,161
But the problem is,

393
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,363
you think you're out there
doing the king's business,

394
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,299
all you're really doing
is sacrificing yourself.

395
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,601
Like the pawn you truly are.

396
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,969
        It ain't like that, B.

397
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,371
It's exactly like that, partner.

398
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:50,174
Now, if you want to keep
making the same mistakes
for a king who could

399
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:54,244
care less about your ass,
out there is the board

Checkmate.

532
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,409
            Hey.

533
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,745
        Where did you
        learn how to do that?

534
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,814
Told you, it's just
a simple stupid game, man.

535
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,665
           Got something I want
           to talk to you about,
           all right, man?
What's up?

536
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,067
            Can't tell nobody,
            all right?
I won't.

537
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,068
               I'm serious.

538
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,336
I won't.

539
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,707
           Me and Cliff,
           we got some
           real things going on.

540
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:52,876
               Real easy money.

541
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,247
               And I want you
               in on it with me.

542
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,349
What you want me to do?

543
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:01,218
               Try it.
               Just in case,
               you know?

544
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,888
All I got to do is roll?

545
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,456
               Yeah, man.

546
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
            You trust me?

547
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,763
I trust you.

548
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,232
            I want you
            in on this with me.

549
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,367
                    For real.

550
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,004
All right.
                   My man.

551
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,143
Okay, so, that-that's--
I got it put away this time.

552
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,878
It's a whole body throw.

553
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,714
            Nothing, 'cause you
            about to airball it.

554
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:33,350
                  Oh, I did it.
                  I'm a beast.
Uh-oh.

555
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:35,085
Oh, man.
                I'm a beast.
                I told you.

556
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,386
      You're right on the ball.

557
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,263
          Ms. King, you said
          you wanted to see me?

558
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,399
Oh, yes, I-I-I did.
Come on in. Have a seat.
                        <i>Okay. </i>

559
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,939
This isn't easy for me.

560
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,446
            Who gave you this?
Someone dropped it
in my mailbox
yesterday afternoon.

561
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,715
            Listen,
            I'm not the same man
            I was back then.

562
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,919
You lied to me, Mr. Brown.

563
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,822
I have to let you go.

564
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,164
               You should see
               these kids, man.
               They're learning.

565
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,832
I'm against
the wall here, though,

566
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,834
and I don't have a choice.
I'm sorry.

567
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,246
           Chess is no different
           than life.

568
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:41,251
           These suburban kids,
           they know
           they get good grades,

569
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:43,420
        they go off to college.

570
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:46,056
     They know
     they're going to own
     their own business someday.

571
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:47,791
     They envision the end game.

572
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,726
          But poor kids
          don't think like that.

573
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,295
Mr. Brown, I--
     I wasn't taught like that.

574
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,730
        I didn't--I didn't
        see the end game

575
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,198
        and it cost me, man.
        It cost me big.

576
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,333
I know.

577
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,473
I am still here for you
and the chess program.

578
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,376
Just not in the school.

579
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,746
Not anymore.

580
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,124
                Hey, Mr. Brown.

581
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,293
Get back to class, Peanut.

582
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:24,861
                  You mad at me?

583
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,596
  No.

584
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:29,899
But chess club is cancelled.

585
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,969
            What? Why?

586
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,971
    Politics.

587
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,272
              Politics?

588
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,641
         Man, that's an excuse.

589
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,010
        What about fighting
        our way out of a corner?

590
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,916
              What was
              I thinking, man?

591
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,087
                Chess.

592

00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:03,666
    Sometimes I don't blame them
    for thinking that way.

797
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:05,467
So you're just
going to give up?

798
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,903
           They think I'm nuts,
           okay?

799
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:10,005
           Trini, they think
           I'm looney.

800
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:12,141
           And you know what?
           I'm starting
           to believe them.

801
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,342
            I'm starting
            to believe them.

802
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:14,543
               You ain't nuts.

803
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,715
             Clifton, he's nuts.
             But you...

804
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:23,085
              You're all right.

805
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:37,032
        Where did you get this?

806
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:39,968
Peanut had that in his hand
before the police came.

807

            [sighs]

808
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,122
Let's clean this place up, man.

809
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,491
        Yeah.

810
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,412
This is a key.

811
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:06,148
See that?

812
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,716
This is how it works.

813
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,018
Any questions?

814
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:50,659
    Man, what the hell you doing
    waking me up, man?

815
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,761
              Don't you
              walk away from me.

816
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,096
              I ain't your mama.

817
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:03,605
        Oh, you want to fight.

818
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:04,973
    You want to--

821
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,332
                    Hey.

822
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,336
What's wrong?

823
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,740
        Tahime, talk to me.

824
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,911
             I'm going to kill
             my mom's boyfriend.

825
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,479
        What?

826
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,747
                I'm going
                to get a gun

827
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,082
                and I'm going
                to shoot him.

828
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:52,754
             I don't care
             what happens to me.
             I don't care.

829
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,556
        But he ain't going
        to touch nobody no more,

830
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,224
              not me, not her,
              not nobody.

831
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,994
         I swear on God he ain't
         going to touch nobody.

832
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:02,431
What do you think
that's going to prove?

833
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:05,500
I was locked up
for 17 years...

834
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:06,635
in prison.

835
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:09,237
I just got out.

836
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,174
I spent almost
two decades in the joint.

837
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:23,151
I blamed everything
on everybody else but me.

838
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:26,588
I was just touching the pieces,

839
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,625
moving them whenever I could

840
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:32,094
without thought.

841
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:35,263
That's why none of y'all
can get nothing over on me.

842
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:38,934
Because I've done
all the dumb stuff that
y'all have done twice.

843
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,270
Some of it three times.

844
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:43,171
    What did you do?

845
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,308
Whatever I wanted to do.

846
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,446
        <i>I stole. </i>

847
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:52,681
        I even ran a crew.

848
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,419
              And they gave you
              17 years for that?

849
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:58,987
        No.

850
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:03,291
I got my 17 years
for armed robbery.

851
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,292
I robbed a bank.

852
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,366
Cops came
and we all scattered.

853
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,073
And I took the fall.

854
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,878
And then I learned.

855
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,012
What did you learn?

856
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,380
           I learned the board.

857
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:30,852
Your move.

858
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:32,821
Good.

859
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:34,823
                    Checkmate.

860
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:36,191
Even better.

861
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,506
Thank you.
              This chess house,
              it's...

862
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:52,708
              it's amazing.

863
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:59,448
        You know, eight years
        I've been at Maud Alton
        and...

864
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,585
      I've just been trying
      to make do with what
      little money they give us.

865
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:05,587
               We're all doing
               the best we can,

866
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:11,993
             most of us
             high ups, teachers,
             parents, kids.

867
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:17,132
         In all my years I have
         seen very few people
         make a real difference.

868
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,237
                These kids...

869
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:24,439
                they need you.

870
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,611
         And your life before...

871
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:32,848
                and who you have
                become now...

872
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,050
                you inspire me,
                Mr. Brown.

873
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:39,454
                You really do.

874
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,333
It's really coming together.

875
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:54,603
This Tahime Sanders
is a beast.
            I talked
            to Marco last week.

876
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:55,871
Really?

877
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:58,073
         He's coming home early.

878
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,074
Wow.

879
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:00,442
Wow, that's good news.

880
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,212
Can I drive you
to pick him up?

881
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,351
         I don't know.
Oh, no, no.

882
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:11,853
Trini, you got to--
you got to do this for me.

883
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:13,455
It would mean a lot to me.

884
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:15,757
I got to be there for him
when he gets out.

885
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:17,559
Show him how much I changed.

886
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:18,493
Please.

887
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,063
                Sunday.

888
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,834
That's what I'm talking about.

889
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,090
              That's nice.

890
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,162
        He in a better place
        now, anyways.

891
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,197
        Yeah.

892
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:56,998
    You all right?

893
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:03,205
You know you got a ticket
out of this place, Tahime.

894
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:06,274
You could be
a special player,
a real pro.

895
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,243
Just need the discipline.

896
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,112
        Check this out.

897
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,116
This could be you.

898
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,522
Maurice Ashley did it.
Who's to say
you couldn't be next?

899
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:21,556
                Maurice who?

900
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:22,891
Ah.

901
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:26,228
Maurice Ashley from Harlem

902
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,897
was the first
African-American grandmaster.

903
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:32,734
   So, what?
   You're telling me
   your brother's a grandmaster?

904
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:35,036
Who's to say
there could only be one?

905
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,839
         Why ain't you one?

906
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:40,041
If I had
your natural talent,
I would be.

907
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,547
                  Come on, man.

908
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,349
             I ain't about to be
             embarrassing myself

909
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:49,150
                 in some
                 white man's
                 competition.

910
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:51,253
You going to think that way
your entire life?

911
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:53,588
Every time you get
an opportunity,

912
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,825
you're going to run away
just because you're scared?

913
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:58,093
        I ain't scared.

914
01:04:58,095 --> 01:05:01,696
T, you have a real talent.

915
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:04,833
And that'll take you further
than any money, race, class

916
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:06,902
any day of the week.

917
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:08,570
You could play
with these kids, man.

918
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,408
                And if I can't?

919
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,944
It ain't about whether
you can or you can't,

920
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:19,381
it's about whether
you will or you won't.

921
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:20,415
Believe that.

923
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,700
Where the hell you been,
Tahime?

924
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:40,702
                I was out...

925
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:41,336
                with Mr. Brown.

926
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,110
    I want you to do
    something for me, okay?

927
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,615
I want you to sign
this consent form

928
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,284
so I can play
in a chess tournament.
  Chess tournament?

929
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,787
What the hell
you talking about?

930
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:02,057
 I told you, I've been
 getting real good at chess.
Give me a damn break, Tahime.

931
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:04,359
You out there playing
some dumb ass game

932
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,828
while the rest of us
sitting in here
trying to survive.

933
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,196
    It ain't a dumb game.

934
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:10,465
Is it a job?
You getting paid?

935
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,200
Because if you
ain't getting paid,

936
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,635
I don't want to hear
nothing about it.

937
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:19,240
Silly.

938
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,213
        If I'm good--
Boy, you ain't good
at nothing but being
a pain in my ass.

939
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,682
Get-get out my face.
Go on.

940
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:30,051

Get out of my face.

you can afford to be
in somebody chess contest?

 <i>Oh, hell no, he ain't. </i>

944

in no chess contest, either.

              What are all
              the computers for?
That's how
we play chess here.

954
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:24,973
It's the way of the future.

            Yes, sir.

960
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:36,851
           A modern way
           of playing.

961
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:39,821
      Man, that's bull.
      I want to play
      street style.

962
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:42,824

      on a computer and behave,

963
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:45,293

         You need to register.

968
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:53,601
        Right. Right.

969

    Here's the thing--

974
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,598
          Actually,
          I left it in the car,

       you think I could
       have enough time to go--
If you're quick.

976
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:28,770
              Thank you so much.

977
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,474
All right, sir.
You're all set.

to come by and tell you
I heard about

983
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:28,696
what you're doing
over there at that house.
It's good stuff.

984
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,798
I got an assistant
who lives over that way.
                Oh, yeah?

01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,134
Yeah.

01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,249
I haven't had jitters
like this in years.

993

        Come on, man,
        that's the fun part.

998
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:21,336
    We have a problem.

999
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:24,005
        After reviewing some
        of your students' forms,

1000
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:26,941
        it's fairly obvious that
        one of them was forged.

1001
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:29,777
Now, Linda over at registration
alerted me to the fact that

1002
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,913
    initially you didn't have
    some of these forms signed,

1003
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:34,849
      so I took a look at them,
      and if you look,

1004
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,585
        this one clearly
        was not signed
        by an adult.

1005
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:40,321
            Now, you forged
            a consent form,

1006
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:44,826
            and failed to submit
            any of the students'
            birth certificates.

1007
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:48,062
Can I talk to you for--
            I'm comfortable
            talking right here.

1008
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,965
Some of these kids
don't have birth certificates.

1009
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,667
            Everybody's got
            a birth certificate.

1010
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:55,069
Not where we come from.

Eugene, that was
an absolute travesty.

1018

1019

1020
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:17,892
          Well, there's nothing
          we can do about it
          right now.
That's not necessarily true.

come on the air

1027

        of a chess championship

1028
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:41,949
        this past weekend
        at a local tournament.

1029
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:45,987
        Now, tell us,
        Tahime, what happened?

1030
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:49,323
        Shed some light
        on this most egregious
        theft of a championship.

1031
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:52,326
It wasn't theft.

        Come again?

1033

It was not theft.

1034
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:59,200

We didn't do that.

Mr. B, we won.

1041
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:14,081
We can't change
the rules, Tahime.

1042

No, sir.
No, it's not.

learning about life.

01:26:21,944 --> 01:26:25,012
And because
of what you look like,
all eyes will be on you.

1199
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:27,748
So you got to think tough.

1200
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:28,415
Huh?

1201
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:32,252
Now, this kid...

1202
01:26:32,254 --> 01:26:35,556
J. Thomas Gaines...

1203
01:26:35,558 --> 01:26:38,592
I wish I had a shot at him.

1204
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:41,728
I got me a list
of his last 300 matches.

1205
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:44,164
Got it sent to me
by a chess magazine,

1206
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:46,300
felt bad that
I was all locked up.

1207
01:26:46,302 --> 01:26:47,734
Free subscription for life.

1208
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:55,175
If you face off
with this Gaines,

1209
01:26:55,177 --> 01:26:57,811
he's got one particular move

1210
01:26:57,813 --> 01:27:01,048
that leaves him vulnerable,
almost without fail.

1211
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:02,849
Amazing how nobody
found it before.

1212
01:27:02,851 --> 01:27:05,919
But then again,
nobody's got as much time

1213
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:08,121
on their hands as I do.

1214
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:10,691
So, listen carefully.

1215
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:13,927
You know he will relentlessly
pound you with his queen.

1216
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:16,763
                    I know.

1217
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:21,201
Know what?

1218
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:23,070
            Look, I appreciate
            all this.

1219
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:27,341
                   I really do.
                   I just...

1220
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:28,909
           This is something
           I have to by myself.

1221
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:41,688
Respect.

1222
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,659
Anything else, then?

1223
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:49,396
            You ever getting
            out of here?

1224
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:58,772
Only my mind gets out...

1225
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,540
every time
I open up that board...

1226
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:05,412
every time I open up a bible.

1227
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,653
And it will be out
when you are playing
in that tournament.

1228
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,342
Tahime Sanders checking in.

1229
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,644
                Okay.

1230
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,179
                Put him
                in this section.

1231
01:28:39,181 --> 01:28:40,013
Yup.

1232
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:42,983
            Good luck, son.

1233
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:52,926
                   You recognize
                   that face?

1234
01:28:52,928 --> 01:28:55,228
    J. Thomas Gaines, huh?

1235
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,363
                       The one
                       and only.

1236
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,894
            Hey, Tahime.

1237
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:33,033
Concentrate here.

1238
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,368
Women weaken legs.

1239
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,204
                It's chess.

1240
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:39,906
                What do I need
                my legs for?

1241
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:41,375
Concentrate here.

1242
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,387
   <i>(Announcer) </i>
   <i>Good afternoon, everyone. </i>

1243
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:57,157

    <i>Now, start your clocks. </i>

1247
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:20,046
    Yes.

1248
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:25,952
You know you could've had him
on the tenth move, right?

1249
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:27,521
            Relax, chess man.

1250
01:30:27,523 --> 01:30:29,122
            I'm just
            getting warmed up.

1251
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:41,735
                This guy
                is good.

1252
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:43,336
        Mm.

1253
01:30:43,338 --> 01:30:46,039
                  Can Tahime
                  beat this guy?

1254
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:48,742
    Well, he's been
    one of the best players

1255
01:30:48,744 --> 01:30:52,212
    in the country
    since he was 15.

1256
01:30:52,214 --> 01:30:53,980
    Anybody can be beat.

1257
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:57,150
    Even Gaines.

            Mr. Brown? My name
            is Danielle Norton
            with Urban League.
   Yes, ma'am.

1271
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:59,953
            This Tahime,
            has he made any
            college plans yet?

1272
01:35:59,955 --> 01:36:01,755
            Because I'd like
            to help.

1273
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:04,891
I'll be in touch.

      I've been scared all year.

1275
01:36:13,201 --> 01:36:15,835
You ain't got to try
and make me feel better.
You know that, right?

1276
01:36:15,837 --> 01:36:18,371
            Trust me.
            I wouldn't do that.

1277
01:36:18,373 --> 01:36:19,439
            Ever.

1278
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:23,176
Hey, can I grab you
for a quick photo over here?

1279
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,146
Mr. Brown.
