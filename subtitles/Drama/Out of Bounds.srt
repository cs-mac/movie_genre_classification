 -Woohoo! Yeah!
 -Daryl has to work! (LAUGHTER)

4
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,420
   Let me tell you something.
   This damn farm's done pretty
   well by you and that boy.

5
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,430
     -I want to sell the place.
     -Well just who in the hell
         is going to buy it?

6
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,900
  I don't care.
  You don't want Daryl to go to
  Los Angeles, do you?

7
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,900
        Hell no, I need him to
        work the farm!

8
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,570
 You didn't want Tommy to leave
 either. You wanted him to
 waste his life here

9
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,800
       just like we did.

10
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,510
   This farm has fed and raised
   them two boys and Tommy up
   and left

11
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,640
   and you want Daryl to do the
   same thing.

12
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,780
  I want Daryl to have
  a better life than we did.

13
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,620
 -I don't want him to go.
 -I don't care what you want.
 I care about the boy's future.

14

   goes two ways.

18

  and so are you.

 much choice.

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,420
     Hey, I'm really lost here,
     man. Do you think I should
          go to the police?

132
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:09,360
  Are you out of
  your fucking skull?
  They almost blew you away.

133
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,060
   -They think you did it.
   -I didn't do it. I didn't do
   anything, man.

134
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,730
            -Don't you know
            anybody else in LA?
            -No.

135
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:25,570
  I don't know anybody.
  That's what's crazy.
  I've never even been here.

136
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,640
       -I can't believe this.
       -Wait a minute.
       I do know a girl.

137
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:37,480
 I met a girl on the airplane
 coming here.
 Her name is Dizz or something.

138
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,120
  Anyway, she said she works at
  a place called the Beanery.
  Do you know where that is?

139
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,420
   Yeah, I know where it is.

140
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,530
  Hey, kid!
  Don't be messing with that!

141
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:14,050
 The suspect, a white male 18
 to 20, was seen fleeing the
 premises carrying a red bag.

142
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,880
 Police refuse to speculate on
 any motive other than robbery.

143
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,520
  A neighbor who was wounded
  was temporarily hospitalized,
  but has been released.

144
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,460
      Reporting from the
       Hollywood Hills,
      this is Bill Press.

145
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,630
  Back to you in the studio.

146
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,500
    So, here we go.
    Rock'n'roll chili and
    an Elvis Presley shake.

147
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,740
      -It's about time.
      -And a Chuck Berry burger
      with fries.

148
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,810
       -I had the Buddy Holly
       burger with onion rings.
       -You did?

149
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,780
        Trust me, baby, I know
        what I ordered.

150
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,550
          I must've written it
          down wrong.

151
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,720
      I would get a jet pilot
      when I'm in a rush.

152
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,920
      Oh, cut me a break, okay?
      I'm an actress, I'm not
      a waitress.

153
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,190
    Oh. Well, try acting like a
    waitress and bringing
    me my order.

154
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,160
       Mmm. Right away.

155
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,640
            -So busy...
            -Dizz.

156
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,310
   Hi! You sure got bored fast.
   Toast, I need it toasted.
   -Listen, listen.

157
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,210
      -What?
      -I need your help.

158
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,580
   Right now? Not right now.

159
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,950
       -Dizz, I'm in a lot
       of very serious trouble.
       -Well so am I.

160
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,990
      These orders are piled up
      and I don't know
      where they go.

161
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,930
  Hey, hey, listen to me.
  I'm seriously in a situation,
  and it's life-or-death.

162
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,130
     I'm not playing any games.
     I need your help.

163
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,000
     And I need for us to leave
     here now.

164
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,610
          -You need me?
          -Yes I do.

165
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,950
     -Let's go.
     Would you take my station?
     -Yeah, okay.

166
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,190
 Hey, brain trust!
 Where's my Buddy Holly burger?

167
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,650
         Buddy ate it.

168
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,370
             Whoa.

169
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,640
 Oh boy, you are in deep shit.

170
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,380
  -Listen to me.
  They think I did this murder.
  -What do you want with me?

171
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,250
  You're the only person I know
  in Los Angeles, Dizz. Look,
  I wouldn't have come to you

172
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,290
    if I didn't need your help.
    My brother's dead.

173
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,680
  -Think we ought to
  make a move?
  -No, not until we're sure.

          (KNOCKING)

175
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,800
 Hi, baby.
 Didn't hear me knocking, huh?

176
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
        Aren't you going to
        open the door?

177
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,800
       I've got some magic dust
       for you.

178
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,980
      Playful, isn't he?

179
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,150
    The little guy bit me.

180
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,860
  It's okay, fella.
  I'm not going to hurt you.

181
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,370
        There's a kid out there
        on the street

182
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,280
      with 10 keys of heroin
      that belong to me.

183
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,750
  You talk to your friends, and
  find out if anyone's seen or
      heard from this guy.

184
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,790
        You can do that for me,
        can't you?

185
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,890
          Good girl.

186
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,770
      Cute little fella.

 you saw my picture on TV?
 What's that supposed to mean?

206
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,350
 Well if that's not how it
 happened and you're so
 innocent, then why don't you

207
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,090
      just go to the police
      and leave me alone?

   I already tried that once

230
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,400
   the wrong bag off the thing.
   We got back to his house and
          when I woke up

231
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,200
   there were drugs in the bag,

  freeze, you pulled a gun.

 pulled it out, I was trying to
 give it to them.

  is just happening too fast.

 to be with him.
 Then he got taken away.

  to help you find who killed
  Tommy. We can do it.

 All we've got to do is get the
 word out on the street that
 we've got their smack

250
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,610
       and they're going
       to be finding us.

251
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,910
         How do you get that
         word around?

252

 got to connect with them.

 that I know. But Daryl, if
 we're going to pull this off

254
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,660
  you're going to have to
  change a little bit.

00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,930
   you're going to have to play
   the game by their rules.
   Can you handle that?

256
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,800
  I want to find them,
  wherever they are,
  and wherever they're going.

257
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,560
   Well, we can lose the scarf.
   That's, that's good.

258
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,260
   That's better. <i> Tres chic.</i>

259
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,470
    It's classic. Let's go.

260
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,650
        Hey! Come here.

261
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,590
     -Do you know why there's a
     crosswalk on that corner?
     -Yes, officer.

262
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,490
  -We were just in a hurry.
  -Haven't I seen you before?

263
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:18,230
     -No.
     -Take the shades off.

264
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,240
 -What?
 -I said, take the shades off.

265
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,460
        -Don't let me catch you
        jaywalking again.
        -Yes, sir.

266
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,270
       So far, so good.

267
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,440
     So, if you hear of anybody
     looking to score big,
     here's my number.

268
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,310
  -Yeah, rad.
  -Take care, now. If you hear
  anything, shoot us a call.

269
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,440
          You got it.

270
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,910
   -"Shoot us a call"?
   -Yeah, I heard it on TV.

271
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,420
   Look, if we're ever going to
   pull this thing off

272
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,950
    you'd better just let me do
    all the talking.

273
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,610
     Hey blondie, why don't you
     come with me, huh?

274
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,690
      I couldn't find Marshall.
      Come on.

292
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,080
 Dizz, what's happening?
 You're looking so sleek this
 evening, girl! How you been?

293
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:06,680
   Whoa, check it out,
   baby, what's happening?
   Stone fox, what do you...

294
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,990
  -I hear you know some people.
  -Now who the fuck are you,
  man?

295
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,690
 Hey, I got 10 keys of smack.
 It doesn't matter who the fuck
 I am. Who the fuck are you?

296
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,630
  I know just the dude that you
  need to be speaking with,
  my man. Now, I want you

297
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,810
     to check me out at the
     Stardust Club. You make it
     after midnight, okay?

298
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,910
       And I'm going to
       take care of you, okay?
       Now you be cool.

299
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,950
      -There you go. Take care.
      Be cool.
      -Later.

300
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,620
    Later, baby, you take care.
    Yeah.

301
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,230
    You find anything new?

302
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,970
   We've been through the house
   a second time. The foreign
   prints we found on the

303
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:03,780
     neighbor's shirt match the
     prints we found on
     the dead woman

304
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,180
    and the ones in the hallway
    and in the bedroom.

305
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:12,620
    -And there's still only one
    set of foreign prints.
    -Mm hmm.

306
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,960
  Then the kid is the only one
  we can place in this house.

307
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,360
 -Did you locate a Harlan Cage?
 -I talked to a sheriff
 in De Witt.

308
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,230
   There's a Cage family there,
   but he can't locate them.

309
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,340
  Maybe the kid's telling
  the truth. Maybe his brother
  did pick up the wrong bag.

310
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:41,710
  Maybe. Maybe he picked up the
  right bag, and the kid killed
   his brother in cold blood.

   buy me a mouse, because he
   broke my mouse's neck?

320
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,700
          That's him!

321

  night, dude.

         Where is he?

      Whoa! What's that?

328
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,950
         Hey! Gaddis!

329
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,490
 (LAUGHING) That was intense!

330
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,160
  What are you, mental? Huh?

331
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,200
 -What do you think this is, a
 fucking video?
 -No, now we know who they are!

332
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
       No, Dizz, now they
       know you we are.

333
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,000
  So what are we going to do?

334
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,240
  Hey look, I really appreciate
  your help and all, okay?

335
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,270
  Hooking me up with all
  these people. I couldn't
  have done this without you.

336
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,340
  But it's just too sick and it
  is too serious, and I have
  to do this alone.

337
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,580
      What, you're just going
      to blow me off now?

338
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,990
   I mean, I've only driven you
   all over Los Angeles.

339
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,190
 I even lost my job because of
 you. And now you're just going
 to blow me off.

340
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,490
  Oh, that's great. Figures.

341
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,960
   My brother's gone, okay?

342
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,830
      And I'm here alone.

343
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,270
 And if we make another mistake
 they're going to nail me.

344
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,440
     And you know what else?
     They're going to nail you.
     That's serious.

345
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,980
  Well, then we gotta make real
  sure that we don't make
  any mistakes.

    We're all friends here.

356

     Yeah. Get in the car.

357

            Listen.

358

   If it's about that kid...

00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,390
          I want him.

      I don't know where he is.

 Don't ever get on my bad side.

  This is definitely heroin!

368

           I think.

     How much is it worth?

370
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,740
    Ten of these? I don't know,
    a million! Maybe more.

     Okay, so what are we going
     to do now?

372

 We gotta get to a wide open
 space. You know, somewhere not
 near here at all.

00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:40,320
 We gotta get away from here.

374
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,660
   Oh, I got it. I know exactly
   where we can go.
   We can go to San Pedro.

375
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,400
        The docks down there?
        It'll be ideal.

             Yeah.

379

       This is Marshall.

380
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,790
         Yeah, we got a message
         to call you.

       Listen to me,
       you little prick.

     Nobody fucks me over.

383
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,130
 I want my shit back tonight.

384
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,530
   Well look, I don't want any
   more trouble with you or the
   cops anyway, okay?

385
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,500
        If you can just give me
        a couple grand

386
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,500
       so I can get the
       hell out of here

387
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,870
         I'll be fine.

          Sure, kid.

389
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,210
           No sweat.

390
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,820
    See how easy I can be?

391
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,270
       Lead rain, Lemar.

392
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,200
   Lead motherfucking rain.

393
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,940
     Okay, it's San Pedro.

394
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,840

396
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,280
       Pier E, I got it.

397
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,250
          What took you so long
          to tip us?

398
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,620
     I did that so you wouldn't
     scare him off.

399
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,350
 If what you're saying is true

400
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,830
   you're way out of bounds.

401
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:27,630
   One careless move and he'll
   blow your ass to pieces.

402
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,500

       gets in his way.

404
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,790
        Go home, okay?

405
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,360
       I don't want to go home
       and just leave you
       here by yourself.

406
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,330
      Look, I don't want to see
      you get hurt.

407
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,440
      Get the hell out of here.
      Go on.

408
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,570
  Get the windshield for you?

409
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,280
  You'd better just be reaching
  for your dick, Lemar.

       There's the kid!

 -Doesn't fucking matter
 whether I believe you or not.

 Two of my men are dead!
 That makes you an accessory to
 murder one.

  You better start playing ball
  with me, boy.

 Or else I'm going to nail
 your fucking ass to the wall.

      Hey man, I'm telling you
      everything I know.

429
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,820
     Bullshit! You've been
     short-stroking me from the
     very beginning.

430

  Now I want to know, who are
  those two other guys, huh?

431
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:59,620
     The one we found toasted
     in the car and the one who
     cut down my men.

432

 Look, those are the dudes who
 killed my brother. I never saw
 them before last night, man.

433
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,830
     What about the girl?

434
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,700
 She has nothing to do with it.
 She's only helped me while
 I've been here.

    You listen to me good.

       of foreign prints at the

 then there's no evidence that

    back home I must seem
    really strange.

497
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,750
   I hadn't known that many.

     girlfriend back home.

  girl I actually have been
  kind of seeing.

500

 She's kind of an actress type.

      She's kind of wild.

  really gotta tell you.

01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,900
        I haven't been straight
        with you.

504
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:34,080
  I'm not really an actress.

505
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,980
           I'm not.

506
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,380
    I mean, I didn't get any of
    those parts that I went
    out for.

507
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,950
 I didn't get that part in
 <i> Massacre in Blood City</i>
 or anything. I made it all up.

508
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:50,760

 I got lots of friends here and
 I know a lot of people

    but they don't know me.

510
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:58,000
    I mean, my name is not even
    Dizz. It's not, really,
    it's Darlene.

511
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,470
  I really couldn't give a shit
  about those things.

512
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,040
      Any of that stuff.

513

01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:47,480
       Out with the gun.

517
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,950
            Slowly.

518
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:55,220
           Drop it.

519
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,750
      Kick it over here.

520

 You want me to blow her away?

           -It's in the bag.
           -Get it.

523
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:30,720
            Get it!

524
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:33,920
      Toss it over here.

525
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,630
        Nice and easy.

526
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,630
          Pick it up.

01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,640
        Get over there.

528
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:49,710
 Move, you little motherfucker.

529
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,880
         Turn around.

530
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,730
           Bye, kid.

531
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,970
          Easy, kid.

532
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,700
           No, wait.

533
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,870
   Ed Hurley, Drug Enforcement,
   Daryl!

534
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,440
  Don't hurt him, he's a cop!

535
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,740
     My partner and I have been
     dogging Gaddis since
     New Orleans.

536
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:42,110
        Fuck you, okay?

537
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:44,210
  Because you've been using
  me as bait the whole time.

538
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,350
   Kid, I didn't even know you
   existed until yesterday.

539
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,980
     I still don't know who the
     fuck you are!

540
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,890
        I think you're talking
        a lot of shit!

541
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,760
 He's getting away. If you're
 going to shoot me, go ahead.

542
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,140
         -Get Delgado!
         -Be careful!

543
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:19,780
    -Yeah.
    -We're going to Mexico.

544
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:27,220
     (POLICE RADIO NOISE)

545
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,230
    Stop the car, stop the car!
    You've got to help me!
    You've got to help us!

546
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:42,770
   Just called Drug Enforcement
   New Orleans.
   About Morano's death?

547
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:46,910
   Turns out he and Hurley have
   been on suspension for the
   past two months.

548
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:48,380
        Boys down there think
        they're dirty.

549
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,120
      That means that kid's out
      there all alone.

550
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:02,530
    They're coming for me.

551
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,510
         Where is he?

552
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:36,960
  Resnick just brought a second
  set of prints from Tommy
  Cage's house.

553
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,990
         I put them through
         the computer.

554
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,600
      They belong to him.

555
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,570
             Good.

556
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,270
          Lieutenant!

557
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:50,310
  Hurley and the kid were seen
  headed West towards Venice.

558
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:53,110
 They got the girl downstairs.
 They're bringing her up now.

559
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:09,990
      You recognize him?

560
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,860
       Yeah, that's him!

561
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,200
 Okay, you come with me!
 In the car, come on! Let's go.
 Let's go!

562
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,490
     Get out of here! Go!

563
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,970
             Shit!

564
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,090
      Give it up, Gaddis!

565
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,560
     You have any idea what
     this stuff is worth?

566
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,640
       Sorry it's gotta
       be this way, kid.

567
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,080
         I was really beginning
         to like you.

568
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,180
      It's just business.

569
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,530
        Go for it, kid.

570
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,200
    Maybe you'll be quicker
    than your brother was.

571
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:51,270
           A knife?

572
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,380
   Life's a bitch, ain't it?

573
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,750
        There's two dead
        bodies inside.

574
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,760
     That's what we were all
     running around about.

575
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:18,660
        Now you got it.

576
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,380
 Are you going to be all right?

577
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,850
     Yeah. What about you?

578
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,420
             Okay.

579
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,330
     Guess you're going to
     go back to Iowa now?

580
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:59,800
   Well actually, I was kind of
   hoping I could stay here
   with you for a while.

581
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,440
   I would really like that.
