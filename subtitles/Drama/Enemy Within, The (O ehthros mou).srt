< Nirvana Sutra > Verse 19

2
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,453
The worst of the Eight Hells
is called Continuous Hell

3
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,611
lt has the meaning of Continuous
Suffering. Thus the name

4
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,074
5 years ago

5
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:31,948
we started valet parking in Tuen Mun

6
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:37,210
We were full of ambition

7
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:40,139
But 2 weeks had hardly gone by

8
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:44,511
and the cops started busting us every day

9
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,876
Within one year

10
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,607
6 of our brothers died

11
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,602
Thanks to the Buddha, my life was spared

12
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:15,604
What thousands must die
so that Caesar may become great

13
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:18,271
But l don't believe in destiny

14
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:25,873
The rule of this game
is to take fate in our own hands

15
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,172
You are the newest in my gang

16
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,001
Your records are the cleanest

17
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,809
You can choose your own future

18
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,568
OK

19
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,364
l wish you guys

20
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,634
every success in the police force

21
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:58,039
Bottoms up, officers

22
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:19,238
27 1 49, you were here 1 0 minutes ago

23
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,701
How many files were on my desk?

24
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:24,198
Six, sir. Four beige ones on the left

25
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,463
one red and one white on the right

26
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,862
What do you think of me?

27
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,398
Sorry, l'm not sure, sir

28
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,261
But l know you're in a hurry today

29
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,868
'coz your socks don't match

30
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,830
27 1 49, you can go now

31
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,033
Yes, sir

32
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:59,799
You owe me $500

33
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,095
OK, but wait till pay day next month

34
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,570
l told you he would make the best
undercover cop

35
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,729
Now that you're in the cadet school
you should follow the rules

36
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,162
Those who break the rules will be
like him

37
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,425
They will be expelled

38
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,859
Who wants to trade place with him?

39
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,899
l do

40
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:40,662
27 1 49
this is a long-term undercover mission

41
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,898
Your records in the cadet school
will be erased

42
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:45,858
Only Superintendent Wong and
l know of your identity

43
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:49,758
This mission is highly dangerous
is that clear?

44
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:50,961
Yes, sir

45
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,821
Sir, l can't stand it any longer

46
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:58,527
l'm either harassed by cops
or beaten up by gangsters

47
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:02,062
4927, you are still a rookie

48
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,820
Give me a good reason
why l should promote you

49
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:09,187
Hang on?
Why don't you go hang yourself instead?

50
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,457
l won the Silver Whistle Award
at the cadet

51
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,287
and have received numerous kudos as
an officer

52
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,819
l am confident l can lead the police force
sir

53
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:23,726
Boss

54
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,327
OK, l got it

55
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:35,888
Move forward

56
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:37,254
Hurry up

57
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:43,722
Please go over there to take your mugshot

58
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:25,046
Excuse me

59
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,616
Can l try this stereo?

60
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:30,521
What speakers are you using?

61
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:33,119
Nothing special, any recommendations?

62
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:38,645
Try this tube amplifier
made in Hong Kong, 1 0,000 only

63
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,145
And use this cable, also locally made
about 1 000

64
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:44,717
The sound is as good as expensive
European amps

65
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:48,950
Sweet high notes, crisp middle
strong bass

66
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,254
ln a word, transparent

67
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,317
Come and listen

68
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:03,746
Human voices are drifting towards you

69
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,416
See that?

70
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,481
Voices are indeed drifting towards you

71
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:25,980
Try this one

72
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,648
This is ideal for listening to oldies

73
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,741
What do you think?

74
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,276
Much better indeed

75
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:43,811
Any discount if l buy the whole set?

76
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:45,743
Buy the tube amp here

77
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:47,608
but not the speakers

78
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:49,876
Go to Cheung Wai; it's cheaper there

79
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,105
Whom should l ask for?

80
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:54,473
Just tell them Yan sent you

81
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:03,075
Which one is mine?

82
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,041
The one in the middle

83
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:05,713
Okay, thanks

84
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:06,978
You're welcome

85
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:09,403
ls Cheung Wai open yet?

86
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,601
Sure

87
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:12,444
You bastard

88
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,804
l told you to watch the store
not to send my customers away

89
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,946
But your speakers are over-priced

90
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:21,079
lf l don't sell them at this price
how can l afford to pay ''protection money''?

91
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,038
You can try not paying for a change

92
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:24,975
Hey, the cable

93
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:25,973
l'll return it in a few days

94
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:28,337
$4,000 for a few days?

95
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:29,338
Where are you rushing to?

96
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:30,541
A funeral

97
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:00,974
Tell me

98
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,433
How many times have you been busted
for assault?

99
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:05,601
l am trying to convince
the Department of Justice

100
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:08,031
that you need to see a shrink

101
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,534
But you keep on beating people up

102
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,402
Are you really going nuts?

103
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,602
Have you forgotten you're a cop?

104
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:23,297
You told me it's only for 3 years

105
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:25,233
But after 3 years come another 3 years
and another

106
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,767
lt's almost 1 0 years already, boss

107
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,335
Can't you be a bit more courteous to me?

108
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:36,168
l'm the only one in Hong Kong
who knows your real identity now

109
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:40,031
Maybe l'll just erase your file
so you can stick with the Triads for good

110
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:43,763
What do you want me to do?

111
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,302
Remind myself l'm a cop every day?

112
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:51,871
Shouting ''Drop your gun, l'm a cop''
even in my dreams?

113
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,867
When will Sam place his order?

114
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,070
No idea

115
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:08,827
Sometime this week

116
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:09,727
What?

117
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,128
Sometime this week

118
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:15,263
The Thais are here

119
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,466
Once the goods arrive
Sam will resell them

120
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,432
Where is the warehouse?

121
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,567
How the hell do l know?

122
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:25,426
l started working for him only 3 years ago

123
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,858
OK, l'll let you retire after this

124
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:34,296
Bullshit
l heard this a zillion times already

125
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,029
Shit. These mikes again?

126
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:54,289
The Police is loaded with cash
Tell them to get more advanced models

127
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,893
How about implanting it into your body?

128
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:59,091
lnto which part of my body?

129
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:11,126
A pinhole camera?

130
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,953
Where's the lens?

131
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,224
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

132
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:22,762
l never wear watches

133
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,487
lf we got nothing for the lnterpol by 5pm

134
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,819
the counterfeit passport case is off

135
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:04,287
3:1 5. Tea time

136
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:06,889
What would you like, boss?

137
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:08,449
Tea with milk, please

138
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,924
They won't talk without their attorney

139
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,159
Has paged their lawyers
but he hasn't called back yet

140
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,922
l won't talk without my attorney

141
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,015
l am Mr. Lau, your attorney

142
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,187
Did you call home?

143
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:00,643
Why should l call home?

144
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,613
lt's good then

145
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:08,047
Where were you last friday
from 3:45 to 5:00 pm?

146
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,051
Brother Mo told me to ask you
if your family needs any help

147
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:16,175
No need to look around

148
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,942
They won't record anything
when a lawyer is present

149
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,243
lt's not admissible in court anyway

150
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,448
Brother Mo sent you?

151
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,544
Those 2 kids next door

152
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,883
have squealed on the workshop already

153
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,546
Cops are heading there now

154
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,109
Brother Mo told you not to say anything

155
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:52,450
lf your brother is there
tell him to leave right away

156
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:54,603
Here

157
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,039
What?

158
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,641
Scram

159
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:15,047
l ask you to scram, do you hear?

160
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:16,837
Scram right away

161
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,537
All right. l'll leave you

162
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,909
lf you don't trust me, so be it

163
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,101
Take care

164
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:36,572
Remember
don't talk without your attorney

165
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,139

Thanks

180
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,598
You're great

181
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,340
How did you know it's Mo's hideout?

182
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:24,440
Thanks

183
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:29,599
Hello, yes

184
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:33,470
No problem. OK

185
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,435
Sorry guys, over time tonight

186
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:48,369
Our target tonight is a drug trafficking
cartel

187
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:53,969
ln an hour's time
they will be trading with a Thai seller

188
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,895
Cash will be handed over in the building
across the street

189
00:17:57,604 --> 00:17:59,434
in a unit on the 3rd floor

190
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,696
Where the goods will be delivered is
still unknown

191
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:10,304
ClB shall tag the target
and tap the phone lines

192
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:16,370
Our unit will not take action till
our mole has pinned down the delivery location

193
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,299
Let's take a look at our principal stars

194
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,960
Here are our principal stars tonight:

195

Hon Sam, Chen Wing-yan, Del Piero

196
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,660
We've been watching them for a long time

197
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,161
We'd better nail them tonight

198
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,725
OK? No more questions?

199
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:37,662
Let's get to work

200
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,163
Sorry for paging you so urgently

201
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:58,855
But our mission is kept confidential till
the last moment

202
00:18:59,099 --> 00:18:59,723
No problem

203
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,625
Do you have confidence?

204
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:02,157
Yes, it should be OK

205
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:03,092
Hello, Dad

206
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:04,465
Pass the phone to Dad

Too bad
Dinner has been prepared already

209
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,460
Call me when you're back
l'll heat it up for you

210
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:18,658
You look so relaxed

211
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,728
lt's only work
We can always work on it next time

212
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,261
Sorry

213
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:52,094
All cell phone signals in this area

214
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,127

215
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,058

216
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,688
Channel 454870

217
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:01,916
Channel 454870

218
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,416
Attention. Our prey is in sight

219
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:48,554
Big Brother

220
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,479
Boss

221
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:12,410
Take out all your cell phones

222
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,519
You two, go get the car

223
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,542
Wait

224
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:25,440

You two, follow me

227
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:39,416
Lau

228
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:40,480
Yes

229
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,878
Did Sam and his gang make any calls?

230
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,214
No. They probably changed their phones

231
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:47,612
Let's search randomly for calls
made from this area

232
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:49,014
Searching

233
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:51,444
Some 6,500 cell phones

234
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,512
are being connected in this area right now

235
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,979
267 cell phones are making calls
on this street alone

236
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,748
Give me 1 0 minutes

237
00:21:58,949 --> 00:21:59,744
Good

238
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:01,277
Thank you

239
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:06,874
Did they spot us?

240
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,544
Are those two over there watching us?

241
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:13,614
Which two?

242
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:15,337
Those two

243
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,112
No one is watching you

244
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:22,315
Those two making out over there

245
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:25,112
They are just making out
Why would they be watching you?

246
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:26,279
You think you're a movie star?

247
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,113
Our prey is back

248
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:31,411
Yip, watch our prey closely

249
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,568
Boss. The Thais are here

250
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:47,770
Hey man

251
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:48,543
What's up?

252
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:50,176
How are you?

253
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:51,967
Cigar?

254
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:55,644
ls that any good?

255
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,534
Excellent

256
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,000
ls it cold in Hong Kong?

257
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,833
Very cold

258
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:09,939
You even know how to speak Cantonese

259
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,639
How fantastic

260
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:17,905
Marvelous indeed

261
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,333
AA+

262
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:52,601
Deal

263

Repeat, Helen, Nelson

265
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,428
Attention. HN397 is taking off

266
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:11,829
Repeat, Helen, Nelson, 397

267
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:18,430
Should we send a car to tail them?

268
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:32,296
Elephant
Kwai Chung Container Terminus

Piero. You're being tailed

271
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:45,056
Lead them in circles

272
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:56,698
They know which channel we are on

273
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,091
Switch to channel 456855

274
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,364
Boss, where are those two going?

275
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,625
Don't worry, take it easy

276
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:24,298
Take care of the Thais for me

277
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,991
Sorry, sir

278
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,825
Hello?

279
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:51,486
Why don't you use the walkie talkie?
We've switched channels?

280
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:52,625
Are you done yet?

281
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:54,888
Beat it

282
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:01,589
Piero, are you being tailed?

283
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:04,886
Keep driving around

284
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:29,823
Cheung

285
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:33,459
Use the current channel to tell Elephant
that action has been cancelled

286
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,522
Yes, sir

287
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:40,483
Elephant, no hunting tonight

288
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:42,586
Come back to the station

289
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:52,181
lt's done

290
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:53,049
What the hell is going on?

291
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,789
Our guys are freezing to death out there

292
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:00,283
What's so funny?

293
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,520
l speak Thai. l know what they're saying

294
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:04,684
Really?

295
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:08,686
Yes. They are bitching at the boss

296
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:11,588
What are they bitching about?

297
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:15,550
Those Thais at Lung Koo Bay
are freezing to death

298
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:19,052
You know they can't stand the cold

299
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:21,179
That's right

300
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:23,252
You're sharp

301
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,274
Cheung, call Elephant

302
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,642

Tell Keung to check the goods
And make sure no one is around

305
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:22,412
Not a soul

306
00:28:28,814 --> 00:28:30,940
A boat is approaching
Probably for checking the goods

307
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:41,739
The cocaine is all here

308
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,479
Keung, are you an idiot or what?

309
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:44,770
Boss

310
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:45,934
l heard it

311
00:28:46,813 --> 00:28:49,803
Tell Keung to shout a loud
that the cocaine is his

312
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:52,311
Keung, the Boss

313
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:54,944
asks you to shout aloud that the cocaine
is yours

314
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,803
The cocaine is yours

315
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:01,342
Take delivery

316
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:09,441
They are taking delivery
Get ready for action

317
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:19,569
Thanks. Thanks

318

Double Eight

320
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:36,731
As soon as the Thais step out, arrest them

321
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:45,261
There's a stooge. Stop the deal

322
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,338
There's a stooge. Stop the deal

323
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:02,434
Wait

324
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,695
There's a stooge. Stop the deal

325
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,027
Hello?

326
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:11,567
Cast all the goods into the sea. Now

327
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:14,895
Keung. Cast all the goods into the sea

328
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,535
Police. Freeze

329

We got the men but lost the goods

330
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,797
They have cast everything into the sea

331
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,231
Double Eight, hold it

332
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:52,791
All of you, follow me

333
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,865
What are you looking at?

334

Boss. Let's...

335
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:52,827
Police, don't move

336
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:40,380
Sam

337
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:42,989
Your food looks good

338
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:44,290
Not bad

339
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,083
We've straightened it out

340
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:49,191
Your boys are only strolling on the beach

341
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:50,748
So they can go now?

342
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:52,316
Sure, any time

343
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:54,591
We don't want to waste any more of
your precious time

344
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:57,455
We've known each other for so long
Don't give me that

345
00:32:58,091 --> 00:32:59,580
l haven't had my dinner here
for quite a while

346
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:01,284
lf you like it, you're always welcome here

347
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:02,218
How about tomorrow?

348
00:33:03,923 --> 00:33:05,014
l'll take a rain check

349
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:08,288
l feel bad coming here empty-handed

350
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:09,716
Don't stand on ceremonies

351
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:11,522
l' should feel bad

352
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:13,722
for making you drop several grand
tonight

353
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:37,720
You think planting a mole in us will do
us in?

354
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:39,244
Same here

355
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,776
l remember a story

356
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:03,449
Two fools are waiting for their
kidney transplants

357
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:04,877
but only one kidney is available

358
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,209
The two guys thus play a game

359
00:34:08,285 --> 00:34:10,582
They each put a playing card
into the other's pocket

360
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:14,445
Whoever guesses the card in his own
pocket wins

361
00:34:16,717 --> 00:34:18,240
You know l can see your card

362
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:22,109
l think so too

363
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:28,147
l will beat you

364
00:34:28,515 --> 00:34:29,412
Let's see

365
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:32,841
We should be more careful

366
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:33,911
l will

367
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:36,237
By the way

368
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:38,574
whoever loses the game will die

369
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,180
Let's see when you're gonna die

370
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:50,511
Ever seen someone shakes
a corpse's hand?

371
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,675
Let's go

372
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:17,908
Put it next to the couch

373
00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:18,839
OK

374
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:20,041
Thanks

375
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,007
Mary

376
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:27,038
What's interior designer's number?

377
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:31,234
The interior designer... 9025504 7

378
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:34,775
How many boxes have l counted?

379
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:39,167
24? Are you sure?

380
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:40,501
Positive

381
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:44,071
Pass me the phone

382
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,370
Coming

383
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,234
Hello?

384
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:52,339
Hold on please

385
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,336
Who is it?

386
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:54,268
l don't know

387
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:55,565
Hello

388
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:56,737
lt's me

389
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:58,703
Yes, l'm moving in

390
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:00,931
Don't eavesdrop. lt's confidential

391
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:02,898
l lost all of my goods

392
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:04,634
There's a mole

393
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,871
Dig him out for me

394
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:07,506
Hold on, too many people around here

395
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:08,638
Hold on

396
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,729
l have no access to those undercover files
l can't dig him out

397
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,369
l don't care how difficult it is

398
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:18,830
l only know he uses Morse codes

399
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:29,698
Give me all the information on the people
around you last night

400
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,565
Their real names, lD card no.
account no., etc

401
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:36,498
See you tonight, at the cinema

402
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,565
OK

403
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,167
What's the matter?

404
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,602
l'm talking about my novel

405
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,426
l know what l'm going to write about
Come here

406
00:36:58,703 --> 00:37:01,727
l can write about a man with 28 different
personalities

407
00:37:02,301 --> 00:37:03,130
Are you talking about me?

408
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,698
Be more serious

409
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:06,134
Think about it

410
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:08,232
A man with 28 personalities

411
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:11,299
That means he starts role playing
the minute he wakes up

412
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:14,024
He is no longer certain
which personality is the real him

413
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,388
lsn't it scary?

414
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,430
Very much

415
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:18,862
Good?

416
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,190
Yeah. Will be a bestseller for sure

417
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:20,989
Wait...

418
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,756
What is it?

419
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:23,190
Why is the ottoman so big?

420
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,631
Which one?

421
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:28,234
l must have gotten the measurements
wrong

422
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,098
Take it easy

423
00:37:31,398 --> 00:37:32,762
You women...

424
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:34,862
Let me see. Get up slowly

425
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:36,822
Don't be mad

426
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:43,787
Meet up?

427
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:44,962
You want me dead?

428
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:46,664
There's a mole in the police station

429
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,257
Dig him out first

430
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,089
So who is he?

431
00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:53,922
l can't talk anymore

432
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,195
What?

433
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:58,086
Just now?

434
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,787
l was at a Chinese chiropractor

435
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,819
l'm seeing the shrink now

436
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,496
l'm going psycho. That's it

437
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,121
This chair is really... incredible

438
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:10,023
You should get one for yourself?

439
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:12,019
So you don't need to come here
and sleep every time

440
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:13,780
lt's more comfortable here

441
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:16,520
Don't be so peevish

442
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:19,189
During these 4 months, if it weren't for me

443
00:39:19,522 --> 00:39:21,250
you wouldn't have the time to play

444
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:24,816
lt's 5 months
computer games

445
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:28,618
ln one more month
your mandatory therapy will be over

446
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,379
You can sleep peacefully at home then

447
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:33,221
So soon?

448
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:37,022
l don't seem to have improved at all

449
00:39:37,322 --> 00:39:40,118
Why don't you just prolong my treatment

450
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:44,321
Besides, my head is splitting these days

451
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:46,418
Could it be schizophrenia?

452
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:49,853
This is called ''headache''
l'll prescribe some Panadol for you

453
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:55,210
Actually
there's something l want to ask you

454
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:56,879
but...

455
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,949
it's kind of embarrassing

456
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:01,683
What do you think of me?

457
00:40:06,685 --> 00:40:09,209
Do you think l'm a good guy or a bad guy?

458
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:12,108
l hardly know who you are

459
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,978
Tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone

460
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,076
l'm actually a cop

461
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:35,710
So am l

462
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:45,143
Let's continue next week

463
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:46,981
Try to remember your dreams

464
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:49,002
Of course

465
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,012
l will dream about you

466
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:53,969
See you next week

467
00:40:58,113 --> 00:40:59,272
Just Panadol?

468
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:06,210
Bye

469
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,911
Your promotion should be OK

470
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:17,070
You will be transferred to lnternal Affairs

471
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,245
but you will work at OCTB

472
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,175
l don't understand

473
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:26,969
l suspect Sam has a mole
in the department

474
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,267
l want you to investigate

475
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:29,899
Why me?

476
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:33,801
We have scrutinized all possible
candidates

477
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,676
You have an immaculate record

478
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,244
You have solved many cases in ClB

479
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,705
Working in lA, you will get in touch
with senior officials

480
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:44,541
That's a good opportunity

481
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,577
l've arranged for you to appear on TV

482
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:50,302
Remember to spruce up a bit

483
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:54,970
When will l meet the Board?

484
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:56,801
You just did

485
00:41:57,575 --> 00:42:01,236
Come, take a stab

486
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,637
Thanks

487
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,596
By the way

488
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,499
how's the wedding?

489
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:13,064
Everything's on schedule

490
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,063
That's good

491
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:18,437
You'll be more stable after marriage

492
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,137
Your image will improve too

493
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,295
You have chance of further promotion

494
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:27,436
Yes, broaden your horizon

495
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,406
Fill in your real name

496
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:33,797
This is my real name

497
00:42:34,405 --> 00:42:35,894
You don't know Del Piero is my real name?

498
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:36,833
ls that so?

499
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:37,935
Yes

500
00:42:45,904 --> 00:42:47,200
What are you guys writing?

501
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:51,662
The Boss told us to fill in these forms

502
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,493
Must be setting up mandatory
provident funds for us

503
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:55,793
You know, MPF

504
00:42:58,903 --> 00:42:59,732
Are you serious?

505
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:01,434
You don't know to spell BOD YGUARD?

506
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,192
lsn't it supposed to look like this?

507
00:43:02,435 --> 00:43:03,628
Of course not

508
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:19,067
Should be B-O-D-Y-G-A-R-D

509
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:20,528
That's it

510
00:43:46,464 --> 00:43:47,521
A shipment will come in next week

511
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:50,189
They are watching closely

512
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:52,526
You do what you need to do

513
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,094
l'll handle the rest

514
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:59,296
The file is open. l'm afraid l can't handle it

515
00:43:59,797 --> 00:44:01,559
So you're not worried about me

516
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:05,225
You are worried about yourself
lnspector Lau

517
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,126
Those girls are so ugly

518
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:23,285
l'll take care of it as soon as l can

519
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:27,177
Hello?

520
00:45:30,923 --> 00:45:32,287
l'm on my way back

521
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:17,515
Yan

522
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:20,446
How long have you worked for me?

523
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:22,649
3 or 4 years already

524
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:24,309
That long?

525
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:26,314
Doesn't seem that long to me

526
00:46:29,617 --> 00:46:31,550
l have another shipment next week

527
00:46:31,884 --> 00:46:32,907
But this time

528
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:36,609
l'm using some tough, new faces

529
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:37,975
So you guys can rest

530
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,014
Even Keung and the others?

531
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,977
Keung?

532
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,009
Don't you know he's nuts?

533
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:04,107
There's a mole within us. You know that?

534
00:47:11,146 --> 00:47:12,373
What do you think we should do?

535
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,102
l'll take care of it

536
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,205
How?

537
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:32,542
l'll find out who he is in a couple of days
Get ready for action

538
00:47:35,344 --> 00:47:36,503
Yan

539
00:47:39,444 --> 00:47:41,138
Of all the brothers, l trust you the most

540
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,635
Lau

541
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:17,032
No, thanks

542
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:23,534
These folks

543
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,134
You know most of them
no need for introduction, right?

544
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:29,596
No, but...

545
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,737
they are so...

546
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:35,997
Who doesn't know you're sent here
to find the mole?

547
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:38,173
What do you want them to do?
Pour you a cup of coffee?

548
00:48:38,973 --> 00:48:41,701
Only an idiot will not be envied, right?

549
00:48:42,106 --> 00:48:44,630
They all want to know who the mole is

550
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,699
Just tell me whom you want to investigate

551
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:47,669
OK

552
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:49,696
Any clues?

553
00:48:52,204 --> 00:48:53,500
Two days ago, my informer

554
00:48:53,737 --> 00:48:55,931
nearly found out who he was

555
00:48:56,204 --> 00:48:59,000
Too bad he lost him

556
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,963
But if Sam is getting a new shipment
he must contact the mole again

557
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,237
Just follow Sam and we'll get
what we want

558
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:06,331
That's right. l've much to learn from you

559
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:07,793
Don't say that

560
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,537
Our seniors sent you here
because they think you can do it

561
00:49:10,802 --> 00:49:12,735
Not everyone can handle lA tasks

562
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:13,798
lt's stuffy here

563
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:15,190
Let's get out of here

564
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:17,527
The coffee here is the best
in the headquarters

565
00:49:17,736 --> 00:49:18,633
l'll pour you a cup

566
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:47,566
My informer nearly found out
who the mole was

567
00:49:47,966 --> 00:49:49,364
But if Sam is getting a new shipment

568
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,530
he must contact the mole again

569
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,288
Yes?

570
00:50:58,626 --> 00:50:59,718
Hey

571
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:01,222
The bed has arrived

572
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:03,118
ls that so? Comfortable?

573
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:05,320
You want to try it?

574
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,157
Don't be silly. l have work to do

575
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:10,659
Think about it

576
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:14,564
No, l can't

577
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:15,596
Come on

578
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:16,755
Saturday

579
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:18,395
l'll be free next Saturday
We can try it then

580
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,159
OK

581
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:21,298
OK, next Saturday then

582
00:51:21,569 --> 00:51:21,933
Bye

583
00:51:22,236 --> 00:51:22,964
Bye

584
00:51:27,237 --> 00:51:27,931
Up already?

585
00:51:28,105 --> 00:51:29,231
Yes

586
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,070
We just tested the bed
and you are working again?

587
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,604
l'm very hardworking

588
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,732
What are you writing now?

589
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:39,238
Here

590
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,708
The more l think of it, the more
pathetic the main character appears

591
00:51:44,277 --> 00:51:45,301
Pathetic indeed

592
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:47,802
Perhaps l should make him a happier guy

593
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:48,875
Good

594
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,808
Should l turn him into a good guy?

595
00:51:53,515 --> 00:51:56,609
Even though he is good
he has done bad things

596
00:51:56,915 --> 00:51:58,041
So how should it end?

597
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,814
That's a good question

598
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,278
l'll leave this to you writers

599
00:52:04,285 --> 00:52:05,980
You're not going to sleep?
Help me, please

600
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,154
Help me, please?

601
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:09,386
l can't

602
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:11,588
Go to sleep. You are tired

603
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:30,959
From now on

604
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,322
follow SP Wong around the clock

605
00:52:35,865 --> 00:52:40,234
Piero, l know how to spot a plainclothes

606
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:41,999
How?

607
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,927
lf he seems to be doing something

608
00:52:44,134 --> 00:52:46,432
but is paying attention to us instead

609
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:48,266
then he is a cop

610
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,206
ls that so?

611
00:53:11,112 --> 00:53:12,136
Then the whole place is filled with cops

612
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:13,573
They're everywhere

613
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,349
Yan

614
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:26,047
Boss

615
00:53:40,824 --> 00:53:41,791
Watching something?

616
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:43,248
You are a cop

617
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:46,386
We are guessing who a cop is

618
00:53:46,993 --> 00:53:48,756
How trivial

619
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,792
l'm going for a massage, wanna come?

620
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,017
l hate it

621
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:55,023
Don't tell

622
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,830
Tell on him

623
00:53:58,097 --> 00:53:58,893
l won't

624
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,357
What a coincidence

625
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:09,831
Yes, l was shopping in the hood

626
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:12,028
Haven't seen you for ages

627
00:54:13,303 --> 00:54:14,668
6 or 7 years already

628
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:18,526
How are you?

629
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:21,537
l'm married. How about you?

630
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:24,271
Still working in...?

631
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,465
Mommy

632
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:35,541
Your daughter?

633
00:54:35,712 --> 00:54:36,576
Yes

634
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:40,144
How old is she?

635
00:54:40,446 --> 00:54:41,413
5 years old

636
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:46,415
l'm waiting for my husband's car, so...

637
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,942
l'm also in a hurry

638
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:49,611
Bye

639
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:50,709
Bye

640
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:57,213
Mommy, l'm 6 already

641
00:54:57,587 --> 00:55:00,112
Sorry, l always get it wrong

642
00:55:35,568 --> 00:55:36,500
Where are you now?

643
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:37,568
On my way

644
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:47,201
Hello?

645
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:50,943
Boss, he is taking the subway

646
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:53,773
Keep following him

647
00:56:16,552 --> 00:56:19,988
Boss, he has gone to the 24th floor

648
00:56:20,286 --> 00:56:21,514
Stay put. Don't do anything rash

649
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,889
Boss, we've got him

650
00:56:42,095 --> 00:56:42,959
l don't know yet

651
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:44,928
But l know where he is now

652
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:52,641
Keep watch over here

653
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,489
So? Any good news?

654
00:57:11,757 --> 00:57:12,689
A shipment will come in next week

655
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:14,219
Time and location yet to be confirmed

656
00:57:14,825 --> 00:57:16,554
l still don't know who Sam's mole is

657
00:57:16,926 --> 00:57:18,894
but he seems confident he can blow
my cover

658
00:57:21,427 --> 00:57:22,951
ln that case

659
00:57:29,331 --> 00:57:31,458
we'd better stop it
We're gonna lose for sure

660
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:33,427
You are kidding, right?

661
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:35,929
What else can we do? lt's deadly business

662
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:44,140
Hello?

663
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:45,301
Boss said he had found the mole
He told us to take care of him

664
00:57:46,804 --> 00:57:47,793
l'll be right there

665
00:58:08,413 --> 00:58:09,345
Hello?

666
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,305
Keep an eye on SP Wong

667
00:58:26,952 --> 00:58:29,113
You two, take the stairs

668
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:31,511
Keung, take the elevator

669
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:34,154
Anyone knows you're seeing me today?

670
00:58:34,322 --> 00:58:35,084
No

671
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:36,413
They are downstairs now

672
00:59:04,868 --> 00:59:05,857
What are you doing?

673
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:07,429
Put it away

674
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:34,674
Take the window-washing scaffolding

675
00:59:34,846 --> 00:59:35,744
How about you?

676
00:59:36,313 --> 00:59:37,337
l'll take the elevator

677
00:59:39,548 --> 00:59:40,537
Be careful

678
00:59:42,118 --> 00:59:44,668
- Hey
- What?

679
00:59:44,817 --> 00:59:45,749
Nothing

680
01:00:24,966 --> 01:00:27,901
Darling, the apartment is superb

681
01:00:28,134 --> 01:00:30,864
A 1 80-degree window facing
the golf course

682
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:32,658
plus club membership costs less than
a million

683
01:00:39,238 --> 01:00:40,227
Superintendent Wong?

684
01:00:51,076 --> 01:00:52,407
Turn around to the main entrance

685
01:01:45,764 --> 01:01:47,129
What do you think of me?

686
01:01:54,034 --> 01:01:56,525
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

687
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,077
Let's go

688
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:19,369
Police. Let's go

689
01:02:50,724 --> 01:02:52,089
Bad news, Boss

690
01:02:52,357 --> 01:02:53,346
Something happened to SP Wong

691
01:03:45,244 --> 01:03:47,940
There's a gunfight in Sheung Wan
this afternoon

692
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,092
Three suspects were dead;

693
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:51,824
several suspects and pedestrians
were injured

694
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:56,299
The police confirmed that
one of the victims

695
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,561
was superintendent in OCTB
Mr. Wong Chi-shing

696
01:03:57,837 --> 01:03:58,963
The motive is unknown

697
01:03:59,204 --> 01:04:02,662
Possibility of gang feud is not ruled out

698
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:04,701
They are now after several triad members
active in the Southern Kowloon area

699
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:06,406
The Police Commissioner

700
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:09,269
expressed condolence

701
01:04:09,508 --> 01:04:11,271
and pledged to solve the case
as soon as possible

702
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,067
lt was a close shave

703
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:16,270
1 0 minutes after you went to your massage

704
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,239
Boss told us to get ready

705
01:04:19,546 --> 01:04:21,070
l was scared stiff

706
01:04:21,579 --> 01:04:24,605
You know
l hide under the car in every fight

707
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:28,411
And there were guns up there

708
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:32,347
l wanted to sneak out of there

709
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:40,618
Two days ago
Boss told me to go to his room

710
01:04:41,054 --> 01:04:43,318
He asked me how long l'd worked for him

711
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:44,849
How the hell could l remember?

712
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:47,813
He then said: Keung

713
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:50,583
it's been 5 years already

714
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,917
You've performed well all these years

715
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,790
l have a question for you

716
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,791
lf one of your brothers is a mole

717
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:03,391
will you dare to take him out?

718
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:06,696
Of course l said yes to his face

719
01:05:06,997 --> 01:05:08,589
You think l'm an idiot?

720
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,699
What's the result?

721
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:16,498
Of course they couldn't find the mole

722
01:05:18,535 --> 01:05:20,230
The cop was tough

723
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:22,129
They dragged him upstairs

724
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:24,994
and beat him up for a good 1 0 minutes

725
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:27,436
1 0 minutes...

726
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:32,905
1 0 minutes...

727
01:05:34,608 --> 01:05:36,235
He didn't say a word

728
01:05:42,878 --> 01:05:43,776
Keung

729
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,540
Boss said...

730
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,882
the cop was hot on his trail

731
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:57,575
Who didn't show up today is the mole

732
01:05:58,617 --> 01:05:59,777
l didn't...

733
01:06:00,386 --> 01:06:02,115
tell him you went for a massage

734
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:07,052
lf Boss knew, you're dead meat

735
01:06:09,889 --> 01:06:13,052
Yan, l want to ask you something

736
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:15,518
How was the masseuse today?

737
01:06:17,692 --> 01:06:18,954
Because...

738
01:06:20,327 --> 01:06:22,887
if she's ugly, it's not worth it

739
01:06:28,763 --> 01:06:30,025
Leave right away

740
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:33,499
There will be lots of cops after a car crash

741
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:39,827
Anyway, remember this:

742
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:43,993
if you see someone

743
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:50,468
doing something
but at the same time watching you...

744
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,436
then he is a cop

745
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:42,090
According to the closed-circuit TV

746
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:44,554
SP Wong entered that building at 4:1 5 pm

747
01:07:44,826 --> 01:07:47,488
The suspects entered 20 minutes later

748
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,657
At 4:38 pm

749
01:07:50,995 --> 01:07:52,792
we received lnspector Lau's report

750
01:07:54,463 --> 01:07:58,160
8 minutes before we arrived
someone fell off the building

751
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:00,894
That was SP Wong

752
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:05,290
All the suspects killed or
injured belong to Sam's gang

753
01:08:06,134 --> 01:08:07,658
Many suspects escaped

754
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:09,696
The actual numbers are unknown

755
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:12,360
Do you know why SP Wong went to
that building?

756
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:18,100
lt was me

757
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:20,039
l told ClB to follow him

758
01:08:20,306 --> 01:08:22,035
Why was ClB following him?

759
01:08:22,575 --> 01:08:24,008
That's lA's business

760
01:08:24,909 --> 01:08:26,274
Now that SP Wong is dead

761
01:08:26,543 --> 01:08:27,840
it is OCTB's business

762
01:08:28,177 --> 01:08:29,405
What kind of attitude is that?

763
01:08:29,644 --> 01:08:31,874
SP Wong was dedicated to the police force
and you investigated him?

764
01:08:32,144 --> 01:08:33,805
What kind of attitude is that?

765
01:08:34,046 --> 01:08:36,742
So we senior officers have to ask
for your approval, huh?

766
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:38,480
Your people have made a mistake now
Or SP Wong wouldn't have died

767
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:39,714
l am talking business here

768
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,038
l am talking personal matters

769
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,010
Nobody wanted this, OK?

770
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:49,910
Sorry, sir

771
01:08:52,456 --> 01:08:53,753
lt's my negligence

772
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:58,054
l will give everybody an answer

773
01:08:58,825 --> 01:08:59,689
Sorry

774
01:09:04,628 --> 01:09:06,220
SP Wong has a file

775
01:09:06,496 --> 01:09:08,464
with information on our undercover
in Sam's gang

776
01:09:09,096 --> 01:09:10,859
lt is locked by a password

777
01:09:11,296 --> 01:09:13,127
The technical staff can't decipher it

778
01:09:14,098 --> 01:09:14,587
lnspector Lau

779
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:15,458
Yes

780
01:09:15,732 --> 01:09:17,825
Work with ClB

781
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:18,999
to unlock it

782
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,200
Find our man and get him out of there

783
01:09:23,268 --> 01:09:24,292
By the way

784
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:27,360
SP Wong was a good cop

785
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:31,962
We should give him a grand funeral

786
01:09:32,638 --> 01:09:33,332
Okay?

787
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:34,996
Yes, sir

788
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:47,607
Hello?

789
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:51,646
Boss. Why made such a scene?

790
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,639
He was following me all the time

791
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,279
One of us would have to die

792
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:56,914
l'm now in charge of everything here

793
01:09:57,182 --> 01:09:58,706
lf you're having any transactions
just let me know

794
01:09:58,983 --> 01:09:59,972
lt's done

795
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:03,012
We got the goods when they killed
the cop today

796
01:10:03,717 --> 01:10:07,448
l won't bother you now

797
01:12:14,635 --> 01:12:15,829
What did you call me for?

798
01:12:18,637 --> 01:12:19,899
So you're the one?

799
01:12:22,306 --> 01:12:23,273
Who are you?

800
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:24,996
lnspector Lau of OCTB

801
01:12:30,842 --> 01:12:33,106
SP Wong is gone. We're all upset

802
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,500
l still have unfinished business

803
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:39,842
SP Wong wouldn't want you to
take law in your own hands

804
01:12:40,179 --> 01:12:41,339
What do you want?

805
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:44,002
Co-operation

806
01:12:53,685 --> 01:12:56,381
The police has discovered

807
01:12:56,619 --> 01:12:58,280
the body of a fugitive suspect
He was involved in

808
01:12:58,552 --> 01:13:01,544
the Sheung Wan shooting earlier today

809
01:13:01,788 --> 01:13:02,777
The police has confirmed

810
01:13:03,021 --> 01:13:06,184
the body to be an undercover cop
Tsui Wai-keung

811
01:13:06,456 --> 01:13:08,390
The police has expressed their condolence

812
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:09,554
and promised a thorough investigation

813
01:13:09,757 --> 01:13:10,917
Boss, Yan is back

814
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:14,458
Three vehicles collided in Yuen Long
today

815
01:13:14,726 --> 01:13:16,159
The driver of the private car was trapped

816
01:13:16,427 --> 01:13:17,985
until firefighters came and rescued him

817
01:13:21,162 --> 01:13:22,060
Boss

818
01:13:23,096 --> 01:13:23,994
What is it, Yan?

819
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:26,830
l have taken care of Keung already

820
01:13:28,731 --> 01:13:30,255
Did you ever send him to the warehouse?

821
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,494
lt will be disastrous if he knows where it is

822
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:44,996
Boss. lt's me

823
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,362
You don't have to go yourself

824
01:13:46,638 --> 01:13:47,696
l don't want anyone to know the password

825
01:13:48,072 --> 01:13:49,004
l understand

826
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:50,665
l'll send everyone away

827
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:00,540
lnspector Cheung

828
01:14:02,878 --> 01:14:04,505
Tell those boys to stop following
Sam's gang

829
01:14:09,513 --> 01:14:12,141
l got information that Sam is heading
towards the warehouse

830
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:14,579
He won't go if he's being tailed

831
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:17,982
Just call them back

832
01:14:18,284 --> 01:14:19,717
Let's do something for SP Wong

833
01:14:19,951 --> 01:14:21,282
Please help me, OK?

834
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:24,053
Say something

835
01:14:24,987 --> 01:14:26,716
This is not my case

836
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:29,279
Officer Chan told me not to get involved

837
01:14:30,456 --> 01:14:33,892
lf they're willing to stop
then it's up to them

838
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:37,222
l know l'm responsible for
SP Wong's death

839
01:14:37,525 --> 01:14:38,321
l am also a cop, like you

840
01:14:38,592 --> 01:14:40,617
l want to solve the case too

841
01:14:41,293 --> 01:14:42,851
l thought you only want promotion

842
01:14:45,562 --> 01:14:47,291
lt's SP Wong's mole who tipped me off

843
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:48,291
Do you believe it or not?

844
01:14:48,563 --> 01:14:50,531
This is our last chance
Are you ready to take the risk?

845
01:15:39,383 --> 01:15:41,214
Attention: Target vehicle

846
01:15:41,484 --> 01:15:43,418
on Highway no.3

847
01:15:51,187 --> 01:15:52,347
U-turn at Pier 3

848
01:15:52,621 --> 01:15:53,986
to Lung Cheung Road

849
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:08,117
They have been here for 20 minutes

850
01:16:08,395 --> 01:16:10,022
they are going to the 4th floor of
the car park

851
01:16:29,902 --> 01:16:32,803
Officer Chan won't let me touch this case

852
01:16:33,537 --> 01:16:35,767
lf anything goes wrong
you'll take the blame

853
01:16:41,374 --> 01:16:42,932
They are loading the goods at 4P

854
01:16:43,174 --> 01:16:45,108
Elephant, stand by at the exit at 3P

855
01:16:45,308 --> 01:16:47,037
Double Eight, watch the entrance at 2P

856
01:16:47,277 --> 01:16:49,507
Fishball and Cheung, stand by here

857
01:16:49,744 --> 01:16:51,268
All of you, wait for my signal

858
01:17:10,385 --> 01:17:12,250
Oh, l forgot Boss told me to stay behind

859
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:13,508
Drop me off here

860
01:17:59,705 --> 01:18:00,364
Run him over

861
01:18:51,992 --> 01:18:53,220
My Master always said that about my life:

862
01:18:54,192 --> 01:18:57,684
What thousands must die so that
Caesar may become great

863
01:18:58,794 --> 01:19:01,957
You choose your own future

864
01:19:16,634 --> 01:19:17,464
That's what you have chosen

865
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:56,755
Coffee for you

866
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:05,447
He's waited a long time for you

867
01:20:15,496 --> 01:20:16,690
So it's you?

868
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:23,154
Was the stereo OK?

869
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:24,456
Pretty good

870
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:26,664
Those tube amps have to be warmed up

871
01:20:26,967 --> 01:20:29,094
Wait 1 0 minutes and it sounds great

872
01:20:29,968 --> 01:20:30,992
Should l salute you?

873
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,225
Not, don't

874
01:20:34,136 --> 01:20:35,330
How long have you been an undercover?

875
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:37,797
l've followed Sam for 3 years

876
01:20:38,204 --> 01:20:39,671
l had several other bosses before

877
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:41,637
All together it's been 1 0 years

878
01:20:41,906 --> 01:20:42,998
1 0 years?

879
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:44,637
l should salute you instead

880
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,205
l just want an identity

881
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,838
l want to be a normal man

882
01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:50,073
Getting tired?

883
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:54,741
You've never been a mole
you won't understand

884
01:20:58,246 --> 01:20:59,873
Too bad l still can't find the stooge

885
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:01,543
l'll take him down if l find him

886
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:11,481
Don't worry
Let me give you back your identity

887
01:21:11,884 --> 01:21:13,511
l'll open your file but...

888
01:21:13,886 --> 01:21:14,944
l don't have the password

889
01:21:17,053 --> 01:21:18,611
What's the Morse code for
''undercover''?

890
01:21:20,654 --> 01:21:21,916
That's it?

891
01:22:08,573 --> 01:22:09,232
Are you serious?

892
01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:10,964
You don't even know to
spell BOD YGUARD?

893
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:11,906
lsn't it supposed to look like this?

894
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:13,436
Of course not

895
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:27,592
Dr. Lee

896
01:24:28,995 --> 01:24:30,155
l thought you wouldn't come

897
01:24:30,495 --> 01:24:31,928
You're wanted by the police

898
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:35,297
Can l sleep in your chair again?

899
01:24:36,064 --> 01:24:37,429
Let's talk upstairs

900
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,129
Last time you said you're a cop

901
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:45,060
ls it true?

902
01:24:45,735 --> 01:24:46,724
lt was true

903
01:24:47,803 --> 01:24:49,031
But l'm not so sure now

904
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:55,930
So what's your plan?

905
01:24:56,739 --> 01:24:59,435
l don't know. Still thinking

906
01:25:13,713 --> 01:25:15,647
There's one thing l've been trying to
tell you for a while

907
01:25:17,147 --> 01:25:18,774
But it's too embarrassing

908
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:27,351
l told you l dreamt about you all the time

909
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:29,343
lt's true

910
01:25:37,722 --> 01:25:38,916
Me too

911
01:26:22,906 --> 01:26:26,467
Remember my secret. Goodbye

912
01:26:43,215 --> 01:26:44,182
Mary

913
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,739
What is it? Has it broken down?

914
01:26:58,787 --> 01:27:00,914
This morning
the guys from the stereo shop came

915
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,854
They have tuned it up already

916
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:07,954
They also left a CD sampler for you

917
01:27:09,158 --> 01:27:10,489
l've listened to it

918
01:27:16,894 --> 01:27:18,486
Have you had breakfast yet?

919
01:27:18,928 --> 01:27:20,054
l'll get you some

920
01:27:21,396 --> 01:27:22,556
lced tea?

921
01:27:23,664 --> 01:27:24,858
Chinese buns?

922
01:27:26,132 --> 01:27:27,190
Sure

923
01:27:43,005 --> 01:27:45,769
l can't finish my novel

924
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,968
l don't know whether he's good or bad

925
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:57,743
l think only he knows

926
01:27:59,611 --> 01:28:00,976
A shipment will come in next week

927
01:28:02,378 --> 01:28:03,640
They are watching closely

928
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,104
You do what you need to do

929
01:28:06,947 --> 01:28:08,539
l will handle the rest

930
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:12,879
The file is open. l can't handle it

931
01:28:13,184 --> 01:28:14,776
So you're not worried about me

932
01:28:16,317 --> 01:28:18,217
You are worried about yourself
lnspector Lau

933
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,148
Are the voices crisp enough?

934
01:28:24,455 --> 01:28:25,513
The precious recording

935
01:28:26,355 --> 01:28:28,346
was taken from Sam's office

936
01:28:29,356 --> 01:28:30,448
lt's not your lucky day

937
01:28:31,424 --> 01:28:33,688
Don't threaten me. What do you want?

938
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:35,421
l want my identity back

939
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:38,953
3 pm, Central Ferry Pier
Keep your cell on

940
01:29:02,769 --> 01:29:05,294
The number you have dialed cannot be
connected

941
01:29:05,538 --> 01:29:07,597
Please leave a message after the beep

942
01:29:08,838 --> 01:29:10,772
Mary, l'm sorry

943
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:13,496
l've chosen to be the good guy

944
01:29:14,207 --> 01:29:15,868
l'm going to meet Yan now

945
01:29:16,475 --> 01:29:19,308
No matter what
l'll give him back his identity

946
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:21,505
The file is in my computer

947
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:23,771
The password is your birthday

948
01:30:40,742 --> 01:30:41,970
You sure know what you're doing

949
01:30:42,309 --> 01:30:43,776
l also went to the cadet school

950
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:50,437
Do all undercover cops like rooftops?

951
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:55,380
Unlike you, l'm not afraid of light

952
01:30:57,248 --> 01:30:58,510
So where's the stuff l want?

953
01:31:00,049 --> 01:31:02,313
l don't think you've brought
what l want either

954
01:31:07,452 --> 01:31:08,544
So what does this mean?

955
01:31:09,586 --> 01:31:11,213
We came up here to sunbathe?

956
01:31:13,254 --> 01:31:14,721
Give me a chance

957
01:31:16,088 --> 01:31:17,453
How?

958
01:31:19,656 --> 01:31:21,055
l have no choice before

959
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,258
but now l want to turn over a new leaf

960
01:31:28,427 --> 01:31:29,451
Good

961
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:32,821
Try telling that to the judge

962
01:31:34,329 --> 01:31:35,819
See what he has to say

963
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:40,688
You want me dead?

964
01:31:41,098 --> 01:31:43,794
Sorry, l'm a cop

965
01:31:43,966 --> 01:31:44,933
Who knows that?

966
01:32:01,907 --> 01:32:03,033
Don't move. Police

967
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:06,209
Drop your weapon and let lnspector Lau
go first

968
01:32:06,674 --> 01:32:08,301
Your boss is Sam's mole

969
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:09,736
l got evidence

970
01:32:10,043 --> 01:32:11,533
Let's clear this up at the station

971
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,035
Drop your weapon now

972
01:32:14,311 --> 01:32:15,403
l've called the police

973
01:32:15,645 --> 01:32:16,612
Why should l trust you?

974
01:32:16,879 --> 01:32:18,073
You don't have to

975
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,017
You'd better watch out

976
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:45,854
Look who's talking

977
01:33:30,741 --> 01:33:34,199
l wish you every success in
the police force

978
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:37,975
Bottoms up, officers

979
01:33:41,078 --> 01:33:43,876
No sweat. We are brothers

980
01:33:45,147 --> 01:33:46,546
Sam is dead now

981
01:33:49,148 --> 01:33:50,342
You have to look after me

982
01:33:57,485 --> 01:33:58,850
l joined the cadet school in 1 994

983
01:33:59,386 --> 01:34:02,378
But my career never really takes off

984
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:05,450
Sam looked down on me

985
01:34:06,255 --> 01:34:08,018
l've taken care of Sam's tape

986
01:34:08,656 --> 01:34:10,954
Don't worry. l'll follow you from now on

987
01:34:13,058 --> 01:34:16,152
Our folks will be here any minute
Let's give them a good show

988
01:34:22,161 --> 01:34:25,619
l'm actually quite smart
Too bad Sam never knew that

989
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:07,810
l'm a cop

990
01:35:33,022 --> 01:35:35,388
Six months later, Dr. Lee Sum Yee
was looking through the personal

991
01:35:35,624 --> 01:35:37,251
properties left by Officer Yip
Headmaster of the Cadet

992
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:39,793
She found Chen Wing-yan's file that
proved his police identity

993
01:35:39,858 --> 01:35:41,792
Chen Wing-yan is now buried
next to SP Wong Chi-shing

994
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:29,379
How are you, Mr. Policeman?

995
01:37:08,827 --> 01:37:11,728
Those who break the rules will be like him

996
01:37:12,128 --> 01:37:13,322
They will be expelled

997
01:37:14,396 --> 01:37:16,364
Anybody wants to trade place with him?

998
01:37:23,733 --> 01:37:25,132
l do

999
01:37:34,044 --> 01:37:35,611
Says the Buddha:

1000
01:37:35,645 --> 01:37:38,709
"He who is in Continuous Hell never dies

1001
01:37:38,718 --> 01:37:41,917
Longevity is a big hardship
in Continuous Hell"
