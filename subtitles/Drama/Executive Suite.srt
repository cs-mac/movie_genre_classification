156
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,747
(BUZZING)

157
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,486
I didn't say I'd have dinner
with him at the club, you did!

158
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,894
Look, will you hold it? Sylvia,
please listen to me for a minute.

159
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,696
Bullard's getting ready to appoint
an executive vice-president, and I...

160
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,895
(BUZZING)

161
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,269
Well, be bored then! It happens
to be the way I make my living!

162
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,173
Hold it, will... Please hold it a minute.

163
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,375
You don't care whether I'm with you or not,

164
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,245
it's just that if I'm not there, you
won't have anything to complain about.

165
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,476
Sylvia? Hello, Syl?

166
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,645
Would you like a transcript of that?

167
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,282
You told me to monitor all important calls.

168
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,588
You made no commitments,
nothing was said by either party

169
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,458
that could be construed as binding
either on this company or...

170
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,761
Please, not now.

171
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:48,400
Mr. Bullard would like you at an
executive meeting at 6:00 tonight.

172
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,514
Shall I change your reservation?

173
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,577
Maybe you'll have to take the late plane.

174
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,957
Maybe I will.

175
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,307
(PHONE RINGING)

176
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,704
Hello? Yes, he's here.

177
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,041
Oh. Just a moment.

178
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,151
- Mr. Walling, telephone.
- Take a message.

179
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,451
It's Mr. Bullard's secretary.
She says it's important.

180
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,025
- How's the density?
- Building up fine.

181
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,461
Yes, Erica?

182
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,130
Well, there must be some mistake.

183
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,138
Today is the day we test
the new molding process.

184
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,764
Are you sure he wants me there?

185
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,935
Well, the wire says "executive
committee," Mr. Walling.

186
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,377
Well, can't you put it off?

187
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,382
Lt'd take months to reproduce this set-up.

188
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,749
Either it comes off on
schedule or not at all.

189
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,451
Yes. Yes, I'll be there.

190
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,720
What's the trouble?

191
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,354
Bullard wants me in a meeting at 6:00.

192
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,757
You're gonna have to
make this shot without me.

193
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,959
But how can we? Suppose something goes wrong.

194
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,026
- Nothing's gonna go wrong.
- You think he forgot?

195
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,628
Bullard never forgets.

196
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,299
- Then I don't understand why...
- Maybe we're not supposed to understand.

197
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,275
It's none of your business and none of mine.

198
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,743
If Bullard calls a meeting,
he's got a good reason.

199
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,337
He's a big man.

200
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,937
(BUZZING)

201
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,141
It's been quite a day, Mr. Caswell.

202
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,818
That's a lot of stock Wingate
sold for you in 45 minutes,

203
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,554
an active issue like Tredway.

204
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,753
- Where's that elevator?
- Relax, Mr. Caswell.

205
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,126
You said it yourself.

206
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,132
You sold 3,700 shares
of stock you haven't got,

207
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,964
and you'll be covering it
Monday morning at 10 points less.

208
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,731
Why, that's a real killing.

209
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,001
So, what have you got to worry
about? You're in good shape.

210
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:06,534
Unless, maybe the man under
the blanket ain't Avery Bullard.

211
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,684
Julius...

212
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,182
(WHISPERING) No, no.

213
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,828
It was Bullard. I saw him. He was dead.

214
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,996
You saw him, too, Julius.

215
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,233
I'm an old man, Mr. Caswell.

216
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,401
My eyes don't see easy money so good anymore.

217
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,536
But I take your word for it.

218
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,285
- Have you got the late finals yet?
- Any minute now.

219
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,195
Can I drive you someplace?

220
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,965
It was right there.

221
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,937
Enjoy your weekend, Mr. Caswell.

222
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,977
- Late finals?
- Yep.

223
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,980
<i>- The Journal, Post and The Telly.
- After I count them.</i>

224
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,312
Oh, come on, come on.

225
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,579
Taxi!

226
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,317
- Stork Club.
- Right.

227
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,231
Hey, don't you want your change?

228
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,466
(PIANO PLAYING)

229
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,172
- Be with you in a minute.
- I thought you said 5:00.

230
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,215
Will you give me the
Beekman Downtown hospital?

231
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,149
Certainly, Mr. Caswell.
Take booth three, please.

232
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,750
Is that "B" as in Benjamin?

233
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,228
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
been no one by that name

234
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,527
admitted here during the past 24 hours.

235
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,964
Perhaps it was some other hospital.

236
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,561
Don't tell me. It was Beekman
Downtown. I want you to...

237
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,833
Hello?

238
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,050
Thank you, Mr. Caswell.

239
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,053
I wanna make a
person-to-person call.

240
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,584
Mr. Avery Bullard,
B- U-L-L-A-R-D,

241
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,689
Tredway Corporation, Millburgh, Pennsylvania.

242
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,132
- Take it in booth four, please.
- Yes.

243
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,271
WOMAN: Operator, this is Plaza Three, 1940.

244
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,899
Mr. George Caswell calling Mr. Avery Bullard,

245
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,467
Tredway Corporation, Millburgh,
Pennsylvania, person-to-person.

246
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,036
That's right, time and charges, please.

247
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,350
You have a big nerve.

248
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,687
I told you I'd be right with
you. What's happening here?

249
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,124
I've been waiting a half hour.

250
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,627
Look, can't you see I'm
busy? Wait for me at the bar.

251
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,788
- Mr. Caswell?
- Yes?

252
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,297
How long do you think I'm
gonna put up with this?

253
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,457
- At the bar.
- Mr. Caswell?

254
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,728
- Yes?
- Mr. Bullard isn't in.

255
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,105
They say he's on his way and
he'll be there in about 20 minutes.

256
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,002
20 minutes?

257
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,810
- Wallet?
- None.

258
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,852
- Laundry marks?
- None.

259
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,614
Ought to be a federal law.

260
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,019
- What about the suit?
- No customer label.

261
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,820
- How about Andruzzi the tailor?
- Palm Beach police trying to locate him.

262
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,417
He closes for the summer.

263
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,291
We should have been tailors.

264
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,627
- Car keys?
- GM's checking on it.

265
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,394
All they know, it's a '53 Cadillac.

266
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,437
- Anything else?
- Monogram on shirt, "AB."

267
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,631
Cuff links engraved, "AB."

268
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,609
(SIGHING) Couple of predictions:

269
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,977
One, it turns out to be a
guy with the initials "AB,"

270
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,379
two, 6:00, I go home.

271
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,475
"I'm on the green in two. How much?"

272
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,611
"300 to 1,000." "You're on," he says.

273
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,450
So, I took my seven iron, I waded...

274
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,457
It's no good, you're going too fast.
What are you trying to do, carbonize it?

275
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,617
Attaboy, Don, give it to him.

276
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,160
McDONALD: Give me the checkpoints
on the time-temperature curve.

277
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,390
- So, what happened?
- What happened?

278
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,400
It took me four to get out of the
rough, and two more to get on the green.

279
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,594
You lost the 300, huh?

280
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,638
Yes, but I got his French
Provincial order for the whole year.

281
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,766
Twenty-eight stores,
135,000 bucks on the line.

282
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,470
That bet convinced Milton Overfelder

283
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,480
that I was the one guy in St. Louis he
beat that week who was really trying.

284
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,845
- McDONALD: Right.
- Were you?

285
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,781
Next time you play Fresh
Meadows in St. Louis,

286
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,117
let me see you hook a brassie
shot in back of that tree.

287
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,117
McDONALD: Bill, those RF
temperatures have to be uniform

288
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,924
over the entire surface, you know that.

289
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,365
- Walt, Jesse, Fred.
- Hello.

290
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,924
Do you know what this meeting is all about?

291
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,936
McDONALD: All right,
give me the figures again.

292
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,869
Didn't Fred tell you?

293
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,077
Well, I'm sorry, Fred. I
assumed Mr. Bullard spoke to you.

294
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,411
I don't know. See that the lines are
balanced. You know it's something.

295
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,645
- Everything going all right, Don?
- Everything's going fine.

296
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,678
Shall I start tearing up my
material rejection charts right now?

297
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,883
You can start to reexamine them.

298
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,353
How about that, Jesse? What's
production got to say about that?

299
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,831
All I'm thinking about right now
is a mess of soft-shelled crabs

300
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,199
fresh out of Chesapeake Bay.

301
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,760
We're rooting for you, Don.

302
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,135
I hope this thing doesn't string out.

303
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,835
I got a 7:00 date with a DC-6,
and I'd sure hate to stand her up.

304
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,276
Taking Mrs. Dudley along, Walt?

305
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,748
Not this time. I'll be too busy
romancing the chain and mail-order boys.

306
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,308
You're ready for some
pressure on prices, of course.

Dealer stocks are up again.

308
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,413
I assume you've figured how far you can cut.

309
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:56,427
Well, no, I thought I'd
work that out on the plane.

310
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,524
Like this?

311
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,697
You'll find a volume and price
chart there for each major item.

312
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,930
Where the curves intersect,
that's your relative net profit.

313
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,632
Maybe you ought to go to Chicago
and try pushing the K-F line, Shaw.

314
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,973
See how far you get with the boys
with your kind of intersecting curves.

Mr. Bullard must've missed the 5:49.

317
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,595
Eddie just called from the
station. He'll wait for the 6:10.

318

Well, I'm sure none of us
minds waiting, Miss Martin.

you for a moment, please?

McDONALD: Pike Street, please.

322
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,308
Julia Tredway is here.

323
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,547
- Where is she?
- In Mr. Bullard's office.

324
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,613
She insisted on waiting.

325
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,429
Uh... Better let me know when
Mr. Bullard's on the way up.

326
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,929
Yes, sir.

327

Julia.

328
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,576
Nice to see you.

329
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,281
- Miss Martin says he hasn't come back yet.
- That's right.

330
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,615
I know I shouldn't be here.
Mr. Bullard doesn't like it.

331
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,354
I... I had to talk to him, Mr. Alderson.

332
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,421
- Perhaps I can help you.
- Well, it's rather important.

333
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,933
I do think it best if I
discuss it with Mr. Bullard.

334
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,335
He'll be pretty busy when he gets here.
Why don't you call him later, Julia?

335
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,874
It's about my stock, Mr. Alderson,

336
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,000
my Tredway stock.

337
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,409
You're thinking of disposing of it?

338
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,279
- That's why I wanted to see Mr. Bullard.
- Naturally.

339
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,145
- Am I really as tiresome as all that?
- Julia, I didn't say...

340
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,154
That I've come here to threaten Avery again?

341
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,417
To play on his fear that he
might lose control of the company

342
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,719
if I did sell my stock?

343
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,023
No. No, Mr. Alderson, you didn't say it.

344
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,188
Just as you didn't say that
this is the only way I had

345
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,665
- to make him pay any attention to me.
- Oh, Julia.

346
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,860
I'm sorry.

How does he do it to us?

349
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,734
Your devotion, my imagination.

350
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,675
It does take imagination, you know,
to think up reasons for coming here,

351
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,644
because he won't come to me anymore.

352
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,585
I had a phone call a while ago, a rather
strange call from someone in New York.

353
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,992
This man said he had information
that was highly unfavorable

354
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,963
to the future prospects
of the Tredway Corporation.

355
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,593
What's this man's name, Julia,
and what's the information?

356
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,366
I asked him that, but he said it
came from a confidential source.

357
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,703
Oh, yes, of course.

358
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:00,211
Well, if I were you, I'd
ignore rumors like that.

359
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,303
When you see our earnings
report, you'll realize

360
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,839
how senseless such
mysterious phone calls are.

361
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:10,043
Then I wonder why Mr. Caswell
was so insistent that I sell.

362
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,413
George Caswell?

363
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,220
Yes, he said I ought to
sell now and buy back later.

364
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,489
- When did you say he phoned?
- About 20 minutes ago.

365
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,689
But Caswell is one of our directors.

366
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,460
All he would tell me was
that he had a customer,

367
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,364
who didn't want his name known,

368
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,303
who is willing to buy 3,700 shares
of Tredway at today's closing price.

369
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,862
3,700 shares?

370
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,135
Provided I would give
him an immediate decision.

371
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,734
He said it would have to be a private sale.

372
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,406
Miss Martin, will you come in, please?

373
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,743
Mr. Bullard wouldn't
want me to sell, would he?

374
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,548
You know that, Julia. You've always known it.

375
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:46,614
But you never let a simple thing like
gratitude stand in your way, do you?

(DOOR OPENS)

00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,091
Before Mr. Bullard goes into
the meeting, I want to see him.

378
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,927
- Well, yes, Mr. Alderson, but I'm afraid...
- What is it?

379
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,762
I just had another call
from Eddie at the station.

380
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,200
Mr. Bullard wasn't on the 6:10 either.

381
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,704
I called the Waldorf in New
York. He hasn't checked out.

382
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,364
- Have you told the others?
- Why, no, I...

383
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,136
Let me do it then.

384
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,176
You... You do understand,
don't you, Mr. Alderson?

385
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,772
- Hmm?
- The reason I wanted to see Avery.

386
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,147
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,709
I did want to make sure I didn't
say the wrong thing to Mr. Caswell.

388
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,880
You see, I promised to
phone him back by 6:00.

389
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,321
Or don't you think I should phone him...

390
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,951
Do as you wish, Julia. You
can use the phone right there.

391
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,153
But...

392
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,256
Oh...

393
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,522
But it would end all this, wouldn't it?

394
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,898
If I did sell once and for all.

395
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,333
It would end a lot of things.

- I'll see you Monday, Fred.
- Was that Mr. Bullard on the phone?

No. Give anybody a lift? Don?

399

- I'm going back to the plant...
- I guess I can just about make it.

400

- I'll run you out to the airport.
- No, that's all right, I'll get a cab.

- George? No, why?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing special.

in touch with you this evening,

would you ask him to call me? I'll be home.

<i>All aboard, please.</i>

458
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,693
- Good night, Mr. Walling.
- Good night, Bill.

459
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,168
Good night.

460
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,404
(PHONE RINGING)

461
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,066
Forget it.

462
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,633
If only we hadn't come so close.

463
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,271
Why didn't I give it all we
had? That might have done it.

464
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,974
Stop knocking yourself out, Bill.

465
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,416
I was afraid to take the gamble,
blow all the mixture on one shot.

466
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,717
It wasn't your gamble to
take. I should've been there.

467
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,885
- Hi, dear.
- Hi.

468
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,589
- Hello, Bill.
- Good evening, Mrs. Walling.

469
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,221
There's room for one more.

470
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,823
I've got my car, thanks. See you tomorrow?

471
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,667
- Not unless you're out at the ballpark.
- I almost forgot.

472
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,933
Good night, Bill, and stop
blaming yourself, will you?

473
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,531
I'll try.

474
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,344
- Darling, I could cry.
- Don't.

475
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,440
You were so sure this time. What went wrong?

476
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,248
I don't know, I wasn't there.
Bullard called a meeting.

477
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,849
How's Mike?

478
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:59,420
Oh, he's nervous as a pup over the game.
I had to chase him out to play next door.

479
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,521
This late?

480
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:04,329
Well, sure, I had to do something to
get his mind off it or he'd never sleep.

481
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,530
- He'll be okay when he steps to the mound.
- Yes.

482
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,572
- What was it for, Don?
- What was what for?

483
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,340
Bullard's meeting.

484
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,446
He never showed up.

485
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,279
If I'd had the new equipment I asked for,

486
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,252
nothing would've gone wrong tonight,
whether I'd been there or not.

487
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,515
Oh, Don.

488
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,080
I needed equipment, I didn't
get it. Shaw didn't approve.

489
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,524
But who listened to Shaw?
Who canceled the order?

490
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,822
He doesn't understand.

491
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,829
Nobody's claiming that a new molding process

492
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,195
is going to revolutionize the industry,

493
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:39,259
it's just one attempt in a hundred
to make one improvement in a hundred.

494
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,898
"Lmprove the profits but never the
product," that's Shaw's philosophy.

495
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,841
To him, the whole company
is just a curve on a chart.

496
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,710
And to you it's always somebody
else, never Avery Bullard.

497
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,806
Oh, darling, why can't you face it?

498
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,751
The dream is dead.
Bullard made you a promise.

499
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,120
He said, "Plan what you want, design
what you want. Develop new ideas.

500
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,749
"We need you, boy."

501
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:05,387
Sure, he needed you, and
it was good, a fine dream,

502
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,023
but it's over with, done, finished.

503
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,933
- I tell you, it's Shaw.
- And it's Bullard who listens to him.

504
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,370
Oh, he's changed, Don, and
you're dying a slow death here

505
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
because you refuse to admit the truth,

506
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,740
the truth about Bullard.

507
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,144
I just don't know how long
you can go on this way.

508
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,249
I'll walk.

509
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,240
He's out early. The test at
the plant must have failed.

510
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,442
You don't sound disappointed.

511
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,610
- Should I?
- Your plant.

512
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:08,091
Every brick, every machine, every
inch of every production line.

513
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,391
And I didn't need the boy wonders
and slide-rule experts to show me how.

514
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:15,990
You really think you'll be able
to say goodbye to it, Jesse?

515
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:20,231
I would've told Bullard tonight,
but he didn't get back from New York.

516
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,795
Monday.

517
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,775
Remember when you used to
bring him home to dinner?

518
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:28,243
The two of you would sit
up half the night talking.

519
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,110
A long time ago.

520
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,511
Sure that isn't what's bothering you?

- You know something?
- What?

533
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:33,668
Mr. Walling, there's a man on the

(SIGHS)

535

No. Not now, no statement.

536
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,694
It's Bullard. He's dead.

537

Oh, no.

538
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,871
Dead.

539
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,453
We were hating him, and all the
time he was lying there dead.

540
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,182
Darling, don't.

541
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,187
He was a great man.

542
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,597

Is there any way I can reach him?

550
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,541
- Now, what about Miss Tredway?
- Getting her right now.

551
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:49,518
Be careful what you write about
her and Bullard. That's libel.

There's nothing you can do for him
now. You've got to think of yourself.

566
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:04,726
You worked for it, Fred, 29
years of it. You've earned it.

You have a right, and so have I.

Oh, Edith, Edith, please.

571
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,900
We've waited a long time.

get over to the Tower.

577

Yes, that's right.

578

MAN: (WHISPERING) Miss Martin...

582
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,892
If there's anything more you
need to fill out your story,

583
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,486
- just get in touch with Lee Ormand here.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Shaw.

584
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,996
Fred, Don, it's good you came down.

585
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,397
Perhaps you can make some suggestions here.

586
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,935
I've roughed out a plan with
Lee for handling the news,

587
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,369
but it's possible we missed something.

588
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,906
First of all, I've taken
the liberty of ordering

589
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,408
the immediate release of the earnings report.

590
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,535
I didn't authorize that.

591
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,240
Well, I'm sure you'd agree that
it's not only wise, but necessary.

592
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,474
Why?

593
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,777
Served up cold, the news
of Mr. Bullard's death

594
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,684
would hit Tredway's stock
pretty hard at Monday's opening.

595
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,052
By countering with the good
news of our increased earnings,

596
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,715
we'll not only check the decline,

597
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,419
but send Tredway stock up quite handsomely.

598
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,327
It's not a bad way to start
a new management, is it?

599
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,628
<i>And there'll be a special release for the
Times, Tribune and Wall Street Journal,</i>

600
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,191
and a follow-up for the
evening and Sunday papers.

601
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,103
The same basic story, but
with a stronger company slant,

602
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:58,664
will be sent to the trades and the
morning papers in our factory cities.

603
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,234
<i>Lee will telephone the business
editors of Time and Newsweek.</i>

604
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,008
That pretty much takes care of the first
- priority stuff.

605
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,106
Anything I've missed?

606
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,619
I'll follow through on
everything, Mr. Shaw. Gentlemen.

607
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:17,891
I hope Ormand there isn't handling
this like some publicity story.

608
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,523
I'm quite confident we can rely
on his good taste and judgment.

609
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,294
Don't you think so, Don?

610
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,301
In a situation like this,
you can't be too careful.

611
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,236
That's why I got Ormand down here right away.

612
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,796
As a matter of fact, I
almost didn't call him.

613
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:33,139
I was sure somebody must've
thought of it before I did.

614
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,201
Apparently, no one did.

615
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,511
I have made all the other arrangements.

616
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,845
The funeral will be Monday
at 4:30, and I've asked...

617
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,248
No, it won't!

618
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,651
The funeral will be at 2:00.

619
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,783
- At St. Martin's?
- At St. Martin's, yes.

620
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,059
Perhaps I was misinformed.

621
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,895
When I checked the church calendar,
I found a wedding scheduled for 2:00.

622
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,798
Something can be done about the church.

623
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,928
There's another point I had in mind.

624
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,667
The highest proportion
of older factory workers,

625
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,608
those who might want to attend the funeral,
are found in the 7:00 to 3:00 shift.

626
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,578
What difference does it make? The
factories will be closed anyway.

627
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,239
- For the day?
- Yes, for the day.

628
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,977
I suppose all you're thinking
of is the money it'll cost.

629
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,781
Not as a first consideration,
but I did happen to recall

630
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,789
Mr. Bullard pointing out at
the time of Fitzgerald's death

631
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:24,920
that a paid holiday would represent a loss
to the company of approximately $87,000.

632
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,089
And that figure, of course,
was before the last wage raise.

633
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:31,100
It'd be somewhat more at the current rates.

634
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,693
There's another consideration, minor perhaps,

635
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,672
but it did seem worth taking into account.

636
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,175
The 4:30 time would make it more convenient

637
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,972
- to close our showroom...
- Convenient!

638
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,809
...during the funeral.
- That's always been your attitude, Shaw.

639
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,611
To make everything as convenient
as possible for yourself.

640
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,653
Even Mr. Bullard's death has
to fit into one of your charts.

641
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,087
I don't rate that, Alderson.
I don't rate that at all.

642
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,524
I have only one interest,
the good of this company.

643
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:07,929
Don.

644
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,138
Tell me, am I wrong, or did the old
boy seem a little shaky just then?

645
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,677
- I know he hasn't been well.
- Don't you think he has a right to be?

646
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,542
You know he was closer to
Bullard than the rest of us.

647
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,172
Don, I was careful to take that into account.

648
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,843
Surely you saw there was every reason
for me to be annoyed at his attitude,

649
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,044
and so I did my best not to show it.

650
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,383
- Why don't we just skip it?
- Don,

651
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,821
I wish you wouldn't feel that way.

652
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,654
You particularly.

653
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,557
Why me particularly?

654
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,829
Well, after all, we know things haven't
been run too perfectly around here.

655
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,733
That's one of the reasons I've often
wished we could work more closely together.

656
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:42,330
And frankly, I'd hoped
that now I could, well,

657
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,233
count on your support.

658
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,075
I've always felt that you and I
shared a certain community of interest.

659
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,014
In your own words, Shaw, I have
only one interest around here,

660
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,118
the good of this company.

661

663
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,616
Erica.

664
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,219
I'm sorry.

665
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,396
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Now, don't be.

666
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,593
Don't ever be sorry for feeling
the way you do about him.

667
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,472
Fred?

668
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,207
Sorry, Don. Made a mess of it.

669
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,809
Oh, look, Fred, nobody expected...

670
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,982
You were disappointed in me,
I was disappointed in myself.

671
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,953
I thought I could do it, but I can't.

672
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,860
Look, nothing's settled. Just
because Shaw took advantage of...

673
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,058
Oh, it wasn't Shaw. It wasn't Shaw at all.

674
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,761
That was my mistake,
thinking I was fighting him.

675
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,464
I was ready for him, could've handled him.

676
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,406
- That wasn't it.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

677
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,672
It was Avery Bullard I was
fighting. Can't you see that?

678
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,772
I could've coped with Shaw. It's
easy to fight somebody you hate.

679
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,545
But I couldn't fight
Avery Bullard. Never could.

680
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,248
Now, look, Fred, you're tired
and upset. We're all upset.

681
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,018
- It's no use, Don.
- Fred, listen to me!

682
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,254
Avery Bullard doesn't
want me to be president.

683
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,853
He never wanted me to be
anything but what I am,

684
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,091
a number-two man, never more, never less.

685
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,361
- I don't believe that.
- Oh, no, Don, it's true.

686
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,996
If it weren't, he would've made me
executive vice-president months ago.

687
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,870
- He didn't want me.
- Then who did he want?

688
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,705
Fred, I assume you know
where to reach Jesse Grimm.

689
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,769
Yes.

690
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,146
When you do, better make sure he
knows about the special meeting

691
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:41,582
of the board tomorrow at 6:00.

692
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,711
When was that decided?

693
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,448
I'm sure we all agree, the sooner the better.

694
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,285
Wires have gone out to everybody.

695
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,089
I'll double check with Walt
Dudley. Good night, gentlemen.

696
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,596
One thing I can tell you.

697
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,728
It's not going to be him.

698
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,102
Who's gonna stop him?

699
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,411
If it was five years from
now, I can tell you who could.

700
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,713
Good evening, Miss Bardeman.

701
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,657
- Mr. Shaw...
- I want to speak to Mr. Dudley.

702
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,491
Oh, you mean, you want to
know where to reach him?

703
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:29,088
Well, he's staying at the Blackstone
in Chicago. I thought you knew.

704
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,465
I see. I've got to talk to him right away.

705
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,894
Would you be good enough to
let me use your telephone?

706
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,906

Mr. Shaw!

Uh... I've got to talk to
you for a minute, Walter.

713
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,354
Which chart did you find this one on, Shaw?

714
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,760
Well, is that all you're gonna say to him?

715
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,368
Just who do you think you
are coming in here like this?

716
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,529
Eva, wait a minute.

717
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,697
This is my apartment. Why
don't you tell him to get out?

718
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,866
- Eva.
- All right, what are you waiting for?

719
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,375
Don't you want to get back to your Dictaphone

720
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,968
and make out your special
report to the president?

Apparently, you two haven't
had the radio on tonight.

722
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,180
He's dead.

723
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,414
Bullard? Dead?

724
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,648
You're lying.

725
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:31,491
He had a stroke in New York this afternoon.
They identified the body this evening.

726
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,195
The old man.

727
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,728
Dead. I don't believe it.

728
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,965
The company will carry on
with a minimum of confusion.

729
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,563
You can catch the 11:00 plane to Chicago.

730
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,767
Get together with your men
there in the morning, brief them,

- Meeting?

elect a new president.

I'll want to talk to you before then.

And while you're in Chicago, I'd
rather you didn't take any calls.

Naturally, Sylvia won't hear about this.

Look, Loren, this is not what you think.

740

I come here because... Well, I don't know.

Well, it's home. I guess
it's what keeps me going.

761
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:08,417
I'll be home tomorrow on the afternoon plane.

762
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,108
Eva.

763
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,617
Eva, you all right?

764
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,924
You want me to call you from Chicago?

765
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,259
(DOOR CLOSES)

766
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,864
Don, you'll be a wreck.

767
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,027
I'll quit in a few minutes.

768
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,904
- Fred stay long?
- Mmm, long enough.

769
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,470
Oh, I like that.

770
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,205
- Did he change
his mind? - Mmm-mmm.

771
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,576
It's gonna be Jesse Grimm.

772
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,245
Fred's gonna get to him
first thing in the morning.

773
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,948
You sound so positive.

774
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,547
Don't the stockholders have anything to say?

775
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:25,322
The stockholders had their say
when they elected the board.

776
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:29,093
Seven directors will vote,
four votes will elect.

777
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:33,998
Jesse Grimm will have his own vote,
mine, Fred's and Walt Dudley's.

778
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,736
I think that Dudley's about as
fed up with Shaw as the rest of us.

779
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,800
Well, what's this question
mark after Julia Tredway's name?

780
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,435
Hmm? Just that.

781
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,477
First her father, now Bullard.

782
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,682
Who knows what she thinks about the company.

783
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:52,313
Anyway, she's never even shown up at
a board meeting. Bullard had her proxy.

784
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,586
Then that means Shaw has only
himself and George Caswell?

785
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,253
Who helped him come into the company.

786
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,422
Well, if it's all settled,
why are you still up?

787
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:09,502
Don, maybe this is the time
for you to leave Tredway.

788
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,629
No.

789
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,905
But you could do what you always
wanted to do, be on your own,

790
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,811
design what you want, build what you want.

791
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:22,745
If it hadn't been for this room the
past few months, you couldn't have lived.

792
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:29,448
I've got to make sure that it
can't be done right here at Tredway

793
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,586
the way that Bullard
made me believe it could.

794
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:38,130
You don't walk away from a thing like
that, not till you know it's hopeless.

795
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,801
Well, if you couldn't do it under Bullard,

796
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,737
how do you expect to do it with
Jesse Grimm running the company?

797
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:46,242
- Jesse's a fine production man.
- You told me he lives in the past.

798
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:50,473
- But he's our best chance to stop Shaw.
- Is that all that matters?

799
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:59,083
Well, there's nothing we can do
about it this late at night, is there?

800
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,924
Fred wanted me to try for the presidency.

801
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:05,688
When?

802
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:09,064
Earlier tonight, back at the Tower.

803
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,162
What did you say?

804
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,364
I told him to forget it.

805
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,269
I'm not gonna die young
at the top of the Tower,

806
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,069
worrying about bond issues
and stockholders' meetings.

807
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,906
That's not why I came here,
that's not what I'm working for.

808
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,378
I'm a designer, not a politician.

809
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,840
I think.

810
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,275
I think, too.

811
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,290
Well, anyway, I just wanted you to know

812
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,555
that you might have been
the president's wife.

813
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,392
Come to bed, Mr. Ex-president.

814
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,432
Yes, that's right.

815
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:51,804
And when you get that call through,
tell the garage to send my car over.

816
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,866
Yes. Yes.

817
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,435
Where are we driving to now?

818
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,743
We're driving no place.
I'm going to Millburgh.

819
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,442
But you promised to take me to the track.

820
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,144
Did I know about this?

821
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,777
What about this?

822
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,981
You're a director of the company, aren't you?

823
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,923
It says here, "Tredway's increased earnings

824
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,789
- "for the first quarter..."
- Do me a favor, will you?

825
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:11,885
Read the funnies.

826
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,624
<i>There aren't any in the
Times. Don't you know that?</i>

827
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,757
Then read "Situations
Wanted." You may need one.

828
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,391
(PHONE RINGING)

829
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,071
Yes? Okay, put Mr. Shaw on.

830
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,139
Yes. Loren? George Caswell.

831
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,607
Huh? Yes, terrible.

832
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,381
Yes, I was shocked.

833
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,845
Now, look, Loren...

834
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,847
I certainly have seen it.
I've got it right here.

835
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:40,913
Remarkable showing.

836
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:44,254
Now, look, Loren, I'll tell you why I called.

837
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,488
Yes, I've got the wire about the meeting,

838
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,327
but it's very important
that I see you before then.

839
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,459
Right. I'll be expecting you.

840
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,042
- Oh, did you send for Miss Martin?
- She's outside.

841
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,168
What about the call to Miss Tredway?

842
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:02,768
Mr. Shaw, I checked with
the telephone company,

843
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,838
and they said it isn't just a busy
signal, her receiver's off the hook.

844
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:09,010
- Keep trying. Send Miss Martin in.
- Yes, sir.

845
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,413
Will you go in, please, Miss Martin?

846
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,982
Would you close the door?

847
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,187
- Sit down, please.
- That's all right, Mr. Shaw.

848
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:22,532
Well, first,

849
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,026
I want you to know, Miss Martin,
that even though there will be certain

850
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:30,436
inevitable changes within the organization,
you have nothing to worry about.

851
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,840
Your closeness to Mr. Bullard will
naturally be of considerable aid to us

852
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,777
in handling those matters of personal policy

853
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:40,577
which was so vital in Mr.
Bullard's running of the company.

854
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:46,279
Well, what I mean, Miss Martin, is that
it would be most helpful at this time

855
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,018
if I could be sure there were no facts,

856
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,094
no dark areas of misunderstanding in
Mr. Bullard's personal relationships

857
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,893
that could possibly hurt Tredway Corporation.

858
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,400
What are you trying to say, Mr. Shaw?

859
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,371
I want you to tell me everything you know

860
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,738
about Mr. Bullard's
relationship with Julia Tredway.

861
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:11,945
Mr. Bullard saved the company after
the death of Miss Tredway's father.

862
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,546
He helped her regain her
health when she broke down.

863
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,644
They became good friends.

864
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,581
- Go on.
- Those are the facts, Mr. Shaw.

865
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,852
- But surely...
- All the facts.

866
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,254
I don't think you quite understand
the seriousness of all this.

867
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,230
Perhaps I do, Mr. Shaw.

868
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,293
That will be all.

869
00:54:47,514 --> 00:54:48,572
Strike three!

870
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:49,910
And Philly goes down swinging.

871
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:51,780
Pretty sharp there today, Lopat.

872
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:55,583
Oh, not Lopat. He's a
lefty. I'm Allie Reynolds.

873
00:54:55,922 --> 00:54:58,948
All right, Allie, just be sure
you do as well against the Eagles.

874
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:00,925
- Who's up?
- Eddie Joost.

875
00:55:04,064 --> 00:55:06,259
- Dad?
- Yeah, yeah.

876
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:10,527
- Low.
- Oh, that looked good to me!

877

(PHONE RINGING)

878
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:12,727
Now, hold it.

879
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,203
Gee whiz, Mom will get it.

880
00:55:15,275 --> 00:55:16,572
- Just a minute.
- Is that Alderson?

881
00:55:16,643 --> 00:55:18,838
- It's Bill down at the plant.
- Oh.

882
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:20,678
Hello, Bill.

883
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:23,240
Yeah. Yeah.

884
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:25,613
You what?

885
00:55:26,486 --> 00:55:28,920
Now, wait a minute. Give me that again.

886
00:55:29,856 --> 00:55:31,380
Are you sure?

887
00:55:32,425 --> 00:55:34,154
Well, of course that's it, it's got to be.

888
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:35,660
Now, look, stay where you
are. Don't touch a thing.

889
00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:37,458
I'll be right down.

890
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,265
How do you like that? We had it all the time.

891
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,391
Oh, good.

892
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:45,131
Now, if we can just duplicate the
same thing at the correct pressure.

893
00:55:45,205 --> 00:55:47,070
- Pick me up at the plant before the game.
- Pop, you coming?

894
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,199
Change in the lineup,
Mike. I'll see you later.

895
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:51,506
Oh, it's a gyp. I would
have struck Joost out.

896

- How do you feel, baby?
- Okay, I guess.

897
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,547
- Perspiring?
- No.

898
00:55:55,615 --> 00:55:58,311
Well, then, come on. Let's go to work.

899
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:00,679
Now, none of that soft stuff.

900
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:02,483
Well, Mom, I don't wanna hurt you.

901

Never mind Mom, you just burn them in.

- Yup.

- Was Mr. Bullard a nice man?
- Yes, he was.

over and we'll be nowhere again.

- What do you say?
- I'm with you.

- Right.

reset the platins and get rolling?

920
00:56:57,043 --> 00:56:58,101
Sorry, Mr. Walling.

921
00:56:58,178 --> 00:57:01,045
- Not this minute. I mean after the whistle.
- Can't do it.

production until further notice.

Okay, knock off. That's all for today.

927

When do you think we'll be
able to have another go at it?

928
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:30,841
Maybe never.

929
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:44,216
Hello, Fred. Any news yet?

930
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,281
He's still out on his boat.

931
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:47,417
Now, now, now, don't worry.

932
00:57:47,494 --> 00:57:51,362
I'll get to Jesse if I have to
send the coast guard after him.

933
00:57:52,298 --> 00:57:55,290
No, no need to. There's
nothing for you to do.

934
00:57:56,836 --> 00:58:01,705
Well, I checked with Walt's secretary,
and he's coming in on the afternoon plane.

935
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:04,636
So, you go ahead. I'll
know where to reach you.

936
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:05,905
Right.

937
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:40,678
Where do we go from here, Mr. Walling?

938
00:58:41,548 --> 00:58:44,847
Four years since we've done
anything good like that.

939
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:48,910
This is what we make now, the K-F line.

940
00:58:50,256 --> 00:58:51,723
Look at it.

941
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:54,453
I remember when Mr. Bullard
used to come down here,

942
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:56,222
see stuff not half as bad as this,

943
00:58:56,296 --> 00:58:58,696
and just pick it up and
smash it against the wall.

944
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:01,529
"Not good enough," he used
to yell. "Not good enough!"

945
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:03,157
(SCOFFS)

946
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:04,634
Not good enough.

947
00:59:05,939 --> 00:59:08,032
Why did he allow it, Mr. Walling?

948
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:10,099
What happened to him?

949
00:59:10,777 --> 00:59:12,677
What's gonna happen to us?

950
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:27,152
- Hello, Mr. Walling.
- Hello, Tom.

951
00:59:28,128 --> 00:59:29,595
Hello, Mr. Walling.

952
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:30,856
Mr. Walling?

953
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:32,420
Yes, Liz?

954
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:37,029
- Everything's going to be all right, isn't it?
- Don't you worry about a thing.

955
00:59:37,103 --> 00:59:39,037
But you weren't here in '33.

956
00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:42,900
You don't know how it was in
Millburgh when Tredway shut down.

957
00:59:42,976 --> 00:59:45,308
Now, nobody's gonna shut
down anything around here.

958
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:47,869
Mr. Bullard brought us a long way from that.

959
01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:04,555
The trouble with us, George, is
we understand each other too well.

960
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:08,867
I know that all this talk of
yours about the earnings report

961
01:00:08,935 --> 01:00:10,596
is part of a campaign to
put me on the defensive

962
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,069
because you want something.

963
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:14,868
You know that whatever it
is, you'll probably get it.

964
01:00:15,275 --> 01:00:18,506
So, why don't you just save
time and get to the point?

965
01:00:18,578 --> 01:00:22,674
There are 50,000 shares of
unissued Tredway common stock

966
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:24,376
in the company reserve.

967
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:27,114
I want you to arrange that

968
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,646
4,000 shares of that stock
are sold to me immediately,

969
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:32,488
at yesterday's closing price.

970
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,926
- How do you expect me to do that?
- Oh, there are ways. You'll find one.

971
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:40,365
- Why 4,000 shares, George?
- I have my reasons.

972
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:42,896
I mean, why the extra 300?

973
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,367
(CHUCKLING) What are you talking about?

974
01:00:52,345 --> 01:00:55,837
Yesterday afternoon, between 2:51 and 3:29,

975
01:00:55,915 --> 01:00:57,610
starting approximately six minutes

976
01:00:57,684 --> 01:01:01,313
after Avery Bullard dropped
dead beneath your office window,

977
01:01:01,387 --> 01:01:02,752
Mr. Philip Wingate

978
01:01:03,523 --> 01:01:08,085
sold 3,700 shares of
Tredway common stock, short.

979
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:11,763
- Wingate told you?
- No.

980
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:15,326
- How did you know?
- As you said, there are ways.

981
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:19,403
I had a sure thing.

982
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,732
If you hadn't released
that earnings report...

983
01:01:25,879 --> 01:01:27,904
You knew, is that why you did it?

984
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:33,214
Now... Now, look, Loren.

985
01:01:33,653 --> 01:01:36,884
I can't go into the open market Monday
morning and cover that short sale.

986
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:40,790
I have no liquid assets, not a
thing I can lay my hands on. I...

987
01:01:41,561 --> 01:01:43,256
You know the way I live.

988
01:01:45,899 --> 01:01:47,457
I'll be wiped out inside of an hour.

Mr. Shaw, have you seen Mr. Alderson around?

991
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:53,064
He hasn't been in today.

992
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:54,163
Well, I wonder...

993
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,605
- Perhaps I better...
- What is it, Miss Clark?

994
01:01:55,675 --> 01:01:57,905
There's a call for him. I have
a feeling it may be urgent.

995
01:01:57,977 --> 01:01:59,706
- Who is it?
- Miss Tredway.

996
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:04,346
- Have it transferred in here.
- Yes, sir.

No, Mr. Alderson isn't in right
now. Perhaps I can help you.

Yes.

I see.

1003
01:02:25,438 --> 01:02:28,168
Why, certainly. As controller
of the company, I...

1004
01:02:28,641 --> 01:02:31,337
Yes, I believe I can
give you that information.

1005
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:33,506
By all means.

1006
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,545
In about an hour?

1007
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:38,240
I'll be waiting for you.

1008
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:40,218
Goodbye, Miss Tredway.

1009
01:02:42,488 --> 01:02:45,184
- Well, what's the answer?
- Hmm?

1010
01:02:45,258 --> 01:02:47,886
Are you gonna get that stock for me or not?

1011
01:02:47,961 --> 01:02:51,829
- Why should I?
- Because you want the presidency.

1012
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:54,425
Do I?

1013
01:02:54,968 --> 01:02:56,299
It's the only reason you joined this company.

1014
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:57,996
It's the kind of set-up
you've been dreaming about

1015
01:02:58,071 --> 01:03:02,440
ever since you came on the Street with
that night-school CPA in your hand.

1016
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:05,705
For years I've been working for
it and now I'm going to get it.

1017
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,549
- But not by larceny.
- And not without my vote.

1018
01:03:16,189 --> 01:03:17,747
You'll need four votes, Shaw.

1019
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:21,282
Without me, you don't stand
a chance and you know it.

1020
01:03:26,499 --> 01:03:29,229
You realize, of course, as
controller, my hands are tied.

1021
01:03:29,302 --> 01:03:31,270
Do a Houdini, untie them.

1022
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:32,836
But as president,

1023
01:03:33,773 --> 01:03:36,173
I'll be in a better position to help you.

1024
01:03:36,242 --> 01:03:39,075
Suppose I vote for you
and you don't come through.

1025
01:03:40,546 --> 01:03:42,878
The only chance you have
to get that stock, George,

1026
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,678
is if I become president.

1027
01:03:48,688 --> 01:03:52,180
Well, I guess I don't have
much choice then, do I?

1028
01:03:52,258 --> 01:03:55,159
That's right, I guess you don't.

And bring me the personal
file on George Caswell.

1033
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,979
You know, the SEC Committee
report on the Luckheim Case.

Well, I finally got Jesse on the
phone. He hadn't heard about Bullard.

1045
01:05:13,973 --> 01:05:16,874
I gave him the whole set-up and he said no.

1046
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:19,570
- What you mean, no?
- He won't take the presidency.

1047
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:21,977
He's going to retire.
Made up his mind weeks ago.

1048
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:25,142
Nothing I could say would
change it. You know Jesse.

1049
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,046
Yes, I know Jesse.

- Well, what for? It's all over.

1051

There's still a way.

1052
01:05:32,825 --> 01:05:35,385
- Now, look, Fred, I told you last night...
- Let me finish.

1053
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:38,689
Jesse feels the way we do about
Shaw, so we still have four votes:

and Walt's and maybe Julia's.

01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:43,267
- Four votes for what?
- For Dudley.

1056
01:05:43,336 --> 01:05:45,736
- Look, Fred...
- Walt's got a lot of standing, Don.

1057
01:05:45,805 --> 01:05:47,466
He's been on two government commissions,

1058
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,030
he's been president of the association,

1059

made institutional speeches

He knows how to keep people happy.

01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:06,634
- What for?
- Her vote.

1220
01:14:06,705 --> 01:14:08,935
- For Walt Dudley?
- No, for me.

1221
01:14:10,376 --> 01:14:13,903
Did you hear what I said?
I'm going for the presidency.

1222
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:17,804
- Yes, I heard you.
- Is that all you're gonna say?

1223
01:14:18,017 --> 01:14:21,646
- What would you like me to say?
- Well, a good word, a few cheers.

1224
01:14:22,488 --> 01:14:24,251
Do you really think you can get it?

1225
01:14:24,323 --> 01:14:26,518
- You got to try.
- Why?

1226
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:27,581
Why not?

1227
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:30,793
Well, for one thing, because I love you.

1228
01:14:31,063 --> 01:14:33,657
And I wouldn't enjoy seeing you
crack that handsome head of yours

1229
01:14:33,732 --> 01:14:36,030
against a stone wall
trying to do the impossible.

1230
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:37,932
Nothing's impossible.

1231
01:14:38,404 --> 01:14:41,737
- Bullard's line, not yours.
- Still true.

1232
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:47,469
Okay, I know what you're thinking,
but last night was years ago.

1233
01:14:47,546 --> 01:14:49,070
I've changed my mind.

1234
01:14:53,052 --> 01:14:55,020
Look at your face in the mirror.

1235
01:14:55,087 --> 01:14:56,918
- Look at your hands.
- It's because I'm in a hurry,

1236
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:58,616
and you're not helping one
bit, Mary. Now, will you...

1237
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:01,319
Five years now, I've
stood by and watched you.

1238
01:15:01,427 --> 01:15:03,987
Harassed, frustrated
and denied, and for what?

1239
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:06,330
To try to keep a dream alive.

1240
01:15:06,665 --> 01:15:07,757
I'm selfish, Don.

1241
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:10,461
I want the man I was in
love with and married.

1242
01:15:10,936 --> 01:15:12,699
I won't let you do this to yourself.

1243
01:15:12,771 --> 01:15:14,762
And I'm not gonna stand
by and let the company

1244
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,671
fall into the hands of
a weakling like Dudley,

1245
01:15:16,742 --> 01:15:18,437
or an adding machine like Shaw.

1246
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,910
There are too many lives involved.
The whole town is at stake.

1247
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,844
Tredway has got to be kept alive.

1248
01:15:22,915 --> 01:15:25,941
Avery Bullard's got to be kept
alive, isn't that what you mean?

1249
01:15:26,018 --> 01:15:28,316
You want to sit in his
chair and be his ghost.

1250
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:30,184
You're even beginning to sound like Bullard.

1251
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:31,813
Oh, let's not.

1252
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:34,884
Don.

1253
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:37,394
- Don...
- Hey, Pop!

1254
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:38,987
Later, Mike.

1255
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,169
Gee whiz. He didn't even
ask me who won the game.

1256
01:15:44,236 --> 01:15:46,067
Oh, don't worry, sweetie, he will.

1257
01:15:46,138 --> 01:15:47,662
(PHONE RINGING)

1258
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:53,433
Hello?

1259
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:55,710
No, he just left.

1260
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:57,146
Mary, this is very important.

1261
01:15:57,216 --> 01:15:59,776
I want you to call the
Tower, get hold of Don,

1262
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:02,616
and have him delay the
meeting until I get there.

1263
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:06,089
That's right. Tell him to hold up the voting.

1264
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:07,147
Right.

1265
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,423
You sure Mr. Grimm will
be coming through this way?

1266
01:16:13,499 --> 01:16:14,488
Yes.

1267
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:24,374
<i>WOMAN ON PHONE: Tredway
Corporation. Good afternoon.</i>

1268
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:28,268
<i>Hello?</i>

1269
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:52,164
Over there, please, Luigi.

1270
01:17:09,154 --> 01:17:11,622
- By the window, please.
- Yes, Miss Martin.

1271
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:18,323
Thanks, Luigi.

1272
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:26,536
Luigi, don't go in his office, please.

1273
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:49,623
- Erica, has Mr. Alderson arrived yet?
- I haven't seen him...

1274
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:53,256
- Well, did he call me? Any messages?
- Why, no, Mr. Walling.

1275
01:17:54,266 --> 01:17:57,497
- Is Miss Tredway here?
- Yes, she's in Mr. Bullard's office.

1276
01:17:57,569 --> 01:17:59,503
She left some of her
personal papers in his safe.

1277
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:01,562
- She insisted I open it for her.
- Oh.

1278
01:18:02,507 --> 01:18:03,667
Mr. Walling.

1279
01:18:04,843 --> 01:18:05,969
Is there...

1280
01:18:07,779 --> 01:18:09,576
Is there anything I can do?

1281
01:18:11,216 --> 01:18:12,478
Thanks, Erica.

1282
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:22,527
Miss Tredway, I'd like to
speak to you for a moment.

1283
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:29,432
I know how you feel.

1284
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:30,900
Then let me alone.

1285
01:18:31,103 --> 01:18:34,732
- I hate to bother you, but this is important.
- Important?

1286
01:18:34,806 --> 01:18:37,604
- It has to do with the company.
- The company.

1287
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:40,838
I don't want to hear another word about it.

1288
01:18:40,913 --> 01:18:43,643
I've said all I'm ever
going to say to Mr. Shaw.

1289
01:18:44,283 --> 01:18:45,272
Shaw?

1290
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,443
I've given him full instructions.

1291
01:18:47,753 --> 01:18:49,846
Miss Tredway, I don't want
you to think that I'm here...

1292
01:18:49,922 --> 01:18:51,184
To urge me not to sell out?

1293
01:18:51,256 --> 01:18:52,723
In another minute, Mr. Alderson will come in,

1294
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:54,918
also not to urge me not to sell out.

1295
01:18:54,993 --> 01:18:56,017
I don't know what you mean.

1296
01:18:56,094 --> 01:19:00,394
This, Mr. Walling! The
funeral pyre of nothing at all!

1297
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:04,400
Bon voyage, Julia.

1298
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:06,501
Sorry, you couldn't stay longer.

1299
01:19:06,571 --> 01:19:07,595
Miss Tredway, you mustn't let this...

1300
01:19:07,673 --> 01:19:11,541
Oh, no. No, you mustn't, Julia.
You mustn't be unreasonable.

1301
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:13,976
We wouldn't want that, would we?

1302
01:19:14,613 --> 01:19:18,140
There, there, my dear. You'll
be all right. That's a good girl.

1303
01:19:19,117 --> 01:19:21,813
You've got everything
in the world to live for:

1304
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:24,446
Money, brains, beauty.

1305
01:19:26,058 --> 01:19:28,424
So, you just sit here and wait.

1306
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:31,120
And if you wait long enough, say,

1307
01:19:31,863 --> 01:19:33,160
10 or 20 years,

1308
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:35,623
maybe something else will happen.

1309
01:19:37,035 --> 01:19:40,266
Because you know, Julia, no
matter how horrible things are,

1310
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:44,172
they can always get worse.

1311
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:50,409
Miss Tredway.

1312
01:19:51,717 --> 01:19:54,584
You said something about
instructions to Mr. Shaw.

1313
01:19:54,653 --> 01:19:56,120
Yes, Mr. Walling.

1314
01:19:56,188 --> 01:19:57,621
The holdings of Julia Tredway,

1315
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:01,523
39,500 shares of common stock
of the Tredway Corporation.

1316
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:04,093
There it is, there it was, and there it goes.

1317
01:20:04,162 --> 01:20:07,723
The liquidation will be prompt,
but swift. I quote Mr. Shaw.

1318
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:09,960
You're not going to throw your
stock onto the open market, are you?

1319
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:13,095
I don't know and I don't care. Mr.
Shaw will take care of everything.

1320
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:14,866
You can't do that! You're
selling out the company,

1321
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,500
Avery Bullard's company, your own father's.

1322
01:20:17,576 --> 01:20:20,943
What did I ever get out of it
but loneliness and sudden death?

1323
01:20:21,013 --> 01:20:23,345
What did I ever get out of them
but the sight of their backs?

1324
01:20:23,415 --> 01:20:24,575
Bullard gave you everything you have.

1325
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:26,139
There wouldn't be any stock
if it hadn't been for him.

1326
01:20:26,218 --> 01:20:27,344
You wouldn't be here at all.

1327
01:20:27,419 --> 01:20:31,378
I gave him 10 years of my life
and all my love! Isn't that enough?

1328
01:20:33,025 --> 01:20:36,324
Please, please, go away.

1329
01:20:39,998 --> 01:20:43,434
- Miss Tredway, at this meeting...
- I'm not interested.

1330
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:45,470
But surely you want to see us
elect a man who will stand for...

1331
01:20:45,537 --> 01:20:48,028
I told you, I don't care. It
won't make any difference to me.

1332
01:20:48,106 --> 01:20:49,971
Well, whether you care or
not, your vote will count.

1333
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:53,273
Mr. Shaw has my proxy.
Now, will you let me alone?

1334
01:20:54,212 --> 01:20:56,680
If you wanna stab a dead man,
why don't you do it yourself,

1335
01:20:56,748 --> 01:20:59,683
instead of having someone else do it for you?

1336
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:01,912
- Get out of here.
- Go on, sell out!

1337
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,615
Smash everything he lived for!
That's what you wanna do, isn't it?

1338
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:06,987
Pay him back for loving the
company more than he could love you?

1339
01:21:07,059 --> 01:21:09,027
Will you get out of here?

1340
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:14,598

- Don't worry, they'll be here.

1346
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:24,432
Oh, hello.

1347
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:29,296
How about a little three-handed gin?

1348
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:34,972
Personally, I prefer to have a little
vermouth-played martini instead.

1349
01:22:38,016 --> 01:22:41,543
A must for the early bird
who fails to catch the worm,

1350
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:46,057
3,700 wriggling worms.

1351
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:56,027
Evening, everyone.

1352
01:22:57,135 --> 01:22:59,831
- Everything all right, George?
- Oh, perfect.

1353
01:23:05,443 --> 01:23:06,967
- Where's Fred?
- I don't know.

1354
01:23:07,045 --> 01:23:08,910
Well, didn't he talk to you?

1355
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:20,820
Don, why don't you sit down?

1356
01:23:23,862 --> 01:23:27,059
- Well, gentlemen, shall we begin?
- We can't begin.

1357
01:23:28,266 --> 01:23:31,099
Perhaps my watch is fast, I have 6:03.

1358
01:23:31,169 --> 01:23:33,831
- There are only four of us here.
- Five.

1359
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:36,069
Miss Tredway's proxy.

1360
01:23:37,209 --> 01:23:41,669
Miss Martin, am I correct in assuming
that five constitutes a quorum?

1361
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:43,272
Yes.

1362
01:23:43,949 --> 01:23:45,644
Am I also correct in assuming

1363
01:23:45,717 --> 01:23:47,617
that four votes out of the
total of seven directors,

1364
01:23:47,686 --> 01:23:51,486
are sufficient to pass the usual
motions, as well as to elect?

1365
01:23:52,457 --> 01:23:53,549
Yes.

1366
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:56,427
Then I see no reason
why we shouldn't proceed.

1367
01:23:56,494 --> 01:24:00,555
Well, don't you think this is important
enough to wait for Fred and Jesse?

1368
01:24:00,632 --> 01:24:02,827
Mr. Alderson and Mr. Grimm
have been officially notified

01:24:02,901 --> 01:24:04,960
of this meeting, have they not?

1370
01:24:05,036 --> 01:24:08,437
And you've had verification of
their receipt of notification?

1371
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:10,733
Yes.

1372
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:14,504
George, any objections to proceeding?

1373
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,238
No.

1374
01:24:16,848 --> 01:24:17,940
Walt?

1375
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:24,747
- No.
- All right, let's get started.

1376
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,625
Now, then.

1377
01:24:33,164 --> 01:24:36,258
Gentlemen, I take pleasure in...

1378
01:24:43,942 --> 01:24:45,432
Miss Tredway.

1379
01:24:46,177 --> 01:24:48,202
You know everybody.

1380
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:52,809
Mr. Caswell, Mr. Dudley,
Mr. Walling. Sit here.

1381
01:25:01,893 --> 01:25:04,361
This won't be necessary, Mr. Shaw.

1382
01:25:08,033 --> 01:25:09,557
I'll do it myself.

1383
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:20,470
Walt?

1384
01:25:23,148 --> 01:25:25,343
Miss Tredway, gentlemen,

1385
01:25:26,384 --> 01:25:30,480
I take pleasure in nominating as
the next president of our company,

1386
01:25:30,555 --> 01:25:35,390
the man whom I believe best
qualified to fill the terrible void

1387
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,495
left by the death of our beloved president.

1388
01:25:38,963 --> 01:25:41,056
I nominate Loren P. Shaw.

1389
01:25:41,599 --> 01:25:43,191
Thank you, Walt.

1390
01:25:43,635 --> 01:25:44,829
George?

1391
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:47,370
I second the nomination.

1392
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:50,472
Miss Martin.

1393
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:53,707
"Mr. Loren P. Shaw has
been placed in nomination

1394
01:25:53,778 --> 01:25:55,541
"for the presidency of Tredway Corporation

1395
01:25:55,613 --> 01:25:57,979
"before this 116th meeting
of the board of directors

1396
01:25:58,049 --> 01:26:00,677
"on the 20th day of June, 1953."

1397
01:26:00,752 --> 01:26:04,381
There being present a quorum of the
total number of directors as of this date,

1398
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:08,984
an affirmative vote delivered four times
shall constitute an elective majority.

1399
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,187
Are there any other nominations?

1400
01:26:17,502 --> 01:26:20,665
Nominations on this first
ballot are now closed.

1401
01:26:21,906 --> 01:26:25,205
If you'll please place your
ballots in these envelopes.

1402
01:27:31,443 --> 01:27:33,308
Your ballot, Mr. Walling.

1403
01:27:47,258 --> 01:27:49,158
One "no" for Mr. Shaw.

1404
01:27:51,663 --> 01:27:53,631
One "yes" for Mr. Shaw.

1405
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,368
Two "yes" for Mr. Shaw.

1406
01:28:00,104 --> 01:28:02,095
Three "yes" for Mr. Shaw.

1407
01:28:05,243 --> 01:28:06,710
One "abstain."

1408
01:28:09,747 --> 01:28:12,011
No decision on the first ballot.

1409
01:28:21,926 --> 01:28:25,054
Miss Tredway, could I
speak with you for a moment?

1410
01:28:25,363 --> 01:28:28,332
Perhaps I failed to make my
position clear this afternoon.

1411
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:31,300
How about a break before we go on with this?

1412
01:28:31,369 --> 01:28:33,599
- Anybody got an aspirin?
- In there.

1413
01:28:53,224 --> 01:28:56,284
Miss Tredway, I don't
know how you just voted,

1414
01:28:56,961 --> 01:29:00,260
but I wanted to tell you how
sorry I am for what I said.

1415
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:05,226
No matter how I feel about the
company, I had no right to do that.

1416
01:29:15,246 --> 01:29:17,476
Well, Loren, how does it feel?

1417
01:29:17,815 --> 01:29:19,908
- What?
- Not getting it.

1418
01:29:19,984 --> 01:29:23,613
- I had her. I know I had her.
- Oh, you still do.

1419
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:28,186
It was you. Why? Why?

1420
01:29:28,259 --> 01:29:30,090
3,700 reasons.

1421
01:29:30,161 --> 01:29:31,719
I told you I was...

1422
01:29:31,796 --> 01:29:33,957
I told you I was gonna do
my best for you, didn't I?

1423
01:29:34,032 --> 01:29:37,092
I didn't realize this afternoon how
much bargaining power I really had.

1424
01:29:37,168 --> 01:29:41,070
It's not just that my "no" keeps
you out and my "yes" puts you in.

1425
01:29:41,406 --> 01:29:44,204
Loren, I want the delivery
of that stock guaranteed.

1426
01:29:44,275 --> 01:29:46,869
You blasted idiot. I have
it for you right here.

1427
01:29:46,945 --> 01:29:50,005
Julia Tredway's pulling out of the company,
and I'm handling the sale of her stock.

1428
01:29:50,081 --> 01:29:52,072
Here's your 3,700 shares, right here.

1429
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:55,244
A letter of transfer
signed by me, as president.

1430
01:29:55,486 --> 01:29:56,783
Do you mind?

1431
01:30:01,593 --> 01:30:03,083
Now, let's go.

1432
01:30:07,265 --> 01:30:09,062
All right, now, Miss Martin.

1433
01:30:23,781 --> 01:30:25,078
Mary, is there anything wrong?

1434
01:30:25,149 --> 01:30:27,413
- Is it all over?
- No, not yet.

1435
01:30:27,752 --> 01:30:32,086
Oh, Don, please don't hate me. I did
a terrible thing to you. I really did.

1436
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:36,223
- Honey, what is it?
- Fred called you right after you left.

1437
01:30:36,294 --> 01:30:37,318
Where is he?

1438
01:30:37,395 --> 01:30:40,887
He said it was important for you to
hold up the voting until he got here.

1439
01:30:40,965 --> 01:30:42,592
I didn't call you, Don.

1440
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,895
And then when I did try to get
through, I couldn't find you, and...

1441
01:30:44,969 --> 01:30:46,869
It's okay, honey. It's all right.

1442
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:49,369
Darling, I was so wrong.

1443
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,468
If it's what you want, really want,

1444
01:30:52,944 --> 01:30:55,435
that's all that should
matter to either of us.

1445
01:31:04,055 --> 01:31:07,149
Don, is there still a chance in there?

1446
01:31:08,493 --> 01:31:11,758
Nothing's impossible. Remember?

1447
01:31:13,364 --> 01:31:14,524
You're funny.

1448
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:16,924
Am I?

1449
01:31:27,945 --> 01:31:30,937
- Getting ready for the second ballot, Don.
- Already?

1450
01:31:31,949 --> 01:31:32,938
Miss Martin.

1451
01:31:33,051 --> 01:31:35,781
"At 6:19, after a brief
recess, the meeting was resumed,

1452
01:31:35,853 --> 01:31:38,219
"and Mr. Dudley once again
placed the name of Loren P. Shaw

1453
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:41,019
"in nomination for the presidency
of Tredway Corporation."

1454
01:31:41,092 --> 01:31:42,616
Miss Tredway, gentlemen...

1455
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:44,525
We all seem to be in a big
hurry around here, don't we?

1456
01:31:44,595 --> 01:31:45,857
I'd like to second the nomination...

1457
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:49,297
Maybe we're a little too accustomed
to quick decisions in this room,

1458
01:31:49,367 --> 01:31:51,426
to directors' meetings that
never really meant anything.

1459
01:31:51,502 --> 01:31:53,766
If you mean that's pretty much
the way Bullard ran this company,

1460
01:31:53,838 --> 01:31:55,829
we might all be inclined to agree with you.

1461
01:31:55,907 --> 01:31:57,101
After all, isn't that why we're here,

1462
01:31:57,175 --> 01:31:59,871
to replace that kind of
dictatorial leadership?

1463
01:32:00,678 --> 01:32:01,667
With what, Loren?

1464
01:32:01,746 --> 01:32:03,407
- Well, I was about to tell you...
- Replace it with what?

1465
01:32:03,481 --> 01:32:06,507
Just a second, George. I
want to answer that question.

1466
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:09,449
After all, Miss Tredway is a
major stockholder in this company,

1467
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,648
and if she, or anyone else,
wants to know where I stand...

1468
01:32:13,591 --> 01:32:17,721
I believe that a company is answerable
first and last to its stockholders.

1469
01:32:18,563 --> 01:32:20,155
To fulfill that obligation,

1470
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:23,632
primary emphasis must be placed
upon return on investment.

1471
01:32:24,335 --> 01:32:25,927
(DOORKNOB RATTLING)

1472
01:32:33,578 --> 01:32:34,943
- Jesse.
- Don.

1473
01:32:35,379 --> 01:32:37,108
- Anything happened?
- Not yet.

1474
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:39,479
Thought I could swing him. He's a mule.

1475
01:32:40,351 --> 01:32:42,012
SHAW: Jesse, Fred, welcome.

1476
01:32:42,954 --> 01:32:43,978
We're into the nominations,

1477
01:32:44,055 --> 01:32:45,613
and I was just trying to
make clear to everyone here

1478
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:47,590
what I believe to be the only

1479
01:32:47,658 --> 01:32:50,286
sound basis for corporation management today.

1480
01:32:52,563 --> 01:32:54,531
When the average stockholder
buys Tredway stock,

1481
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:55,759
he makes an investment.

1482
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:58,734
Now, the only reason he
makes it is to get a return.

1483
01:32:58,936 --> 01:33:01,734
That's why I believe that corporations today

1484
01:33:01,806 --> 01:33:03,603
must be governed to be what
its owners want it to be,

1485
01:33:03,674 --> 01:33:05,266
and have paid for it to be,

1486
01:33:05,376 --> 01:33:09,506
a financial institution yielding the
highest and safest return on investment.

1487
01:33:09,881 --> 01:33:11,712
You know why more and more corporations today

1488
01:33:11,783 --> 01:33:14,684
are drawing their leaders from the ranks
of controllers and investment bankers?

1489
01:33:14,752 --> 01:33:17,243
Because the problems that come
to the president's office today

1490
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:18,982
are predominantly financial.

1491
01:33:19,056 --> 01:33:20,353
I get it.

1492
01:33:20,525 --> 01:33:22,925
Manufacturing and selling
don't count anymore.

1493
01:33:22,994 --> 01:33:25,462
Of course they count, Fred, but
they're not ends in themselves,

1494
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,498
only the means to the end.

1495
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:29,658
It's a matter of management
levels. I just said it.

1496
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:32,965
At the presidential level,
the emphasis must be financial.

1497
01:33:33,471 --> 01:33:34,870
Take our own case.

1498
01:33:35,206 --> 01:33:36,798
Jesse and his staff have done a wonderful job

1499
01:33:36,874 --> 01:33:39,434
of reducing costs on our finishing operation,

1500
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:41,876
and we all appreciate the
creative effort that's been poured

1501
01:33:41,946 --> 01:33:44,244
into our experimental program
at the Pike Street plant.

1502
01:33:44,315 --> 01:33:45,646
But the truth is,

1503
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:48,919
such efforts add comparatively
little to our net earnings,

1504
01:33:48,986 --> 01:33:50,613
even when they succeed.

1505
01:33:51,055 --> 01:33:55,185
Last year, they contributed less
than a quarter of what we gained

1506
01:33:55,259 --> 01:33:59,093
from one new tax accounting procedure
I got the government to approve.

1507
01:33:59,163 --> 01:34:02,291
So, you see, that one
piece of work, all purely...

1508
01:34:02,366 --> 01:34:03,560
Yeah, we see, all right.

1509
01:34:03,634 --> 01:34:05,795
While Jesse and Don are turning out products,

1510
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:10,330
you figure-jugglers and chart-men are
busy flyspecking it with decimal points.

1511
01:34:10,408 --> 01:34:11,739
Well, some of us have had enough of it,

1512
01:34:11,809 --> 01:34:13,777
and some of us are sick
to our stomachs from it!

1513
01:34:13,845 --> 01:34:15,938
I've had enough of that attitude!

1514
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:20,483
I know how I've been regarded
around here by most of you.

1515
01:34:20,551 --> 01:34:22,712
Efficiency has become a dirty word.

1516
01:34:22,854 --> 01:34:24,719
Budget control has a bad odor.

1517
01:34:24,789 --> 01:34:27,019
Well, that's my job.
That's my responsibility,

1518
01:34:27,091 --> 01:34:28,820
to plug every profit leak,

1519
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:32,860
to run to earth every single case of
waste and inefficiency in this company.

1520
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:35,296
If I have to step on toes and
hurt feelings in the process,

1521
01:34:35,366 --> 01:34:36,492
that can't be helped.

1522
01:34:36,567 --> 01:34:38,296
But nobody's going to say I ever had anything

1523
01:34:38,369 --> 01:34:40,803
but the best interests of this
company at heart while I was doing it.

1524
01:34:40,872 --> 01:34:42,806
You take a look at the record
of the last three years.

1525
01:34:42,874 --> 01:34:44,205
Fight that record.

1526
01:34:44,275 --> 01:34:45,503
My record.

1527
01:34:45,576 --> 01:34:46,634
Your record, Shaw?

1528
01:34:46,711 --> 01:34:48,838
Couldn't have been done without me.

1529
01:34:49,513 --> 01:34:52,311
Understand, I don't mean
to belittle Mr. Bullard.

1530
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:55,150
We all recognize his magnificent contribution

1531
01:34:55,219 --> 01:34:57,312
to this company during its period of growth.

1532
01:34:57,388 --> 01:35:00,016
In other words, Avery Bullard
was the right kind of man

1533
01:35:00,091 --> 01:35:02,252
to save this company from disaster,

1534
01:35:02,326 --> 01:35:04,521
to build it up and set it on its way.

1535
01:35:04,695 --> 01:35:06,663
But now, we need a
different kind of management,

1536
01:35:06,731 --> 01:35:08,722
one that will dedicate itself to paying

1537
01:35:08,799 --> 01:35:10,824
the maximum dividends to the stockholders.

1538
01:35:10,902 --> 01:35:12,369
Is that it?

1539
01:35:13,504 --> 01:35:15,938
I don't know that I'd express
it in exactly those terms,

1540
01:35:16,007 --> 01:35:19,238
but, yes, that's
substantially what I do mean.

1541
01:35:20,645 --> 01:35:22,636
Shaw, let me ask you something.

1542
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:25,312
The president of a company like
Tredway would have to be a man

1543
01:35:25,383 --> 01:35:27,817
- of outstanding qualities, wouldn't he?
- Naturally.

1544
01:35:27,885 --> 01:35:30,820
A man prepared to make a
good many personal sacrifices,

1545
01:35:30,888 --> 01:35:34,824
willing to devote himself to the
company, mind and heart, body and soul.

1546
01:35:35,526 --> 01:35:38,086
If you have the right man,
there'd be no worry on that score.

1547
01:35:38,162 --> 01:35:40,790
Why? Why would he do it?

1548
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:42,423
What would be his incentive?

1549
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,331
You mean, outside of salary?

1550
01:35:45,269 --> 01:35:47,100
There's such a thing as success, isn't there?

1551
01:35:47,171 --> 01:35:48,570
The sense of accomplishment.

1552
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:49,901
Exactly.

1553
01:35:50,508 --> 01:35:53,033
Now, let's assume, Shaw, that you're the man

1554
01:35:53,678 --> 01:35:56,078
running the Tredway Corporation your way.

1555
01:35:57,148 --> 01:35:59,708
Would you be satisfied to
measure your life's work

1556
01:35:59,784 --> 01:36:01,945
by how much you raised the dividend?

1557
01:36:02,353 --> 01:36:04,412
Would you regard your life as a success

1558
01:36:04,488 --> 01:36:06,046
just because you managed to get the dividend

1559
01:36:06,123 --> 01:36:08,887
to $3 or $4, or five or six or seven?

1560
01:36:09,493 --> 01:36:10,858
Would that be enough?

1561
01:36:10,928 --> 01:36:13,488
Is that what you want engraved
on your tombstone when you die?

1562
01:36:13,564 --> 01:36:15,395
The dividend record of
the Tredway Corporation?

1563
01:36:15,466 --> 01:36:17,696
Are you suggesting that
earnings aren't important?

1564
01:36:17,768 --> 01:36:20,328
I'm suggesting no such thing and you know it!

1565
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:23,297
Shaw's right when he says

1566
01:36:23,374 --> 01:36:26,070
that we have an obligation
to our stockholders.

1567
01:36:27,345 --> 01:36:30,212
But it's a bigger obligation
than raising the dividend.

1568
01:36:31,248 --> 01:36:34,046
We have an obligation to
keep this company alive,

1569
01:36:34,285 --> 01:36:37,186
not just this year, or
next, or the year after that.

1570
01:36:37,621 --> 01:36:40,886
Sometimes, you have to use your
profits for the growth of the company,

1571
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:42,323
not pay them all out in dividends

1572
01:36:42,393 --> 01:36:45,089
to impress the stockholders
with your management record.

1573
01:36:45,162 --> 01:36:48,495
There's your waste, Shaw!
There's your inefficiency!

1574
01:36:48,566 --> 01:36:50,295
Stop growing, and you die!

1575
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:52,865
Turn your back on experimentation
and planning for tomorrow

1576
01:36:52,937 --> 01:36:54,996
because they don't
contribute to dividends today

1577
01:36:55,072 --> 01:36:56,801
and you won't have a tomorrow

1578
01:36:56,874 --> 01:36:58,774
because there won't be any company.

1579
01:36:58,843 --> 01:37:00,071
Avery Bullard didn't seem to think

1580
01:37:00,144 --> 01:37:02,908
my policies were exactly
destroying this company.

1581
01:37:03,848 --> 01:37:04,837
No.

1582
01:37:05,983 --> 01:37:07,211
No, he didn't.

1583
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:09,584
And he was wrong.

1584
01:37:10,287 --> 01:37:12,847
The way a lot of people are wrong these days,

1585
01:37:13,157 --> 01:37:16,593
grabbing for the quick
and easy, the sure thing.

1586
01:37:17,128 --> 01:37:19,596
That's just a lack of faith in the future,

1587
01:37:20,231 --> 01:37:22,096
something that's in the air today,

1588
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:24,600
the groping of a lot of men, who
know they've lost their faith,

1589
01:37:24,668 --> 01:37:27,899
but aren't sure what it is, or
how they happened to lose it.

1590
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:30,907
Avery Bullard was one of them.

1591
01:37:31,175 --> 01:37:33,939
He'd been so busy building
a great production machine

1592
01:37:34,011 --> 01:37:37,003
that he finally lost sight
of why he was building it,

1593
01:37:37,081 --> 01:37:38,981
of why he was the man he was!

1594
01:37:39,917 --> 01:37:41,544
If he ever really knew.

1595
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:44,150
Do you know, Mr. Walling?

1596
01:37:45,823 --> 01:37:47,222
Yes, I think I do.

1597
01:37:48,592 --> 01:37:50,719
Avery Bullard was driven by pride,

1598
01:37:51,629 --> 01:37:52,994
pride in himself,

1599
01:37:53,564 --> 01:37:56,692
the urge to do things that no
other man on earth could do.

1600
01:37:56,767 --> 01:37:59,065
He was the man at the top of the tower,

1601
01:37:59,236 --> 01:38:01,261
needing no one, wanting no one,

1602
01:38:01,739 --> 01:38:02,933
only himself.

1603
01:38:03,874 --> 01:38:06,274
That's what it took to satisfy his pride.

1604
01:38:07,178 --> 01:38:08,770
That was his strength.

1605
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,279
That was his weakness, too.

1606
01:38:11,348 --> 01:38:14,044
Why shouldn't a man have
pride if he's earned it?

1607
01:38:14,685 --> 01:38:15,674
All right.

1608
01:38:16,253 --> 01:38:19,780
But why should that set him apart
from the people he's working with?

1609
01:38:21,659 --> 01:38:25,322
The force behind a great company has
to be more than the pride of one man,

1610
01:38:25,396 --> 01:38:27,421
it has to be the pride of thousands.

1611
01:38:27,498 --> 01:38:31,491
You can't make men work for money alone,
you starve their souls when you try it.

1612
01:38:31,569 --> 01:38:34,436
And you can starve a company
to death the same way.

1613
01:38:36,307 --> 01:38:38,605
Avery Bullard must have known that once,

1614
01:38:40,211 --> 01:38:43,078
but he'd become a little
lost these last few years.

1615
01:38:44,215 --> 01:38:45,842
The company had been saved.

1616
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:48,477
There were no more battles to win.

1617
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:52,121
Now he had to find something
else to feed his pride:

1618
01:38:52,389 --> 01:38:54,653
Bigger sales, more profit, something.

1619
01:38:59,463 --> 01:39:02,432
And that's when we started
doing things like this.

1620
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,728
The K-F line.

1621
01:39:04,602 --> 01:39:07,696
Walt, are your boys proud when
they go out and sell this stuff

1622
01:39:07,771 --> 01:39:09,204
when they know the finish is gonna crack,

1623
01:39:09,273 --> 01:39:10,865
the veneer will split off
and the legs come loose?

1624
01:39:10,941 --> 01:39:13,535
Now, wait a minute, wait a
minute. That's price merchandise.

1625
01:39:13,611 --> 01:39:16,478
It serves a definite purpose in the
profit structure of this company.

1626
01:39:16,547 --> 01:39:18,378
- We're not cheating anyone.
- Ourselves!

1627
01:39:18,449 --> 01:39:21,247
At that price, the customer knows
exactly what he's going to get.

1628
01:39:21,318 --> 01:39:22,307
This?

1629
01:39:23,387 --> 01:39:24,411
(CRASH)

1630
01:39:24,488 --> 01:39:26,752
This is what Tredway has come to mean!

1631
01:39:27,725 --> 01:39:30,319
And what do you suppose the people
think of us when they buy it?

1632
01:39:30,394 --> 01:39:33,090
How do you suppose the men in the
factories feel when they make it?

1633
01:39:33,164 --> 01:39:34,529
What must they think of a management

1634
01:39:34,598 --> 01:39:36,725
that's willing to stoop to
selling this kind of junk

1635
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,268
in order to add a dime
a year to the dividend?

1636
01:39:39,336 --> 01:39:42,362
Do you know there are men at Pike Street
who've refused to work on the K-F line?

1637
01:39:42,439 --> 01:39:45,602
Who've taken a $7.50-a-week cut to
get transferred to something else?

1638
01:39:45,676 --> 01:39:47,337
Well, after all, that's
only part of our business.

1639
01:39:47,411 --> 01:39:49,106
Eventually, we can cut down on the line.

1640
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,704
We'll drop that line!

1641
01:39:52,082 --> 01:39:55,745
And we'll never again ask a man to
do anything that will poison his pride

1642
01:39:55,819 --> 01:39:57,446
in himself or his work.

1643
01:39:58,956 --> 01:40:01,356
We'll have a line of low-price furniture,

1644
01:40:01,659 --> 01:40:03,388
a new and different line,

1645
01:40:03,827 --> 01:40:05,454
as different from anything
we're making today,

1646
01:40:05,529 --> 01:40:08,760
as a modern automobile is
different from a covered wagon.

1647
01:40:08,999 --> 01:40:11,695
That's what you'd want, Walt,
isn't it? What you've always wanted?

1648
01:40:11,769 --> 01:40:14,897
Merchandise that will sell because
it had beauty and function and value,

1649
01:40:14,972 --> 01:40:18,271
not because the buyers like your
Scotch or think you're a good egg.

1650
01:40:18,342 --> 01:40:20,833
The kind of stuff that you, Jesse,
will be able to feel in your guts

1651
01:40:20,911 --> 01:40:23,209
when you know it's coming
off your production line.

1652
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,875
A product that you'll be able to budget
to the nearest hundredth of a cent, Shaw,

1653
01:40:26,984 --> 01:40:30,249
because it will be scientifically
and efficiently designed.

1654
01:40:31,622 --> 01:40:35,217
And something you'll be proud to
have your name on, Miss Tredway.

1655
01:40:37,027 --> 01:40:39,518
We're gonna give the people what they need

1656
01:40:39,597 --> 01:40:41,690
at prices they can afford to pay.

1657
01:40:42,066 --> 01:40:44,557
And as fresh needs come
up, we'll satisfy them, too,

1658
01:40:44,635 --> 01:40:46,660
with something new and even more exciting!

1659
01:40:46,737 --> 01:40:49,205
And when we achieve that,
we'll really start to grow!

1660
01:40:49,273 --> 01:40:51,104
We're not gonna die, we're gonna live!

1661
01:40:51,175 --> 01:40:53,336
And it's gonna take every
bit of business judgment

1662
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,173
and creative energy in this company

1663
01:40:55,246 --> 01:40:57,476
from the mills and the factories
right to the top of the Tower!

1664
01:40:59,049 --> 01:41:01,176
And we're going to do it together.

1665
01:41:01,919 --> 01:41:03,216
Every one of us.

1666
01:41:03,621 --> 01:41:05,248
Right here, at Tredway.

1667
01:41:06,857 --> 01:41:08,256
I'm with you, Don!

1668
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,620
I take great pleasure in
nominating Mr. McDonald Walling

1669
01:41:12,696 --> 01:41:15,096
for the presidency of
the Tredway Corporation.

1670
01:41:15,165 --> 01:41:16,154
Second!

1671
01:41:16,233 --> 01:41:18,064
I move we make it unanimous.

1672
01:41:18,602 --> 01:41:20,069
All those in favor?

1673
01:41:20,971 --> 01:41:22,199
Miss Tredway?

1674
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:23,998
Yes.

1675
01:41:25,142 --> 01:41:26,302
Mr. Caswell?

1676
01:41:28,812 --> 01:41:29,870
Mr. Shaw?

1677
01:41:38,222 --> 01:41:39,211
So voted.

1678
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,433
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Loren.

1679
01:41:58,042 --> 01:41:59,907
(STAMMERING) Loren?

1680
01:42:00,878 --> 01:42:02,743
About that stock...

1681
01:42:23,233 --> 01:42:26,202
- You're Mary Walling, aren't you?
- Yes.

1682
01:42:26,603 --> 01:42:30,004
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.

1683
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:34,940
- I'm a little frightened, too.
- Because you don't quite understand him?

1684
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:39,342
We never do. Not completely.
Not men like that.

1685
01:42:40,317 --> 01:42:44,253
It will make you very lonely at times
when he shuts you out of his life,

1686
01:42:44,855 --> 01:42:47,221
but then he'll always come back to you.

1687
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:49,486
And you'll know how fortunate you are to...

1688
01:42:51,161 --> 01:42:52,458
To be his wife.

1689
01:42:55,165 --> 01:42:57,292
Will you tell him something for me?

1690
01:42:59,169 --> 01:43:02,605
Say thank you for saving my life.

1691
01:43:11,315 --> 01:43:12,839
Congratulations, Mary.

1692
01:43:15,319 --> 01:43:16,616
(MARY LAUGHING)

1693
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:28,628
- Oh, Erica.
- Yes, Mr. Walling?

1694
01:43:28,699 --> 01:43:31,133
Better call a committee meeting
for 10:00 Monday morning.

1695
01:43:31,201 --> 01:43:33,669
We'll be appointing an
executive vice-president.

1696
01:43:33,737 --> 01:43:35,102
Yes, Mr. Walling.

1697
01:43:35,706 --> 01:43:38,004
- Good night.
- Good night.

1698
01:43:42,946 --> 01:43:46,143
- Hey, by the way, who won today?
- We did.

1699
01:43:47,584 --> 01:43:49,211
