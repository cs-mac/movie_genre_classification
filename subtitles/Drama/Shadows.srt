1
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:24,446
<i>Whoo! Yee-ha!</i>

2
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:34,885
<i>Whoo!</i>

3
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,215
<i>Whoo-hoo! Yee-ha!</i>

4
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,687
<i>Whoo!</i>

5
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:21,880
<i>Whoo-hoo! Yee-ha!</i>

6
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,462
<i>Whoo!</i>

7
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:51,153
<i>Whoo-hoo! Yee-ha!</i>

8
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:00,589
<i>Whoo!</i>

9
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:19,347
<i>Whoo-hoo! Yee-ha!</i>

10
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,335
<i>Pass it by! Come on, pass it by!</i>

11
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,039
- How you doin'?
- Good. Pass it by!

12
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:42,606
<i>Come on! Pass it by!</i>

13
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,781
<i>Hey, Bennie.</i>

14
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,556
Hey, Bennie. You got the loot?
The boys are waiting.

15
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,028
- I got the money. But you ain't
coming with us. - Aw, Bennie.

16
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:55,088
Hey, baby, I got the money.
I got the bread.

17
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:58,101
Twenty bucks.

18
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:00,400
- Hey, I got the 20. Wait a minute.
- Be careful!

19
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,271
Let go of my leg.
Let go of my leg.

20
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:06,039
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my arm, man.

21
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:08,946
- Let me see that bill.
- Forward!

22
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:22,063
- Twenty bucks apiece.
- Twenty bucks.

23
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:24,294
- That's shocking.
- No, I'm gonna get you one.

24
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,703
- Look what we've got here.
- Dennis, you're in.

25
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,446
- I haven't seen him around, have you?
- Who cares?

26
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,724
Hey.

27
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,727
Get a load of him.

28
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,326
- Hi.
- Hello.

29
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:56,099
Been here long?

30
00:03:56,174 --> 00:04:00,008
- Two or three days. Where have
you been? - Two or three days?

31
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,070
How come I haven't
been around before this?

32
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:04,081
I don't know. Your problem.

33
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,319
What do you do?

34
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:10,823
Nothing very much.

35
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:13,917
Well, I'm not gonna ask you
the story of your life.

36
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:17,329
- You seem nice.
- I wish you would.

37
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:26,003
<i>Well, I'm making enough.</i>
<i>I got a nice cozy place.</i>

38
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:32,882
- Well, I haven't had any better offers.
- What's to drink?

39
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,115
- Want to finish your drink?
- A little bit.

40
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:42,184
Good boy. Big boy.

41
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,527
- Tonight -
- What's the matter?

42
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,999
Well, uh...

43
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,162
I think I'm caught in this booth.

44
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,433
Come and get comfortable.

45
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,274
Oh, come on.

46
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,686
You come on.
What do you mean by "interesting"?

47
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:09,494
Huh?

48
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:12,555
What do you mean by
"come up to my apartment"?

49
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,103
That's a silly question
for a big girl like you.

50
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,110
What do you do?

51
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:25,180
I'm a musician.

52
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,685
Jazz musician.

53
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,947
I play trumpet.

54
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,289
You didn't bring
your instrument tonight, did you?

55
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:44,730
You guys are really something.

56
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,797
Well, what have you been
sitting here all night for?

57
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,813
Huh?

58
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:55,146
I thought you knew all the answers.

59
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:58,154
Well, you want to get
picked up, don't you?

60
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:01,214
Would you like that?
I'd like to take you.

61
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,624
- I'll bet you would.
- Have a great time.

62
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:07,028
What do you say?
All right? Please?

63
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:09,897
- Such a baby.
- What do you say?

64
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,098
I'm not kidding. I'm very serious.
Would you like it?

65
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,765
- Huh?
- All right.

66
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:27,548
- What's your name?
- Nancy.

67
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:31,990
- What's yours?
- Ben.

68
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:37,100
Hi.

69
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:41,177
That's a lousy agreement.

70
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,408
I've been a singer
in this business for 10 years...

71
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:46,043
and I've never introduced
a girlie line in my life.

72
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,383
Well, I can't change you. Hughie -

73
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:50,549
It's not a question of the money.

74
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,460
It's just that my client feels
that it's beneath his dignity...

75
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:57,191
to have to introduce
a bunch of floozies.

76
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,202
I've got a few guys ready
right now to take your place.

77
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,296
You aren't infallible, you know.

78
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,977
<i>Okay. All right, cut it.</i>

79
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,247
- Cut it! Cut it out.
- All right, all right.

80
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,255
Okay, okay.

81
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:19,656
Okay, cut it. Cut it.

82
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:22,820
- All right. All right.
- Okay, uh -

83
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:28,803
Now, there are 10 million people in
New York City. Half of them are girls.

84
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:32,170
<i>And any one of them can sing this song</i>
<i>better than you broads. Any one of them.</i>

85
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,040
<i>"A real mad chick," right?</i>

86
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:38,308
And shake your bodies around!

87
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:41,351
Do something, will ya?
Now, let's try it once more.

88
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,083
- All right, if you want me to do it.
<i>- Once more, girls. "A real mad chick."</i>

89
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,322
But look, I'm going to feel like an awful
damn fool introducing those girlies.

90
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,330
You're an artist.

91
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,332
If you make up your mind
to do it, you can do it.

92
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,869
Look, I was an artist 10 years ago.

93
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:59,304
Now, that's when I was an artist.

94
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,366
How you doing?
You want to see me for a moment?

95
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,378
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

96
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:05,175
- Bennie -
- Wait a minute.

97
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:07,182
Let me see him for a moment, okay?

98
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,684
A moment, man. You know.

99
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:11,688
- What is it, Bennie?
- You got a minute?

100
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,690
Yeah, I got a minute.
Let me tell you something.

101
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,023
You know what these people
want to do to me?

102
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:19,030
It's bad enough working
in a third-rate nightclub...

103
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:23,126
packaged with the strippers and floozies
and playing second fiddle to them.

104
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:26,071
They want me
to introduce the girlie line.

105
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,131
Crazy.

106
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:31,544
- They can't even sing.
- Look, Hugh.

107
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,344
I need 20 bucks to pay a guy back
I borrowed from for a few beers.

108
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,909
- Are you ready for our deal now?
- We're still making up our mind about it.

109
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:40,218
- Where's your boy?
- He's over there talking to his brother.

110
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,417
I want to pay him back.
Have you got it?

111
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:45,986
Here's my offer now. You're gonna
play two nights. $35 a night. Yes or no?

112
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:48,727
We'll take it, Jack.
We've got no problems.

113
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,735
You've got to introduce the girls,
the whole line.

114
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,706
- We need the money, Hugh.
- You got it, 20 bucks for me?

115
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,709
What's it gonna be?

116
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:02,778
- Look, we haven't decided anything.
- We've decided, and he'll be there.

117
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,785
Look, man.
I'll see you later.

118
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,516
You're only a kid.
It's a lot of money for a kid.

119
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,924
Anything. Okay, excuse me.
Bennie.

120
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:12,929
Now, Mr. Ackerman.
There are no problems at all.

121
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:14,931
He's got a little trouble
with his kid brother.

122
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,560
And it's going to be taken care of
in just about another minute.

123
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:21,129
Now, as we agreed, we're going to be
there tonight in Philly right on time.

124
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,141
Bennie.

125
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:26,943
Look, Hugh.
We've gotta settle this thing.

126
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:32,646
- What's the deal?
- He wants to give us $35 a night
and third billing.

127
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,655
And you introduce
the girlie line, Hughie.

128
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:37,351
We heard that part before.

129
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:41,887
- All right, what time do I leave?
- Just be in Philly in time for the show.

130
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:44,161
That's all I want from you.

131
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,540
<i>Rupe, you're a very lucky boy.</i>

132
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,943
<i>If you knew how many people</i>
<i>wanted this job.</i>

133
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,345
<i>You guys are both very lucky boys.</i>

134
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,977
<i>Well, I wouldn't say that</i>
<i>exactly, Mr. Ackerman.</i>

135
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,994
What's the matter?

136
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:10,327
What's the matter?
Come on, what's the matter?

137
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,494
- I forgot your toothbrush.
- Look, I'll buy one.

138
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,834
Hey, how about moving up there?

139
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,870
- How you gonna get home?
- I thought I'd take a nice little walk.

140
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,879
No, look,
I want you to take a cab.

141
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,609
Oh, please, Hugh.
Don't start that again.

142
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,278
I'm 20 years old,
and I've lived in this city all my life.

143
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,845
- I think I can manage.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

144
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,518
Look. You don't know everything,
and you're a baby.

145
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,061
I mean, all you have to do
is read the papers.

146
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,691
A girl can't walk safely
down the streets at night in any city...

147
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:42,363
without being hollered at and
called names and pinched and abused.

148
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:46,375
I don't want my baby sister being hurt
for a few pennies. Now, you take a cab.

149
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:48,968
Nothing ever happens to me
when I walk home.

150
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:51,072
Round trip to Philadelphia, please.

151
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,225
Look, nothing's gonna happen to me,
nothing ever does.

152
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:03,287
I love you.
Now, take care of yourself. Okay?

153
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,764
And do a good show.
And come on, let's go.

154
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,496
- And look-
- The suitcase.

155
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:12,166
- You're gonna be late.
- Look, take a cab, please. All right?

156
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:14,176
Get out of here.

157
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:17,380
You're gonna miss it!

158
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:29,592
- Where you been? You're never on time.
- Look, we'll make it.

159
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,597
Come on.

160
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:41,365
- No, we're gonna make it. Come on.
- Man, it's too late.

161
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,571
Look, he's stopping.
Come on, man, run.

162
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,945
After you.

163
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,551
Hey, Sam.
Thanks for letting us use this pad, man.

164
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,559
- How'd you like that date?
- Yeah, man, but everybody's gotta live.

165
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:20,926
Sure, sure. Fourth billing
and introduce the girlie act.

166
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:23,865
- Now, that really burns me.
- Forget it, will you?

167
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:28,099
What am I introducing a bunch of
dumb broads for? What's to introduce?

168
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:30,937
So they're dumb broads.
So they gotta live too.

169
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,601
That's the way I feel also.

170
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:35,443
That beats baked beans
with baked beans, buddy.

171
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:40,819
Sam. All right, I'm a singer.
And I sing a song.

172
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:44,825
Now, what am I gonna say about a bunch
of dumb broads with white ribbons...

173
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:47,192
going around singing "A Pretty Girl"?
Does that make sense?

174
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:51,059
Well, you just can't say that exactly.

175
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,831
I don't know, say a few nice words
about the audience...

176
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,838
like, uh, I don't know.

177
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:58,535
Just smile, be yourself, you know?

178
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,737
I'm a singer.
Nobody seems to get that.

179
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,872
And singers sing.
I mean, that's it. That's all, man.

180
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:05,975
Well, man. You can always
tell a couple of jokes.

181
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,612
Everybody likes jokes.
That makes people feel good.

182
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,280
Sam, what time is it?

183
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:13,850
You make them feel relaxed, at easy.
Like Steve Allen, you know.

184
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:15,920
Jokes? What jokes?
I don't know any jokes.

185
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,331
- Look, I don't even know my own name.
- Now, come on, baby. Let's go.

186
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:22,064
- Now, hold on a minute.
<i>- To hell with jokes. You tell a joke.</i>

187
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:24,402
Look, dummy,
don't let yourself go.

188
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:26,602
<i>Tell us some jokes, man.</i>

189
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,944
Yeah, yeah, okay.

190
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,006
How's that one
about the witch doctor?

191
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,450
Are you kidding?
They'd close the joint.

192
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,454
I was just thinking out loud.

193
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:40,220
I'll tell you one a little bit,
little bit more refined.

194
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:43,320
Uh, you like that one about
the rabbit in the tree?

195
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,059
I don't know that one.

196
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:48,126
That one about the rabbit that
fell on out of the tree and says...

197
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:51,640
"Man, that lovemaking's for the birds."

198
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:54,438
- That's great. That's cute.
- Don't you like it?

199
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:57,948
- Oh, man, come on.
- Wait a minute, man. What do you mean?

200
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:01,781
Look, man. Hold it.
That's cute. That's funny.

201
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:03,788
- Everybody likes jokes.
- That's right.

202
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:06,188
Man, you won't offend anybody.
You know, with dates?

203
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:09,490
- Do you really think that's funny?
- Yeah, come on. Give it a try, will ya?

204
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:12,396
- I do, man.
- I don't know.
- Come on.

205
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:16,233
- Look, I can't.
- Try it, Hugh, once, will ya?

206
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,301
- Okay, okay.
- There you go.

207
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,971
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
did you ever hear-

208
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:26,072
This is stupid, man.
I can't do this.

209
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,017
Try it, man. What's to lose with us?
Are we gonna kill you?

210
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,682
Look, if you're so smart,
you do it yourself.

211
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,294
Okay, I will.

212
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,523
It's easy though, you know.

213
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,657
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

214
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,105
On my way over here this evening
a very funny thing happened to me.

215
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:52,740
Got it? I was walking down the street
looking up at this great big tree.

216
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:56,751
- And way up there on -
- Man. Say it out fast. Catch 'em off guard.

217
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:01,052
- No, you got to set 'em up, man.
- Set 'em up? You'll rock 'em to sleep.

218
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,822
- Man, who are you, Steve Allen?
- All I'm saying -

219
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:06,386
Wait. I got it. I got it. I got it.

220
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,601
I say, uh...

221
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,666
"Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

222
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,436
Well, you certainly look like
a refined audience we got here tonight...

223
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,445
and I have a couple
of refined jokes to tell."

224
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,845
- See? I play up the class.
- There you go.

225
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:28,181
Beautiful couple here,
ladies and gentlemen.

226
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:32,252
There's a couple celebrating
their third drink since 7:15.

227
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,667
Hey, that's pretty good, man!

228
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:40,301
You're beautiful.
You two married?

229
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:44,533
What are you asking if they're married for?
They're with a fella.

230
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,545
He's the lookout.

231
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,813
Here's the Andrew Sisters,
ladies and gentlemen...

232
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:53,513
Patty, Maxene and LaVerne.

233
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:56,319
- Are you two girls married?
- I just asked that.

234
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:59,487
Well, it got a laugh over there.
I figured it would get a laugh here.

235
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:16,675
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to meet a singer-

236
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,946
We've got a singer right now
named Hughie Hurd.

237
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,853
<i>He's a great singer. I want you all</i>
<i>to, like, take care of him.</i>

238
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:24,323
Give him a lot of applause, please,
because he's new in town.

239
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:07,873
Man, he's putting them all to sleep.

240
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,120
- Kill him, man. Get him off.
- What?

241
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,290
What is this "bring the girls on"?
What kind of a place you running here?

242
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,425
Bring the girls on.
Bring them on out.

243
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,900
Call the girls, man.
Introduce the girls.

244
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:32,102
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Bring on the girls, will ya?

245
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:21,828
Well, is everybody going
to sit around here all day?

246
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:26,264
Dennis, stop that, will ya?
It makes me sick.

247
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,141
- What's the matter with you, Tom? - I
got a hangover. That's what's the matter.

248
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,476
That's what you get
for staying out all night.

249
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,710
Who takes care of your sister
when you stay out all night?

250
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:38,185
Man, I hire a babysitter. Don't I hire
a babysitter for you, sweetheart?

251
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:40,883
David's writing a new novel
all about you, Ben.

252
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:45,555
Better not be any of that
beat generation jazz like the last one.

253
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:48,693
Stop it, Dennis. It makes me sick.

254
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:51,669
Right in my coffee, Tom.

255
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:53,501
Yeah, take some Dramamine.
It helps sometimes.

256
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:57,534
- Dramamine? What's Dramamine?
- It's airsick medicine.

257
00:20:57,612 --> 00:21:00,274
I'm not airsick. I'm ground sick.

258
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,977
But I'll take anything
if it'll help me with the way I feel.

259
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:05,646
Dennis, will you do me a favor
and get me some of that stuff?

260
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:08,384
- What is it? - Will you get me
some Dramamine, please?

261
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,018
Do me a favor, huh?
Dennis, I appreciate that very much.

262
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:13,723
Oh, Tom! Will you cut it out?
For crying out loud.

263
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:21,106
You guys.

264
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:25,235
You never break your pattern.
You'll never go anywhere with your lives.

265
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:28,679
- Tom, take this. Drink up.
- How many do I take?

266
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:30,684
Take just this one.

267
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:36,690
<i>Why don't you do something,</i>
<i>learn something?</i>

268
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,125
There are thousands of things to do
in New York City.

269
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:43,428
- Like what?
<i>- Why don't you do something different?</i>

270
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,435
<i>Do you want to meet new people?</i>

271
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:47,562
You wanna come to a literary
party I'm having tonight?

272
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,803
Don't invite them, David.
They won't even wear ties.

273
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,710
- Lelia's coming.
- What the hell is a literary party?

274
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,650
<i>Just where people interested in</i>
<i>books and other literary efforts...</i>

275
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,653
get together and discuss things.

276
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,849
Well, if they're coming,
I'm not going to be there...

277
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:06,291
because they're gonna just act awful,
and I'll be so embarrassed.

278
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:08,728
- Oh, it's all right.
<i>- Oh, a tie. You kidding?</i>

279
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,062
<i>You can come just as you are.</i>
<i>Do you want to come?</i>

280
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:14,263
- Yeah, I'll read a poem.
<i>- Don't get excited, honey.</i>

281
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:17,740
Who wants to make
that fink party anyway?

282
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,440
<i>All right, something else.</i>
<i>A concert or a museum?</i>

283
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:26,612
A museum, I'm for it.
Ben, Tom?

284
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:29,588
I don't think you've ever even been
in a museum, any of you.

285
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:33,252
I? I've never been in a museum?

286
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:36,924
<i>We've been in plenty of museums.</i>
<i>I bet you can't even spell it.</i>

287
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,832
- Oh, will you stop teasing me?
- Here, Tom. Pick it up.

288
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,167
Lelia has a very bright mind, Bennie.

289
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:45,140
- She's developing very rapidly.
- Bull.

290
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:49,373
I don't want to sit around here and
be insulted by these creeps. Let's go.

291
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:52,281
Lelia, you should eat something
besides black coffee.

292
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:56,948
David, please.
Don't start lecturing me now.

293
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:05,064
Well?

294
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,465
- Come on, David. Let's go.
- Never mind. We're going.

295
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:10,733
What will it be, Dennis,
the Margarine or the Metropolitan?

296
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,469
Let's go to the Metropolitan.
They got mummies there and everything.

297
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:15,477
- What do you say?
- You guys kidding?

298
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:18,674
- No, man. Let's cut.
<i>- Let's go.</i>

299
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,344
- Let's go. Come on, Ben.
- Hey, Bennie.

300
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,820
Come on, Ben. Let's go.

301
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:30,359
Hey, Bennie, Dennis.

302
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,736
I don't know what you wanted
to come here for, Dennis.

303
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:48,012
This joint is nothing but a place
for a bunch of sexless women...

304
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:50,019
who don't have
any love in their life.

305
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,249
A lot of big deal professors.

306
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,484
A lot of creeps trying to show
off how much they know.

307
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,893
- You couldn't be wronger.
- I suppose professors don't come here?

308
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:00,728
Well, I didn't say that.

309
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,962
All right, Dennis. Look at that.

310
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,528
I suppose you can tell me
what he's about, huh, genius?

311
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:08,336
- He's a statue.
- I know he's a statue, Dennis.

312
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:10,708
What kind of a statue?
I know he's a statue.

313
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,045
- Well, Tom, I don't know everything.
- You know something, Dennis?

314
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:16,608
- You don't know nothing.
- Oh, yeah? What do you know?

315
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,678
- A lot more than you do, pal.
- Yeah?

316
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:20,724
What you come here for
if you know so much?

317
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,454
You have no respect for art,
no respect at all.

318
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,864
You listen to me, Dennis.

319
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,926
You're nothing but an ignorant slob,
Dennis, a little ignorant slob.

320
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,029
<i>- I went to college, Dennis.</i>
<i>- You?</i>

321
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:35,904
<i>All I ever got out of it</i>
<i>was dissipation...</i>

322
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:39,003
<i>and a lot of early bells</i>
<i>disturbing my sleep.</i>

323
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,014
<i>A lot of supercilious professors...</i>

324
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:44,211
slob professors shooting off
their mouth about something...

325
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:47,984
trying to teach me something they'd
already failed at in life themselves.

326
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:50,549
So don't tell me
I don't appreciate anything.

327
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,476
Tom, do you know what
I'm going to do with that?

328
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,143
I'm gonna put it on a Christmas card.
Just a mask on a card.

329
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:13,119
- Won't that be wild?
- Don't send one to me, pal.

330
00:25:13,188 --> 00:25:15,851
Look, Tom, will you cool it?
You know what you're talking about?

331
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:18,052
I suppose you really understand
that thing, huh, Bennie?

332
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:22,895
- It's not a question of understanding it.
If you feel it, you feel it, stupid.
- That's what I been trying to tell you.

333
00:25:22,966 --> 00:25:25,561
- Aw, shut up, Dennis.
- Aw, shut up, yourself.

334
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:28,470
- Say you're sorry.
- All right, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

335
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,475
Hey, look at that one, now.
Look at that one, man.

336
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:32,477
- You're really sorry?
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

337
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:34,878
- Okay. I apologize.
- Take it easy, guys, will you?

338
00:25:34,948 --> 00:25:36,882
Hey, look at this.
Now, look.

339
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,384
<i>Now, look at this cat.</i>

340
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:42,923
He really had a sense of humor
when he made this.

341
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:45,050
That isn't supposed
to be humorous, Tom.

342
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,359
What are we supposed to do,
get serious with a can like that?

343
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:52,197
- I'm telling you right now, Tom.
- Don't get excited, Dennis.

344
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,328
I'm not going to hurt it.
It's made of iron.

345
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,339
A chick like that may destroy me.

346
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:58,706
What's the matter with Tom?
Is he crazy or something?

347
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:01,941
- No, Dennis.
- Someday you may marry
a girl that looks like that.

348
00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:05,780
- Oh, God forbid.
- It's not funny, Dennis.
- It's not funny.

349
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:12,391
This joint gives me the creeps, Bennie.
Let's go, come on.

350
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,361
- Where are you going?
- Let's get out of here.

351
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,422
Okay.

352
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,174
Lelia.

353
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:30,544
I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings.

354
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:34,074
But if you're going to write a story,
you have to do it professionally.

355
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:36,644
David, I don't want to be a writer.

356
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:39,716
I didn't want to do this.
You convinced me to do it.

357
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:42,921
And now all you can do is criticize.

358
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,990
I just want you to be honest.

359
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:51,438
Look, your story has some pretty good
things. But it's very hard to be honest.

360
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:53,169
I don't understand your viewpoint.

361
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:57,270
Jean-Paul Sartre has absolutely nothing
to do with existential psychoanalysis.

362
00:26:57,347 --> 00:26:59,077
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

363
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,414
Well, it's all a bit vague.
Don't you think so, Joan?

364
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,614
I do not. The trouble with you is...

365
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,817
you suffer from self-induced hysteria
at the word existentialism.

366
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,884
- Are you aware of that?
- Can I fix you a drink?

367
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,896
- No, thank you.
<i>- I assure you, I don't.</i>

368
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,798
<i>I know the article to which you refer.</i>
<i>I've read it three times.</i>

369
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:16,531
<i>I couldn't even find</i>
<i>the basic precepts.</i>

370
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:19,574
- Which article was that?
<i>- If you can explain it, I'd be delighted.</i>

371
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:22,873
Well, it's perfectly obvious.
Man, in contrast to other animals...

372
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:24,879
is conscious of his own existence.

373
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:28,111
Therefore, conscious of
the possibility of non-existence.

374
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:30,654
<i>Ergo,</i> he has anxiety, right?

375
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:32,656
Right, absolutely.
I couldn't agree with you more.

376
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:35,717
Well, it figures.

377
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:43,534
Now this girl here...

378
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:45,970
she has no control over herself.

379
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:49,409
She's been deeply hurt.

380
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,412
And yet she goes on
as if nothing happened...

381
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,414
living her life the same as before.

382
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:57,044
It just doesn't make any sense.
Life takes more than imagination.

383
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,058
Well, the point is that
if you're yourself, you won't get hurt.

384
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:07,030
- Are you a writer too?
- Oh, no. Do I look like a writer?

385
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:10,069
Well, I can't tell anymore.

386
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:14,164
- I'm a dancer really.
<i>- Oh, a dancer. Why, that's great.</i>

387
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:17,369
- Are you a ballet dancer?
- Oh, no, exotic.

388
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:22,213
- Exotic?
<i>- Oh, you don't know what that is, do you?</i>

389
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:27,086
- Not exactly.
- It's, uh, sort of modern...

390
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:29,091
only more exotic.

391
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,093
That sounds terrific.

392
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:33,824
Listen, would you mind if I came
to see you perform sometime?

393
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:36,265
<i>Oh, no. The very next time,</i>
<i>I'll invite you.</i>

394
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:38,269
Great. When will that be?

395
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,737
Oh, I'm not dancing right now.

396
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,469
Oh, no? Why not?

397
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:46,104
I'm going to have a baby in March.

398
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:49,482
You're -

399
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,485
That's great.
You're going to have a baby.

400
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:55,752
A baby. That sounds terrific.
Congratulations. That's great news.

401
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:58,487
- We think so, don't we, honey?
<i>- Huh?</i>

402
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:01,622
Yeah, well, that's swell.
Congratulations.

403
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,361
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Listen, if it's okay...

404
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:07,632
I'll just excuse myself
and fix my drink a little bit.

405
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:26,358
<i>You don't know what it is to be hurt.</i>
<i>You can't always see it coming.</i>

406
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:29,990
Sometimes a person could ruin your life.

407
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:33,901
And yet, all he'd be able
to honestly say is "I'm sorry."

408
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,701
Hi, David.
Am I interrupting something?

409
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:40,472
Tony. Lelia Carruthers, Tony Russell.

410
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,138
- Hello.
- Hello.

411
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,308
I was just trying
to convince Lelia that...

412
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,046
writers today have got to be
realistic in their approach.

413
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,317
What he's trying to say is,
he hates my writing.

414
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,916
You be the judge, Tony.
You be the judge.

415
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:55,258
On her first day in New York this year...

416
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,993
Lelia's writing about
a walk down Fifth Avenue.

417
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:03,496
<i>She sees a stranger standing in</i>
<i>the sunlight on a street corner...</i>

418
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:06,475
<i>and she walks up and kisses him,</i>
<i>this perfect stranger.</i>

419
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:09,206
<i>It's revolting on a Sunday afternoon.</i>

420
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,377
It is not.
If I wanted to, I would.

421
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:26,231
Was that so bold?

422
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:28,896
I guess I have to
change sides, David.

423
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:31,963
David, would you go and get me
some more champagne?

424
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,533
It's even more revolting in real life.

425
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,348
Some more champagne.

426
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,545
I think you've had plenty.

427
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:50,760
- What did you say your name was?
- Lelia.

428
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:54,390
It's a lovely party, isn't it?

429
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:57,063
Do you know you're staring at me?

430
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:01,805
- I'm hypnotizing you.
- Thank you.

431
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:03,903
Who do you belong to, Lelia?

432
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:06,983
Why, I belong to me.

433
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:09,315
What about David?

434
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,327
- No more champagne, Lelia.
- David, I was just about to see Lelia home.

435
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:18,829
What do you mean?
I'm taking Lelia home.

436
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:22,096
Well, uh, you're both wrong...

437
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:24,467
because neither one of you
are taking me home.

438
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:27,474
I'm meeting Vickie and
she's spending the night at my house.

439
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:32,173
Oh. I guess my hypnotic spell is
a little rusty. What about tomorrow?

440
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:35,183
Tomorrow, Lelia and I
are going to the park.

441
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:37,811
<i>- Oh, well, good, good. I'll come along.</i>
- No.

442
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:41,153
- Oh.
- David, don't be so unfriendly.

443
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,310
Don't be such an old man, David.

444
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:01,315
- Hi, Moe.
- Moe-Moe.

445
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:04,751
Hey, baby.
Give me one of those.

446
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,690
- Hello, stranger. There's a stranger.
- Hi, Moe.

447
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:09,692
- Hello, Moe.
- How have you been?

448
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,389
- Lelia, come here.
- You sure look like you've got a hangover.

449
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,931
I've gotta go.

450
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,230
- What's the story here?
- I'll talk to you later about it.

451
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,202
I thought you and Lelia were making
the scene. Dave, wait a minute!

452
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,934
- I can't. I can't.
- Oh, wow.

453
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:18,435
I'm really not very happy.

454
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,912
I mean, I'm happy, but I'm not
as happy as everybody thinks I am.

455
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:23,915
- Why not?
- Oh...

456
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:27,112
because I feel that I should be
farther ahead than I am.

457
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:30,748
And everything
is passing me by, and -

458
00:33:30,824 --> 00:33:32,759
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

459
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:37,663
- I'd never guess.
- Oh, stop. Don't laugh. I'm serious.

460
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:41,067
I have the feeling that
I'll never, you know, be smart...

461
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:43,766
and I'm never going
to get the things that I want.

462
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,642
And, uh - Oh -

463
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:49,680
What do you feel like?
Tell me what you feel like.

464
00:33:49,747 --> 00:33:52,740
- I feel like I'm in a -
- In a cocoon and you can't get out?

465
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:54,753
That's right.
How did you know?

466
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:57,483
I didn't think boys were supposed to
understand things like that.

467
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:01,392
- You see, I am far behind.
- Behind who?

468
00:34:01,462 --> 00:34:05,365
- Now you sound like David.
- I hope not.

469
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:09,097
Why not? David's one of the most
intelligent people I've met in my life.

470
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,106
But not very romantic.

471
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,508
No, he's not very romantic.

472
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,484
You know, I'm not a very nice person.

473
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:22,520
I mean,
I have very romantic inclinations.

474
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:25,056
Be forewarned that I'm not one
of these storybook characters...

475
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:27,491
that's supposed to be
all noble and righteous.

476
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,121
When I see someone I like...

477
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,998
and if she likes me,
we accept my romantic inclinations.

478
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:39,970
Do you happen to know
where we are right now?

479
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:42,170
No.

480
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:46,842
That's where I live,
right there, number seven.

481
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,449
Come on up for a drink.

482
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,817
You know you're beautiful?

483
00:35:26,765 --> 00:35:28,700
Don't you move.

484
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:40,280
Don't move.

485
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,151
You've got the softest lips
I've ever felt.

486
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:28,005
Tony.

487
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,942
I love you, Lelia.

488
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:35,470
I don't want anything to drink.

489
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:40,086
All right, baby.

490
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,055
I love you, Lelia.

491
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:50,165
Love you, Lelia.

492
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,693
Baby, I love you.

493
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:57,508
So much.

494
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:21,967
Lelia.

495
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:24,233
Really, if I'd known
this was the first time for you...

496
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:26,299
I wouldn't have touched you.

497
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,903
I didn't know it could be so awful.

498
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,051
Don't be so upset, sweetheart.

499
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:37,349
Baby.

500
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,952
It'll be much easier next time.

501
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:45,460
There isn't going to be a next time.

502
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:54,099
Want a cigarette? Huh?

503
00:37:54,178 --> 00:37:57,170
- Come on, have a cigarette.
- No.

504
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:04,547
<i>I'm sorry if I disappointed you.</i>
<i>I guess I did.</i>

505
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:10,786
I was so frightened.

506
00:38:14,802 --> 00:38:18,136
I kept saying to myself,
"You mustn't cry.

507
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:21,040
If you love a man,
you shouldn't be so frightened."

508
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:24,536
It's only natural.

509
00:38:24,614 --> 00:38:28,415
There isn't a girl in the world
that wouldn't feel the same way.

510
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:30,477
She's got to.

511
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,123
- What happens now?
- What happens?

512
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:40,025
Uh, what do you mean,
"What happens now"?

513
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:45,632
- I mean, do I stay with you?
- Stay with me?

514
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:49,199
Uh, stay with me?
Do you mean live with me?

515
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:53,505
Yes.

516
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,348
Do you want to?

517
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:05,422
No.

518
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:07,465
I want to go home.

519
00:39:09,636 --> 00:39:11,763
Okay, baby.

520
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:21,671
I thought being with you
would be so important...

521
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:25,618
mean so much...

522
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,784
that afterwards two people would be
as close as it's possible to get.

523
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,034
But instead...

524
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:43,934
- we're just two strangers.
<i>- Lelia.</i>

525
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,572
- Lelia.
- It's over.

526
00:39:49,684 --> 00:39:51,619
I know that much about life.

527
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:57,248
Lelia, you can come stay with me.

528
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,261
I want you to.

529
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,798
But when I say
that you're close to me...

530
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:05,734
that's all I can say,
because that's the way I am.

531
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:11,403
But that does not mean that I don't feel
the same things that you feel.

532
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:14,276
Tony, please, please don't.

533
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:18,912
- Lelia, I love you.
- Please don't touch me.

534
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:22,890
Please don't touch me.
I want to go home.

535
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:29,763
- I want to get dressed now.
- Okay, sweetheart. Okay.

536
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,666
- Please leave me alone.
- Okay, sweetheart, I'll take you home.

537
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:35,968
Okay, sweetheart.
Sweetheart, it's okay.

538
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,975
- I'm with you.
- I want to go home.

539
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:40,034
I'll take you home.
I'll take you home.

540
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,287
Seventy-five, buddy.

541
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:52,850
Look, uh, why don't you just take
the taxi wherever you're gonna go?

542
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:55,088
Because I'm coming upstairs with you.

543
00:40:56,465 --> 00:40:58,956
Look, folks. Come on,
it's my busy time. Let's go.

544
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:01,527
Yeah, yeah.
Just a second, huh?

545
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:05,968
Look, why don't we
just end it right here?

546
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:08,376
Make up your minds.

547
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:13,715
Because you don't want it that way,
and because I don't want it that way.

548
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:16,654
You go with her,
or end it and you stay.

549
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:19,283
But, uh, come on,
make up your mind.

550
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,851
- How much - How much on the clock?
- Seventy-five.

551
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,731
I'm coming upstairs with you, Lelia,
whether you like it or not.

552
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:29,863
- Please, don't make any scenes.
- I'll make the biggest scene you ever saw.

553
00:41:29,939 --> 00:41:32,271
You're that important to me.

554
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:37,780
All right, all right. You can come up,
but just for a minute.

555
00:41:37,848 --> 00:41:40,716
Okay, fine.

556
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:45,357
Ain't love grand?

557
00:41:45,424 --> 00:41:47,893
Why don't you
mind your own business.

558
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,664
Keep it. Keep it.

559
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:09,279
<i>- What's wild?</i>
<i>- Deuces wild.</i>

560
00:42:09,353 --> 00:42:11,288
<i>- It's up to you, Dennis.</i>
- Any kind of deuce?

561
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:14,291
<i>Any kind of deuce. It's up to you,</i>
<i>Dennis. You open or what?</i>

562
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,920
I open for 50.
Give me two cards, Ben.

563
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:18,964
Wait a minute.
Want me to call you, do you?

564
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,529
Tell you what
I'm gonna do, Dennis.

565
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:25,966
You need the money,
so I'm gonna let you have it.

566
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,237
I'm gonna let you have this hand
and bury my cards.

567
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,245
<i>I don't wanna play anymore.</i>
<i>Let's call some girls.</i>

568
00:42:31,313 --> 00:42:33,508
- Come on, let's call a couple of chicks.
<i>- Why not?</i>

569
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:35,744
- Get on the phone, Bennie.
<i>- Come on, Ben.</i>

570
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,117
Who do you know, Ben?
You should know a lot of chicks.

571
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,817
You said you had something.
You've been bragging all day about it.

572
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,156
Ben, call Barbara.
Barbara Kennedy.

573
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:48,296
Twelve twenty-one, please.

574
00:42:50,804 --> 00:42:53,330
Room 1221.
Uh, Anita.

575
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:58,244
I don't know her last name, just Anita.
Yeah, room 1221.

576
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:02,506
Yeah, hello, baby.

577
00:43:05,154 --> 00:43:07,817
This is Clark.
I'm all through flying.

578
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:13,421
Anita? Yeah, Tom.

579
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:15,193
<i>How about a couple of drinks?</i>

580
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:18,896
Can you get that redhead
that works in the hat check room?

581
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,497
No, there's three of us.
I got two buddies.

582
00:43:21,575 --> 00:43:24,066
Yeah, Bennie and Dennis.

583
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:28,482
We're feeling mighty low.
Can you get another girl?

584
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:32,384
All right, I'll meet you in about
20 minutes? Yeah, see you.

585
00:43:32,454 --> 00:43:35,355
- Tell you, man?
- Come on, let's go.

586
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:38,087
Didn't I tell you the chicks would go?
You didn't believe me.

587
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:40,289
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

588
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:44,156
<i>Come on, Bennie.</i>

589
00:44:57,023 --> 00:45:00,152
<i>Okay, let's break it up.</i>

590
00:45:00,227 --> 00:45:02,923
That's more like it.
How you been?

591
00:45:02,997 --> 00:45:05,967
I'm fine. Uh, Tony Russell,
this is my brother, Hugh.

592
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:09,266
- Hi.
<i>- And this is Rupert Crosse.</i>

593
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,001
Glad to know you.

594
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:14,010
How are you?

595
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:18,276
Well, how did the thing go?
I mean, big crowds?

596
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,386
<i>Fine. The only one bad spot</i>
<i>in the whole thing was...</i>

597
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:25,947
<i>this character here decides to-</i>-
<i>he's gonna rewrite everything.</i>

598
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:28,017
<i>You ever hear Jelly Roll</i>
<i>sung like an opera?</i>

599
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:32,031
<i>Come on. The song's not Jelly Roll, man.</i>
<i>It's a ballad. It's a beautiful thing.</i>

600
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,933
- You sing like a velvety-
- Of course, honey.

601
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:37,495
Oh, Lelia.

602
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:40,201
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

603
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:50,849
I have an appointment.
I told you.

604
00:45:58,531 --> 00:46:02,696
- Where are you going?
- My appointment.

605
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,738
You didn't tell me about
an appointment earlier.

606
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,865
I just remembered about it
a couple of minutes ago.

607
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:10,275
<i>Tony, I love you.</i>
<i>Doesn't that mean anything?</i>

608
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:19,522
Look, Lelia.

609
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,717
We'll have lunch tomorrow, okay?

610
00:46:26,732 --> 00:46:31,067
After lunch, we'll go to a movie
or something like that.

611
00:46:31,137 --> 00:46:33,071
<i>Maybe have some drinks.</i>

612
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:37,543
Lelia.

613
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:39,546
Lelia.

614
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,818
Look.

615
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:47,286
I don't wanna fight with you.
I don't wanna argue with you.

616
00:46:47,356 --> 00:46:50,520
- What's the matter?
- I want you to go.

617
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:52,529
Why?

618
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:56,192
I don't want you -
I don't want you to hurt my sister.

619
00:46:56,267 --> 00:46:59,135
- I don't wanna hurt your sister.
- Look. Maybe I can make you understand.

620
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:01,970
- Lelia, I don't want to hurt you.
- Look, I want you to go!

621
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,976
Why? I don't understand that.

622
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:08,038
Look, I want you to go.
I mean, it's as simple as that.

623
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:11,109
- I don't want you around.
- Want to have dinner with us tomorrow?

624
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:15,020
- I don't want nothing from you.
- I'll take you and Rupe to dinner.
All of us will go.

625
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,218
I can't seem to
make it clear to you.

626
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:21,198
I don't want you around
hurting my sister.

627
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,261
I don't want you
to hurt anything of mine.

628
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:27,498
Now go.

629
00:47:27,572 --> 00:47:29,939
Just get out!

630
00:47:31,844 --> 00:47:33,778
- You're telling me to get out.
- Get out, man.

631
00:47:33,846 --> 00:47:36,611
What do you want me to do now?
Just get out.

632
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:44,618
Remember, you told me to get out.

633
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:46,957
Look, would you leave?

634
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:51,024
Would you leave before I do something
I don't want to do right now.

635
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,265
Would you just get out of here.
Go ahead.

636
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,670
But you remember you told me
to get out of here!

637
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:59,074
Will you get out of the house!

638
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:37,489
- You got me, Bennie -
- I love you.

639
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:41,662
Okay. It's all right.

640
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:44,220
Oh, I love him so much.

641
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:07,315
<i>You all right, baby?</i>

642
00:49:15,837 --> 00:49:17,772
Good night, baby.

643
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,865
Get some sleep, will you?

644
00:49:58,488 --> 00:50:02,789
That water better be hot this morning or
I'm gonna wipe that superintendent out.

645
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:08,399
Excuse me.

646
00:50:11,404 --> 00:50:14,272
Hey, how do you manage to get here
three minutes before I do?

647
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:17,505
What do you do, get up late at night
and watch the alarm or something?

648
00:50:17,578 --> 00:50:20,707
- Too bad.
- Just don't slop it up in there, okay?

649
00:50:20,782 --> 00:50:22,841
Well, some people like water on them.

650
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,649
Oh, go drown yourself.

651
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,619
Hey, baby. How you feeling?

652
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,630
- Fine.
- Great.

653
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:37,430
Looks like I'll have to go out
and buy you a whole field of tobacco.

654
00:50:38,637 --> 00:50:40,730
How you feel now?
You feel like talking to me about it?

655
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:43,037
- Maybe it'll help you.
- No, Hugh.

656
00:50:44,311 --> 00:50:47,304
There's not much to say.
Thanks anyway.

657
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:49,873
Is it just possible for somebody
to get a towel in this place?

658
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:52,045
Oh, I forgot to put them up.
I'll get you one.

659
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:54,612
No, don't drag it out.
It's probably someplace simple...

660
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,818
like in the hi-fi set.

661
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:59,657
Look, I better get it while it's hot.

662
00:50:59,729 --> 00:51:03,427
Oh, Lelia. Look, I got some cats
coming up tonight.

663
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:06,630
And, uh, if you don't feel
up to it, we can cancel.

664
00:51:06,705 --> 00:51:09,037
Oh, no, Hugh.
It's all right, really.

665
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:13,671
I'll even order some things.
It'll give me something to do.

666
00:51:13,746 --> 00:51:16,181
Great, great. That's my baby.

667
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:22,852
Al.

668
00:51:25,694 --> 00:51:28,664
Al told me a story yesterday about Bird.

669
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,861
Bird had this big limousine
that had been assessed by the
Bureau of Internal Revenue...

670
00:51:34,939 --> 00:51:38,706
and he was driving it all over town,
you know, like a block long.

671
00:51:38,777 --> 00:51:41,211
And, uh, he was driving with
two other people in the car...

672
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,341
and Al was, like, the guy
in the center who, like, told me.

673
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:47,147
And the guy on the outside he didn't like
and they were going uptown.

674
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:50,088
And they were going down Broadway
and they had to make a left...

675
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:52,285
and another left to go uptown.

676
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,329
So as they stopped at the light...

677
00:51:55,397 --> 00:51:57,332
Bird said...

678
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,234
"Man, would you mind getting out
of the car? I have to make a left turn."

679
00:52:01,305 --> 00:52:03,466
So the guy said, "Okay, Bird,"
and got out of the car.

680
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,908
And Bird made his left turn
and went uptown without him.

681
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:10,779
- Isn't that sick?
- Yeah, very.

682
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,512
- Hey, Bennie, you got a towel for me?
- Yeah.

683
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,650
Thanks.

684
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:20,756
Maybe I'll just join
a small group in Vegas.

685
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:24,664
Bennie, what's this I hear
about you getting a job?

686
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:27,201
I mean, that really upsets me.

687
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,434
- You're kidding, aren't you?
- Very funny, very funny.

688
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,036
Lelia, can I get you
a cup of coffee or something?

689
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:37,637
No, Hugh.

690
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:40,116
What's the matter with you?
Are you sick?

691
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:46,285
You look awful. You ought
to get some rest at night.

692
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:48,294
Will you shut up!

693
00:52:53,034 --> 00:52:54,968
What did I say?

694
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,030
Just forget it.

695
00:52:58,107 --> 00:53:00,041
I won't forget it. What did I say?

696
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:03,079
- What's the matter with her?
- Nothing you'd be interested in.

697
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,547
Look, she's my sister too. I wanna know
what's the matter with her.

698
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,814
Nothing, baby. Just a little problem
that came up last night.

699
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,254
A little problem?
What is the little problem?

700
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:19,054
Look, Bennie. It's just a problem
with the races, that's all.

701
00:53:22,236 --> 00:53:26,503
Like I said, Bennie,
nothing you'd be interested in.

702
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:30,535
Who all is coming
to this party tonight?

703
00:53:30,613 --> 00:53:32,911
Oh, just some people.

704
00:53:51,004 --> 00:53:52,938
You know what you need?

705
00:53:53,006 --> 00:53:56,272
You need a guy to take care of you
and protect your values.

706
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:59,212
You need a home and security
and babies, honey.

707
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,215
That's what you need.

708
00:54:02,317 --> 00:54:05,583
<i>- Oh, look. There's Davey Jones. Davey!</i>
- No, Vickie.

709
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:07,589
Meet Davey. He's wonderful.
You'll love him.

710
00:54:07,657 --> 00:54:10,491
- Vickie, no.
- Davey! Davey Jones. Davey!

711
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:14,123
Davey, I want you to meet Lelia.
Lelia, this is Davey.

712
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:16,895
- Hello there.
- Hello.

713
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:19,767
Sit down for a second, Davey.

714
00:54:21,707 --> 00:54:25,769
Davey went to the same school -
Your brother's school, Stuyvesant.

715
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:31,909
<i>Vickie-</i>-
<i>How long have you known Vickie?</i>

716
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:35,653
What do you do all day?

717
00:54:35,724 --> 00:54:39,252
- I paint.
- You're an artist.

718
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:43,099
Maybe I can drop by one afternoon.
Take in a movie or something.

719
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:45,568
I don't like the movies.

720
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:49,437
Well, there are other places to go.
Take you to a club then. How about that?

721
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:53,310
Or we'll go to an opera.

722
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:55,314
I might drop up one afternoon.

723
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:57,373
Maybe we can go for a walk
through the park or-

724
00:54:57,451 --> 00:54:59,386
I don't like the park either.

725
00:54:59,454 --> 00:55:02,014
Oh, give me a break.

726
00:55:09,066 --> 00:55:12,502
- Hi, Dave, daddy.
- Hello, Rupert. How are you?
I'm not interrupting, am I?

727
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:15,539
Vickie, will you help me out, put in
a good word here or there somewhere?

728
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:22,573
Well.

729
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:25,641
- To talk to Lelia.
- Hi, baby. How are you doing?

730
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:28,587
Why don't you take her
to that wonderful painters' -

731
00:55:28,656 --> 00:55:31,750
They're having some kind of thing
over at Cooper Union.

732
00:55:31,826 --> 00:55:35,456
- She'd love that.
- I wouldn't dig that at all.

733
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,999
Well, that's the kind of thing
I enjoy, you see?

734
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,897
Well, we'll go then.

735
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,714
Lelia. Hello.

736
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,081
I'd like to see you
for a second, can I?

737
00:55:53,152 --> 00:55:55,451
<i>- Yeah, what?</i>
- It's about Tony.

738
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:06,593
Say, uh, excuse me. Can I talk to Lelia for
just a second? It's something important.

739
00:56:06,668 --> 00:56:09,159
- No, David. I'd rather not.
<i>- Honey. It's okay.</i>

740
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:12,470
No, please. David,
I don't want to discuss any of this.

741
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:15,569
- Please. Just come with me for a second.
- No, David, please!

742
00:56:15,646 --> 00:56:19,481
He called me. He was very
upset about something that
happened here the other day.

743
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:22,884
- And he got me upset about it.
- I know, David.

744
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:25,856
Yeah, but I feel I'm involved in it.
And I just want to tell you...

745
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,258
that I didn't know at all
what he was like, when, you know -

746
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:31,320
Hey, hey, Dave, Dave.

747
00:56:31,398 --> 00:56:33,663
Come on, Dave.
Leave my sister alone.

748
00:56:33,735 --> 00:56:36,295
Come on, man.
Come on and join the party.

749
00:56:41,377 --> 00:56:43,312
Look, I have to go.

750
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,314
I'll see you later, all right?

751
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:48,580
- You're a very good dancer.
- I'm not such a good dancer.

752
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:50,985
Lelia, come on over here.
Come on over here.

753
00:56:51,055 --> 00:56:53,047
Looks like you and her
are getting along real fine.

754
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,355
Well.

755
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:27,293
Look, why don't you just
come on and have a drink with us...

756
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:31,531
and join in the party
and forget about your mood for a while?

757
00:57:31,605 --> 00:57:33,539
You know, I just don't understand.

758
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:36,441
I think you really
want to join in the party...

759
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,638
but maybe you don't know how.

760
00:57:38,714 --> 00:57:41,182
You want to be coaxed a little bit.

761
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,185
You really feel that way?

762
00:57:44,988 --> 00:57:48,015
I prefer to be coaxed.
But don't you coax me, okay?

763
00:57:48,092 --> 00:57:49,923
There are other ways.

764
00:57:52,731 --> 00:57:55,029
You want a drink?
Want me to get you a drink?

765
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,935
- No, thanks. I don't drink.
<i>- You'll find it's good for what ails you.</i>

766
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:04,774
<i>Just pull yourself together, because</i>
<i>you're not kidding anybody but yourself.</i>

767
00:58:04,845 --> 00:58:09,783
You know, you have
your sense of values all mixed up.

768
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:11,786
So I can just -

769
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:14,288
No, don't touch me.

770
00:58:14,356 --> 00:58:16,587
Come on, just a little taste.

771
00:58:27,439 --> 00:58:30,034
- Let him go, let him go.
- You're crazy, baby.

772
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:32,976
<i>- Let me go. Let me go.</i>
- Hugh, come on.

773
00:58:33,046 --> 00:58:35,038
Let me go!

774
00:58:38,886 --> 00:58:41,447
<i>What the hell is wrong with that guy?</i>

775
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:43,514
What's wrong with you?
You don't have to get carried away.

776
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:45,753
He's always messing up the damn thing!
What's wrong with him?

777
00:58:45,828 --> 00:58:47,989
This is a party! Stop it!

778
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:07,580
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow.

779
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:11,280
Everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

780
00:59:23,574 --> 00:59:26,373
- Gee, he's your brother, and I -
- I know.

781
00:59:26,444 --> 00:59:28,969
I find it hard to believe
you can't talk to him.

782
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:34,076
I don't know, right now I'd just be satisfied
with a home and a few kids, you know.

783
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,646
- Simple things.
- I envy you.

784
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:41,183
He's a pretty unhappy kid, you know.
It's too bad you can't -

785
00:59:41,262 --> 00:59:44,026
He's mixed up and for some reason,
I don't know...

786
00:59:44,098 --> 00:59:46,397
he doesn't,
either doesn't want to, is afraid to -

787
00:59:46,468 --> 00:59:48,902
Okay, Hugh.
Let her off the hook, will you?

788
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,405
<i>The night's almost over.</i>

789
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:55,902
Let's end it off with a little smile
rather than all this.

790
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,384
What's with this "Leave the girl alone"?
Why don't you leave me alone?

791
01:00:00,452 --> 01:00:03,512
I was only attempting to remind you
that we invited her here...

792
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:05,318
<i>to have a good time, that's all.</i>

793
01:00:05,391 --> 01:00:07,882
She obviously wants to hear
what I have to say.

794
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,691
- Maybe he doesn't wanna talk about it.
<i>- She's not complaining.</i>

795
01:00:10,764 --> 01:00:13,325
Why don't you butt out,
mind your own business?

796
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,995
<i>We want to kill each other,</i>
<i>that's my business.</i>

797
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:19,371
Every time I turn around, it's you behind
me pushing me, interfering with me.

798
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:21,535
<i>- You could be replaced.</i>
- You sound pretty mad about it.

799
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,945
Okay, Hugh.
Let's knock it off, huh?

800
01:00:27,952 --> 01:00:29,510
Hey, look.
I'm picking up your phrases.

801
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:31,920
The other day in Philadelphia
when I was singing...

802
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,015
you know,
I don't appreciate that at all.

803
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:36,756
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
- I'm getting ready to sing the song.

804
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,764
In the middle of the song...

805
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:42,394
for what reason I don't know
why you did it, you decided to change it.

806
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,438
This don't make sense.
Does that make any kind of sense?

807
01:00:44,505 --> 01:00:48,374
No, I don't think it's fair to...

808
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:52,540
- sort of as a last minute sort of thing.
- Another little bright idea of his.

809
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,879
Without interfering with you...

810
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,580
I think what you feel more
is my attitude towards life.

811
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,091
<i>Maybe that bugs you, but don't hold it</i>
<i>against me. That's the way I am, see.</i>

812
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:04,094
How much longer you
planning on us staying here?

813
01:01:04,162 --> 01:01:07,826
- I don't know. What time is it now?
<i>- Five after 5:00.</i>

814
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:12,405
- Here are your keys.
- Where the hell have you been?

815
01:01:12,472 --> 01:01:14,964
- What the hell do you care?
- What do you mean, "What do I care"?

816
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:16,976
- There are your keys. Where's Lelia?
- She's out.

817
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,240
Don't mess with me.
I'm splitting. There are your keys.

818
01:01:19,314 --> 01:01:22,147
- I want to talk to you.
- No. Get out of my way.

819
01:01:22,217 --> 01:01:24,686
- I want to talk to you!
- Are you gonna stop it?

820
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:27,552
Take your hands off!

821
01:01:27,624 --> 01:01:29,286
Look, Bennie, you're my brother.

822
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,760
What do you want me to do,
start the whole thing all over again?

823
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:34,355
Goddamn it, if I have to whip you,
I'm gonna tell you something!

824
01:01:34,432 --> 01:01:37,402
- Look, wait a minute, will you?
- I'm going.

825
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,098
Bennie, will you listen? I love you.
What the hell am I supposed to say?

826
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:47,276
<i>Bennie. Bennie, for God's-</i>-
<i>Take the keys, please.</i>

827
01:01:48,349 --> 01:01:50,374
- Bennie.
- All right.

828
01:01:50,451 --> 01:01:54,786
Are we friends?
Buddies? Brothers?

829
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:57,893
Huh?

830
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:08,972
- Hi. All ready?
- Well, hello.

831
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:12,410
No. Where's my flowers?

832
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,345
I was late, so I didn't have
a chance to - I just ran right over.

833
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:19,147
Well, I just don't think
that's very nice of you at all.

834
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:23,021
Don't you think you should bring a lady
something when you beg to take her out?

835
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:25,424
I can go back and get them
if you want me to.

836
01:02:25,494 --> 01:02:27,985
No, just go make yourself comfortable.
There's drinks in there.

837
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:30,590
- Go, go.
- Will you be long?

838
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,658
I'll be as long as I am.

839
01:02:37,242 --> 01:02:39,302
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi.

840
01:02:39,378 --> 01:02:41,539
I'm Davey. I'm taking Lelia
to the dance tonight.

841
01:02:41,614 --> 01:02:45,483
Oh, good. Pleased to meet you.

842
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:50,081
Uh, why don't you go and have a drink
with my brother and Rupe?

843
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:53,389
- Thanks.
- Introduce yourself, why don't you?

844
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,195
Hi, fellas.

845
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:59,201
- Hi.
- Hi.

846
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,068
- It doesn't even make sense to be singing.
- I don't want to talk about -

847
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:03,800
- What?
- What's up?

848
01:03:03,874 --> 01:03:05,808
What's up?
What do you mean, "What's up"?

849
01:03:05,876 --> 01:03:08,107
- You want a drink?
- I'd love one.

850
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:10,841
- Good, get one over there.
- Yeah, drinks over there.

851
01:03:10,915 --> 01:03:13,248
Over there, man. Drinks over there.
The whole song -

852
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:16,016
It would sound ridiculous
the other way, you know?

853
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:18,080
- I'd want to do it, you know -
- Lelia, let's -

854
01:03:18,158 --> 01:03:20,092
I'm not ready, David.
David, I'm -

855
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,095
Do I look ready? No.

856
01:03:22,163 --> 01:03:24,290
Therefore, wait.
Be comfortable and wait.

857
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:26,300
- Lelia, it's getting late.
- Well, wait.

858
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,034
I'm not gonna say I'm gonna sing
all the things like that.

859
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:37,842
- Were you just doing "Lucky Day"?
- Yeah.

860
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:40,146
I know that song.
I'm doing it in my nightclub act.

861
01:03:40,218 --> 01:03:42,152
- Great, man. Great.
- Oh, boy. That's terrific.

862
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,553
No, but really.
I know it, and he's doing it wrong.

863
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:46,615
Oh, really?
You want to show him how to do it?

864
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:49,686
That's wrong, man. You're dragging it
through the middle. It's a up tune, man.

865
01:03:49,763 --> 01:03:51,958
- It has to go and swing.
- You tell him, now.

866
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:55,525
- You know, you know.
- See? Now, that's the right idea.

867
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:59,768
Oh, wow. Isn't this -

868
01:03:59,842 --> 01:04:03,176
Hey, Bennie. Isn't this great?

869
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:10,654
Hey, Bennie. Isn't he a smash?

870
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,419
What do you think you're doing?
What do you think you're doing here?

871
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:16,656
- I was explaining that song.
- I didn't ask you to interrupt
my brother's business.

872
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:19,062
- He was singing it wrong.
- He makes the money, not you.

873
01:04:19,132 --> 01:04:21,191
<i>- You don't understand.</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

874
01:04:21,268 --> 01:04:24,032
I didn't ask you to come in here
and disturb my relatives.

875
01:04:24,105 --> 01:04:27,007
<i>So please sit down and be quiet.</i>

876
01:04:29,211 --> 01:04:31,874
Did you hear that?
Wasn't it great?

877
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:34,416
Marvelous.

878
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:37,079
- Where is he?
- Are you kidding with this guy?

879
01:04:38,889 --> 01:04:40,824
Rupe, I feel -

880
01:04:47,566 --> 01:04:49,626
I'm a strange one.

881
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,421
Would you mind shaking it up, Lelia?

882
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:09,859
I've been waiting for exactly
two and a half hours.

883
01:05:09,927 --> 01:05:14,456
Do you want to go out with a wreck,
or would you like me to look nice?

884
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:18,266
I want you to look good, but I want you
to shake it up. Do you mind?

885
01:05:18,337 --> 01:05:20,601
You want to go to the dance with me?

886
01:05:20,673 --> 01:05:24,610
<i>- I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to.</i>
- Then you'll wait. I'm not finished yet.

887
01:05:24,678 --> 01:05:26,612
Hey, hey, what's with you two?

888
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,548
Lelia, do you have to
talk to him like that?

889
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:32,553
I'll talk-What do you mean,
"Do I have to talk to him that way"?

890
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:34,714
I wouldn't blame the fella
if he got up and left.

891
01:05:38,795 --> 01:05:41,264
I don't know.

892
01:05:41,332 --> 01:05:43,323
Sure wouldn't let anybody
talk to me like that.

893
01:05:43,401 --> 01:05:46,030
You didn't tell me you had
such a tough sister, man.

894
01:05:46,104 --> 01:05:49,596
- Does she carry on like that
all the time? - Look, I'm just
happy to see her going out.

895
01:05:50,777 --> 01:05:53,302
I'm done.

896
01:05:53,379 --> 01:05:55,905
- How do I look?
- You look nice.

897
01:05:55,983 --> 01:05:58,713
- You be a good boy. Be a good boy.
- Yeah, thank you.

898
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:02,120
- I'll see you. Write to me.
- I'll write, and I'll send the money.

899
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:05,524
Come on, I'm finished.

900
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,529
Come on, let's go.

901
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:13,169
My coat, sir.

902
01:06:41,704 --> 01:06:44,105
Hey.

903
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:48,043
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to Lelia.

904
01:06:48,113 --> 01:06:51,379
Well, you can't talk to Lelia.
I don't want you in here.

905
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,941
- Never mind, don't even talk. Just get out.
- Let me tell you -

906
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:57,115
I don't want to hear anything
you've got to say. Will you go, please?

907
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:00,023
<i>- I don't want to hear anything.</i>
<i>- Please listen to me for a minute.</i>

908
01:07:00,093 --> 01:07:03,689
I don't want to listen to you.
Get out of the place!

909
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:05,757
- Hugh. Let me talk to him.
- Wait a minute.

910
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:10,272
- Wait a minute. This is my problem.
- This is our problem, our problem.

911
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:13,173
- Okay.
- So what do you want?

912
01:07:13,243 --> 01:07:15,269
I just want you
to tell her that I'm sorry.

913
01:07:15,346 --> 01:07:18,941
- All right. He's sorry, he's sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

914
01:07:19,016 --> 01:07:22,009
- Will you tell her that?
- Yes, I will. Most definitely I will tell her.

915
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:25,956
Will you tell her that I realize now...

916
01:07:26,025 --> 01:07:29,257
- there's no difference between us.
- Anything else?

917
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:31,924
She'll always mean a great deal to me.

918
01:07:31,999 --> 01:07:35,231
- Anything else?
- Just tell her that...

919
01:07:35,303 --> 01:07:38,205
Tony said, "I'm sorry."

920
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:41,300
There's no difference
between you and Lelia.

921
01:07:42,578 --> 01:07:44,945
She means a great deal to you.

922
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:48,218
And you're sorry.

923
01:07:49,387 --> 01:07:50,945
<i>Thank you.</i>

924
01:08:17,321 --> 01:08:21,918
You must like to fight or something, man.
You keep pushing people.

925
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:26,764
- See you.
- Okay.

926
01:08:30,637 --> 01:08:32,298
What are you doing?

927
01:08:32,372 --> 01:08:34,307
Getting ready to go to Chicago, buddy.
How about you?

928
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,866
Wait a minute. I'll pack,
and I'll be right with you.

929
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:39,573
Okay. So you meet me
down at the station.

930
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,582
- All right.
- Twenty minutes.

931
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,020
Twenty minutes.

932
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:54,624
- You're a very good dancer.
- Sure.

933
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,102
- You don't believe me?
- I believe you.

934
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:00,401
It's just that I know
I'm a good dancer.

935
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:03,672
Oh, wow. What an ego.

936
01:09:04,845 --> 01:09:08,509
- Do you come here often?
- Yes.

937
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:10,608
I like this place. It swings.

938
01:09:11,787 --> 01:09:14,119
Well, maybe you can
take me here next week.

939
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:16,158
But I didn't ask you.

940
01:09:16,225 --> 01:09:19,218
Well, if I want to go,
I'm sure you'll take me.

941
01:09:19,296 --> 01:09:23,563
Now, look, Lelia, where I come from,
the men do the asking.

942
01:09:23,634 --> 01:09:27,503
- The girls just go yes or no.
- Well.

943
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:30,737
I guess I just don't fit into
that pattern, now, do I?

944
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:35,646
No, you don't. As a matter of fact,
you're just a little too much for me.

945
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:38,685
Well, then why don't you
take me home?

946
01:09:38,753 --> 01:09:41,245
- Why did you ask me in the first place?
- Now, steady, girl.

947
01:09:41,323 --> 01:09:43,348
Do you always shout down
your boyfriends that way?

948
01:09:43,425 --> 01:09:48,295
- I never shout.
- Well, it would seem that way to me.

949
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,266
Look, do you always go around
embarrassing people in front of strangers?

950
01:09:53,337 --> 01:09:55,272
I mean, laughing at them
in front of your family...

951
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:58,674
keeping them waiting for hours
just to show off how masculine you are.

952
01:09:58,744 --> 01:10:00,678
Darling, I'm not masculine.

953
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:03,910
Well, it would seem that way to me.

954
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:06,316
Well, how do you want me to behave?

955
01:10:06,386 --> 01:10:10,721
Look, just dance.
And be as lovely as you look.

956
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:16,288
Look, David, I am what I am,
and nobody tells me what to do.

957
01:10:16,365 --> 01:10:19,164
Look, I don't know who
you think you're fighting.

958
01:10:19,235 --> 01:10:21,396
You know, I saw the way
he looked at you back there.

959
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:24,168
And I also saw the way
he looked at me.

960
01:10:52,409 --> 01:10:56,642
You know, despite
your horrible exterior...

961
01:10:57,748 --> 01:10:59,683
it's you I like.

962
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:31,117
- Hey!
- Come on.

963
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:33,556
- So you finally made it.
- No sweat, man.

964
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:36,254
- Hugh, I've got some bad news.
- The train move?

965
01:11:36,328 --> 01:11:38,263
No.

966
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:41,768
No, I checked with
our telephone service and...

967
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:46,102
there's no point in us going to Cincinnati
because the job is closed out.

968
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:48,540
- What about Chicago?
- It's still there.

969
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:51,136
- So what happened?
- Ackerman.

970
01:11:51,214 --> 01:11:53,842
Ackerman called Cincinnati
at his own expense...

971
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:57,149
and told them
you were being difficult.

972
01:11:57,221 --> 01:11:59,917
- So?
- So that means no Cincinnati.

973
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:05,656
That means we go to Chicago for
a week's billing and come back here...

974
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:09,691
and maybe some cheap, mangy
club owner will give us a job...

975
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,034
- introducing the girlie line.
- Wait a minute, will you?

976
01:12:12,105 --> 01:12:15,303
<i>Or maybe you can sing</i>
<i>to a room full of drunks.</i>

977
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:18,038
Look, we've been in this business
for a long time.

978
01:12:18,112 --> 01:12:22,106
I'm supposed to be a manager.
You're supposed to be a singer. Right?

979
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:26,918
Now who have I ever managed besides
you? And what have you ever done?

980
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:29,425
- Rupe, wait a minute.
<i>- The best job I've been able to get you...</i>

981
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:33,760
is in the Black Rose
in Tucson, Arizona.

982
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:36,460
Rupe, wait a minute, baby. Wait.

983
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:40,370
No, no, I've had it
with this rat race. I've had it.

984
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,500
I'm busted. I'm busted.

985
01:12:42,576 --> 01:12:46,171
<i>I've been insulted by these pigs,</i>
<i>laughed at.</i>

986
01:12:46,246 --> 01:12:50,274
And what's in it for you or for me?
Look, if we've got to be failures...

987
01:12:50,352 --> 01:12:54,187
<i>let's do so in our own city</i>
<i>or get the hell out of here.</i>

988
01:12:54,256 --> 01:12:57,283
- Out of where, man?
- Here, the States.

989
01:12:57,361 --> 01:13:01,298
We'll go to Paris, France, Africa.
I don't care.

990
01:13:01,366 --> 01:13:03,834
It's going to be the same
no matter where we go.

991
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:08,532
- Look, I have had it.
<i>- Rupert, wait a minute.</i>

992
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:12,476
Do you believe in me?
Rupert, do you believe in me?

993
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:14,479
<i>I don't mean what</i>
<i>those other people think of me.</i>

994
01:13:14,547 --> 01:13:19,212
I mean what we give each other.
You know, what comes out of both of us.

995
01:13:19,286 --> 01:13:21,619
Your talent, my voice.

996
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:24,420
Man, when you're on time,
you're still not on time.

997
01:13:24,493 --> 01:13:27,793
<i>Rupe, do you believe this?</i>
<i>Because, Rupert...</i>

998
01:13:27,864 --> 01:13:31,301
I believe that you're
the greatest manager in the world.

999
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:33,495
<i>And we're together.</i>

1000
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:35,835
Rupe, you're the greatest
manager in the world.

1001
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,082
Come on, let's go.

1002
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:22,559
<i>Next week, Eastland's.</i>

1003
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,928
<i>Move, will you? Come on.</i>

1004
01:14:24,999 --> 01:14:27,059
Hey.

1005
01:14:27,136 --> 01:14:30,766
Hey.

1006
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:36,142
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Almost hit me, the dirty-

1007
01:14:42,254 --> 01:14:44,189
You ready?
Make the announcement.

1008
01:14:44,257 --> 01:14:46,589
Girls, the Happiness Boys
singing "Up On The Moonbeam."

1009
01:14:46,659 --> 01:14:48,593
Girls, the Happiness Boys.

1010
01:15:04,815 --> 01:15:08,980
Hit it, boys.

1011
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:15,524
Hey, man!

1012
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,586
Hey, Bennie.

1013
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:21,892
- Hey. What's going on here?
- Take it easy. Leave him alone.

1014
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:25,097
Get out of here.
We're with these girls.

1015
01:15:25,173 --> 01:15:27,301
<i>- So what's the story?</i>
<i>- What are you guys doing here?</i>

1016
01:15:27,376 --> 01:15:30,675
We just came in here,
and we're clowning around.

1017
01:15:30,746 --> 01:15:32,681
Go clown around somewhere else,
huh, buddy?

1018
01:15:32,749 --> 01:15:34,910
- Take it easy. We're only kidding.
- We're with these girls.

1019
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:37,180
Shut up, punk.

1020
01:15:37,254 --> 01:15:39,245
- Wait a minute.
- What do you mean, "Take it easy"?

1021
01:15:39,323 --> 01:15:43,624
- I mean take it easy.
- Hands off, buddy.

1022
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:46,324
Take your hands off me.

1023
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:48,594
Let's see you imitate somebody now,
stool pigeon.

1024
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:50,660
We're only kidding around, buddy.
All right, come on.

1025
01:15:50,737 --> 01:15:52,671
Come on, man. Don't get excited.

1026
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:54,867
Listen for a second.
What you want to fight for?

1027
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:57,309
Just get your hands off.
You want to tangle ass, let's go.

1028
01:15:57,378 --> 01:15:59,745
- Let's go.
<i>- Take it easy, brother.</i>

1029
01:16:04,287 --> 01:16:06,778
- You're gonna get yours, brother.
- Come on, mother. You for me.

1030
01:16:06,856 --> 01:16:09,849
- You're for me too, boy.
- You're just the guy I want.

1031
01:16:09,927 --> 01:16:12,725
- All right, let's go!
- Yeah? Come on!

1032
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:34,620
My eye, my eye!

1033
01:16:52,178 --> 01:16:54,305
You -

1034
01:16:54,381 --> 01:16:56,942
I'll kill you!

1035
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:08,970
- How about it, Jonathan? Tell him.
- Three beers.

1036
01:18:09,972 --> 01:18:14,968
- He wants to - He's all shook up.
- No more of this jazz for me, baby.

1037
01:18:15,046 --> 01:18:17,014
You can go home
for a week and cool it.

1038
01:18:17,081 --> 01:18:20,745
So what are you gonna do?
We went out to have a ball, didn't we?

1039
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:23,310
- That's what we did.
- So you gotta pay the price, man.

1040
01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:26,223
If you get beat up, you get beat up.

1041
01:18:28,395 --> 01:18:30,455
I don't know why we do this, man.

1042
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:34,263
- I mean, go around, try to pick up girls.
- Stupid broads.

1043
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:39,070
You'd think we'd have girls of our own
like every normal type guy.

1044
01:18:39,142 --> 01:18:41,372
<i>So?</i>

1045
01:18:41,444 --> 01:18:43,743
<i>So I'm not gonna do it anymore.</i>

1046
01:18:43,814 --> 01:18:47,181
Want me to be corny and say
this has taught me a lesson?

1047
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:51,746
- Well, it's taught me a lesson.
<i>- Aw, just forget about it.</i>

1048
01:18:51,823 --> 01:18:53,758
Okay, forget about it.

1049
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,092
Uh. Yeah, okay.
Forget about it.

1050
01:18:58,465 --> 01:19:02,368
- I'm gonna shove off. Okay, Bennie?
- Okay.

1051
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:05,235
- All right. I'll see you.
- So long.

1052
01:19:05,306 --> 01:19:08,799
I'll see you, Dennis.
Yeah, you too.

1053
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,479
So long.

1054
01:19:12,549 --> 01:19:14,915
I gotta get a pack of cigarettes.
