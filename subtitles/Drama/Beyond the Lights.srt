we were living in this awful

where they all said I'd be.

1080

you started singing.

I started laughing.

And that made you laugh,
and then we're both there laughing.

the morning after the concert,

1168
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,100
this came through my fax machine.

1169
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,380
It's a, uh, letter of termination.

1170
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,220
We never sent a letter of termination.

1171

- That was sent by mistake.
- Excuse me?

1172
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,260
I... I drafted it as a precaution.

1173
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,420
I-I left it on my desk.
My assistant must have sent it. I...

1174
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:08,782
It was a mistake, Noni, I apologize.

1175
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,780
I know the legalese
can be a bit complicated, Liam.

1176
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,940
The thing is, once that comes
through a fax machine,

1177
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,660
it's legally binding.

1178
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,260
- So as of now, there is no deal.

you said I wouldn't re-sign.

you were always my manager.

I was your father,
