1
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,080
 - Did you say it might take a while?
 - lt's OK.

2
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,640
 - We could phone them.
 - No, it's OK.

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,160
 lt could take till tonight,
 depending on how things go.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 - lt's a strange story.
 - Really?

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,679
 Well, it seems that

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,680
 someone has been passing himself off

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,359
 as Mohsen Makhmalbaf, do you know him?

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,959
 - A businessman?
 - No, not at all.

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,479
 Do l turn left here?

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 He's not a businessman, he's a filmmaker.

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,799
 - Do you know him?
 - No.

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,799
 The Cyclist is his latest film.

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,800
 l've no time for the cinema!

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,880
 He's a filmmaker,
 but his face isn't very well-known.

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,360
 And this guy told a family
 he was Makhmalbaf.

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,160
 lt's not clear what his intentions were.

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,160
 He chose a few members
 of this family to be actors

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 and told them their house was ideal

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,720
 as the location for his next film.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,040
 But no one knows
 what his intentions really are.

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,440
 l'm a journalist and l'm going there

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,479
 to cover his arrest.

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,480
 - You're a journalist?
 - For Sorush Magazine.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 l thought you were a policeman!

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,919
 That's funny!

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,679
 l was told about this case

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,519
 and l thought it would make a good story.

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,520
 l'm going to follow
 this case through to the end.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 You don't hear of a story like this every day.

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 Godsends like this only come
 a couple of times in your career.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,399
 lt's a hot news item.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
 Sensational news.
 The kind of news that boosts sales.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 lt's what l call an Oriana-style story.

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,680
 By the way, do you know Fallaci?

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,599
 No.

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,879
 Bogdanovich? Edisson?

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,359
 They're fellow journalists.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,360
 They're not my clients!

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,719
 But they're fellow journalists.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 They write sensational reports.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,560
 Oriana Fallaci writes
 some very original articles.

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,480
 She has a gift for finding stories
 that no one else does.

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,200
 She has a worldwide reputation.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,160
 And l'm sure this is
 a new Oriana-style report.

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,560
 l must find out if he had any illicit plans

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,679
 such as stealing from them.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,680
 l'll know that once he's been arrested,

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,520
 so l'll need you till tonight.

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,919
 - Fine by me.
 - Good.

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
 Give your boss a call when we get there.

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 lt's OK, l don't work for them
 full-time anyway.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
 l'm a retired fighter pilot.

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,160
 l'm one of the ground staff now!

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,360
 Funny, a pilot working on the ground!

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,520
 That could be a good scoop, too!

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,639
 - Left here?
 - Yes.

57
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,640
 - To Lavizan?
 - Yes, then Hosseinabad Avenue.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
 Lavizan is a nice area.
 l lived there before the Revolution.

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,399
 l left when the unrest started

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
 at the Lavizan garrison.

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,279
 When the soldiers rioted...

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
 l haven't been back since.

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,280
 We're going to Javanshir Avenue.

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,680
 Keep going, l'll ask someone the way.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,200
 Let's see if this boy can help.

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,960
 - Excuse me. Where's Javanshir Avenue?
 - l don't know.

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
 - He doesn't know.
 - Ask an adult.

68
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,759
 Let's ask this man.

69
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 Excuse me. Where is Golzar Avenue?

70
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,359
 l don't know.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,439
 - Want a turkey?
 - No.

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,440
 We're off to see a family
 who were made turkeys of!

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,079
 How did you hear of this story?

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,080
 A composer friend called me
 and said strange things were afoot

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,879
 in his friend's house.

76
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,880
 lt's a strange place to choose.

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,239
 Where's Golzar Avenue?

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,240
 Straight on, then left
 just after the supermarket.

79
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 - Straight on, then left?
 - Yes.

80
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,760
 Thanks.

81
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,280
 This is a once-in-a-lifetime story
 for a journalist.

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 You can't imagine how impatient l am

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,920
 to see this report on the front page.

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,639
 lt'll cause a sensation.

85
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,479
 Everyone in TV and cinema

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 will talk about it.

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,959
 Let me see...

88
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 First Avenue off Golzar Avenue.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Here it is. First Avenue.

90
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,840
 That way.

91
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,040
 ls this it?

92
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,559
 Yes, but it's a dead end.

93
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,560
 lt's strange that this sensational news

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,039
 should come from a dead end!

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,559
 Just my luck!

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,560
 12... 14... 16...

97
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,520
 Here it is. What a strange place.

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
 - Wait here.
 - OK.

99
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,680
 - Yes?
 - Hello, it's Mr Farazmand.

100
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,719
 He might see you from the window.

101
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
 Stay in the car till l call you.

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,560
 Tell the plaintiff to bring
 his complaint and his lD papers.

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,880
 - Complaint and papers.
 - Right.

104
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
 Don't the police have their own vehicle?

105
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,999
 Yes, they do.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The journalist will have quite a bill to pay.

107
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,639
 - Smoke?
 - No, thanks.

108
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 - Where are you from?
 - lspahan.

109
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
 Funny... l'm from Tehran
 and l did national service in lspahan.

110
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,959
 And you do the opposite!

111
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,960
 That's fate!

112
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,520
 - Are you from lspahan too?
 - No, Borujerd.

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,240
 Actually l'm not from lspahan,
 but a village near Naeem.

114
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
 - Naeem's near Yazd, right?
 - Yes, my village is Jandagh.

115
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,200
 - How long do you have left?
 - l've done one year.

116
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
 l still have two years to do,
 because l'm not married.

117
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,759
 l'm off to the front soon.

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,159
 - Where?
 - Kurdistan.

119
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,160
 - Near Baneh?
 - Yes.

120
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
 lt'll be over soon.
 Then you can go home and get married!

121
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,839
 As long as God grants you good health...

122
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
 - And you?
 - l'm married.

123
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,759
 - Any children?
 - Yes, one.

124
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,760
 God bless him.

125
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,880
 - Mr Abolfazl Ahankhah?
 - Yes.

126
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,280
 - ls he armed?
 - l don't think so.

127
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 Hang on! l've forgotten my case.

128
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,560
 Look, if you tell me the truth...

129
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,199
 l can help you.

130
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
 To you l'm just a crook.

131
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,639
 Did he have one?

132
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,599
 There's no one home.

133
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 But l really need a tape recorder.

134
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,479
 Go to HQ. l'll see you there.

135
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,719
 - What about the fare?
 - How much is it?

136
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 350 tomans.

137
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
 Mr Ahankhah, give me 200 tomans.

138
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,560
 Sorry about this.

139
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 Here. l'll join you at HQ.

140
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,319
 l have to find a tape recorder.

141
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,320
 - We don't know them.
 - l need one.

142
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,360
 - Yes?
 - lt was a mistake!

143
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 They're away.

144
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,360
 - Yes?
 - Excuse me, l'm Mr Farazmand.

145
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 l'm a journalist and friend
 of your neighbour, Mr Ahankhah.

146
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,560
 l need a portable tape recorder.

147
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,799
 We don't have a recorder.

148
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,800
 Thanks anyway.

149
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
 - Yes?
 - Excuse me, l'm Mr Farazmand.

150
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,040
 l'm a journalist and friend
 of your neighbour, Mr Ahankhah.

151
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 - l need a tape recorder.
 - We don't have one.

152
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,320
 - You don't have one?
 - No.

153
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 l'm Mr Farazmand...

154
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,239
 - Mr Farazmand!
 - Yes?

155
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,759
 Here's one.

156
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
 You'll get it back.

157
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
 CLOSE-UP

 BOGUS MAKHMALBAF ARRESTED

166
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
 - Who's in charge?
 - Captain Bashiri.

167
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,799
 - Can l see him?
 - l'll call him.

168
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,800
 Captain! Someone to see you.

169
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,959
 - Hello, Captain.
 - Hello.

170
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 l read in Sorush Magazine
 that a certain Hossein Sabzian

171
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,959
 was arrested by your men.

172
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,960
 Yes, we have a copy of the magazine.

173
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,519
 Do you want to see it?

174
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 Barati, bring me the magazine.

175
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,319
 l already read the article,

176
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,320
 but could you give me some more details?

177
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 l don't remember.
 lt was two weeks ago.

178
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 As you can see, we're very busy here.

179
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,440
 Could you give me...

180
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 the address of the house
 where it happened?

181
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,480
 l'll have to check the file. Go get it.

182
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,839
 - Two weeks ago?
 - Yes.

183
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,719
 lt was published recently!

184
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 One week after it happened.

185
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
 - Was he detained here?
 - For a few days.

186
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,240
 What kind of man is he?

187
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
 He claimed to be quite religious.

188
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,119
 Were you there when he was arrested?

189
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,999
 Yes.

190
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 - Did he resist arrest?
 - Not at all.

191
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,120
 - What kind of man is he?
 - He surrendered...

192
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 - Pardon me?
 - He didn't struggle.

193
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 - What kind of man is he?
 - Not the kind to do such things.

194
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,199
 What do you mean?

195
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
 He didn't look the kind who plans a fraud.

196
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 - Not the kind...
 - Not at all.

197
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,439
 l'd like Mr Ahankhah's address.

198
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
 You seem to know a lot about it.
 His house is...

199
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 l'll note it down.

200
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 Number 16, First Avenue
 off Golzar Avenue in Lavizan.

201
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Mr Kiarostami, the people
 concerned by this case

202
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,880
 wish to be presented in a favourable light.

203
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,080
 Mr Farazmand claimed that the truth
 would not have come out

204
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,679
 if it hadn't been for him.

205
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,599
 That's not true.

206
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
 l knew exactly what was going on
 and l always had the situation

207
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,159
 perfectly under control.

208
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
 l played along with him,
 so it'd serve as a lesson to my children.

209
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,120
 But you're giving me a different version

210
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,239
 and l'm confused.

211
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,240
 The report doesn't tell the whole story.

212
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,480
 What do you mean by that?

213
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 The article portrays us as simple people.
 That's not true.

214
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,719
 What do you mean?

215
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 l like the movies, but that doesn't mean

216
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 l'd do what it says in the article.

217
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,920
 l was glad my mother met Mr Makhmalbaf.

218
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,519
 That's a fact.

219
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,520
 l thought that meeting him

220
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,599
 could've been useful to me, too.

221
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,559
 l have a degree in civil engineering,

222
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 but l haven't yet found a job in my field.

223
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,159
 And my brother,

224
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,160
 who's a mechanical engineer, sells bread.

225
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,079
 Mehrdad...

226
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,080
 l had the choice
 between art and selling bread.

227
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,959
 l chose art.

228
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,399
 Manuchehrdoesn't sell bread.

229
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,400
 He's the directorofa bread factory.

230
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,719
 But Mum, come on...

231
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 Could you speak Persian?

232
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
 lt's true, my brother didn't do
 all those studies to sell bread.

233
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,519
 When did you graduate?

234
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,279
 Six months ago.

235
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
 l'm sure you'll soon find a good job.

236
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 Amir, Hossein and Hushang
 graduated over a year ago

237
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
 and only Amir got a job for six months.

238
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
 The factories aren't hiring.
 They lack raw materials.

239
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,880
 l came to talk about Mr Sabzian.

240
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,959
 Can you tell me anything about him?

241
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,879
 - Where is he now?
 - ln prison.

242
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,880
 - Where?
 - Ghasr.

243
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 - Hello. Mr Sabzian?
 - Yes.

244
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,960
 - Detained for?
 - Attempted fraud.

245
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
 You have a visitor.

246
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,280
 - Are you well?
 - Yes, thanks.

247
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,439
 - Do you know me?
 - Yes.

248
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
 l read a report on you
 and l decided to come see you.

249
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
 - ln what magazine?
 - Sorush.

250
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,999
 Apparently you're interested in cinema.

251
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 As l'm a filmmaker, l wanted to talk to you.

252
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,160
 - And you are...
 - Kiarostami.

253
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
 l'm surprised, Mr Kiarostami.

254
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,160
 l've seen your films.

255
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 Can l do anything for you?

256
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,840
 You could make a film about my suffering.

257
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 l can't promise anything,
 but l'd like to talk to you.

258
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
 What did they write about me?
 That l'm a crook?

259
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,240
 Apparently you confessed
 to attempted fraud.

260
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 Yes, l did confess.

261
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,160
 - But l'm not a crook.
 - Really?

262
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
 Why did you confess you were, then?

263
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 Because what l did
 looks like fraud from the outside.

264
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
 - But what is it really?
 - l'm interested in cinema.

265
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,520
 How long have you been in prison?

266
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,920
 l'm not sure.

267
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
 - About three weeks.
 - When's the trial?

268
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,799
 l don't know.

269
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 The courts don't like this kind of case.

270
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,959
 l'll try to bring your trial forward.

271
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,960
 l'd be grateful.

272
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
 l have no more questions, Captain.

273
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
 l have a message for Mr Makhmalbaf.

274
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,159
 What is it?

275
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,160
 Tell him The Cyclist is a part of me.

276
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 l'll tell him.

277
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,839
 lf you'll excuse me...

278
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,679
 Goodbye.

279
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,680
 Goodbye. Tell me if you need anything.

280
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,759
 - Which block are you in?
 - Block 5.

281
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 - Nothing you need?
 - No.

282
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,560
 We came on Tuesday
 concerning the Sabzian case.

283
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,759
 l don't remember.

284
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,760
 The man who pretended
 to be Mr Makhmalbaf.

285
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,639
 l have stacks of files.

286
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
 l can't remember everyone's name...

287
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
 Could you be more precise?

288
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,720
 l came on Tuesday.
 You said you'd speak to Haj Agha

289
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 and tell us his answer.

290
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,679
 We'd like to film the trial.

291
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,680
 That's right, l remember now.

292
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,840
 l passed it on to Haj Agha.

293
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,240
 Excuse me, did you study the Sabzian file?

294
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,279
 - The one you want to film?
 - Yes.

295
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,039
 Yes.

296
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,040
 We need your authorisation
 to shoot our film.

297
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,640
 We'd like the date of the trial
 to be brought forward.

298
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 lt was set for January 19,
 but we'd like it brought forward.

299
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,080
 Yes, it was January 19.

300
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,560
 Why do you want it brought forward?

301
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,079
 What's the rush?

302
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 For our shooting schedule.

303
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,120
 We also need a permit...

304
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,680
 to film in the courtroom.

305
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,080
 There's nothing about this case
 that's worth filming.

306
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,199
 - Did you study the file?
 - Yes.

307
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,200
 This case interests us,
 because it has a connection...

308
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,959
 with the cinema.

309
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
 Do you have more interesting cases?

310
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,040
 We have cases
 where the charges are more serious.

311
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 This is a small fraud case

312
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,760
 concerning the fact that he received
 1 ,900 tomans from Mr Ahankhah

313
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,520
 apparently to take a taxi.

314
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,840
 He also passed himself off
 as Mr Makhmalbaf.

315
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,400
 Will you allow us
 to film in the courtroom?

316
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Only if the authorities allow it.

317
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,320
 - That is?
 - The Department of Justice.

318
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,599
 lf they OK it, l will.

319
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,600
 - We have your agreement?
 - You do.

320
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,880
 Scene 1 , Shot 1 ,
 Law Courts, December 10.

321
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,240
 Mr Sabzian, do you remember me?
 We've met before.

322
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,319
 Yes, Ghasr Prison.

323
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,399
 We'd like to film the trial.

324
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
 Do you agree to us doing that?

325
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,799
 Yes.

326
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,800
 Because you're my audience.

327
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,039
 - Who is?
 - You are.

328
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,679
 Why's that?

329
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,680
 - Because of my passion.
 - Which passion?

330
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,239
 Art.

331
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,839
 Film.

332
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,840
 We have two cameras,
 one with a close-up lens.

333
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,199
 - Know what a close-up is?
 - Yes.

334
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
 - The other camera...
 - No, l don't know.

335
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,799
 lt's used to zoom in on things.

336
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,800
 The other lens, a wide-angle,
 films the proceedings.

337
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,080
 This one stays on you all the time.

338
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,799
 When l met you in prison,

339
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
 you told me you would plead guilty.

340
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 But certain things
 are more complex than they seem.

341
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 This camera is here
 so you can explain things

342
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
 which people might
 find it hard to understand.

343
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,520
 They will begin by reading the charges.

344
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,039
 lf anything seems unacceptable to you

345
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,079
 from a legal point of view

346
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,080
 and you wish to explain,
 address this camera.

347
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,719
 OK.

348
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,799
 - Are you ready?
 - Yes.

349
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 ln the name of God...

350
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,960
 The accused, Mr Hossein Sabzian.

351
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
 Who are the plaintiffs?

352
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,040
 Mr Ahankhah, Mrs Mohseni
 and Mehrdad Ahankhah.

353
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,440
 - Three plaintiffs in all?
 - Yes.

354
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,960
 Before we proceed,
 l invite the two parties

355
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,520
 to settle their differences amicably.

356
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,680
 lf the plaintiffs do not wish

357
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 to withdraw their complaint,

358
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,520
 we shall begin the trial.

359
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,760
 As the head of the family,
 l am not in a position

360
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,239
 to withdraw my complaint.

361
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,240
 l've asked my son Mehrdad
 to talk on our behalf.

362
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,280
 Very well. Let us begin.

363
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,680
 Mr Ahankhah, could you give us
 your side of the story?

364
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,560
 Mr Hossein Sabzian
 approached our family...

365
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,240
 passing himself off as Mr Makhmalbaf...

366
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,200
 and was clearly intending...

367
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 at best...

368
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,599
 to commit fraud...

369
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,600
 and at worst, a burglary.

370
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,599
 He was thwarted...

371
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
 thanks to my father's vigilance...

372
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,400
 and was arrested.

373
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,640
 THE CYCLlST

374
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Excuse me, where did you get that book?

375
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,880
 Where did you buy that book?

376
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,679
 ln a bookshop.

377
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,119
 Could you give me the address?

378
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,639
 You can have it.

379
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,359
 No, thank you. l want to buy it.

380
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,679
 lt's yours.

381
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,919
 l wrote it.

382
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,920
 - You wrote it?
 - Yes.

383
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,239
 Are you Mr Makhmalbaf?

384
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,240
 - Yes.
 - Pleased to meet you.

385
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,359
 That's very kind of you.

386
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,360
 l'll sign it for you.

387
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
 - Thank you.
 - You're welcome.

388
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
 How come you use public transport
 to get around?

389
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,719
 Why does that surprise you?

390
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,720
 Famous directors
 usually use their own cars.

391
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 They don't take the bus.

392
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,759
 l often take the bus

393
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,760
 to look for interesting subjects.

394
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,239
 Did you see my film?

395
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
 Yes, with my children. l liked it a lot.

396
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,759
 - Just once?
 - Yes.

397
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,760
 You have to see it several times
 to fully understand it.

398
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,240
 My children were more interested.

399
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,839
 Really?

400
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,279
 Yes, my two sons.

401
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,239
 - They're engineers.
 - Which was more interested?

402
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,240
 The younger one was more enthusiastic.

403
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
 - He saw it, too?
 - Yes, we saw it together.

404
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,160
 - What did he think about it?
 - He liked it.

405
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,120
 - Did he have any questions?
 - No.

406
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,879
 What does he do?

407
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 Both my sons are engineers.
 The elder one's a mechanical engineer.

408
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,240
 He works
 in a bread factory in Mazandaran.

409
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,040
 The younger one

410
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 doesn't have a job yet.

411
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
 He helps out at a computing firm.
 He studied civil engineering.

412
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
 My daughter here just took
 her university entrance exams.

413
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,520
 Oh, she's your daughter, is she?

414
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,240
 She has finished her schooling.

415
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,360
 What are your son's interests?

416
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,720
 He's interested in art and literature.

417
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,519
 Has he written any screenplays?

418
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,599
 Just for himself.

419
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,600
 - He's interested in cinema?
 - Yes, he is.

420
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 - And drawing?
 - Yes, that's his speciality.

421
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,680
 So he's interested in art?

422
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,160
 Very much so.

423
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,520
 My sons will be thrilled to hear

424
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,759
 l met you.

425
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,359
 lf they wish, they can contact me.

426
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,199
 What's your address?

427
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,200
 lt's on the back,
 along with the phone number.

428
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,799
 Thank you. l'll tell them.

429
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
 Could l have your number?
 Then, l could call them.

430
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
 Here's some paper.

431
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,560
 l have a pen, too.

432
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,360
 - Here's your pen.
 - Thanks.

433
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,079
 What's your name?

434
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,080
 Ahankhah.

435
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,480
 Stop, l want to get off.

436
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,480
 - You want to get off?
 - Yes. Excuse me.

437
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 - l hope l'll see you again.
 - Thank you.

438
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 What do you mean by ''fraud''?

439
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,919
 What exactly did he do?

440
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,999
 Well, he passed himself off

441
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 as Mr Makhmalbaf, the filmmaker.

442
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,120
 He examined all the rooms of the house,

443
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,920
 pretending he wanted to film there,

444
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,120
 so as to gather information
 to carry out a burglary.

445
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,240
 Mr Hossein Sabzian,
 you are accused of fraud

446
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,999
 and attempted fraud.

447
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 You are to defend yourself
 on these two counts.

448
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,640
 Do you acknowledge the charges
 you are accused of?

449
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 lf you do, explain how you intended
 to carry them out.

450
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,719
 The burglary...

451
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,359
 You're not on trial for that.

452
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,360
 You are accused
 of fraud and attempted fraud.

453
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,840
 l never intended to defraud anyone.

454
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,800
 Legally, it might be
 an acceptable charge.

455
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,880
 But morally, it is not.

456
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,360
 This all arose
 from my love of the arts.

457
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,239
 As a child, l often went to the cinema.

458
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,240
 l played at making films with my friends.

459
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,159
 But as l didn't have the means,

460
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,160
 l had to abandon my artistic pretensions.

461
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,760
 lt became an obsession.

462
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,880
 A crook, however,
 deliberately changes his appearance.

463
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,240
 He comes along in a borrowed car,
 carrying a briefcase...

464
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,439
 so he looks convincing.

465
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,440
 l never did that.

466
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,599
 That was not my intention.

467
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,600
 What was your motive for passing
 yourself off as Mr Makhmalbaf?

468
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,599
 Tell the court.

469
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 l admire him, because he...

470
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 portrays suffering in his films.

471
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,680
 ln fact, he spoke out for people like me,

472
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,200
 especially in Marriage ofthe Blessed.

473
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,680
 Just like Mr Kiarostami
 did in The Traveller.

474
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
 l'm like the little boy in the film
 who takes photos of people

475
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,719
 although his camera isn't loaded,

476
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,720
 so he can go to Tehran
 to see a soccer match.

477
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,480
 But he falls asleep and misses the match.

478
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,800
 l too have the feeling l missed the match.

479
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,960
 l know that my actions
 can't be justified legally,

480
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,360
 but my love of art
 should be taken into account.

481
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,479
 You haven't answered the question.

482
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,480
 Why did you pass yourself off
 as Mr Makhmalbaf

483
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,120
 if you didn't intend to commit fraud?

484
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,480
 Wouldn't you call that fraud?

485
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,240
 l liked interpreting this character.

486
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,600
 One of the plaintiffs
 claims that the accused

487
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,039
 received 1 ,900 tomans from him.

488
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,040
 Tell us about that.

489
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,360
 On leaving the house after his first visit,

490
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,399
 he saw a motorbike.

491
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
 He asked me if it belonged to me.

492
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
 He asked me to give him a lift home.

493
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,640
 So l agreed. As we left...

494
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,040
 he said that if anything happened to him...

495
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,480
 his admirers and his film crew...

496
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,680
 would avenge him by coming to our house

497
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,919
 and ransacking it.

498
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,079
 We laughed at that.

499
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,080
 As we rode along...

500
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
 he answered me
 as if he were Makhmalbaf.

501
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,920
 He talked about his filmmaking.

502
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,960
 l asked him a few questions.

503
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
 He answered my questions

504
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 sometimes very intelligently,

505
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,520
 sometimes very evasively.

506
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,239
 l just thought that he didn't want

507
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,240
 to expand on every aspect
 of his filmmaking.

508
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,040
 Then he said he'd had
 an interesting idea for a film.

509
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,240
 He said, ''Two people are on a motorbike...

510
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,520
 ''and one loses his wallet.''

511
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,720
 l asked if that had happened to him

512
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,879
 and he said yes.

513
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,880
 As he got off, he said
 he needed some money.

514
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,039
 l thought that, to get home,

515
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 he'd need 50 or 100 tomans.

516
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 But he said that he needed to buy
 something costing 1 ,500 tomans.

517
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,559
 When l gave him the money,

518
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,560
 he said he needed another 500,
 that 2,000 would be perfect.

519
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,080
 l kept 50 back...

520
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,880
 because l needed some myself.

521
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,639
 And l gave him the rest.

522
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,399
 He put it in his pocket.

523
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,400
 Then he said that the screenplay

524
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 that he had conceived finished like that...

525
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,280
 One of the two men,
 the one with some money,

526
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,760
 lent some to the one
 who had lost his money.

527
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,480
 And it was the start of a great friendship.

528
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,760
 l was delighted to have met a director

529
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,080
 who was humble enough
 to borrow money off me.

530
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,400
 - Did you receive 1 ,900 tomans?
 - Yes.

531
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,679
 Did you need the money or was it...

532
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,719
 just to test his generosity?

533
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,479
 l did need the money.

534
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,239
 Does that justify your actions?

535
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,319
 No.

536
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,320
 With the court's permission,
 tell us the reason for your behaviour

537
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,680
 and why you chose
 to pass yourself off as Makhmalbaf.

538
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,400
 Being Makhmalbaf was very difficult.

539
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,280
 Why's that?
 You yourself decided to be him.

540
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,880
 lt was hard for me...

541
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,040
 to assume his identity.

542
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,520
 lt wasn't easy to be believable doing that.

543
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,239
 - What?
 - Being Makhmalbaf.

544
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,240
 lt was hard to play the part of a director.

545
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,280
 But it gave me self-confidence.

546
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,360
 And l won their respect.

547
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,680
 - Whose respect?
 - The members of the family.

548
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,240
 They did everything l told them.

549
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,400
 lf l'd asked them, say, to move a cupboard,

550
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,480
 or to cut down a tree,
 they would have done it.

551
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,760
 Before that, l'd never been able
 to get my views across.

552
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,520
 People were reluctant to do what l said.

553
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,360
 But then, by acting like this famous person,

554
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,759
 l made them all obey me.

555
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,760
 When l left the house
 and l had to accept the money

556
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,040
 to buy something for my son

557
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,640
 and pay for my trip home, l realised...

558
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,320
 that l was still a poor guy
 who couldn't even support his family

559
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,880
 and who lived in a godforsaken place.

560
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,360
 When l woke up the next day

561
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960
 and still had no job,

562
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 l understood nothing had changed.

563
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,360
 lt was hard to go on playing this part.

564
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,760
 lt was very hard
 to pretend to be someone else.

565
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,840
 But at the same time, l liked it...

566
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,600
 above all, because they respected me

567
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,120
 and supported me morally.
 So l really got into the part.

568
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,320
 l started to believe l actually was a director.

569
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,080
 l really felt it.

570
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,880
 l wasn't acting any more.

571
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
 l really became this new character.

572
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,440
 But when l left that place

573
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,720
 and went home at the end of the day,

574
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,560
 l had to shed my character
 and that was hard for me.

575
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,559
 Did the money make it easier

576
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,560
 for you to go on playing this role?

577
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,800
 Yes, a director cannot be poor.

578
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,959
 He must have money.

579
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,960
 He cannot be so poor

580
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,400
 that he is unable

581
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,680
 to give his family

582
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,679
 the means to get by with dignity.

583
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,519
 That's why it was so hard for me

584
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,520
 to go on with my role as director
 the next few days.

585
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,120
 On the other hand, they trusted me

586
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,680
 and their trust gave me confidence.

587
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,840
 lt gave you confidence
 that he lent you money?

588
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,439
 Yes, when he lent me money,

589
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,439
 l realised

590
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,440
 that he was convinced
 that l was a director.

591
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,560
 You didn't intend to give it back?

592
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,999
 l did, but...

593
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 l didn't know how l could go about doing it.

594
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,360
 On top of that...

595
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,400
 he was so keen on acting in a film

596
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,160
 that l would've loved
 to have the means to make one.

597
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,640
 We began to have doubts
 the following Thursday.

598
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,240
 He insisted we all go
 see the film The Cyclist.

599
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,760
 He said we could discuss the film,
 that it'd serve

600
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,519
 as a point of departure

601
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,520
 for our film, The House ofthe Spider.

602
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,520
 The Cyclist was on at two cinemas.
 One was near our house.

603
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,320
 But he wanted us to go

604
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,080
 to the one that was
 a long way from our home.

605
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,560
 He claimed that it was showing

606
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,399
 a less censored version of the film,

607
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,400
 so we had to see it in this cinema.

608
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,720
 That's one of the things
 that started us thinking.

609
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,680
 When we pointed out
 that we didn't have a car,

610
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,239
 he said that it didn't matter.

611
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,959
 He even asked a friend of ours

612
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,279
 to take his father's car.

613
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,280
 He said that he wouldn't come with us.

614
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,720
 Otherwise his admirers
 would bother us outside the cinema.

615
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,639
 Mr Sabzian, did you hear that?

616
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,039
 Spite is a veil to conceal art.

617
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,199
 What?

618
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,200
 Spite is a veil to conceal art.

619
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,920
 l should like to ask Mr Ahankhah...

620
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,080
 who accuses me
 of intent to burgle his house...

621
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,799
 You are not accused of that.

622
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,800
 He merely mentioned it in passing.
 lt's not on record.

623
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,280
 So disregard that.

624
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,759
 They claimed that you

625
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,760
 were part of a gang

626
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,920
 who were planning a burglary.

627
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,879
 l categorically deny that.

628
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,880
 They thought you wanted
 to force them out of their house

629
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,640
 so your accomplices
 could go in and steal their possessions.

630
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,240
 - Was that your intention?
 - No.

631
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,240
 But you admit you wanted
 to misappropriate Makhmalbaf's name.

632
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,839
 Yes.

633
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,840
 As he has explained, and you confirmed,

634
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,160
 he had no intent to steal anything.

635
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,560
 But it isn't clear why he wanted

636
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,320
 the whole family to go to the cinema.

637
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,960
 lf you don't mind, l'd like him to explain

638
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,080
 his motives for doing this.

639
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,239
 l wanted them to see the film

640
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,959
 so that they would acquire

641
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,960
 a greater interest in the cinema

642
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,440
 and have more respect for me as a director.

643
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,040
 l wanted them to see me

644
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,520
 as a director who is aware

645
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,080
 of people's sufferings and difficulties.

646
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 A director who is modest enough

647
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,120
 to mingle with ordinary folk.

648
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,560
 l wanted to make them forget
 the idea that a film director

649
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,120
 is different from other people.

650
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,960
 A director should have humility.

651
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 l wanted them to realise

652
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,440
 that a true artist

653
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,600
 is someone who is close to the people

654
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,400
 and is prepared to go
 to the cinema with them.

655
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,160
 But as they didn't accept my proposition,

656
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,040
 l suggest they go on their own.

657
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,920
 l went there by bus

658
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,480
 and when l arrived in front of the cinema,

659
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,560
 l saw that they were already there.

660
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,799
 They hadn't seen me...

661
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,800
 l went up to them and l said...

662
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 that l'd been waiting
 for them a long time.

663
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,440
 They asked me how l'd come.

664
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 l told them l'd been careful
 not to be recognised

665
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 because people
 would have crowded round me

666
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,159
 to ask for autographs.

667
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,160
 What would you have done if someone
 had taken you for Makhmalbaf?

668
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,760
 lf it had been outside the cinema,

669
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,160
 l'd have tried not to attract attention,
 but l sensed...

670
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,280
 Would you have followed him

671
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,320
 and been his Makhmalbaf as well?

672
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,879
 l think l would have.

673
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,880
 How long after his visit
 to your house was he arrested?

674
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,839
 When he left us on the Tuesday,

675
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,840
 he said he liked me

676
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,160
 and that he wanted to give me the lead role

677
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,880
 in his next film.

678
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,840
 He added that he'd be back to see us.

679
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,080
 He said he'd come to lunch that Thursday.

680
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,360
 And that soup was his favourite dish.

681
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,320
 How long after you met was he arrested?

682
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,720
 And on what grounds?

683
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,160
 He came to our house
 three times in four days.

684
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,719
 On the Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

685
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,720
 Describe the circumstances
 that led to his arrest.

686
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,680
 Actually, my father
 suspected him from the start.

687
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,760
 He talked it over with Mr Mohseni.

688
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,239
 The description he gave

689
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,999
 corresponded to Mr Sabzian.

690
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Mr Mohseni, you've been following
 all this from the outset.

691
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,360
 Everything has happened

692
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,240
 as l anticipated it would.

693
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,959
 But Mehrdad said

694
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,960
 there was no reason to suspect him.

695
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,240
 Fortunately, something happened yesterday

696
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,680
 which convinced him
 that he wasn't Makhmalbaf.

697
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,920
 Yesterday, the so-called Makhmalbaf

698
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,320
 came to rehearse with the children.

699
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,160
 Mehrdad arrived with a newspaper.

700
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,600
 And he said,
 ''Congratulations, Mr Makhmalbaf!''

701
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,640
 He was confused
 and didn't know what to say.

702
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,160
 The newspaper said that a prize

703
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,800
 had been given to The Cyclist

704
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,399
 at the Rimini Festival.

705
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,400
 But he didn't seem
 to know anything about it.

706
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,959
 He got out of it

707
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,960
 by saying that this prize
 was for the music of the film.

708
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,560
 - He was thinking of Fajr Festival.
 - Probably.

709
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,680
 They continued their rehearsals.

710
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,920
 But Mehrdad was convinced
 that it wasn't Makhmalbaf.

711
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,759
 But sometimes

712
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,760
 the director doesn't hear
 of these things right away.

713
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,960
 No, the newspaper said Mr Makhmalbaf

714
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,400
 had sent a wire to the festival.

715
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,480
 So he had to know about the award.

716
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,720
 They continued the rehearsals,
 then went to the cinema.

717
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,440
 As we left the cinema,
 he expressed the wish

718
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,480
 to come home with us
 and spend the night at our house.

719
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,760
 He came home and spent the night here.

720
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,480
 The next day, at around six am,

721
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,120
 l heard him talking with Mehrdad.

722
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,280
 He said he wanted to go...

723
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,719
 mountain climbing.

724
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,720
 Mehrdad was sure he wouldn't come back.

725
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,120
 But he lent him his coat
 so he wouldn't catch cold.

726
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,680
 We thought we'd never see him again,
 but luckily...

727
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 or unluckily...
 he phoned 30 minutes ago.

728
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,880
 He asked Mehrdad to go to town
 to pick him up.

729
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,720
 So off he went
 and they'll be here any moment now.

730
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,119
 Like l told you,

731
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,120
 my friend knows artistic circles very well.

732
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,480
 l hope this man really is Makhmalbaf.

733
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,640
 Excuse me. l can hear a motorbike coming.

734
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,200
 - Hello. How are you?
 - Fine, thanks.

735
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,560
 - My friend, Mr Mohseni.
 - Pleased to meet you.

736
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,760
 Do sit down.

737
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
 - How are you?
 - Fine, thank you.

738
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,079
 l hope you had a good night's sleep.

739
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,679
 l didn't.

740
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,479
 - No?
 - l didn't sleep at all.

741
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,480
 l'm sorry you didn't find
 our house comfortable.

742
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,440
 One often sleeps badly
 in someone else's place.

743
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,080
 And yet a sage feels at home anywhere.

744
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,599
 l'm no sage.

745
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,600
 You look like one though.

746
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,239
 Appearances can be deceptive.

747
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,240
 Mr Makhmalbaf, have you eaten?

748
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,999
 l had a big breakfast.

749
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 But l'll gladly join you.

750
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,280
 At the weekend, our children get up late

751
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,759
 and just have lunch.

752
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,279
 But l can make you an omelette.

753
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,280
 No, l'm not really hungry.

754
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,120
 Whether you're a sage or not,
 all we can offer you is an omelette.

755
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,399
 That's fine.

756
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,400
 Make him an omelette.

757
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,880
 Do you often go
 up in the mountains, Mr Makhmalbaf?

758
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,399
 Sometimes.

759
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,400
 But this morning,
 when l looked at the mountains,

760
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,920
 l felt the urge to get closer to nature.

761
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,839
 Being close to nature

762
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,840
 lifts the burden of worries from your breast.

763
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
 One must be in touch with nature...

764
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,200
 ''l asked the Muse why she was hiding.

765
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,680
 ''She replied, 'lt's you who are hiding.'''

766
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,080
 We are the slaves of a mask
 which hides our true face.

767
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,480
 lf we manage to free ourselves of this,
 the beauty of truth will be ours.

768
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,120
 This morning l wanted
 to go up in the mountains to study myself.

769
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Nature is a mirror
 in which we can study ourselves.

770
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,240
 lf you like nature so much,
 you should live a natural life.

771
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,320
 Mehrdad, you don't look
 as if you're ready for rehearsals.

772
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,960
 l'm waiting for the others.

773
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,359
 You're wasting my time.

774
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,479
 Have your meal.

775
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,480
 What do you see
 as being unnatural about me?

776
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,520
 That's not what l meant.

777
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,720
 l just wanted to stress
 the fact that most people rest on a Friday.

778
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,920
 When there's work to be done,
 it doesn't matter what day it is.

779
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,399
 We have so little time...

780
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,400
 That's why l always give priority to my work.

781
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,960
 Rest comes later.
 You never know what tomorrow will bring.

782
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 You can't predict the future.
 Even the immediate future.

783
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 That's why we must try to make the most
 of the opportunities that come our way.

784
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,200
 That's what l'm doing.

785
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,399
 lt's rare you get the opportunity to work.

786
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,400
 You can't always choose when to rest.

787
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,840
 That's why l don't stop working

788
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,520
 on a Friday or during the summer.

789
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,400
 l love my work and l have to finish it
 before l can rest.

790
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,600
 There are so many days in the week

791
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,240
 when we are unable to work.

792
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,640
 l'm prepared to work day and night

793
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 as long as your boys
 maintain their enthusiasm.

794
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,720
 But l sense that their interest is fading.

795
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,320
 l can't imagine why it is, though.

796
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,880
 Mehrdad has done some very good work,

797
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,080
 but he seems to be
 becoming less motivated.

798
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,559
 Who knows?

799
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,679
 l'd like to know why.

800
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,680
 lf he had stayed
 as keen as at the beginning...

801
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,280
 l'd have worked day and night.

802
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,120
 lt would've been no problem.

803
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,480
 Yes? Come in.

804
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,280
 - lt's Mr Farazmand.
 - Excuse me.

805
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,120
 - How are you?
 - Fine, thank you.

806
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,679
 l hope l'm not disturbing you.

807
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,239
 Not at all.

808
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,240
 - This is Mr Mohseni.
 - How do you do?

809
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,560
 - Mr Makhmalbaf.
 - Pleased to meet you.

810
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,080
 Please sit down.

811
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,080
 How do you do, Mr Ahankhah?

812
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,400
 l hope l'm not interrupting.

813
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,800
 - Can l have a word?
 - Of course.

814
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,799
 Can we start the rehearsals?

815
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,800
 l'll be right with you.

816
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,600
 Mr Ahankhah, l need a tape recorder.

817
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,679
 Mr Farazmand needs a tape recorder.

818
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,680
 - A portable tape recorder.
 - We don't have one.

819
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,520
 - What about your neighbours?
 - l'll ask them.

820
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,480
 Let him finish his meal.

821
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,800
 - Don't let them take him away.
 - Don't worry, he'll be back.

822
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,200
 ls this your first offence of this kind?

823
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,960
 Yes, it's the first.

824
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,160
 - Yet l heard that...
 - People take me for Makhmalbaf.

825
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,920
 - So it's not the first time.
 - People have taken me for him

826
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,840
 and l did nothing to correct them.

827
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,040
 Do you regret what you did?

828
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,360
 Yes... l know that justice must be done.

829
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,800
 But l regret having toyed with their feelings.

830
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,800
 That's the only reason l'm ashamed.

831
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,320
 Deep down, l never had the slightest
 intention of stealing from them.

832
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,680
 l'm sorry for what l did,
 but not for the time l spent in prison.

833
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,560
 Prison is good for good people
 and bad for the wicked.

834
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 lt teaches good people a lesson
 but the wicked get worse. l repent.

835
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,039
 - Been to prison before?
 - Never.

836
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,040
 - What is your trade?
 - l worked for a printer.

837
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,720
 Why did you search every room

838
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,319
 in their house?

839
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,320
 l was playing the part of a director.

840
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,800
 l said that we'd do the shot
 from such and such an angle...

841
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,279
 Have you ever worked in film?

842
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,679
 No.

843
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,680
 But l've read books on the subject.

844
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,040
 Screenplays
 and books about how to direct films.

845
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,600
 l went through the motions
 of rehearsing scenes.

846
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,520
 You also asked them
 to cut the trees in the garden.

847
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,120
 l said that for the scenes
 we'd shoot in the garden,

848
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,520
 the trees would obscure
 the view of the house

849
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,680
 and Mr Ahankhah agreed to cut them down.

850
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,680
 Then, l said that we could use other angles.

851
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,760
 Was the idea of filming in the house

852
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,680
 yours or theirs?

853
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,599
 Mine, but they liked the idea, too.

854
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,600
 Did you intend to ask them
 for money for the production?

855
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,559
 - To produce the film?
 - Yes.

856
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,560
 l put forward a project to them.

857
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,400
 lf l'd had the money, l would have shot it.

858
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,880
 They seemed to want to get involved

859
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,439
 in a film project.

860
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,440
 l never thought
 it would turn out the way it did.

861
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,959
 He repents of his faults.

862
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,960
 l wish to ask the plaintiffs

863
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,559
 if they would agree to pardoning him.

864
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,560
 Of course, his offence is punishable by law.

865
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,600
 But their pardon could be considered
 as extenuating circumstances.

866
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,320
 l would have pardoned him
 if he had been honest.

867
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,600
 But when l hear him,
 l get the impression he is still acting.

868
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,119
 He's still playing a role,

869
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,120
 even if it's a slightly different one.

870
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,119
 lnstead of playing Makhmalbaf,

871
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,120
 he is playing a sentimental person.

872
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,160
 l'd like Mr Farazmand to tell us

873
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,520
 about the various people
 who contacted him about this man.

874
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,279
 Do you have new evidence?

875
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,280
 Yes, l do. l've been following the case.

876
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,039
 What is the title of the article you wrote?

877
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,519
 ''Bogus Makhmalbaf Arrested.''

878
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,319
 Bogus Makhmalbaf?

879
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,320
 When the paper came out,
 l received a lot of phone calls.

880
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,520
 One of them was from a woman
 l haven't been able to find since.

881
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,880
 She said that a man
 who claimed to be Makhmalbaf

882
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,680
 had promised to give her a part in his film.

883
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,880
 He had even promised to marry her.

884
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,240
 She wanted to file a complaint and l told her

885
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,520
 she should come to the trial to tell her story.

886
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,479
 But she refused.

887
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,480
 l also got a call from a printer's

888
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,880
 saying that the accused
 had misappropriated funds,

889
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,840
 such as keeping the money
 from a delivery of paper.

890
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,239
 Well, Mr Sabzian...

891
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,240
 Concerning the lady's phone call...

892
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,239
 Since you're single now, you could've...

893
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,240
 l deny everything
 and l am prepared to confront her.

894
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,240
 l worked as a salesman

895
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,559
 for a trading company.

896
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,560
 l'd call on clients

897
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,440
 and show them my samples.

898
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,880
 The day l met Mrs Ahankhah

899
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,160
 l was short of money

900
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,680
 and l'd left home without eating any lunch.

901
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,960
 When Mrs Ahankhah
 took me for Makhmalbaf,

902
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,920
 l thought that l could perhaps go

903
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,560
 and have lunch at her house.

904
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,960
 l only did it to have a meal.

905
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,360
 l would like to add...

906
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,599
 an important fact.

907
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,600
 On the day l was arrested,

908
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,640
 l had written Mr Ahankhah's address

909
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,840
 in my notebook and l wrote next to it

910
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,240
 ''The Last Tragedy''.

911
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,839
 - You knew...
 - l sensed it.

912
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,840
 l sensed the end was coming
 and l wrote it down.

913
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,600
 My tragic end.
 l'm sure they read it at Police HQ.

914
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,280
 l knew that l'd be arrested
 because of the money

915
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,280
 that l'd received
 and because l'd spent the night there.

916
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,200
 But l couldn't stop myself

917
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,720
 going back to that house.

918
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,960
 - Why?
 - l loved playing that part.

919
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,320
 l enjoyed playing the part of Makhmalbaf

920
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,680
 and arousing their respect and admiration.

921
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
 lt did my morale a lot of good.

922
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,360
 l also thought they'd give me
 some financial support.

923
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,320
 But that day when he came
 to pick me up on his motorbike,

924
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,519
 l felt ill at ease.

925
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,520
 But l decided to go with him nevertheless.

926
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,840
 As l arrived that last day,
 l knew l'd be arrested.

927
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,960
 When l phoned Mehrdad
 to fix an appointment with him

928
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,040
 at Hosseinabad Square,
 l knew it was a trap.

929
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,800
 When Mehrdad arrived at the square,
 he was astonished to see

930
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,080
 that l was waiting for him,
 which confirmed my suspicions.

931
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
 l made a note of it and they read it

932
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,079
 at Police HQ.

933
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,080
 - Where is this notebook?
 - l tore out the page.

934
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,840
 l tore it out,
 because l thought it was all over.

935
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,640
 When did you realise
 your pretence had been discovered?

936
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,080
 On the last day.
 During the evening l spent with them,

937
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,880
 l saw a film magazine lying around.

938
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,680
 lnside was a photo of Makhmalbaf.

939
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,680
 He was directing one of his actresses

940
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,160
 in a scene from Marriage ofthe Blessed.

941
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,880
 l sensed that they had bought
 this film magazine,

942
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,440
 because there was this photo in it.

943
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,280
 They wanted to see how l'd react.

944
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,879
 They showed me the photo

945
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,880
 and said to me,
 ''You were more handsome

946
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,920
 ''when you were young, Mr Makhmalbaf''.

947
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,120
 l said to them that l was much younger then.

948
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,840
 At that moment, l sensed
 that they were suspicious.

949
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,440
 But l soon convinced myself

950
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,760
 that they didn't know l wasn't Makhmalbaf.

951
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,440
 How far did you want to take this?

952
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,680
 As far as they were...

953
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,039
 prepared to go.

954
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,040
 When he came
 to our house on the Thursday,

955
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,319
 he had grey hair.

956
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,320
 But on the photo,
 Makhmalbaf's hair was black.

957
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,800
 l didn't ask him why, but he said that his hair

958
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,960
 had once been black and it was now grey.

959
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,520
 When he returned that Saturday,
 he had dyed his hair.

960
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,879
 How does he explain that?

961
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,639
 My mother, who is right here,

962
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,439
 can confirm that l dyed my hair

963
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,440
 a long time
 before this whole episode began.

964
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,680
 l wanted to look a bit younger.

965
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,679
 You are young.

966
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,680
 l've been dyeing my hair for a long time,

967
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,080
 and it wasn't for the reason
 that was suggested here.

968
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,119
 - Are you married?
 - Yes.

969
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,120
 - You have a family?
 - l'm divorced.

970
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,959
 Why is that?

971
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,799
 l was poor and out of work.

972
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,079
 - Any children?
 - Two.

973
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:24,080
 - Where are they?
 - l have one, my wife the other.

974
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,800
 - Who looks after him?
 - My mother.

975
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,120
 - Where is your mother?
 - Right here.

976
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,200
 - Where?
 - At the back, wearing a black veil.

977
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,760
 - Are you Mr Sabzian's mother?
 - Yes.

978
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,080
 Do you know why he divorced his wife?

979
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,760
 - Why?
 - He works for a printer off and on.

980
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,720
 He's often out of work.
 Our house is small. After he married,

981
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,840
 they got a room of their own.

982
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,320
 After seven years,
 his wife started complaining

983
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,440
 that there was no future
 for her in our house.

984
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,800
 He said that if she wasn't happy,

985
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,840
 the best thing would be to divorce.

986
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,120
 They agreed
 she'd keep one child and me the other.

987
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,920
 He lives with me. When he has work,

988
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,440
 he supports his family as best he can.

989
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,600
 He's never been in trouble before.

990
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,760
 Why didn't you try to get bail for him?

991
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,320
 l went to see the officer in charge.

992
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,760
 l also asked to see Mr Ahankhah.
 But they said they'd handle it.

993
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,480
 Every time l feel sad in prison,

994
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,880
 l think of the verse
 in the Koran which says,

995
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,080
 ''To remember God is
 the best consolation for a troubled heart''.

996
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,080
 l feel the need, when l'm depressed
 or overcome by worries,

997
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,400
 to express the anguish in my soul,

998
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,680
 all my sorrows

999
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,600
 that no one wants to hear about.

1000
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:23,440
 And then, l come across a good man

1001
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,640
 who portrays all my sufferings

1002
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,320
 in his films, and makes me want

1003
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,840
 to see them over and over again.

1004
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,640
 A man with the courage to portray people

1005
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,279
 who play with others' lives,

1006
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,280
 the rich who are indifferent
 to the needs of the poor...

1007
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,680
 simple needs which are mainly material.

1008
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,120
 That's why this book
 brought me consolation.

1009
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,160
 lt speaks of things
 l'd have liked to express myself.

1010
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,800
 Now, having played this part, do you think

1011
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,920
 you are a better actor than a director?

1012
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,400
 lt's not for me to say.

1013
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,399
 l think l prefer being an actor.

1014
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,400
 l think l could express

1015
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,879
 all the bad experiences l've had

1016
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,880
 and all the suffering
 l have felt deep down inside me.

1017
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,760
 l like to think that l could

1018
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,879
 get these feelings across

1019
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,599
 through my acting.

1020
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,600
 Are you not acting
 for the camera right now?

1021
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,079
 What are you doing now?

1022
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,080
 l'm speaking of my suffering.

1023
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,120
 That's not acting.

1024
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,320
 l'm speaking from the heart.

1025
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,959
 For me, art...

1026
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,960
 is the extension of what you feel inside.

1027
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,959
 Tolstoy said,

1028
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,960
 ''Art is a sentimental experience

1029
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,320
 ''that the artist develops in himself
 and shares with others''.

1030
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,519
 l think that my experiences of hardship

1031
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,520
 and suffering can give me
 the grounding l need

1032
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,880
 to be a good actor.

1033
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,440
 That way l act well and l express

1034
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,600
 my inner reality.

1035
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,600
 Why did you pretend to be a director,
 rather than become an actor?

1036
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,360
 Playing the part of a director
 is a performance in itself.

1037
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,120
 To me, that's acting.

1038
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,800
 - What part would you like to play?
 - My own.

1039
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,920
 You are playing your own part.

1040
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,160
 Mr Sabzian, you have heard

1041
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,679
 the charges against you.

1042
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,680
 Say whatever you think
 might help your case.

1043
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,560
 l ask Mr Ahankhah's honourable family
 to forgive me.

1044
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,600
 l'm not asking
 to be spared the sentence l deserve.

1045
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,399
 l need their pardon

1046
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,239
 to soothe my conscience.

1047
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,240
 l ask the court to forgive me
 if that is possible.

1048
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,760
 Do you promise never to do it again?

1049
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,399
 l promise.

1050
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,839
 The accused...

1051
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,479
 Please forgive him.

1052
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,999
 Sit down.

1053
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
 My son is a descendant of the Prophet.
 For his sake...

1054
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,640
 please forgive him.

1055
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,880
 ln view of his young age,

1056
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,960
 the fact that he has a family to support,

1057
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,200
 that he has no record,

1058
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,880
 and that he promises never to do it again,

1059
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,200
 l would ask the plaintiffs
 to forgive him if they can.

1060
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,680
 But as l said before,

1061
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,600
 their pardon could only be considered
 as extenuating circumstances.

1062
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,919
 ls this the case?

1063
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,519
 l am willing

1064
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,520
 to withdraw my complaint
 in the hope that Mr Sabzian

1065
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,440
 may become a useful member of society.

1066
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,160
 Now l know he regrets what he did,

1067
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,080
 if my son Mehrdad is in agreement,

1068
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,440
 l will withdraw my complaint.

1069
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,640
 His actions are the result

1070
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,959
 of the social malaise and unemployment.

1071
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,879
 But this is not the place to debate that.

1072
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,880
 He is therefore not the only one to blame.

1073
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:20,080
 Unemployment can lead to delinquency.

1074
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,480
 l am certain, after he has been freed,

1075
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,520
 if he finds a proper job,
 he will lead an honest life.

1076
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,560
 That's why l too withdraw my complaint.

1077
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,319
 We've lost him!

1078
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,839
 He didn't wait in the right spot.

1079
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,639
 l can't see him.

1080
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,640
 We can't redo this shot!

1081
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
 - l can see him.
 - Yes, he's behind the taxi.

1082
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,799
 - l see him.
 - Me, too.

1083
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,639
 We've no sound!

1084
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,079
 What on earth's going on?

1085
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,080
 lt comes from Mr Makhmalbaf's lapel mike.

1086
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,919
 lt's old equipment.

1087
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,919
 There's a loose wire in it.

1088
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,839
 lt's 15 years old.

1089
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,840
 The sound's back!

1090
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,159
 Will it last long?

1091
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,160
 We can't do anything.

1092
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,399
 Are you Mr Sabzian?

1093
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,479
 How are you?

1094
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,480
 Don't cry.

1095
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,879
 There's no need to cry.

1096
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,880
 When were you released?

1097
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:43,240
 Let me look at you.

1098
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,160
 When were you released? Look at me.

1099
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,520
 Let's go.

1100
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,159
 This way.

1101
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,879
 You OK?

1102
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,599
 - Where are you going?
 - The Ahankhahs'.

1103
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,079
 l'll take you.

1104
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,959
 Had you seen me before?

1105
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,519
 - ln the film.
 - Which film?

1106
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,759
 Marriage ofthe Blessed.

1107
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,760
 Do you prefer
 being Makhmalbaf or Sabzian?

1108
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:20,200
 l'm tired of being me.

1109
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,240
 l'll get the motorbike.

1110
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,200
 Hold that for me.

1111
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,760
 How long were you in prison?

1112
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,680
 When you met that woman in the bus...

1113
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,360
 ln your opinion...

1114
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,239
 That's very true.

1115
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,240
 Now l see what that means.

1116
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,119
 Do you want to buy some flowers?

1117
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,120
 Count your money.

1118
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,640
