1
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,236
- I think I'll just...
- Okay.

2
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:07,852
You've got the euros.

3
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:10,065
I've got the euros, have I?

4
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,562
Don't start.

5
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:15,199
You never lose anything.

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,901
I'll lose you in a minute.

7
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:22,589
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

8
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,429
<i>- you can now purchase metro tickets...</i>
- Thank you.

9
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,435
<i>from our buffet between
coaches six and 13,</i>

10
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:32,692
<i>as well as a Paris pass giving you
access to museums and access to...</i>

11
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:34,361
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

12
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,203
<i>We also sell discounted...</i>

13
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:48,053
This is exactly what I needed.
Can't we have lunch immediately?

14
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:50,976
- Are you starving?
- I'm practically dribbling.

15
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:53,473
I like a man who knows
how to dribble.

16
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:04,753
Rue Myrha.

17
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:07,924
This is Chateau Rouge.
We've come out here.

18
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:12,338
- Ah, Montmartre.
- Ah.

19
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:14,718
Merci.

20
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:17,401
Practically fluent.

21
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:19,906
- I'm thinking in French now.
- You look French.

22
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,241
Oh, <i>pardon.</i>

23
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,995
- Oh, it was you.
- Oh, yeah.

24
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,252
Spritely.

25
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,217
Once you get in the rhythm,
you've got to keep going.

26
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:32,543
You're just showing off now.

27
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:41,229
Surely not.

28
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,986
They've tarted it up a bit.

29
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:47,404
They have?

30
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:58,521
All right?

31
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:00,470
Yep.

32
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,921
I reckon if you stood on
tiptoe with a telescope,

33
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:15,328
you could see the Hunchback
of Notre Dame's arse.

34
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:18,092
It's, um.

35
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,298
Beige.

36
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,147
There's a certain
light-brownness about it, yes.

37
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:31,166
Meg.

38
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,618
Meg, don't do this, Meg.

39
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,631
Last time, when we
were here before,

40
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:43,189
it was bigger, plus grand, different
colour, <i>différente couleur.</i>

41
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,069
So you recommend we
should redecorate?

42
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,069
I can't do that.

43
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,991
<i>Merde.</i>

44
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,215
- Meg.
- Sorry, sir.

45
00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:00,590
How can you do...
How can you treat... Meg!

46
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,393
Meg!

47
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:04,270
- I'm really sorry, sir.
- Meg!

48
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,094
- Taxi!
- Don't.

49
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:09,071
- Taxi!
- We do have a complimentary breakfast

50
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:10,950
- if you'd like to try...
- Wait! Wait!

51
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:13,246
- Sir?
- Wait, wait, wait!

52
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,375
We have croissants, sir.

53
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:17,546
This was your idea.

54
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:21,637
- How terrible to be in Paris.
- You want us to sleep in a coffin.

55
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,134
- Give me the euros.
- What?

56
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:25,936
Give me the euros.

57
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:28,091
Wow.

58
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,944
Oh, Meg. Stupid...

59
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,457
Let's get started.

60
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,544
Meg!

61
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,838
Look, look, look!

62
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,262
Ah. Paris.

63
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,584
- Meg, stop it.
<i>- Merci.</i>

64
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:01,454
Fuck's sake.

65
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,684
What are we doing? Why are we
doing it? Where are we going?

66
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:11,649
Why? What? Ooh, what?
We're in Paris!

67
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,444
Yes, exactly. Why don't we
just stop and enjoy it?

68
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:14,847
Just look!

69
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,271
You'll need this.

70
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,816
Okay.

71
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:35,192
<i>Merci.</i>

72
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:38,190
Meg! No! Please!

73
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,871
<i>Bonjour.</i>

74
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:51,391
No, no, no, no, no.

75
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:53,520
<i>Non.</i>

76
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:09,079
<i>Pardon. Monsieur, non, non.</i>

77
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,751
Jesus.

78
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,968
Meg? Meg!

79
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:22,901
Whatever it costs is fine.

80
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,455
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

81
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:28,920
I'm so sorry, madame, but
unless you made a reservation,

82
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:31,216
we are completely and utterly full.

83
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,791
You see?

84
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,887
They've taken our bags.

85
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:47,196
- What now? Back on the train?
- Good idea.

86
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:50,787
Get a taxi to the Gare du Nord.

87
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,341
Sit in silence all the
way back to Moseley

88
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,512
before killing ourselves
in a suicide pact.

89
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:57,507
Perfect.

90
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,233
I knew this trip would
be a fucking disaster.

91
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:04,890
- You didn't even want to try.
- I did.

92
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,660
But why did you book
that dreadful place?

93
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,831
I was foolish enough to
want to try and please you.

94
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,710
You actually said you
wanted to go back.

95
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,254
- Not that far.
- Madame?

96
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:14,924
- Anyway, it was the wrong place.
- It wasn't.

97
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,176
- It was.
- It wasn't.

98
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:17,888
They'd just redecorated.
That's all.

99
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,886
Madame, there is one possibility.

100
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,943
- There is?
- As a special offer,

101
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:28,601
we have a prestige suite
available for two nights.

102
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,032
In fact, Tony Blair
once slept there.

103
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,659
Well?

104
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:39,166
As long as they changed the sheets.

105
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,876
Thank you.

106
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,945
May I have your passports,
and a credit card, of course?

107
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:50,199
Of course. You've
got the passports.

108
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,702
Passports.

109
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,456
Bang goes the bathroom.

110
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:55,709
Just close your eyes
when you go in.

111
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,382
My only remaining ambition
was to have a bidet.

112
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:01,756
Well, I think we've
earned a very good time.

113
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,385
You know I'm anxious about money.

114
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:07,607
We might live for ages
as a burden to others.

115
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:10,530
I've taken up Zumba.
I'm redesigning my body.

116
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:13,369
Why? Who's going to see it?

117
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,538
Meg?

118
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,034
- The keys, sir.
- Oh. Merci.

119
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:20,382
- Anything else, sir?
<i>- Non, non.</i>

120
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,879
Merci, ca va.

121
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:25,417
Do you want me to
show you the room?

122
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:28,856
No, no, it'll be all right. Thank you.
Merci, ca va, ca va.

123
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:31,387
- Thank you, sir.
- <i>Merci.</i>

124
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,234
Thank you, sir.

125
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:37,246
See you later, no doubt.
<i>Au revoir.</i>

126
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:48,519
On, my God!

127
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,720
Oh!

128
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,560
It really is wonderful.

129
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:59,782
Quite spectacular.

130
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:02,336
Time for some refreshment,
don't you think?

131
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:04,082
Right.

132
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:23,745
Meg, Meg, stop.
We're not that thirsty.

133
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:32,561
So far this city is a
brilliantly designed machine

134
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:35,261
for extracting all our money.

135
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:37,011
What are you saying?

136
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:40,066
What I'm saying is that

137
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:46,154
we can't proceed with the bathroom until
you've made a decision about the tiles.

138
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:50,248
What's that got to do with this?

139
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:54,018
Well, I thought that now
we're in Paris together,

140
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,263
we could discuss important things.

141
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,852
Like tiles?

142
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,561
It has to be done.

143
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,989
Suppose I want you
to choose the tiles?

144
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,587
Aren't you interested?

145
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:11,870
I'm not sure I am, actually, no.

146
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,986
Here's to us.

147
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:29,193
- I love you.
- Lots of love, darling.

148
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:33,623
Mmm.

149
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:41,889
- Can I touch you?
- What for?

150
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:46,367
This last five to ten years

151
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:49,289
your vagina has become
something of a closed book.

152
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,419
Now we've paid all this money,

153
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,919
I'd rather see the Eiffel Tower
than your partially erect sausage.

154
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:59,216
See both at the same time.
Wouldn't take a moment.

155
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,781
I was thinking,

156
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:10,531
we could try taking our lovemaking
into another dimension.

157
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:15,615
What did you have in mind?

158
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:20,253
I thought we could pretend
to be other people.

159
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:35,118
A man who still wants to
make love to his wife.

160
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:39,209
That's unusual, if not
a far-out perversion.

161
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,722
I might do it for you later.

162
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:44,423
- Really?
- If you stay awake.

163
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:57,786
Last time we did this,
we could breathe.

164
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:05,462
- Have your knees gone yet?
- Not yet.

165
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,347
Nothing's gone yet.

166
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,371
Who'd want to live anywhere else?

167
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:28,770
Let's do it.

168
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:30,732
What?

169
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,229
Sell up, get a little
apartment here.

170
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:36,105
You'll find we'd still
have to earn money.

171
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:40,359
Haven't we worked for long enough?

172
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,490
What else would we do?

173
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,720
We could be artists.

174
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,601
Nick, we're from Birmingham.

175
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:51,647
Not by birth.

176
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,910
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, Dad, it's me.</i>

177
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,330
Hi, man!

178
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:02,376
<i>Dad, are you at home?</i>

179
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,781
No, we're on the continent.

180
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,412
In France, in Paris.

181
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,019
No, we haven't argued yet.

182
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,721
Not at all, no. It's wonderful.

183
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:18,238
I'm falling in love with
your mother all over again.

184
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,330
What?

185
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:24,460
- Another one? Oh, fuck!
- Yeah, another one.

186
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,379
- What's going on?
<i>- The place is teeming with them.</i>

187
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,132
I'm going inside.

188
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,721
- It's important.
<i>- Dad? Dad?</i>

189
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:32,850
- It's a rat's nest.
<i>- Oh...</i>

190
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,896
<i>And I don't know
what to do about it.</i>

191
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:37,650
- Have you spoken to the estate agent?
- No, not yet.

192
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:41,366
- You should, that's the first thing to do.
<i>- Think they'll be able to help?</i>

193
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:42,860
Yeah.

194
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:50,550
Hmm.

195
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:52,955
Definitely not.

196
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:56,587
Come on, Meg, it's an emergency.

197
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:02,072
How can you let them stay in a house full
of rats with a three-month-old baby?

198
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:04,318
We just got rid of them.

199
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,525
You know what she's like.

200
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,755
She makes his life even more
intolerable than you make mine.

201
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:13,636
You make my blood boil
like nobody else!

202
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:15,764
That's the sign of
a deep connection.

203
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,227
Meg! Meg!

204
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:21,259
Do not mock or patronise me!

205
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,231
Come on.

206
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,852
He's our son.

207
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:30,903
- Come on.
- Stop!

208
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,011
Why won't you ever
let me touch you?

209
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:39,841
It's not love.
It's like being arrested.

210
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,055
I'm a phobic object for you.

211
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,153
Kiss me now, then.

212
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,049
Go on.

213
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,512
God!

214
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,221
That's us in ten years.

215
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,235
- Is that the height of your ambition?
- Huh?

216
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,505
- Ow!
- We're in Paris, give us a kiss.

217
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,007
God! What the fuck are you doing?

218
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:19,386
Don't you like to be spanked?

219
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:21,598
No! Don't you know me at all?

220
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,268
Whoa! Ow!

221
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:25,397
Oh, God, Nick!

222
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,567
Nick, I'm sorry.

223
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:30,949
- Sorry, are you okay?
- No, no, leave it. Leave it, it's my knee.

224
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,120
Oh, come on, old fella.

225
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:35,039
Take me to Casualty.
Stop it. Stop it!

226
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,668
Don't be such a girl.

227
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:40,509
No, really... It really hurts.

228
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,473
Oh, God, Nick, can't
you be a man for once?

229
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:46,060
- I'll leave you here.
- You do that. Go on.

230
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,967
Jesus, God! Oh!

231
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,769
Oh...

232
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:55,187
Ah! Oh...

233
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:02,242
It really hurts!

234
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:05,172
I'm serious.

235
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,973
It's not a terrible limp!

236
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:15,183
Here?

237
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,237
You choose lunch, I choose
dinner. Usual arrangement.

238
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:22,114
How's your knee?

239
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,996
Let's keep walking.

240
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:29,727
Good boy.

241
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,935
Too modern.

242
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,915
Too empty.

243
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,865
Too empty.

244
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:47,093
Too touristy.

245
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,499
And they've got an English menu.

246
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:53,511
- We have lift off.
- You sure?

247
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,601
Good.

248
00:17:56,153 --> 00:18:00,034
<i>- Madame, monsieur, bonjour.
- Bonjour.</i>

249
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:02,030
Bliss.

250
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:14,426
<i>- Madame, monsieur, le menu.
- Merci.</i>

251
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:23,997
<i>Merci.</i>

252
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:27,905
I can't think when I've ever
had a harder decision to make.

253
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,217
<i>Monsieur?</i>

254
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:32,088
Madame.

255
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:45,496
<i>Vivant.</i>

256
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:47,822
Rosé.

257
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:59,230
It's the nicest thing I've
ever put in my mouth.

258
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,285
Listen.

259
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,949
Thanks for bringing me.

260
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:17,001
Try.

261
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:20,884
Mmm!

262
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:28,520
Oh, God.

263
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,506
I was sceptical. But I'm
so glad we did this.

264
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,910
Why sceptical?

265
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:40,091
You've been attacking
me a lot, lately.

266
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:43,482
Do you know why?

267
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,351
DO you?

268
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,446
You're making that noise.

269
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:53,959
Am I?

270
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,754
Have I always done it?

271
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,173
Like an old horse at the trough.

272
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,252
Enjoyment, some people call it.

273
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,608
Lack of inhibition, freedom.

274
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:09,606
Are you free?

275
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,478
I'd love not to give a fuck.

276
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,530
This is it, isn't it, my love?

277
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:20,786
This is where I want to be forever.

278
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,756
You always did edit out
the arguments and misery.

279
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:29,519
You can't not love and
hate the same person.

280
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:33,736
Usually within the space of
five minutes, in my experience.

281
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,573
But you like things steady.

282
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,960
Too steady.

283
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,129
Why have you got your
constipated face on?

284
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:55,727
The fact of the matter...

285
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,868
Actually...

286
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:07,290
What's happened...

287
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:12,342
About a month ago, the college
insisted I take early retirement.

288
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,196
Oh, Nick.

289
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:17,226
Oh, fuck.

290
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:20,529
One of the students made
an official complaint.

291
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,881
What did you say?

292
00:21:24,882 --> 00:21:28,514
I said, "if you spent as much time on
your studies as you do on your hair,

293
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:32,013
"you might have a chance of
escaping your background."

294
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:37,222
She complained to the dean.

295
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:41,706
Apparently her hair is her history,

296
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:44,545
her identity.

297
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:47,325
And something else, I forget what.

298
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:51,181
Ah, <i>oui.</i>

299
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:53,587
Yes, yes, we're finished.

300
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,650
Why didn't you tell me before?

301
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,821
I wanted it to be a surprise.

302
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:11,204
I couldn't think about it.

303
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,905
- It's just here.
- I hope it's dirty.

304
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,700
I could do with cheering up.

305
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:24,730
Definitely earthy.

306
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,417
Is this it?

307
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:29,003
Are you expecting me to die?

308
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:32,331
Unfortunately, I'm expecting
you to live forever.

309
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:39,008
Baudelaire, Soutine,
Sartre, Beckett...

310
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,028
Your heroes.

311
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,865
They're all here.

312
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:47,288
But it's not as though they're
actually here, is it?

313
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:49,208
Don't panic.

314
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:51,296
It's only dust and bones.

315
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,701
That's the problem.

316
00:22:54,094 --> 00:22:56,054
As Beckett says,

317
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,268
"Do we mean love when we say love?"

318
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,390
What else do we mean?
That's stupid.

319
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:06,692
I think he means there's more to
love than loving or being loved.

320
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:13,740
Come on, where's Sartre?
This is fun!

321
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:17,834
I was brilliant at school.

322
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,424
Bit of a star at university.

323
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:26,270
I have to say, I'm amazed by how
mediocre I've turned out to be.

324
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:30,112
You can draw, you're musical.

325
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:33,042
You can explain Wittgenstein
to the illiterate.

326
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:39,121
You contrived to chuck them
away, your numerous talents.

327
00:23:39,137 --> 00:23:42,545
I did? Why would I do that?

328
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,131
Masochism?

329
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:49,645
It's not too late for you
to find another direction.

330
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:52,651
Why don't you think about it?

331
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,443
Do you think so?

332
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,880
People don't change.

333
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,352
They do.

334
00:24:04,353 --> 00:24:06,130
They can get worse!

335
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:09,261
Why have you cheered up so much?

336
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:12,617
What is wrong with you?

337
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,863
Come on.

338
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,280
Can you see anything there?

339
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:45,922
- Have I got skin cancer?
- Yes.

340
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:48,628
I knew it.

341
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:54,905
You also mentioned early onset
Alzheimer's and stomach cancer.

342
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:56,867
That's right.

343
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:59,272
And a lazy eye.

344
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:04,366
What else?

345
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:08,210
You'll be sorry that you
never loved me enough.

346
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:17,558
Mmm.

347
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,508

00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:27,289
I've got the key.

359
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,945
Hold on. Hold on.
Where are my keys?

360
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,510
We're not at home. Even
you might have noticed.

361
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,381
I get anxious if I don't
know where they are.

362
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:41,023
I help you find things all the time,
even when it's futile and stupid.

363
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,821
And don't use my toothbrush.
You'll give me gum disease.

364
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:45,991
- That's not even yours.
- It bloody is!

365
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,288
- The blue one.
- Oh, yes.

366
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:51,209
- Blue toothbrushes.
- It's a panda welcome.

367
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,615
The welcoming committee.

368
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:56,708
Why's that panda staring at me?

369
00:26:57,138 --> 00:27:00,340
- I'm worried.
<i>- Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.</i>

370
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,887
Catch me!

371
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,146
Pardon.

372
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,425
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

373
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:27,600
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

374
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,563
They'll take our last penny.

375
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:49,016
If it's the end of the world,
I want to go down gulping oysters.

376
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:51,783
Come on.

377
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:54,280
I love it when you're in this mood!

378
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:57,782
- Do you think you're bi-polar?
- Tri-polar, possibly.

379
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:00,215
Do you think that

380
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:03,806
part of the reason you invited
Jack and Angie back into the house

381
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,179
was because you can't
bear being alone with me?

382
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:10,762
I can't bear to be apart from you.

383
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:14,268
Well, you are
pathetically dependent.

384
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:17,957
Why don't you want to
help young people?

385
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,170
Shut up.

386
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:21,995
Idiot!

387
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:26,165
You're a fucking idiot, sometimes.

388
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:36,898
I want a new start.

389
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:40,075
Sorry?

390
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,674
I wanted to tell you.

391
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:46,303
I've gone as far as I
want to at the school.

392
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:49,393
I'm fed up teaching Biology GCSE.

393
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,969
I don't want to run the department.

394
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,975
That's mad. What would
you do instead?

395
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:59,438
I don't know.

396
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:04,422
I want to learn Italian,
play the piano,

397
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,826
dance the tango.

398
00:29:12,938 --> 00:29:15,513
Is it such a terrible idea?

399
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,696
Once the kids have gone...

400
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:28,116
What's left of us?

401
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:39,266
You've picked our
anniversary to dump me?

402
00:29:40,407 --> 00:29:43,312
We must at least be
able to talk about it.

403
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:46,652
Right?

404
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:49,243
Of course.

405
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:56,185
Come on, love.

406
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:58,591
Let's enjoy our dinner.

407
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:14,413
Come on. Let's talk
about the bathroom.

408
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:17,376
I've got some good ideas.

409
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,723
Nick?

410
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:34,842
The least you can do is
buy me a last supper.

411
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:36,245
My pleasure.

412
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:59,180
Go outside and smoke.

413
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:02,007
- I don't smoke.
- And wait.

414
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:05,525
Get your coat.

415
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:08,397
And get my coat too.

416
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,109
That's all you have to do.

417
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,820
Right.

418
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:17,616
Fucking hell.

419
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:19,665
Right.

420
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,605
<i>Excusez-moi.</i> My coat, please.

421
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:26,774
Of course.

422
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:28,528
Is everything okay for you, madam?

423
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:31,435
- Yes, great, thanks.
- Thank you.

424
00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:52,490
<i>Ah, excusez-moi.</i>

425
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,895
Pardon.

426
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:49,682
Nick!

427
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:52,383
Nick! Over here!

428
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,243
For Christ's sake,
what are you doing?

429
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,665
Get this thing.
They've plastic on it.

430
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:03,959
Come on!

431
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,492
Come on, give it a
really good pull!

432
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,672
Yes!

433
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:12,964
Ah!

434
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:23,188
God! Come on.

435
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:35,511
Rock and fucking roll!

436
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,568
Don't tell the kids.

437
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:41,689
<i>Merci.</i>

438
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:45,446
Come on. Come on.

439
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:48,167
- Let's do it all again.
- What do you mean?

440
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:51,508
Try me again and I promise
it'll be more fun this time.

441
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:01,402
Get a room!

442
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:03,978
Hey, Nick Burrows!

443
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:08,415
It is. Nick Burrows?

444
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:14,050
No. Is that really you, under all
that terribly un-English passion?

445
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,596
My God! Good God, hello there!

446
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:21,105
Yes, hi, how are you? How the damn
devil in the entire world are you?

447
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:24,308
Tell me everything!

448
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:28,536
- Wow!
- Great. Good.

449
00:34:28,537 --> 00:34:30,457
Um... Not bad.

450
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,336
- Well, then, this is my wife, Meg.
- Hello.

451
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,005
- Meg, Morgan. Morgan, Meg.
- Your wife?

452
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:37,177
I've never seen a man
kiss his wife like that.

453
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:40,267
Well, look at her. She's so...
She's so beautiful.

454
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:44,643
May I... I gotta try a little of...
A little of that. Hello, Meg.

455
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:47,739
Let's see. Wow, that's
just delightful!

456
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,118
Well, what are the two of
you up to around here?

457
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,248
The weekend, you know, in Paris.

458
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:53,751
- Oh, really?
- For old times' sake.

459
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:56,004
What about you? I thought
you lived in New York.

460
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,883
Yeah. I know, I thought I did too.

461
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:01,766
But I'm back here and I've got a
brand new wife, as a matter of fact.

462
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,854
I'm scribbling and, you know,
prostituting myself as usual.

463
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,443
Economics, politics,
the whole collapse.

464
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:09,989
I understand it, apparently.
Who am I to disagree?

465
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,035
Hey, listen...

466
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:14,164
We're having a little
thing tomorrow.

467
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:16,460
I'd love it if the two
of you could come along.

468
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:17,963
- I don't know.
- I think we're free.

469
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:19,967
You are? That's great. May I?

470
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,722
May I write a little something?

471
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:24,768
Seriously, Nick, this
must be synchronicity.

472
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:28,191
We gotta catch up on so many
things. Thank you, Meg.

473
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,195
Mmm. There's so much to talk about.

474
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:31,406
There is?

475
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:32,741
- Thanks.
- Eight o'clock.

476
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:35,663
You can be unfashionably on
time for once in your life.

477
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,128
Wow!

478
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:40,923
Tomorrow.

479
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:43,178
Tomorrow, oh, my God!

480
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:46,677
Nick... Burrows!

481
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,648
Rue de Rivoli. Wow!

482
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:56,703
We were at Cambridge together.

483
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:59,417
Haven't you got his
book by the bed?

484
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:00,628
Possibly.

485
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:03,342
You read it twice and said it was a
bad day for the English language.

486
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:05,929
It was very well received.
It was a sensation.

487
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:10,980
He was in the year below me.

488
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,226
I introduced him to everybody.

489
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:16,228
What happened?

490
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:18,270
Life happened.

491
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,242
That's mine.

492
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,911
- Give it to me!
- No.

493
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:30,643
You're gonna get gum disease!

494
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:33,516
Yeah, I'll give you gum disease.

495
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,141
- Ow!
- Give it to me!

496
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:38,767
Oh, sorry.

497
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:45,447
Blood.

498
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,461
Show me your breasts.

499
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:39,307
Are you sleeping?

500
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:42,013
Awaiting your noises.

501
00:37:44,743 --> 00:37:47,739
What are you thinking?

502
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:54,622
Should I have had the creme brulée
instead of the poires belle Hélene?

503
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:58,043
It'll be my dying thought.

504
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:05,181
- Would it be okay...
- Mmm?

505
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:08,787
for me to briefly mount you...

506
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:09,914
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:14,541
and soon after ejaculate
a miniscule amount?

508
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:18,164
I'm dropping off.

509
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,579
Nick?

510
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,153
Nick?

511
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:48,677
Nick?

512
00:40:23,002 --> 00:40:25,839
What is it? What's happened?

513
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,459
I thought you'd gone.

514
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:30,959
Wasn't that what you wanted?

515
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:34,218
Hold me.

516
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:39,103
I've got you, darling.
I've got you.

517
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:41,411
- I thought you'd gone.
- It's all right, it's all right.

518
00:40:41,412 --> 00:40:44,192
I've got you. I've got you.

519
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,462
I never read short stories
in the papers at home.

520
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,383
It's good.

521
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:03,106
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, madame.

522
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:06,149
Over here?

523
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:15,508
You know, Morgan seems
to really like you.

524
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,597
He wasn't joking. He really
does want to see you.

525
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,525
Why?

526
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,162
What have I got that he
could possibly want?

527
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:28,567
Me, for a start.

528
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:34,252
- Oh.
- Couldn't he help you?

529
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,105
- I like your collage.
- You do?

530
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:42,694
Yeah, it looks great.

531
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:44,864
- You look great.
- Thanks.

532
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:47,369
You've always had
elegance and grace.

533
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,830
You've always had class.

534
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:50,655
Thank you!

535
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:53,665
Well?

536
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:56,327
Well... Thanks.

537
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:59,551
- What about me?
- What about you, what?

538
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,732
Have I got class?

539
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:03,901
What?

540
00:42:03,902 --> 00:42:06,238
I want to do the ultimate
Cambridge novel.

541
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,657
God!

542
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,494
Beginning in the '70s.

543
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:13,294
Orgies, drugs, work, kids,

544
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:14,921
divorce,

545
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:17,593
multiple sclerosis,

546
00:42:17,594 --> 00:42:19,722
assisted death...

547
00:42:19,723 --> 00:42:22,143
I'd rather stick
pins in my breasts.

548
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:24,595
Haven't you got any
less tired ideas?

549
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,069
Don't put me down.

550
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,075
Mistress Realism, you used
to call me. You liked that.

551
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:31,900
Up to a point.

552
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:51,107
What are you doing?

553
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:54,022
Come on. Take what you want.

554
00:42:54,415 --> 00:42:56,292
You can cut out the pictures.

555
00:42:56,293 --> 00:42:58,823
I'll pay.

556
00:43:11,613 --> 00:43:13,938
Be kind, don't look.

557
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:19,043
Every time I take off my knickers,
I think there's going to be an eclipse.

558
00:43:19,044 --> 00:43:21,700
I love to look at you.

559
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:25,805
Slightly chubby in places
now. Voluptuous.

560
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:29,760
I don't want to be fucking
chubby in places. Any places.

561
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:33,154
I thought you'd like
to be appreciated.

562
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,354
Well, I am.

563
00:43:36,243 --> 00:43:39,499
The other day, I'll have
you know, a young man,

564
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,586
not entirely retarded,

565
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:44,584
tried to pick me up in Waterstones.

566
00:43:45,427 --> 00:43:48,709
Doesn't surprise me. You're hot.

567
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:51,137
Thank you.

568
00:43:51,606 --> 00:43:53,885
Hot but cold.

569
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,275
Our generation was
into weird living:

570
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:02,292
Communes,

571
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:04,672
vegetarianism,

572
00:44:04,673 --> 00:44:06,951
lesbianism.

573
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:11,130
Nothing straight where possible.

574
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,597
But I'm glad we got married. That's why
I wanted to celebrate this weekend.

575
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:19,115
It's the commitment...

576
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:22,615
The sacrifice of other
pleasures that makes it work.

577
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:24,992
You're terrified.

578
00:44:26,755 --> 00:44:29,135
- Of what?
- Being left alone.

579
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:33,058
You follow me round the house like
a child with a popped balloon.

580
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:37,192
You really are becoming more
self-obsessed, Nick. It's getting worse.

581
00:44:37,193 --> 00:44:40,395
Some people brag about
their ability to be alone.

582
00:44:43,037 --> 00:44:47,211
But I've started to feel a sort
of physical dread of desertion.

583
00:44:47,212 --> 00:44:49,616
Oh, come on!

584
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:53,126
Why doesn't anybody
want my company?

585
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:11,327
Do you like the shoes?

586
00:45:13,345 --> 00:45:15,965
Do I please you, monsieur?

587
00:45:17,811 --> 00:45:20,888
Tell me who you bought
those shoes for.

588
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:23,312
What do you mean? You know who.

589
00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:26,940
Who, for me?

590
00:45:27,663 --> 00:45:30,364
For you? For me, you idiot.

591
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:36,086
I've decided to give
up everything I like.

592
00:45:36,263 --> 00:45:38,308
- Why?
- It's a discipline,

593
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,312
the only advantage of masochism.

594
00:45:40,313 --> 00:45:43,640
I want to stop desiring
things which are impossible.

595
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:48,811
You won't like this, then.

596
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,525
What?

597
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:56,534
What?

598
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:02,383
Get down.

599
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:28,936
Look.

600
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,988
Can you see?

601
00:46:52,783 --> 00:46:55,107
Let me smell you.

602
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:02,498
Please... Just a sniff.

603
00:47:06,684 --> 00:47:08,554
You're a naughty dog.

604
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,932
Get ready while I put my dress on.

605
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,455
Haven't got any...
Anything to get ready in.

606
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:31,138
Stay here, then, and
write your masterpiece.

607
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:40,080
Just leave it, like Jack does.

608
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:44,046
I wouldn't rely on him
in matters of the head.

609
00:47:44,047 --> 00:47:46,041
You envied him.

610
00:47:46,218 --> 00:47:48,596
You made sure he had
more of you than I did.

611
00:47:48,597 --> 00:47:51,924
He was the child. Now you
want him back in the house.

612
00:47:52,104 --> 00:47:54,133
You can't let anyone go.

613
00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:56,736
I haven't seen this
since I read Gramsci

614
00:47:56,737 --> 00:47:59,617
and contemplated kidnapping
a captain of industry.

615
00:48:22,954 --> 00:48:25,358
<i>This is the last time I save you.</i>

616
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:28,155
What?

617
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:32,388
On the room, madame?

618
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:34,975
Always on the room.
It's my new mantra.

619
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:36,846
"On the room."

620
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,019
Everything on the room.

621
00:48:51,384 --> 00:48:57,671
I think I'm gonna ask Morgan to help you
get your philosophy book published.

622
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,008
I'm not ready to start that.

623
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:04,228
What's so amusing?

624
00:49:04,783 --> 00:49:10,752
You are always about to write a book
or about to decorate the bathroom

625
00:49:10,753 --> 00:49:16,254
or about to tell me something which
will alter our lives forever.

626
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:18,767
But you know what you are?

627
00:49:18,768 --> 00:49:21,138
A potential Nobel laureate?

628
00:49:21,315 --> 00:49:24,937
You are the postman
who never knocks.

629
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:27,242
And you know why that is?

630
00:49:27,243 --> 00:49:30,915
Please, darling, lighten
my burden of ignorance.

631
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:33,321
I'm not sure you've got any balls.

632
00:49:35,675 --> 00:49:38,555
When we met, you were part
of the feminist Taliban

633
00:49:38,556 --> 00:49:41,269
and you insisted I contact
my feminine side.

634
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,273
Have I not contacted
it sufficiently?

635
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:44,692
Contacted it?

636
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,096
You practically married it.

637
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:56,866
Perhaps one day I'll
be as tall and manly

638
00:49:57,175 --> 00:50:00,582
and as nifty with
Microsoft Word as Melik.

639
00:50:01,057 --> 00:50:02,585
Melik.

640
00:50:06,734 --> 00:50:08,946
The computer guy? Melik?

641
00:50:08,947 --> 00:50:10,692
Yes, Melik.

642
00:50:11,744 --> 00:50:14,741
Well? Are you going to admit it?

643
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,112
Admit what?

644
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:19,165
Your lover.

645
00:50:22,765 --> 00:50:25,214
Yes?

646
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:31,723
That kid?

647
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:35,955
That bald, sweaty nerd
in a badly-fitting T-shirt?

648
00:50:35,956 --> 00:50:37,667
Are you having a nervous breakdown?

649
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:38,878
Admit it.

650
00:50:38,879 --> 00:50:41,842
How many times do you expect me to
believe your bloody laptop can go wrong?

651
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:43,622
Admit it!

652
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:50,262
You're ill!

653
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:03,300
I saw how you were with him.
Tell me the truth.

654
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:06,138
You're an idiot. I've
had enough of you.

655
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:08,643
Meg, tell me the truth.

656
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:12,221
Have I ever lied to you? Ever?

657
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,113
What on earth was I thinking of,

658
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:19,455
depriving myself of love,
of sex, of male company,

659
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:21,209
to keep this pathetic thing going?

660
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,129
I thought you were
interested in someone else.

661
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,760
- It's me I want more of!
- Why? What for?

662
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:29,224
- I want to sell the house.
- What?

663
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:31,144
I'm to be thrown out
of my own home?

664
00:51:31,145 --> 00:51:34,024
- Get a flat.
- I don't have an income.

665
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:36,646
Divorce happens to everyone now.

666
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:39,243
You went with a student!

667
00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:41,998
Fifteen years ago. How could
you bring that up now?

668
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:44,169
Just as Jack was having all
those problems at school,

669
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,794
all you said was, "He'll be fine."
I was out of my mind with worry.

670
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:51,349
You couldn't believe
that any child of yours

671
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,105
could possibly have
anything wrong with him.

672
00:51:54,106 --> 00:51:56,650
I was isolated. You
preferred the boys to me.

673
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:58,555
Do you blame me?

674
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:01,603
Meg. Meg...

675
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:04,707
If we go in there, our lives
will never be the same again.

676
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:08,240
Great! Let's hurry,
let's open the door.

677
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:13,015
In fact, why don't you stay out here
whingeing and complaining as usual?

678
00:52:13,016 --> 00:52:15,519
I actually want to go to a party.

679
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,674
Come on, Meg!

680
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:19,478
Meg, please.

681
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:22,897
Fucking apologise!

682
00:52:23,828 --> 00:52:25,705
Why should I?

683
00:52:25,706 --> 00:52:30,081
You dressed up for him. You took him tea.
You hung around wearing that scent.

684
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:34,837
I love you, Meg.

685
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:37,470
Take that seriously.

686
00:52:40,402 --> 00:52:42,196
Love dies.

687
00:52:42,197 --> 00:52:43,740
Only if you kill it.

688
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:46,328
- Fool, you really are.
- Call me paranoid.

689
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,582
You are, you must be. Melik!

690
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,336
Cold, you. You're frozen inside.

691
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:51,755
Frankly, you'd freeze a penguin.

692
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:53,592
- Ha, ha. That's not fuckin' funny.
- You're weak.

693
00:52:53,593 --> 00:52:56,931
You won't even get through this
evening without a nervous breakdown.

694
00:52:56,932 --> 00:52:59,145
- Welcome!
- Ah!

695
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:02,017
Thank goodness, you made it.
That's so wonderful.

696
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:04,238
- Ah! There we are.
- Hi.

697
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:06,031
Not far to go. Good evening.

698
00:53:06,032 --> 00:53:08,162
Welcome. Here, would you
like some champagne?

699
00:53:08,163 --> 00:53:10,249
- Thank you.
- Please. Come on in, come on in.

700
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,462
I was worried you guys
weren't gonna make it.

701
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:14,424
I almost had a thrombo.
Come on, come on.

702
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,093
There are some great
people in here,

703
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:17,804
and they're dying to meet you.
I've been talking you up.

704
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,099
Thank you, Stéphane.

705
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,560
I've been thinking
about you all day.

706
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:22,009
You have?

707
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,984
What gorgeous hell is this?

708
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:27,014
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

709
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,243
Go on, go in.

710
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:32,082
They're French. I'm sure
their lives are awful too.

711
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,668
Don't leave me on my own.

712
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,868
Isn't that what you want?

713
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:37,467
There we are.

714
00:53:37,468 --> 00:53:39,221
Thought I'd lost you. Come on in.

715
00:53:39,222 --> 00:53:41,683
I didn't see... Oh, look at that.
Come on in, I'll introduce you.

716
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:46,012
I didn't see that black lacy...
I wish I had my sketch pad.

717
00:53:46,193 --> 00:53:49,949
May I introduce you to all
these talkative types?

718
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,373
Hey, this is, uh, Nick, everybody.

719
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:57,003
Well, here's Robert and Dominique
Ertel, my long-suffering publishers.

720
00:53:57,004 --> 00:53:58,632
They do all my stuff
here in France.

721
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:03,350
This is my great old friend,
Nick Burrows, and his wife, Meg.

722
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:06,313
They're from London.
He's a professor of philosophy.

723
00:54:06,314 --> 00:54:10,280
Meg, I'm so sorry, I didn't ask you.
Tell me what you do.

724
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:12,075
- Writer?
- I'm a teacher.

725
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:13,911
That's so interesting.
I wanna hear all about that.

726
00:54:13,912 --> 00:54:17,084
Jean-Pierre. May I introduce
our expert on Proust?

727
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,004
- He's exaggerating.
- Not true.

728
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:22,177
He's so good. And you're
currently translating Dickens.

729
00:54:22,178 --> 00:54:23,805
<i>Yeah. Bleak House.</i>

730
00:54:23,806 --> 00:54:25,808
- Oh!
<i>- Bleak House.</i>

731
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:29,357
Oh, yeah. Victoire Lachapelle,
the novelist, I'm sure you know,

732
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,514
Américain, very successful...

733
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:34,992
And Harry Rose, the sculptor,

734
00:54:34,993 --> 00:54:37,164
who's got a very interesting
show of drawings.

735
00:54:37,165 --> 00:54:40,295
- Where is that gallery?
- Think and Do Gallery, St Honoré.

736
00:54:40,296 --> 00:54:42,841
I saw it, it's fantastic.
I highly recommend it.

737
00:54:42,842 --> 00:54:45,596
- Christophe Aragues.
- Ara-gueth.

738
00:54:45,597 --> 00:54:46,931
Ara-gueth.

739
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:49,812
He's a professor of
economics at the Sorbonne.

740
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:53,570
And Valentin Lefevre, who's
an economist at <i>Le Monde.</i>

741
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:54,988
<i>Financial Times.</i>

742
00:54:54,989 --> 00:54:58,788
<i>The Financial Times</i>. Perhaps
you've run into his stuff.

743
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:03,004
And the Mona Lisa over there,
can you see, is my wife Eve.

744
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:07,038
Hello, my darling.
Nick Burrows and Meg.

745
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:08,848
Thank you.

746
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:11,938
So there you go.
Hey, come with me, Nick.

747
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:14,568
Can I steal your sweet
husband away for a sec?

748
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:16,863
- Take him, do.
- What are you gonna say?

749
00:55:16,864 --> 00:55:18,075
Yeah, right.

750
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:22,405
There you go. Okay.

751
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,273
There you go.

752
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:36,142
There you go, Nick.

753
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,157
Oh, if I may.

754
00:55:39,158 --> 00:55:42,163
Thanks. Can't wait to read it.

755
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:46,128
Oh, well, you know, it's actually
just a rehash of my old articles.

756
00:55:46,129 --> 00:55:50,219
But, you know, they put it into this
book and it took off for some reason.

757
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,142
I got lucky, I guess.
It could happen to anybody.

758
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:56,898
- It didn't happen to me.
- Well, you're too serious.

759
00:55:56,899 --> 00:56:00,781
You know, have you ever even said
anything slight in your whole life?

760
00:56:00,782 --> 00:56:04,121
I don't think so, not in the time
that I knew you. Here have a...

761
00:56:04,122 --> 00:56:06,400
Please have a seat.

762
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:10,299
Over the years that I've sat in
desks like this and, you know,

763
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,889
in those times when I've tried to
convince myself I had some kind of brain

764
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:18,898
or just a little bit of
rigour and integrity,

765
00:56:18,899 --> 00:56:21,403
you know what I've thought
so often to myself?

766
00:56:21,404 --> 00:56:23,649
"What would Nick Burrows do now?

767
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:27,315
"What would Nick say now?"

768
00:56:28,543 --> 00:56:30,413
- You have?
- Yes.

769
00:56:30,505 --> 00:56:32,907
Thank you so much. Would
you like something to eat?

770
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:35,930
- No, merci.
- Are you sure? Thank you.

771
00:56:35,931 --> 00:56:37,725
Thank you. Is it, Ju...

772
00:56:37,726 --> 00:56:40,632
- Julie.
- Julie?

773
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:42,678
Thank you, Julie.

774
00:56:46,785 --> 00:56:48,313
Eve.

775
00:56:48,914 --> 00:56:51,319
She's gonna eat me alive.

776
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:54,788
You know, I'm not...
I'm not a total idiot.

777
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:56,511
But...

778
00:56:56,512 --> 00:57:02,391
Nick, I was so depressed and I was
just suffocating and I was dying.

779
00:57:02,482 --> 00:57:06,013
I was seeing every psychiatrist
on the Upper West Side.

780
00:57:06,615 --> 00:57:11,947
Until I finally found one who, of course,
told me what I wanted to hear

781
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:14,743
and he released me

782
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,136
and I slipped away from
my wife one morning

783
00:57:18,137 --> 00:57:20,507
without even taking my toothbrush.

784
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,231
It was totally insane.
And I wound up here.

785
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:28,238
But then, I decided to do the
whole thing all over again.

786
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:30,660
Love, marriage and kids.

787
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:34,034
And so now here I am...

788
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:35,877
Mmm.

789
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:38,203
Enjoying...

790
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,797
Keeping the Mona Lisa fascinated.

791
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:44,048
And she adores me.

792
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:46,898
Can't see through me... Yet.

793
00:57:46,899 --> 00:57:48,803
But we know she will.

794
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:51,148
I mean, she will.

795
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:57,156
So am I brave or am I foolish?

796
00:57:58,004 --> 00:58:00,910
Why would you put yourself
through all that again?

797
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:05,684
Because I'm vain.

798
00:58:05,685 --> 00:58:08,773
Because I'm just ridiculously vain.

799
00:58:08,774 --> 00:58:13,309
I wanna be adored and waited for

800
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:15,445
and listened to.

801
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,448
Don't you?

802
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:20,413
I don't share your delusion.

803
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:24,542
What do you mean, delusion?
How am I deluded?

804
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:29,514
That by giving up on
someone, you're free.

805
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:35,274
No, no, no.

806
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:37,320
No, no. Mmm.

807
00:58:38,122 --> 00:58:39,820
Mmm!

808
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:42,171
Do you know what I just flashed on?

809
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:44,793
Do you remember those
mornings at dawn

810
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:50,853
that we would get up to sell those
newspapers in front of the factory gates?

811
00:58:50,854 --> 00:58:55,388
I think we sold about four of them before
the working-class heroes chased us away.

812
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,203
I'll bet those factories
aren't even there any more.

813
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:01,541
How about the Brecht play,

814
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:05,131
that you put on at the ADC
with the Pink Floyd music?

815
00:59:05,132 --> 00:59:07,707
Very brilliant. Very brilliant.

816
00:59:08,388 --> 00:59:10,211
Were those the days?

817
00:59:12,437 --> 00:59:14,055
Oh!

818
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:16,013
Wow!

819
00:59:16,778 --> 00:59:20,277
I mean, we grew up so safe
and easy, that's the truth.

820
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:25,001
You know, it's been just a
breeze for guys like us.

821
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:27,999
- It has?
- Well, look at you, you know.

822
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:31,541
Sitting comfortably in
some 15th-century room,

823
00:59:31,724 --> 00:59:36,304
with your spectacularly
striking, beautiful wife.

824
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:40,770
A weekend cottage ¡n the Cotswolds,
I'll bet, and a Labrador,

825
00:59:42,286 --> 00:59:45,415
the royalties from all your books and
a big pension at the end of all of it.

826
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:47,377
Am I getting my serve
in the ballpark?

827
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:50,967
And you've got smart, bearded friends
with whom you can discuss politics

828
00:59:50,968 --> 00:59:54,350
and philosophy while you all sing
along to Joni Mitchell records?

829
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:57,521
You see me more clearly
than I see myself.

830
00:59:57,522 --> 01:00:01,613
I can... You know,
I can do a little thing.

831
01:00:01,614 --> 01:00:03,141
You know...

832
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:07,027
I think we've taken too
much out of the world.

833
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:10,755
We were the spark. The '60s
and '70s lit the fuse, baby.

834
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:12,250
Really?

835
01:00:12,468 --> 01:00:16,044
Yeah. Feminism, racial equality,
human rights, all that stuff.

836
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:20,232
Yeah, I wanna ignite some
kind of blaze, you know.

837
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:24,937
I wanna go into the banlieues with
some good people and some money

838
01:00:25,032 --> 01:00:29,374
and, you know, have discussions,
political, literary, but shake things up.

839
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,253
Do you wanna come with me?

840
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:32,672
Me?

841
01:00:32,673 --> 01:00:37,423
I could put you down for, you know, 2K.
Neither of us'll miss that kind of money.

842
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:40,895
Make it four.

843
01:00:40,896 --> 01:00:44,349
Make it 4K, I'll put a
cheque in the post tomorrow.

844
01:00:45,447 --> 01:00:47,191
Nick Burrows.

845
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:50,109
I knew you'd get it.

846
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:53,537
Oh, I knew it.

847
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,495
Here's to the future.

848
01:01:09,826 --> 01:01:12,357
- Are you an artist?
- I wish.

849
01:01:13,042 --> 01:01:15,445
Well, you... You
look like an artist.

850
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,746
Perhaps it's your hair.

851
01:01:25,439 --> 01:01:28,219
So, what are you doing here?

852
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:30,766
Yes, that's a good question.

853
01:01:30,908 --> 01:01:33,413
No, I mean, what are you
doing here in Paris?

854
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:35,707
Oh, it's our wedding anniversary.

855
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:39,286
Really? Wow, how long?

856
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,721
- Thirty years.
- That's amazing.

857
01:01:42,722 --> 01:01:44,392
Yes, it is, isn't it?

858
01:01:44,393 --> 01:01:47,890
Our children have
left home. Nearly.

859
01:01:47,982 --> 01:01:49,693
So now, we're alone together.

860
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:52,115
And now you will have
time just for each other.

861
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:54,110
Mmm.

862
01:01:55,455 --> 01:01:57,859
I know it's awful.

863
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:03,455
I can't wait to be with him
every minute of the day.

864
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:07,101
He knows everything.
I will never be bored by him.

865
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:09,506
Suppose he's bored by you?

866
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,737
Really? You think?

867
01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:14,656
I don't believe in that.

868
01:02:14,657 --> 01:02:16,184
"The one."

869
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:19,541
There are many ones.
That's the problem.

870
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:22,869
People start to murder you.
You have to be ruthless.

871
01:02:25,094 --> 01:02:27,640
My husband claimed
I was unfaithful.

872
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:29,340
And what did you say?

873
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:33,443
I thought,

874
01:02:33,444 --> 01:02:36,189
"What a waste.

875
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:41,199
"To be accused of being a
whore and to be so innocent."

876
01:02:45,132 --> 01:02:46,676
I'm sorry.

877
01:02:46,677 --> 01:02:48,930
When's the baby due?

878
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,428
Oh, it's for April.

879
01:03:42,742 --> 01:03:44,869
Sorry.

880
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:46,456
Who are you?

881
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:48,861
Nick. I'm Nick.

882
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,415
Do you like that music?

883
01:03:56,726 --> 01:04:00,008
Uh... I like all music.

884
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:02,513
I give it a go.

885
01:04:03,532 --> 01:04:05,701
Good for you.

886
01:04:05,702 --> 01:04:07,195
Do you want a drink?

887
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:18,509
Aren't you, um, enjoying the party?

888
01:04:18,727 --> 01:04:21,724
I'm not sure enjoyment's
really my thing.

889
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,521
I don't quite fit in.

890
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:28,528
Even on my own, I don't fit in,
let alone with anyone else.

891
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,374
- You live here?
- Oh, I'm just here for the weekend.

892
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:38,889
I live in New York.

893
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:41,341
- Crikey.
- Yeah, Morgan's my dad.

894
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,549
Oh, right.

895
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:48,224
How's that? Not too bad?

896
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:52,072
Does he talk in a loud
voice all the time?

897
01:04:56,465 --> 01:04:58,869
Even his emails are loud.

898
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:06,680
Hi.

899
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,074
- Hi.
- Can I join you?

900
01:05:10,075 --> 01:05:12,479
Please do.

901
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:16,752
- It's high up, yes?
- Yeah.

902
01:05:16,753 --> 01:05:18,873
It is.

903
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:25,602
Do you know Paris well?

904
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:28,225
No. No, not well.

905
01:05:30,238 --> 01:05:33,201
So we have, over there, the Louvre,

906
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:37,417
la Gare d'Orsay and the Tour
Montparnasse over there.

907
01:05:37,418 --> 01:05:40,298
- Mmm-hmm.
- Les Invalides.

908
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:43,546
- L'Assemblée nationale.
- Oh, yes.

909
01:05:43,763 --> 01:05:45,098
L'Obelisk.

910
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:48,221
- You see l'Obelisk?
- It's pretty.

911
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:56,696
I mean, a weekend in Paris.
What a drag!

912
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,945
The more out of it
I am, the better.

913
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:04,457
You've obviously never
been to Birmingham.

914
01:06:04,595 --> 01:06:07,841
I'd make the most of this
city, if I were you.

915
01:06:08,435 --> 01:06:11,557
- That's what my dad says.
- He does?

916
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:17,018
He and I don't really

917
01:06:17,077 --> 01:06:18,954
share that many interests.

918
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:22,795
That's not unusual.

919
01:06:22,796 --> 01:06:26,499
I mean, he likes the
idea of me being around.

920
01:06:27,554 --> 01:06:30,101
He sends me air tickets,

921
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:34,401
but he really freaks out if we're
ever stuck in the same room together.

922
01:06:34,402 --> 01:06:38,309
He feels bad, guilty, I suppose.

923
01:06:39,077 --> 01:06:41,777
He hates being hated.

924
01:06:43,585 --> 01:06:45,988
What about your mum?

925
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:48,869
She's okay.

926
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:51,516
She tried to, you
know, kill herself.

927
01:06:51,517 --> 01:06:53,311
Oh, fuck!

928
01:06:53,312 --> 01:06:55,773
Yeah, she, like,

929
01:06:55,774 --> 01:06:57,777
threw herself out of a window.

930
01:06:57,778 --> 01:07:00,199
Oh, my God!

931
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,871
Yeah, but she's okay.

932
01:07:02,872 --> 01:07:05,276
She's over that now.

933
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:11,012
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

934
01:07:11,013 --> 01:07:12,765
Sorry?

935
01:07:12,766 --> 01:07:15,591
What are you thinking
at this moment?

936
01:07:23,536 --> 01:07:27,819
The, um, situation
of a woman like me.

937
01:07:30,216 --> 01:07:33,873
Boredom, dissatisfaction...

938
01:07:35,475 --> 01:07:37,504
Fury.

939
01:07:38,314 --> 01:07:41,139
And the clock ticking by.

940
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:48,992
What a great thing.

941
01:07:50,295 --> 01:07:52,370
What?

942
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:57,125
To be so attuned to
your own unhappiness.

943
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,739
Look...

944
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,620
You see La... La Rue de Rivoli?

945
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:13,172
Around the corner,
there is a little bar

946
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:16,374
where we could have a
drink, if you like.

947
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,226
When?

948
01:08:26,697 --> 01:08:29,398
Now, if you like.

949
01:08:53,123 --> 01:08:54,741
What do you do?

950
01:08:55,585 --> 01:08:58,131
- I'm a teacher.
- A teacher?

951
01:08:58,132 --> 01:09:00,386
Yes, really.

952
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:17,906
Jesus!

953
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:22,916
Is that a fucking
monkey I see before me?

954
01:09:36,913 --> 01:09:39,910
Do you know what my
problem has been?

955
01:09:44,803 --> 01:09:49,520
I am one of those
unfortunate people

956
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:53,225
who is congenitally
faithful to his wife.

957
01:09:56,284 --> 01:10:01,411
Unlike the rest of the population, I
don't want to go to bed with strangers.

958
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:04,617
I only like her.

959
01:10:07,555 --> 01:10:11,429
For me, there's never been sex
without an attempt at love.

960
01:10:12,857 --> 01:10:15,227
Uh-huh?

961
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:19,269
Love is the only interesting thing.

962
01:10:20,622 --> 01:10:24,496
It's far, far more
difficult to do than sex.

963
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:28,503
What is wrong with me?

964
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,271
What's he telling you?

965
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:37,396
Um, to be honest, it's
difficult to make sense of it.

966
01:10:39,074 --> 01:10:41,022
They want us to eat.

967
01:10:41,078 --> 01:10:42,856
Having a good time?

968
01:10:44,376 --> 01:10:46,575
A man asked me to have
a drink with him.

969
01:10:47,882 --> 01:10:50,161
Did he?

970
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,923
What did you say?

971
01:10:54,603 --> 01:10:56,598
I said yes.

972
01:11:00,072 --> 01:11:01,782
When?

973
01:11:01,783 --> 01:11:04,188
Later tonight.

974
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:08,992
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

975
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,835
I want to go.

976
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,244
Um... Here, you should take these.

977
01:11:25,245 --> 01:11:27,649
You might need them.

978
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:33,248
We are all here to celebrate
the brilliance of this.

979
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:35,012
Ah!

980
01:11:35,013 --> 01:11:37,087
Bravo!

981
01:11:38,603 --> 01:11:40,648
Bravo! Bravo!

982
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:42,026
No...

983
01:11:42,027 --> 01:11:47,244
Yeah, which he wrote while
working, while running our lives,

984
01:11:47,245 --> 01:11:49,206
attending to me,

985
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:52,296
buying art and learning Russian.

986
01:11:52,297 --> 01:11:54,341
Yeah, that's true.

987
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:57,930
Yeah, he has the energy
of 100 teenagers.

988
01:11:57,931 --> 01:11:59,517
Yes.

989
01:11:59,518 --> 01:12:02,440
But wait. He's dark. He's moody.

990
01:12:02,441 --> 01:12:03,985
Moody?

991
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,528
Yes.

992
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:08,326
He talks all the time,
all through breakfast.

993
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:12,959
In fact, he talks even
when he's on the toilet.

994
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,740
I'm stunned. That's dessert talk.

995
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:20,382
Yeah, he has more exes,
I think, than Pére-Lachaise.

996
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,816
But I... I agreed to take him on.

997
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:28,939
<i>Mmm, pourquoi? Pourquoi?</i>

998
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:30,518
Idiocy.

999
01:12:31,204 --> 01:12:32,902
Idiocy? Idiocy?

1000
01:12:34,293 --> 01:12:35,694
No, love.

1001
01:12:37,715 --> 01:12:39,790
Yes, love.

1002
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:45,842
To you, my love.

1003
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:48,310
To Morgan.

1004
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:50,239
Cheers. <i>Santé.</i>

1005
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,567
- Santé. Cheers.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1006
01:12:54,373 --> 01:12:57,335
Thank you, sweet. Let me say it quick.
Let me get this over with.

1007
01:12:57,336 --> 01:13:01,844
Thank you. What have I done to deserve
such love, and from my wife of all people?

1008
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:04,045
Oh, my golly!

1009
01:13:04,308 --> 01:13:05,892
Well, just very quickly,
thank you all for coming.

1010
01:13:05,893 --> 01:13:09,150
Those books, by the way, they're
gonna be in a box in the hall.

1011
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,738
So on your way out, take five
or ten, as many as you want.

1012
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:15,271
Some are even unsigned. I think
that makes them more valuable.

1013
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:19,711
But may I take this opportunity not to say
anything more about that lousy little book,

1014
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:22,675
which already is, frankly,
wildly out of date,

1015
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:25,672
but about this fella right here?

1016
01:13:26,057 --> 01:13:31,066
Nick Burrows, who I found yesterday,
as you do so often with old friends,

1017
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:33,821
kissing a woman
passionately in the street.

1018
01:13:33,822 --> 01:13:35,783
He later claimed that
that woman was his wife.

1019
01:13:41,545 --> 01:13:43,381
But, no, you know.

1020
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:49,715
I'm thinking back right now, uh, on a
time when you and I were skulking around

1021
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:53,985
and loitering in
gloomy Cambridge pubs,

1022
01:13:53,986 --> 01:13:56,606
presuming to figure out
how to fix the world.

1023
01:13:56,698 --> 01:14:00,652
I made him take me
on as his disciple

1024
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:05,537
and stalked him at meetings
and followed him around

1025
01:14:05,549 --> 01:14:09,514
to these little bring-your-own-bottle
parties in bedsits

1026
01:14:09,515 --> 01:14:13,146
and grubby little restaurants
with names like Eros

1027
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:15,316
and The Whim.

1028
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:20,728
He started to shame me
into reading real things.

1029
01:14:20,996 --> 01:14:25,294
You made me concentrate for more
than five minutes at a time.

1030
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:29,954
And he made me say true things

1031
01:14:30,263 --> 01:14:36,425
for the first time in my short and
well-upholstered Yankee life.

1032
01:14:38,278 --> 01:14:39,931
My gosh.

1033
01:14:40,657 --> 01:14:45,316
I thank you publicly for
keeping the torch burning,

1034
01:14:46,126 --> 01:14:50,580
as you have done so
magnificently over these years.

1035
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,601
Ladies and gents, may
we raise a glass

1036
01:14:55,602 --> 01:14:59,351
to my friend Nick Burrows.

1037
01:14:59,902 --> 01:15:01,279
Thank you, Nick.

1038
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,158
To Nick Burrows.

1039
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:05,278
<i>Santé.</i>

1040
01:15:05,412 --> 01:15:08,694
Thank you, my friend.

1041
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,420
Fuck.

1042
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:17,005
Shit... Um...

1043
01:15:18,312 --> 01:15:20,273
Fucking hell.

1044
01:15:20,274 --> 01:15:22,929
Thank you for that, Morgan.

1045
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:26,644
I'm grateful for what you said.

1046
01:15:26,911 --> 01:15:28,610
Um...

1047
01:15:30,419 --> 01:15:34,327
I'm surprised, too, and taken
aback, quite far back.

1048
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:37,042
But I was reminded of something.

1049
01:15:39,686 --> 01:15:41,681
Of myself.

1050
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:46,573
Of the self

1051
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:49,196
I hide in myself.

1052
01:15:52,127 --> 01:15:55,624
I'm still an anarchist
of the left, I suppose.

1053
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:58,254
I'm still a fool for the truth.

1054
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:01,219
Always my weak point.

1055
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:06,069
So I suppose I should,
on that basis, point out

1056
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:09,158
that the university where I teach
is not a proper university,

1057
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:14,911
but it's an ex-polytechnic, which is now
a factory on the outskirts of Birmingham,

1058
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:19,669
set up to produce only idiocy.

1059
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:25,897
I should point out that
I have just been sacked

1060
01:16:25,898 --> 01:16:32,107
for apparently speaking inappropriately
to a female black student.

1061
01:16:34,124 --> 01:16:40,217
My older son is a pot-head with rats
in the house that we bought for him

1062
01:16:40,218 --> 01:16:42,839
with the last of our savings.

1063
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,222
His chosen profession is to watch
television in the afternoons.

1064
01:16:48,024 --> 01:16:49,426
I'm broke.

1065
01:16:50,362 --> 01:16:53,450
Every bone and muscle in
my body screams with agony

1066
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:55,854
when I attempt to tie my shoelaces.

1067
01:16:58,586 --> 01:17:03,292
I'm near shitting myself with fear
and anxiety every moment of the day.

1068
01:17:11,068 --> 01:17:14,199
Plus the fact my wife is well aware

1069
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:20,283
that I only cling to her like a
drowning man to a shelf of melting ice

1070
01:17:21,588 --> 01:17:24,084
because no one else would touch me.

1071
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:29,937
She's planning, in fact, to give
me the slip later this evening

1072
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:32,513
in order to be with another man.
Well, good for her.

1073
01:17:32,944 --> 01:17:34,971
And good for him, too.

1074
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:40,449
So think of me as falling
out of a window...

1075
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:44,665
Forever.

1076
01:17:46,718 --> 01:17:49,419
For I am truly fucked.

1077
01:18:00,955 --> 01:18:04,532
Oh, man, that was awesome.

1078
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,260
Is that it? Did I
leave anything out?

1079
01:18:22,454 --> 01:18:24,324
Can I say something, please?

1080
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:26,777
Go ahead, please.

1081
01:18:28,673 --> 01:18:32,172
I was on the balcony just
now talking to Jean-Pierre.

1082
01:18:35,186 --> 01:18:38,763
I remembered something
from the other day,

1083
01:18:39,194 --> 01:18:43,022
when I was with a friend.

1084
01:18:43,535 --> 01:18:45,938
And my phone rang.

1085
01:18:48,294 --> 01:18:49,879
And, um.

1086
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,959
I spoke with the person.

1087
01:18:54,473 --> 01:18:58,221
And at the end of
the call, she said,

1088
01:18:58,981 --> 01:19:01,135
"Who was that?

1089
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:03,523
"Was it your secret lover?

1090
01:19:05,535 --> 01:19:08,532
"You sounded so pleased
to hear from them,

1091
01:19:10,211 --> 01:19:11,955
"and you kept laughing."

1092
01:19:15,053 --> 01:19:17,723
I was astonished. I said,

1093
01:19:17,724 --> 01:19:20,129
"What do you mean?

1094
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,926
"It was my husband."

1095
01:19:28,245 --> 01:19:30,649
it was my husband.

1096
01:19:39,224 --> 01:19:41,628
Nick?

1097
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:44,150
Are you guys... Oh, are you...

1098
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:45,485
Are you heading out?

1099
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:49,109
That was genius. Genius, as always.

1100
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:52,624
Gee, I wish you didn't
have to rush away.

1101
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:56,453
I'm so sorry if I...
Did I say something possibly...

1102
01:19:56,798 --> 01:19:59,220
How long are you guys
gonna be here for?

1103
01:19:59,221 --> 01:20:03,471
Because I know you said the weekend,
but I don't know specifically.

1104
01:20:03,812 --> 01:20:05,606
Do you still have my number?

1105
01:20:05,607 --> 01:20:08,354
Did you transfer, uh...

1106
01:20:09,114 --> 01:20:12,987
'Cause you can text me.
We don't even have to speak.

1107
01:20:15,834 --> 01:20:18,160
I love you!

1108
01:20:27,816 --> 01:20:30,221
You fucking idiot.

1109
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,700
You genius.

1110
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:35,104
How could you do that?

1111
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:38,962
Talent.

1112
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:41,466
I nearly...

1113
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:43,416
Puked.

1114
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,340
Thank you.

1115
01:20:48,188 --> 01:20:49,590
<i>You know what?</i>

1116
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:55,242
The other day at that
dinner at Ellie's,

1117
01:20:55,243 --> 01:20:57,864
you did this thing.

1118
01:20:58,249 --> 01:21:03,706
You came over and you kissed
me on the side of the head.

1119
01:21:05,012 --> 01:21:07,257
Just casually.

1120
01:21:08,185 --> 01:21:10,855
But I thought it was
the loveliest thing.

1121
01:21:10,856 --> 01:21:13,728
Thanks.

1122
01:21:16,116 --> 01:21:17,826
Now.

1123
01:21:17,827 --> 01:21:20,483
Again, do it again.

1124
01:21:45,965 --> 01:21:48,461
Time to pack, I guess.

1125
01:21:48,678 --> 01:21:51,755
French stairs, my abiding memory.

1126
01:21:52,144 --> 01:21:54,188
You can get the lift.

1127
01:22:00,409 --> 01:22:02,287
- What's going on?
- Madame, I'm sorry.

1128
01:22:02,288 --> 01:22:04,416
We have instructions to refuse
you entry to this room.

1129
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:07,572
- You've been checked out.
- Why? It's not midday.

1130
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:12,139
You are forbidden to touch anything
in here. Again, I apologise.

1131
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,851
Please, give me that hat, ma'am.
Come on, give it to me.

1132
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:18,192
- It's an outrage! It's ridiculous!
- Give it to me. Come on.

1133
01:22:18,193 --> 01:22:20,518
- Ha ha!
- Wahey!

1134
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:23,535
Come on!

1135
01:22:23,536 --> 01:22:25,280
Quickly!

1136
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:28,695
<i>Pardon.</i>

1137
01:22:35,558 --> 01:22:37,603
<i>Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, pardon.</i>

1138
01:22:37,604 --> 01:22:39,232
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1139
01:22:39,233 --> 01:22:41,387
<i>Merci, merci.</i>

1140
01:22:43,115 --> 01:22:44,892
Pardon.

1141
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:47,455
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

1142
01:22:47,456 --> 01:22:49,860
<i>Excusez-moi, pardon, pardon.</i>

1143
01:22:50,504 --> 01:22:52,423
<i>Excusez-moi. Merci.</i>

1144
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:58,309
Ah, Mr and Mrs Burrows.

1145
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:01,774
Please accept my deepest
apology for our little difficulty.

1146
01:23:01,775 --> 01:23:05,398
But I'm sure we can sort
everything out very quickly.

1147
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,525
- Will you please follow me?
- Yeah.

1148
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:13,505
Of course, we have your
passports in our safe.

1149
01:23:13,506 --> 01:23:14,715
But why?

1150
01:23:14,716 --> 01:23:17,596
The credit card you gave
us is beyond its limit.

1151
01:23:17,597 --> 01:23:20,219
See... Here's the bill.

1152
01:23:20,644 --> 01:23:22,719
Right.

1153
01:23:24,027 --> 01:23:25,929
Mmm-hmm.

1154
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:29,827
Oh, yes, that's, um...

1155
01:23:29,828 --> 01:23:32,249
Yes, that is quite a lot of money.

1156
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:36,423
Yeah. There is also the matter,
I fear, of the damage to the room.

1157
01:23:36,424 --> 01:23:38,510
- There is?
- Yes.

1158
01:23:38,511 --> 01:23:40,165
Plus the tax, of course.

1159
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:44,013
- It looks like we got carried away.
- Oh?

1160
01:23:44,564 --> 01:23:46,859
- It was worth it.
- Yeah.

1161
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,812
Mr Burrows, you have another carol?

1162
01:23:51,036 --> 01:23:52,829
Only my bus pass, I'm afraid.

1163
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:56,237
And how do you intend to pay?

1164
01:23:57,881 --> 01:24:00,707
With our lives?

1165
01:24:01,097 --> 01:24:04,048
Unfortunately, it's no longer
a matter of laughing, madam.

1166
01:24:04,478 --> 01:24:07,007
In fact, it's a very
serious matter indeed.

1167
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,111
- A very serious matter.
- Yeah.

1168
01:24:09,112 --> 01:24:11,357
I'm not listening to
any more of this.

1169
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:30,651
That's me bust.

1170
01:24:37,832 --> 01:24:40,454
- What are you doing?
- Texting Morgan.

1171
01:24:41,548 --> 01:24:42,883
Why?

1172
01:24:42,884 --> 01:24:44,677
He's our only hope, isn't he?

1173
01:24:44,678 --> 01:24:46,514
Oh, shit.

1174
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:48,769
- Hi, Jack.
<i>- Hey, Dad. Having a lovely time?</i>

1175
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:51,441
- We're having a fine time.
<i>- Making friends with many frogs?</i>

1176
01:24:51,442 --> 01:24:54,280
No, we haven't met any
French people yet, no.

1177
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:55,698
<i>Have you come to a decision?</i>

1178
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:57,452
Well, yes and no.

1179
01:24:57,453 --> 01:24:59,372
Your mother says it
wouldn't be a good idea

1180
01:24:59,373 --> 01:25:01,335
for you to move back in with us.

1181
01:25:01,336 --> 01:25:04,117
You'll be better off
staying with a mate.

1182
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:06,385
Yeah.

1183
01:25:06,386 --> 01:25:09,292
Yeah, we're enjoying
being on our own now.

1184
01:25:10,144 --> 01:25:12,689
Well, we hope to be back soon.

1185
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,152
- But you do realise...
- No, sorry.

1186
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:16,530
Sorry.

1187
01:25:16,531 --> 01:25:18,575
Hello? Hello?

1188
01:25:18,576 --> 01:25:20,871
- Are you there? Can you hear me?
<i>- Hello?</i>

1189
01:25:20,872 --> 01:25:23,619
- Hello? Hello?
- Dad?

1190
01:25:24,838 --> 01:25:26,958
We got cut off.

1191
01:25:39,825 --> 01:25:41,619
Yes!

1192
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:43,569
What?

1193
01:25:47,756 --> 01:25:50,537
I said you had the euros.

1194
01:25:54,644 --> 01:25:57,141
<i>- Voilà, monsieur.</i>
- Merci.

1195
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,445
We can't do a runner from this
place, we'd get beaten to death.

1196
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:08,237
It's been the best time.

1197
01:26:10,927 --> 01:26:13,331
The best.

1198
01:27:03,192 --> 01:27:04,969
Oh!

1199
01:27:05,112 --> 01:27:08,492
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
My pleasure!

1200
01:27:08,493 --> 01:27:10,538
What... What's happening?

1201
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:13,461
Well, we've had...
A couple of little problems.

1202
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:16,090
- Really? Like what?
- Well...

1203
01:27:16,091 --> 01:27:20,515
You guys have just been having
like a great, great time.

1204
01:27:20,516 --> 01:27:22,311
We certainly have.

1205
01:27:22,312 --> 01:27:23,730
I guess you have.

1206
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:28,489
I think you'd better stay at my
place till you sort yourself out,

1207
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,368
which could take a while.

1208
01:27:30,369 --> 01:27:32,915
- Thanks, that's kind.
- Yes, yes, my pleasure.

1209
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:37,324
I'll get some food and we'll
have a great evening in.

1210
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:42,808
Do you like that idea?
We'll play music and dance.

1211
01:27:42,809 --> 01:27:45,521
Yeah. Would you like to
sing, by any chance?

1212
01:27:45,522 --> 01:27:48,402
- I'd love to sing.
- I'd love to hear you sing.
