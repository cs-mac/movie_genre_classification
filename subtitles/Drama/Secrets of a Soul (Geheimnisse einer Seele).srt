1
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:21,078
Happiness is not aIways fun.

2
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:40,237
FEAR EATS THE SOUL

3
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:08,083
Yes?

4
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:09,316
Excuse me,

5
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:12,560
but it's raining so hard outside,

6
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,556
and I thought,
"Emmi,

7
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,357
better get inside that bar."

8
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,595
I pass by here every evening and
hear that foreign music.

9
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,715
What Ianguage are they singing in?

10
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:27,406
Arabic.

11
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:29,883
Arabic. I see.

12
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:34,005
We have German stuff in the
jukebox, too. NearIy haIf.

13
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,237
But, of course, they prefer the
stuff from back home.

14
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,680
Of course.

15
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,919
What wouId you Iike to drink?

16
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:49,995
What ...

17
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,717
do peopIe usuaIIy have?

18
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:56,203
AII sorts of things.
Whatever you Iike... coIa or beer...

19
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:57,840
That sounds good, thanks.

20
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:00,083
What then? Beer or coIa?

21
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,560
A coIa, pIease.

22
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:10,243
She's nuts. TaIks a bIue streak.

23
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:13,001
Maybe she never gets a chance
to taIk otherwise.

24
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:14,521
ProbabIy.

25
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,595
WeII... are you coming or not?
-No.

26
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,242
And why not?
-Cock broken.

27
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,446
Forget it, then!

28
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,322
Another beer?
-Sure.

29
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:38,715
Two beers.

30
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,602
How much?

31
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,003
For nine beers?
-Yes, nine beers.

32
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:54,166
10 marks 80.

33
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:57,685
Keep the change!
-Thanks.

34
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,157
Why don't you dance with
the oId girI?

35
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:26,876
Me dance with oId woman?

36
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:29,516
Why not?
Your Iegs aren't broken, are they?

37
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,915
What's up?

38
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:33,596
She says I shouId dance
with oId woman.

39
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,045
You dance with me?

40
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,561
What? Dance?

41
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:54,276
Yes. You sit aIone. Sad.
Not good sitting aIone.

42
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:55,482
Why not?

43
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:58,207
It must be aII of 20 years
since I Iast danced.

44
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:01,086
Maybe I can't anymore.

45
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,400
Don't matter! Dance very sIow.

46
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:19,561
Turn the Iights off!

47
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,525
Where are you from?

48
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:33,321
LittIe town in Morocco, Tismit.

49
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:36,680
Oh, Morocco!

50
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:39,720
Yes. Very nice, but no work.

51
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,758
You speak German weII.

52
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,156
Been here Iong?

53
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,557
Two years. Much work.

54
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,600
Me, too.

55
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,239
HaIf of Iife consists of work.

56
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,678
You have no man? Married?

57
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,401
My husband died ages ago.

58
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,079
What do you do?

59
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,999
Work on cars. AII day,

60
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:16,522
aII time.

61
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,799
And you spend your evenings here?

62
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,402
Yes.

63
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,440
Good music,

64
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,446
Arab buddies...

65
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,205
Don't know other pIaces.

66
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:29,398
Germans with Arabs not good.

67
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,716
Why?

68
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,716
Don't know.

69
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,676
Germans not same peopIe as Arabs.

70
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,280
But at work sureIy...?

71
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:43,005
Not the same.

72
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:45,800
German master.

73
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,445
Arab dog.

74
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,478
But that...
-Who cares?

75
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:54,361
Better not think too much.

76
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,283
Think much, cry much.

77
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,085
Here!
-Thanks.

78
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:28,201
Like another drink?

79
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,117
No, thanks.

80
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,324
I have to get up earIy.
I'd Iike to pay for the coIa.

81
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,318
One mark.
-Me pay coIa.

82
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:35,636
Here!

83
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,685
Thanks a Iot, but...

84
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,521
You taIk good with AIi.
AIi pay coIa.

85
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,156
Your name's AIi?

86
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,443
Not AIi, but everyone says AIi.

87
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,882
Now I am AIi.
-What's your reaI name?

88
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,720
EI Hedi ben SaIem M'Barek
Mohammed Mustapha.

89
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:01,842
That's pretty Iong.
-Yes. In Tismit aII names Iong.

90
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,198
I'm afraid I have to go now.

91
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,358
Goodbye.
-Not goodbye.

92
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,643
I go home with you to door.

93
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,160
Not going aIone...

94
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:14,323
better.

95
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,161
If you Iike!

96
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,045
This awfuI rain!

97
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:37,566
Here we are.

98
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,325
This your house?
-Yes.

99
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,842
You can wait here a minute.

100
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,963
Maybe the rain wiII stop.

101
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,966
Otherwise you'II catch coId,
and it'II be my fauIt.

102
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,646
What work you do?

103
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,366
WeII... you know...

104
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:58,764
Yes?

105
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,205
I don't Iike to say.

106
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,278
PeopIe aIways give you
such a funny Iook.

107
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,126
Me not Iook funny.

108
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,115
No, not you.

109
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:09,037
WeII...

110
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:11,163
I cIean.
I'm a cIeaning Iady.

111
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:12,835
In big company?

112
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,883
Not too big,
but there's a Iot of gIass.

113
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,526
It's hard work.

114
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:21,558
There are four of us to
cIean eight fIoors.

115
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:23,884
We do two each,

116
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:26,955
one in the morning and
one in the evening.

117
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:30,724
I'm free in between to
do private jobs.

118
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:35,443
They're aIways Iooking for
cIeaners nowadays.

119
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:38,756
I never Iearned a proper trade.

120
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,766
You wouIdn't beIieve some of
the things that happen.

121
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:46,275
One empIoyer sends for
me in his Mercedes.

122
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,119
With a chauffeur!

123
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:51,004
Who am I to refuse?

124
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,038
He has a factory or something.

125
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,637
You shouId wear Iighter-coIored
suits, AIi.

126
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:59,321
They'd Iook better on you.

127
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:02,363
Me? Light suits?
Why?

128
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,803
It's none of my business, but ...

129
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,562
dark cIothes Iook so sad,
don't they?

130
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:09,923
Don't know.

131
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,315
Maybe.

132
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:14,479
It's good to taIk with someone.

133
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,038
I'm aIone most of the time.

134
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,485
AII the time, reaIIy.

135
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:22,475
My chiIdren have their own Iives.

136
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:25,080
You have many chiIdren?

137
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:27,956
Three...

138
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,597
two sons and a daughter.
They're aII married.

139
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:34,284
Where... other town?

140
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,278
No, here.

141
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:38,958
But they Iive their own Iives.

142
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:42,599
We get together on speciaI
occasions, but...

143
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,366
With us in Morocco,

144
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,995
famiIy aIways together.

145
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:48,965
Mama never aIone.

146
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,879
Mama aIone, not good.

147
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,162
Other countries have other customs.

148
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,197
I'II go see if the rain's stopped.

149
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,800
It's stiII pouring.

150
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,126
Maybe...
-Yes?

151
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:11,483
Why don't you come up for a whiIe?
I'II make us a coffee,

152
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,797
and maybe the rain wiII stop.

153
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,599
I'd Iike to, but...

154
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,927
PeopIe aIways say "but".

155
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,084
And nothing ever changes.

156
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,243
Come on up!

157
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,637
I've got a bottIe of brandy.

158
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,316
A Christmas present from
my oIdest son.

159
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,796
You Iike brandy?
-Brandy? Yes.

160
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,122
There you are.

161
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,516
It's no fun drinking aIone.

162
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:00,840
Good evening, Mrs. Kurowski!

163
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,524
I wanted to give you the
3 marks 50 ...

164
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,166
I owe you.

165
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:16,398
There ...

166
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,281
and thanks a Iot.

167
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:19,795
Thanks. Goodnight!

168
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,161
Goodnight!

169
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:29,837
Come on up!

170
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:43,477
Mrs. Karges?

171
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,875
Imagine!

172
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,442
Mrs. Kurowski's got a foreigner
up there.

173
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:48,676
What?

174
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,437
A bIack man?
-A reaI bIack?

175
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:54,607
WeII, not that bIack,
but pretty dark.

176
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,438
She's not reaIIy German herseIf.

177
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,723
With a name Iike Kurowski!

178
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:00,838
What are things coming to?

179
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,078
I wonder what she's up to with him.

180
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:06,160
No idea.
Maybe she's buying a carpet.

181
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:09,163
At 9:30 at night?

182
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,841
Who knows?

183
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,084
Goodnight, Mrs. Karges!
-Goodnight.

184
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,005
Very good coffee.

185
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:22,276
My famiIy says Emmi's coffee is
enough to wake the dead.

186
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,724
WouId you Iike a brandy with it?

187
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:26,042
PIease.

188
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,285
My husband was PoIish,

189
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:30,795
not German.

190
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,716
He was a foreign worker
during the war.

191
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,197
He just stayed on afterwards.

192
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,996
My parents were stiII aIive then.

193
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,841
They said,
"Emmi,

194
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,243
this'II come to no good."

195
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,842
Because he was a foreigner,

196
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:52,756
you see?

197
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:55,325
Cheers!
-Cheers!

198
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:00,124
My father hated aII foreigners.

199
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,921
He was a party member.
HitIer's party.

200
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,556
You know who HitIer was?
-HitIer? Yes.

201
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,961
I was in the party, too.
Everyone was...

202
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,355
or aImost everyone.

203
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:12,757
But Frantizek and I got aIong fine.

204
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:15,122
That was my husband's name.

205
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:19,077
But then he started having
Iiver troubIe.

206
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:23,160
He aIways drank too much.
But he was aIways a Iot of fun.

207
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:26,117
He died in 1955.

208
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,798
Oh weII! Another drink?
-Yes.

209
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:35,919
And you? Are you married?
-Not married.

210
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,559
And your parents?

211
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,282
Parents dead.
-Both of them?

212
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,756
Papa very oId. Mama very sick.

213
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:45,845
Any brothers or sisters?

214
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:48,475
No brother. Five sisters.
-Five?

215
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,400
Five sisters. AIi smaIIest.

216
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,683
AII sisters oIder.

217
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,326
And they're aII stiII in Morocco?

218
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,047
Not just Morocco. AIgeria, Tunisia.

219
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,164
Papa go waIking with cameIs.

220
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:04,081
Papa Berber.
Berber waIk aII over Africa.

221
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,477
AIi must go now. Very Iate.

222
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:13,440
Have another drink!
Just ten more minutes.

223
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,924
Last tram now.

224
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:18,805
Tram go, AIi waIk home.

225
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:22,325
Where do you Iive?
-Very far. Hofmann Strasse.

226
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,557
Do you have a room there?

227
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,957
Yes, with five friends from work.

228
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,924
Six in smaII room.

229
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:30,725
Six men in one smaII room?

230
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:32,718
Three beds here, three beds there.

231
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,237
What's kif-kif?
-"Who cares" in Arabic.

232
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,886
That's funny.

233
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:43,235
But six men in one room,
that's inhuman.

234
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,682
Arabs not human in Germany.

235
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:46,802
Different earIier.

236
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,567
But since catastrophe in Munich,
not good.

237
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,765
You know what? Have another drink,
and I'II fix you up a bed.

238
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,401
You can sIeep here tonight.
-AIi sIeep here?

239
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,006
Because you have such a Iong way,

240
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,635
and there are six in a room,
and because you're nice.

241
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:03,275
You nice. Very nice.
-Thanks.

242
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,119
When do you start work?

243
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,959
Six-thirty.

244
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,960
Good. Me too.
We can have breakfast together.

245
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,239
I'II get your bed ready.
Have another drink!

246
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:22,564
The bathroom's down the haII.

247
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:29,005
I must have a spare toothbrush.
I bought a ten-pack once.

248
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,442
There.

249
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,199
Thanks. Thanks a Iot.

250
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,636
Goodnight!

251
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:47,922
Goodnight!

252
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:51,922
I've Iaid out one of my husband's
pyjamas for you.

253
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,478
SIeep weII!
-Thanks.

254
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,605
What's the matter?

255
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:51,686
AIi no sIeep.

256
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:54,077
Much thinking in head.

257
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,642
Wants to taIk with you.

258
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:57,557
OK?

259
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,516
AII right. Sit down here.

260
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:11,118
AIi much aIone, too.
AIways working, drinking.

261
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,481
Nothing eIse.

262
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,444
Maybe German right:

263
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:16,165
Arab not human.

264
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:17,556
Nonsense!

265
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,479
You mustn't even think that.

266
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,805
You said yourseIf,
thinking makes a person sad.

267
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:25,197
Though it's not reaIIy true ...

268
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:27,758
that thinking makes you sad.

269
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:30,765
Of course not.

270
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,643
What eIse shouId we
do with our time?

271
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,798
AII the years, aII the months ...

272
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,278
and suddenIy it's over,

273
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,763
and what is there to show for it?

274
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,286
My God, I...

275
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,206
Good morning!

276
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,764
Your coffee aIways good.

277
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,518
I'm actuaIIy quite a cook.

278
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,723
You must come for dinner sometime.

279
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,957
I'm sure you'd Iike it.
-Sure.

280
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,522
Maybe...
-Yes?

281
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,126
Oh, nothing.

282
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:56,881
It's just that...
an oId woman Iike me...

283
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,125
You not oId woman. You good.
Big heart.

284
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:02,642
ReaIIy?

285
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,316
My God!

286
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,046
Don't cry.

287
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,642
PIease!

288
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:10,956
Why cry?

289
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,918
Because I'm so happy and
so fuII of fear, too.

290
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,845
Not fear. Fear not good.

291
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,599
Fear eat the souI.

292
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,803
Fear eats the souI.

293
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,200
That's nice.

294
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,564
Is that an Arab saying?
-Yes.

295
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,958
AII Arabs speak so.

296
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:32,004
It's Iate. Must go now.

297
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,401
If I come Iate, not good.

298
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:38,796
When boss mad with AIi, reaI mean.

299
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,202
I must go, too. I'II get dressed,

300
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,244
and we'II go down together.

301
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,082
I'm taking the subway. You too?

302
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,999
No, I take tram.

303
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,797
WeII, then... Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

304
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:34,159
Today, a man chatted me up in the
subway. Me! An oId woman!

305
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:37,206
A foreign worker.
He wanted to buy me a coffee.

306
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:39,802
They stop at nothing.
-But...

307
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,477
No, nothing's sacred to them,
not even oId age.

308
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:45,478
They're fiIthy pigs.

309
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:46,921
The way they Iive!

310
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:50,682
WhoIe famiIies crammed into one room.
AII they're interested in is the money.

311
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:53,043
Maybe they can't find
a decent pIace.

312
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:56,046
No! They're stingy.

313
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,597
Stingy, unwashed pigs.

314
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:02,756
And they have onIy one thing in
their heads: women.

315
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:06,404
But they do their work.
That's what they're here for.

316
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,795
Hogwash!

317
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:11,323
Go down to the station and Iook
around. A Ioad of trash!

318
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,399
None of them work.

319
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:16,917
ExactIy. They Iive here at our expense.
You onIy have to read the papers:

320
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,998
fuII of rapes and so on.

321
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:22,405
But some of them are married
to German women,

322
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:23,920
aren't they?

323
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:28,362
Some women wouId stoop to anything.

324
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,399
I'd die of shame.

325
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,326
The mere thought!

326
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:40,726
I've aIways said,
women Iike that are fiIthy whores.

327
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,956
There's one where I Iive.

328
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,924
She must be 50 at Ieast.

329
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,799
She's got one. A Turk, I think.

330
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:51,437
He's much younger than she is.
But no one taIks with her anymore.

331
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:53,080
Serves her right!

332
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:56,402
Maybe <i>he</i> taIks with her,

333
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,603
and she doesn't need anyone eIse.

334
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,523
Nobody can Iive without others.

335
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:05,722
No one, Emmi.

336
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:11,559
And what can you taIk about
with someone Iike that?

337
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,400
Most of them don't speak
a word of German.

338
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,922
AII they want is sex.

339
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:19,237
They're not interested in taIking.

340
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:23,161
Some women want it that way.
UnciviIized.

341
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:25,283
Sex on the brain.

342
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,642
I'd die of shame
if I were Iike that.

343
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,318
WeII, we'd better get back to work!

344
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,400
Get me a beer!

345
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:10,205
Get it yourseIf!

346
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:13,601
If I have to get up,
you're going to get it good.

347
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:16,636
You wouIdn't have the energy.

348
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:18,320
You'II see.

349
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:33,043
I have to go back to
work in Friday.

350
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:35,002
At Iast!

351
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,441
It's easy for you to Iaugh.

352
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm not Iaughing. I just want my
peace during the day.

353
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,565
Because I don't Ieave you aIone.

354
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:46,558
It depends how you Iook at it.

355
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:48,435
Who's that?

356
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,007
Do I know in here
who's ringing out there?

357
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,885
Then you'd better Iook.

358
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,485
Lazy swine!

359
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:08,195
Mom!
-Christ AImighty!

360
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:12,116
Guess who's here.
-I heard.

361
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,164
Be nice to her, Eugen!

362
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,800
Come in, Mom!

363
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:18,762
HeIIo!

364
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:20,722
- Hi! -

365
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:25,246
Eugen's on sick Ieave tiII
the day after tomorrow.

366
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,562
You're sick?
-Sort of.

367
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:30,756
ShaII I make you a coffee?
-Yes.

368
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:32,600
That wouId be nice.

369
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:40,399
What've you got?

370
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:41,795
A fever and a cough.

371
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,118
BuII! He's just Iazy.

372
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:46,199
The heII I am!

373
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:49,321
I had a cough and fever,

374
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:51,205
but I feeI better now.

375
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,883
Aren't you working for
your manager today?

376
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:57,241
No, that's tomorrow.

377
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,443
And otherwise?
-Not too bad.

378
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,478
Oh weII!
Your coffee.

379
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,837
Want one, too?
-Leave me aIone!

380
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:08,717
Mind your manners whiIe Mom is here.
-I'II do what I Iike in my own home.

381
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:10,764
It's my home, too.

382
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:13,236
Shut your trap, and put some
cIothes on you, you sIut!

383
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,760
Just Iook at you!

384
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:17,561
It's Iike this every day, Mom.

385
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:21,484
Do you have any foreign workers
where you work?

386
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,886
Don't mention foreign workers.
It makes him see red.

387
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,481
Why?
-Because they're swine!

388
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:29,757
Oh, I see.

389
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,121
Yes they are!

390
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,037
He's even got a Turkish foreman.

391
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:37,041
He just can't get over it.
-Can't get over it?

392
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:38,959
I ignore the guy compIeteIy.

393
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:42,399
And when he gives you orders?
-He doesn't give me orders.

394
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:44,598
Sure he does.
-Then...

395
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,645
Get me the cigarettes!

396
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,476
I wouIdn't dream of it.
-Krista!

397
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:50,797
Yes?

398
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,679
Leave it, Mom! I'II get up.

399
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,241
I'II get them myseIf.

400
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:57,916
I've faIIen in Iove.

401
00:26:58,887 --> 00:26:59,637
What?

402
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:01,556
Yes, Krista.

403
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,395
I'm in Iove ...

404
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:07,159
with a Moroccan.
He's 20 years younger than me.

405
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:08,840
ProbabIy more.

406
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:13,602
You've got a strange sense
of humor, Mom.

407
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:15,924
It's no joke.

408
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,281
It's true.

409
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:19,646
I'm in Iove ...

410
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:23,238
with a Moroccan
who's younger than me.

411
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:25,681
Much younger.

412
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,798
I feIt it was my duty to teII you.

413
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,400
Don't bother!

414
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:36,325
I'II see myseIf out.

415
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:37,676
Bye!

416
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:39,920
Bye, Mom!

417
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:42,798
You know what?
-No,

418
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:44,965
but I'm sure you'II teII me.

419
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:49,243
Your mother's got a screw Ioose.

420
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:14,601
A coIa!

421
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,001
Good evening!

422
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:43,996
Strange,
it's not even raining today.

423
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,476
No, it's not raining.

424
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,758
It's reaIIy quite nice.

425
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,762
I'II pay right away.
-One mark.

426
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,322
Here you are.

427
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,002
By the way, this is my bar.

428
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:00,846
Yes, OK.

429
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,076
And...?

430
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,800
Good evening!

431
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:37,275
Good evening!

432
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:44,397
Yes?

433
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:48,717
Yes.

434
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,041
WeII then...

435
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:08,402
Like it?

436
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,001
Tastes good.

437
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,959
Dig in, there's pIenty.

438
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:13,765
Thanks, not too much.

439
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:16,763
Want a coffee afterwards?
-Yes, coffee.

440
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,325
AIi bring money.

441
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:28,676
No!

442
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,486
Why no?

443
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:32,399
AIi eat and drink.

444
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,637
AIways you pay. Not right.

445
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:38,720
But I Iike to. I earn enough.

446
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:42,876
And money spoiIs a friendship.

447
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:45,204
Not spoiI friendship.

448
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,835
You take money! Everything good!

449
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:52,559
I'II keep it for you in the drawer.

450
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,480
When you need it, just take it.

451
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,601
That money not for AIi. For Emmi.

452
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,122
I don't want it. It's your money.

453
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,721
I don't want a penny from you.

454
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,598
You make me so happy.

455
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:14,915
Good evening, Mr. Gruber!

456
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:16,560
Good evening, Mrs. Kurowski!

457
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,281
Good evening!
-Good evening!

458
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:23,876
This is Mr. Gruber,
the IandIord's son.

459
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,966
PIease have a seat.

460
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:26,764
Thanks.

461
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:28,804
Like a brandy?
-Yes, pIease.

462
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:32,685
But I have something serious
to taIk about with you.

463
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:37,241
WeII, then...

464
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:41,445
I can onIy think ...

465
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,277
you haven't read your
Iease properIy.

466
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:48,404
Of course I've read it.

467
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:53,639
Then you must know you're not
aIIowed to subIet...

468
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:56,603
Section 5, cIause 2.

469
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,764
You mean, because of AIi?

470
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,236
Yes, Mrs. Kurowski. I...

471
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,320
Cheers!
-Cheers!

472
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,035
It's good...

473
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,637
AII I can say is ...

474
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:17,925
your Iodger must move out ...

475
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:20,160
and tomorrow, Mrs. Kurowski.

476
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,158
But AIi's not a Iodger.

477
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:27,238
We're going to get married.

478
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,925
WeII, that's different.

479
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:35,599
I'II be on my way then.

480
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,236
You're oId enough to know
what you're doing.

481
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:42,876
Goodnight!

482
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:44,955
Goodnight!

483
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:47,279
Good grief! What have I done?

484
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:49,039
What he say?

485
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:51,556
He said you can't stay here.

486
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:53,160
Not good man.

487
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:57,164
He's Iike everyone eIse;
no better, no worse.

488
00:33:58,207 --> 00:34:00,846
I toId him we were going to marry.

489
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:02,926
We marry?

490
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,805
You and me? OK.

491
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,440
Good idea!

492
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:10,842
But I didn't mean it.
I just said it because...

493
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:13,356
You and me marry ...

494
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,286
very good.

495
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:16,436
Now drink!

496
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:17,956
Cheers!

497
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:23,161
For everything good.

498
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,837
Yes, AIi. Good for everything.

499
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:31,045
Now we go teII Arab buddies.

500
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:39,078
...and they were so huge,
with big sIeeves and trousers,

501
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:42,359
and this IittIe man came aIong
and just vanished in the suit.

502
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:44,961
We Iaughed our heads off.

503
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,282
Cheers!

504
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,199
The fiIthy oId whore!

505
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,205
You're just envious.

506
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:54,278
Envious? Of her?

507
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:08,283
Now I'II pIay our record.

508
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,919
Come on, Iet's dance!

509
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,119
It'II never work out.

510
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,080
It's unnaturaI,

511
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:04,639
pIain unnaturaI.

512
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:10,280
Of course it won't work. So what?

513
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,477
<i>CiviI Registry II, Munich</i>

514
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:47,886
You know what my name is now?

515
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:49,076
Long name.

516
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,800
A very Iong name.

517
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:55,040
EmanueIa ben SaIem M'Barek
Mohammed Mustapha.

518
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,922
Sounds terrific, doesn't it?
-Very nice.

519
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:00,757
Nice? I don't know...

520
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:02,281
Yes, nice.

521
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,405
If you say so...

522
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:05,636
Come on!

523
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:29,601
HeIIo, Krista!

524
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:31,282
This is Mom.

525
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,805
I'd Iike to invite you over.

526
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:35,605
AIbert and Bruno, too.

527
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,406
Next Saturday...

528
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:38,836
Why?

529
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:40,962
No speciaI reason.

530
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,560
I have something I want
to discuss with you.

531
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,285
CaII the taxi!

532
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,516
This is where HitIer used to eat,

533
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,724
from 1929 to '33.

534
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:18,203
I've aIways wanted to come here.

535
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:20,443
HitIer, you know?
-HitIer, yes.

536
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:53,646
Let's just order the most expensive
things on the menu.

537
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:57,277
The best soups, the best starters.
Or do you want something speciaI?

538
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:59,119
I eat what you eat.

539
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:02,759
Good heavens! Look at that!

540
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:05,202
Caviar costs 45 marks!

541
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:07,961
StiII, today's a speciaI day.

542
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:10,518
Did you know
that there's goIden caviar, too?

543
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,724
I read it in a magazine.

544
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:17,246
GoIden caviar?
-Yes, Iike reaI goId.

545
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,797
But it goes to the Shah of Persia.

546
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,037
Ordinary peopIe can't get it.

547
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:25,681
Caviar's good for Iove, they say.

548
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:27,480
Good for Iove?

549
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:29,763
Yes, it puts you in the mood.

550
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,440
But I don't beIieve that.

551
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:34,922
Or onIy a bit.

552
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:37,484
So, I'II order now.

553
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:39,244
Waiter!

554
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:49,003
Have you decided?
-Yes.

555
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:50,441
We've decided.

556
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,755
Two Iobster cream soups,

557
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,558
caviar for two ...

558
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:00,637
and Chateaubriand ...

559
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:02,760
for two.

560
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,244
How wouId you Iike
the Chateaubriand?

561
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:06,796
How?

562
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,241
GriIIed, I thought.

563
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,604
Of course, ma'am.

564
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:13,719
Rare, or medium?

565
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:17,958
Rare, that sounds good.

566
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,437
Rare, then.
AImost raw. Good.

567
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:23,641
Raw?

568
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:26,716
ActuaIIy...

569
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:30,046
If it's raw,

570
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:32,996
we'd rather...
What was the other one caIIed?

571
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:34,636
Medium.

572
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,562
That's not raw?

573
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,003
No, it's medium.

574
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,966
That'II be fine.

575
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,719
An aperitif to start with?

576
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:46,922
An...?

577
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:48,806
Oh, of course!

578
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:50,480
What kind?

579
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,166
Maybe...

580
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:54,799
What wouId you recommend?

581
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,960
You'd enjoy our house aperitif.

582
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:00,602
WeII, if you say so, fine.

583
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:06,042
He reaIIy had me on the rack there!

584
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,522
If you're not used to
things Iike that...!

585
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,800
WeII, what's up?
Why did you ask us over?

586
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,923
You have to know sooner or Iater.

587
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:35,445
Are you iII, Mom?

588
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,241
Why iII?

589
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:40,797
Because this is aII so officiaI.

590
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:43,356
I'm anything but iII, AIbert.

591
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:44,881
I've married.

592
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:49,683
You've...

593
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:51,517
Mom!

594
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:52,842
But...

595
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:54,483
Who...

596
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:56,799
Who did you marry?

597
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:58,640
Come on in!

598
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:03,520
This is my husband.

599
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,646
EI Hedi ben SaIem M'Barek
Mohammed Mustapha.

600
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:09,122
I caII him AIi.

601
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:55,837
Leave him!

602
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,642
You shouIdn't have done that,
Mother.

603
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:09,600
It's a disgrace.

604
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:12,363
You can forget you have chiIdren.

605
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:15,756
I want nothing to do with a whore.

606
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,436
Come on, Eugen!
We're not staying in this pigsty.

607
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,803
What wouId we Iike?
-A LibeIIe.

608
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:05,281
LibeIIe.

609
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:09,316
Not Iemonade.

610
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,080
Like butter.

611
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:14,883
Butter.

612
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,885
No, not butter.

613
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:18,844
Like butter. LibeIIe.

614
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:25,125
No, mister, not that!

615
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,962
Make up your mind!
I don't have aII day. WeII?

616
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,159
LibeIIe, Iike butter. Not Iemonade!

617
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:35,718
Listen! You go and Iearn some
German first! Then come back!

618
00:44:36,127 --> 00:44:36,877
No understand.

619
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,361
You understand me aII right.

620
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,724
Learn German first,
then come back.

621
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:42,603
Goodbye!

622
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:45,077
Don't understand! I say LibeIIe,

623
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,636
Iike butter, not Iemonade.

624
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,286
Why you not understand? Why?

625
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:56,960
What does he want?

626
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:58,756
LibeIIe.

627
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:01,122
Sure, that's the new margarine.

628
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:03,199
Do you think I don't know that?

629
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,886
He not give LibeIIe.
Say he don't understand.

630
00:45:12,447 --> 00:45:15,519
It's written cIearIy on the Iist:
"LibeIIe".

631
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:19,356
I say: "LibeIIe, Iike butter."
He give Iemonade.

632
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:22,361
He just doesn't want to serve you.

633
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:24,040
I'II show him!

634
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:25,516
What you do?

635
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,237
I'II go over and have
a word with him.

636
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:30,716
I've been a customer of that
swine for 20 years.

637
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:32,526
No fight! Fighting not good!

638
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:34,837
I won't fight, don't worry.

639
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,520
HeIIo!

640
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:47,326
HeIIo, Mrs. Kurowski!
What'II it be?

641
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,399
TeII me, Mr. Angermeyer,
why won't you serve my husband?

642
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:51,966
What's he done to you?

643
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:55,119
Not serve your husband?
He can't teII me what he wants.

644
00:45:55,287 --> 00:45:58,085
He asked for LibeIIe. Margarine.

645
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,161
You see, I didn't understand.

646
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:04,797
You understood him, aII right.

647
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:07,765
But you didn't want to understand.
And you know why?

648
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:10,805
Because he's a foreigner!
That's why you didn't understand.

649
00:46:11,207 --> 00:46:14,563
I'm not Ietting you accuse me of
prejudice against foreigners.

650
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:17,764
I have nothing against foreigners,
not even yours.

651
00:46:17,927 --> 00:46:19,918
Serve him, then, when he comes in!

652
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:22,476
I can't serve someone who
can't speak German.

653
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:24,643
Nonsense!

654
00:46:25,527 --> 00:46:26,846
He can speak German
better than you.

655
00:46:27,127 --> 00:46:28,958
I'm not Ietting you teII me ...

656
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:32,358
a bIack can speak better German
than me. Not you!

657
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:35,243
And that's the Iast time
I serve you, too.

658
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:37,398
I don't need troubIe in my shop.

659
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,559
Leave the shop at once
or I'II throw you out! You...!

660
00:46:40,807 --> 00:46:42,399
Yes?
-Out!

661
00:47:14,487 --> 00:47:16,045
Mrs. Kurowski!
-Yes?

662
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,715
We've been meaning to have
a word with you.

663
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:21,523
About cIeaning the staircase.

664
00:47:21,687 --> 00:47:23,564
In aII seriousness...

665
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:27,806
We've spoken to everyone in the
house, and they aII agree.

666
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:30,719
About what?

667
00:47:31,087 --> 00:47:34,159
About the dirt in the house IateIy.

668
00:47:34,447 --> 00:47:36,085
Dirt? I don't see any.

669
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:38,397
But everyone says there is ...

670
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:42,685
and we've aII agreed that you'II
have to cIean twice a month.

671
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:46,123
Me? Why?
We've had our system for years.

672
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:49,677
Yes, but the situation has
changed radicaIIy.

673
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:50,842
RadicaIIy!

674
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:53,000
It's the same everywhere.

675
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:56,319
With peopIe Iike that in the house,
dirt takes over.

676
00:47:57,327 --> 00:47:58,999
You know what I say?

677
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,603
You put your own house in order,
and I'II see to mine.

678
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:05,565
I don't meddIe in your affairs.

679
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:08,878
We have nothing to reproach
ourseIves with.

680
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:12,202
If you ask me,
you're envious, Mrs. Karges,

681
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:15,800
you're just envious.
Good day!

682
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:18,245
The nerve?

683
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:20,199
Me? Envious?

684
00:48:21,127 --> 00:48:23,083
What does she mean by that?

685
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:33,478
HeIIo!
-HeIIo!

686
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:35,239
Here!
-Thanks.

687
00:48:42,447 --> 00:48:44,563
That's 236 marks 50.

688
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:47,321
Five hours overtime. One every day.

689
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:51,482
And I thought you were boozing
it up somewhere.

690
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:53,439
No understand "boozing".

691
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:55,844
Drinking. Beer or Iiquor.

692
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:58,123
AIi not drink without you.

693
00:48:58,407 --> 00:48:59,726
That's aII right.

694
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:02,196
I earned 210 marks this week,

695
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,676
and you 236.50...

696
00:49:05,087 --> 00:49:08,716
That makes 446 marks 50 in aII.

697
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,878
We'II be rich, AIi ...

698
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:13,961
and we'II buy ourseIves
a IittIe piece of heaven.

699
00:49:14,127 --> 00:49:15,162
Why heaven?

700
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:18,278
Oh, just a fancy of mine.

701
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:20,205
I take a shower.

702
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:22,558
Want a coffee?
-Coffee? Yes.

703
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,518
You're very beautifuI, AIi.

704
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,366
Coffee's ready.

705
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:02,960
Here!
-Thanks.

706
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:10,960
PauIa! What brings you here?

707
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:13,357
My sister died today.

708
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:15,802
She'd been sick a Iong time.

709
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:18,037
The funeraI's on Monday morning.

710
00:50:18,207 --> 00:50:21,165
I wanted to ask
if you'd fiII in for me?

711
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:22,760
Come in, pIease!

712
00:50:23,807 --> 00:50:26,002
This is Mrs. Borchert.
She works with me.

713
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,919
AIi, my husband.

714
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:30,436
Your...?

715
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:34,399
Yes, PauIa. We've been married
for three months.

716
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:36,876
Oh my God!

717
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:40,845
HeIIo!
-HeIIo!

718
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:42,725
WeII, I'd better be going.

719
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,316
Have a coffee with us!
-No thanks.

720
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:48,445
I'II ask Hedwig about Monday.
Who'd have dreamed that!

721
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:49,926
But PauIa!

722
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,521
That woman no good.

723
00:50:51,727 --> 00:50:53,399
Nonsense! She's OK.

724
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,205
She was just surprised.

725
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,003
That woman has death in her eye.

726
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,476
No wonder. Her sister just died.

727
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:03,002
No. Other death in her eye.

728
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,635
You're imagining things.

729
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:07,879
Come on, get dressed!

730
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:11,080
Let's go see buddies.
Germans not good.

731
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:14,398
I don't feeI Iike going out today.

732
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:23,441
Why don't you bring
your friends here ...

733
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:25,404
for a drink?

734
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:27,280
It's much nicer here, isn't it?

735
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,403
Buddies come here?

736
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:32,356
Yes! Get dressed
and bring them here!

737
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:49,206
Hi!
-HeIIo!

738
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:53,277
Nobody's here yet.
ProbabIy doing overtime.

739
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:55,758
A beer?
-SmaII beer.

740
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:07,076
How are you?

741
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:11,882
Good.

742
00:52:13,327 --> 00:52:14,316
Happy?

743
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:16,996
Don't know.

744
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:22,562
Come by my pIace again sometime.

745
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:23,717
Maybe.

746
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:26,401
I'II make you some couscous.
-Your couscous good.

747
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:28,319
WeII, then?

748
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:29,556
Don't know.

749
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:31,206
Or are you scared of your wife?

750
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,278
AIi not scared.

751
00:52:33,807 --> 00:52:35,559
WeII, come by then!

752
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:36,876
Maybe.

753
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,118
HeIIo!
-Hi, AIi!

754
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:50,119
Come to my home? LittIe party.
-OK.

755
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:52,847
I'm not going to that
oId whore's pIace!

756
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:55,365
She not oId whore!

757
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:57,837
AII right. Let me go!

758
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:59,202
Come on!

759
00:53:05,647 --> 00:53:07,877
Come to my pIace? LittIe party.

760
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:16,846
Bastards!

761
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:23,559
It's on the next fIoor up.

762
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:25,399
Can't get a wink of sIeep.

763
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:27,717
She's got four foreigners
in her apartment.

764
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:28,922
Four of them!

765
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,084
You're not safe anymore.

766
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:32,646
Now, now. Let's not exaggerate!

767
00:53:32,807 --> 00:53:35,116
I'm not, officer.
They're aII Arabs.

768
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:36,686
You know what they're Iike:

769
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,121
bombs and aII that.

770
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:41,802
They're not aII Iike that, ma'am.
Come on, Hans, we'II have a Iook.

771
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:48,275
Did you see that?

772
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:50,517
PoIicemen with Iong hair.

773
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:53,360
Things sure have changed.

774
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:56,003
Five!

775
00:53:56,447 --> 00:53:58,563
One, two, three, four, five!

776
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,283
Again nothing!

777
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:07,242
At Iast!

778
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:11,715
It's your turn.

779
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:15,762
Cheers!

780
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:23,155
Good evening!

781
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:26,924
Sorry, but your neighbors say
the music's causing a disturbance.

782
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:29,476
If you wouId turn it down, pIease...
-But...

783
00:54:29,647 --> 00:54:32,241
Sorry, but if it disturbs them...

784
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:34,159
OK, I'II turn it down.

785
00:54:34,447 --> 00:54:36,085
Goodnight!
-Goodnight!

786
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:43,803
Six.

787
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:47,405
Turn the music down a IittIe!

788
00:54:48,047 --> 00:54:48,957
Why?

789
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:51,561
They've set the poIice on us.

790
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:14,358
CouId you hand me a knife?

791
00:55:15,487 --> 00:55:19,082
The subway rates are going up.
It was in the paper today.

792
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:20,966
Not again!

793
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:23,199
I read it, too.

794
00:55:24,207 --> 00:55:25,276
Want a piece?

795
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:32,086
Stop being so pecuIiar!
Hand me a knife, wiII you?

796
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:35,645
And it said,

797
00:55:35,807 --> 00:55:39,117
women shouId have a
cancer test every six months.

798
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:42,245
Every six months?
-Yes, every woman.

799
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:46,235
Not that it does much good.
My sister-in-Iaw, for instance...

800
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:48,796
Let's sit over there!

801
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:58,646
Anyway, I'm making an
appointment for next week.

802
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:01,799
Make one for us, too.
You'II come, won't you, Frieda?

803
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:04,800
Yes, if you're going.
I'd be scared aIone.

804
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:39,756
HeIIo!

805
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:41,446
HeIIo, Mrs. Kurowski!

806
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:44,405
That rabbIe!

807
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:48,367
Can't we do anything about it,
Mr. Gruber?

808
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:52,242
Why? They seem very happy together.

809
00:56:52,407 --> 00:56:54,443
What's happiness?

810
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:57,042
There's stiII such a
thing as decency.

811
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,122
I faiI to see anything indecent,

812
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:03,196
hard as I might try. Goodbye!

813
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:07,485
Can you understand it?

814
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:08,397
No.

815
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:30,995
Everyone's Iooking.

816
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:35,722
Don't Iet it bother you!
They're just envious.

817
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:41,524
No understand "envious".

818
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,366
Envious is ...

819
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:47,122
when someone doesn't Iike
another person having something.

820
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:48,875
Understand.

821
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:51,557
They're just envious.

822
00:57:51,727 --> 00:57:52,921
AII of them.

823
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:03,486
Why do you cry?

824
00:58:06,487 --> 00:58:09,240
Because I'm so happy
on the one hand ...

825
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:13,124
and on the other,
I can't bear it anymore.

826
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:16,321
AII this hatred!

827
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:18,201
From everyone!

828
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:25,443
Sometimes I wish I were aII aIone
with you in the worId ...

829
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:27,484
with nobody around us.

830
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:33,122
I aIways pretend I don't care,

831
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:38,086
but I do. I do care!

832
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:41,244
It's kiIIing me.

833
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:47,841
Nobody Iooks me in the eye anymore.

834
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:51,800
They aII have such a horribIe grin.

835
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:55,885
They're aII swine!

836
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,315
Dirty swine, aII of them!

837
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:04,080
Stop staring, you stupid swine!

838
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,319
This is my husband, my husband.

839
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:34,600
I Iove you, too.

840
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:37,562
Me more.

841
00:59:38,127 --> 00:59:39,446
How much?

842
00:59:39,887 --> 00:59:41,115
So much.

843
00:59:42,487 --> 00:59:44,125
And me, from here ...

844
00:59:44,887 --> 00:59:46,320
to Morocco!

845
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,726
Do you know what?
Let's go away somewhere.

846
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:52,243
Somewhere where
we'II be on our own,

847
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:55,758
where no one knows us
and no one stares.

848
00:59:56,887 --> 01:00:00,516
When we get back,
it'II aII be different.

849
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:05,043
Everyone wiII be nice to us.

850
01:00:05,327 --> 01:00:06,476
They wiII.

851
01:00:40,785 --> 01:00:42,741
They're back again.

852
01:00:43,065 --> 01:00:43,895
Who?

853
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:48,544
Mrs. Kurowski and her foreigner.

854
01:00:49,385 --> 01:00:50,420
You know,

855
01:00:50,905 --> 01:00:53,339
I aIways thought she was nice.

856
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:55,979
She is. But that foreigner!

857
01:00:57,265 --> 01:00:58,937
Things Iike that don't Iast.

858
01:00:59,425 --> 01:01:00,460
You reckon?

859
01:01:01,305 --> 01:01:01,976
Of course.

860
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,898
Listen! Next time she waIks by,

861
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:07,977
go out and say heIIo.

862
01:01:08,305 --> 01:01:10,136
To her? No!

863
01:01:10,705 --> 01:01:11,774
Anton,

864
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:14,939
don't forget
she was a good customer.

865
01:01:17,065 --> 01:01:18,293
You're right there.

866
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:22,773
Just waIk out, say heIIo,

867
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,776
and things wiII be back to normaI.

868
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,859
And she'II do her shopping
here again.

869
01:01:29,665 --> 01:01:33,180
Yes, they're aII going to the
supermarket instead of coming here.

870
01:01:34,545 --> 01:01:35,978
You're right, AdeIe.

871
01:01:36,785 --> 01:01:40,016
In business,
you have to hide your aversions.

872
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,894
Mrs. Kurowski. Just the person...!

873
01:01:57,065 --> 01:01:58,817
HeIIo, Mrs. EIIis!
-HeIIo!

874
01:01:59,545 --> 01:02:04,539
Imagine! They've sent my son to
Norway for a whoIe year.

875
01:02:05,385 --> 01:02:06,784
I'II be right up.

876
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:12,974
So he asked me to keep his
things here for him.

877
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:18,536
But I've got such a smaII ceIIar,

878
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:22,061
and I thought, since I have aII
that stuff down there,

879
01:02:22,225 --> 01:02:23,453
maybe you...

880
01:02:23,905 --> 01:02:25,258
Of course, Mrs. EIIis.

881
01:02:25,665 --> 01:02:27,895
I don't need aII that space.

882
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:29,339
When wouId you need it?

883
01:02:30,105 --> 01:02:32,380
Today, if possibIe.

884
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:35,582
His stuff's been down there
for ten days now.

885
01:02:36,025 --> 01:02:37,981
It wouId be very nice if...

886
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:41,382
OK. I'II teII my husband
to give you a hand.

887
01:02:41,545 --> 01:02:43,501
I'm sure it's not so Iight.

888
01:02:43,665 --> 01:02:46,259
It's good to have a
strong man in the house.

889
01:02:46,425 --> 01:02:49,144
He'II be down in ten minutes. Bye!

890
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:51,664
Bye, Mrs. Kurowski!

891
01:02:51,825 --> 01:02:53,258
And thanks a miIIion.

892
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:55,017
Don't mention it.

893
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:58,055
Such a nice woman. And so heIpfuI!

894
01:02:58,225 --> 01:02:59,544
Yes, she aIways was.

895
01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:08,704
Here are the ceIIar keys.

896

HeIp the woman move her stuff.
Be nice to her,

897
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:13,303
and she'II be nice to us.

898
01:03:13,465 --> 01:03:15,979
I'm going shopping.
Do you understand?

899
01:03:16,345 --> 01:03:18,984
Understand.
-And put something eIse on.

900
01:03:24,545 --> 01:03:27,059
Anton, here she comes!
Out you go!

901
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:37,463
HeIIo, Mrs. Kurowski!

01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:39,616
Back from you vacation?

903
01:03:39,985 --> 01:03:42,499
Was the weather nice?
-Very nice.

904
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:45,577
It's high time we took a vacation.
Where did you go?

905
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:47,144
Not far. To Steinsee.

906
01:03:48,985 --> 01:03:51,180
I know it. Nice pIace.

907
01:03:51,345 --> 01:03:53,700
Come in and teII us aII about it.

908
01:04:04,385 --> 01:04:06,216
HeIIo, Mr. Kurowski!

909
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:10,014
Your mother's back.
She's just gone shopping.

910
01:04:10,185 --> 01:04:11,982
She'II be back in a minute.

911
01:04:12,145 --> 01:04:14,534
Thanks, Mrs. Karges. I'II wait.

912
01:04:15,545 --> 01:04:18,662

915
01:04:27,545 --> 01:04:31,140
And your mother has the
biggest ceIIar here.

916
01:04:32,545 --> 01:04:34,217
Ah, Mrs. Kurowski!

917
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:36,735
Your son Bruno's here.

918
01:05:03,185 --> 01:05:05,779
You got the check?
-Yes, just now.

919
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:10,061
The Ietter was in the maiIbox
when I got back. With the check.

920
01:05:10,225 --> 01:05:12,181
It's for the TV set.

921
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,024
I'm sorry,

922
01:05:14,545 --> 01:05:17,457
but I was so surprised
I just Iost my head.

923
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:20,014
I wouIdn't have reacted
Iike that otherwise.

924
01:05:20,185 --> 01:05:23,814
You aIways were a hothead.
Remember the cat?

925
01:05:24,305 --> 01:05:27,024
My God, Mom! You can't hoId that
against me aII my Iife.

926
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,853
No,

927
01:05:29,785 --> 01:05:31,457
I had reaIIy forgotten
aII about it.

928
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,981
Everything wiII be OK now.
I've spoken to Krista.

929
01:05:35,145 --> 01:05:38,581
AIbert stiII hasn't gotten over it,
but he'II come around.

930
01:05:38,745 --> 01:05:41,464
Sure. Time heaIs aII wounds.

931
01:05:43,145 --> 01:05:46,615
ActuaIIy,
I wanted to ask you a favor.

932
01:05:47,265 --> 01:05:48,778
Out with it!

933
01:05:49,185 --> 01:05:51,745
No need to beat around the
bush with your oId Mom.

934
01:05:52,505 --> 01:05:54,097
No, you're right.

935
01:05:55,425 --> 01:05:57,143
Brandy?
-No thanks.

936
01:05:59,145 --> 01:06:01,340
HiIdegard wants to take a
part-time job again.

937
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:04,144
What with everything
being so expensive...

938
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:08,660
We've hunted high and Iow for a
kindergarten, but it's hopeIess.

939
01:06:08,825 --> 01:06:10,577
They're aII booked up.

940
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:14,863
So I thought maybe you couId take
Beate from one to five.

941
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:16,697
I'd pick her up afterwards.

942
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,335
It wouId be a great heIp.

943
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:22,664
HeIIo!

944
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:25,660
HeIIo!

945
01:06:27,065 --> 01:06:28,259
I'm going to shower.

946
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:33,943
Do you think you couId manage it?

947
01:06:34,185 --> 01:06:36,699
HiIdegard starts work at
Pschorr on the first.

948
01:06:36,865 --> 01:06:39,060
Of course.
I've aIways been there for you.

949
01:06:39,305 --> 01:06:40,624
Thanks a Iot, Mom.

Then I'II be going.
They're waiting for me.

951
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:48,059
I might come by on Sunday,

952
01:06:48,225 --> 01:06:49,783
Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

954
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:55,060
Finished.

955
01:06:56,025 --> 01:06:57,936
You no make couscous?

956
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:01,822
I can't make couscous,
you know that.

957
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:05,022
You shouId get used to the way
things are done in Germany.

958
01:07:05,185 --> 01:07:07,494
PeopIe in Germany don't
eat couscous.

959
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:09,895
Couscous good sometimes.

960
01:07:16,985 --> 01:07:18,384
I don't Iike couscous either.

961
01:07:21,665 --> 01:07:22,859
Where are you off to?

962

AIi go to Arab buddies.
Maybe eat couscous.

963
01:07:26,705 --> 01:07:28,024
You're not taking me with you?

964
01:07:28,985 --> 01:07:31,419
No. Want to be aIone.

965

-Very nice.

970

Like something to drink or to eat?
-Couscous.

971
01:09:44,545 --> 01:09:45,534
OK.

972
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:47,858
I'II put the pan on.

She's from YugosIavia.

977
01:12:56,145 --> 01:12:58,181
Interesting! Where's Frieda?

978
01:12:58,425 --> 01:13:02,259
Haven't you heard?
She got fired without notice.

979
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:04,863
Fired without notice?

980
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:06,694
For steaIing.

981
01:13:08,265 --> 01:13:09,141
No!

982
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,697
It's true. They say
she's been at it for ages.

983
01:13:12,865 --> 01:13:15,698
They caught her with
an adding machine.

984
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:18,580
The next day,
she didn't show up,

985
01:13:18,705 --> 01:13:20,104
and YoIanda came.

986
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:21,664
WeII I never!

987
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:23,736
Who wouId have thought it of Frieda?

988
01:13:23,905 --> 01:13:28,695
Of course, she never did Iook you
straight in the eye.

989
01:13:29,985 --> 01:13:32,624
ReaIIy?
-You must remember. AIways shifty.

990
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:34,298
You're probabIy right.

991
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:36,137
And then...

992
01:13:37,345 --> 01:13:38,858
Let's go over there.

993
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,780
There was the matter of our raise.

994
01:13:45,945 --> 01:13:48,505
That's right, 20 pfennigs. WeII?

995
01:13:48,665 --> 01:13:50,895
You can forget it.

996
01:13:51,065 --> 01:13:52,862
They've probabIy forgotten us.

997
01:13:53,025 --> 01:13:54,617
Forgotten? I can't imagine that.

998
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:58,054
There's no other expIanation.

999
01:13:58,785 --> 01:14:00,741
Come here! Listen!

1000
01:14:09,385 --> 01:14:11,660
YoIanda gets 3.40 an hour,

1001
01:14:11,825 --> 01:14:13,781
50 pfennigs Iess than us.

1002
01:14:14,065 --> 01:14:15,339
No!
-Yes.

1003
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:17,616
They know aII the tricks up there.

1004
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:20,743
We must think of something
to get that raise.

1005
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:24,341
Come to my pIace,
and we'II taIk it over, OK?

1006
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:26,417
How about it?
-We'II see...

1007
01:14:27,545 --> 01:14:28,739
What about her?

1008
01:14:34,385 --> 01:14:37,980
There's no point.
She's on a different pay scaIe.

1009
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:40,295
Six o'cIock, then?
-OK.

1010
01:14:59,945 --> 01:15:01,298
This is AIi.

1011
01:15:01,465 --> 01:15:02,978
Say heIIo!

1012
01:15:04,705 --> 01:15:06,218
HeIIo!
-HeIIo!

1013
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,814
He's a handsome one, Emmi!

1014
01:15:11,585 --> 01:15:12,813
And so cIean!

1015
01:15:13,305 --> 01:15:14,340
What do you mean?

1016
01:15:14,745 --> 01:15:16,383
Sorry,

1017
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,503
but I aIways thought
they didn't wash.

1018
01:15:20,065 --> 01:15:21,862
He does!

1019
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,255
He even takes a shower every day.

1020
01:15:25,185 --> 01:15:27,176
And just Iook at those muscIes!

1021
01:15:30,065 --> 01:15:31,942
He's reaIIy strong.

1022
01:15:32,665 --> 01:15:33,984
Come here!

1023
01:15:37,745 --> 01:15:39,895
Go ahead, feeI his muscIes!

1024
01:15:42,865 --> 01:15:43,900
Terrific!

1025
01:15:45,585 --> 01:15:47,576
And such nice soft skin!

1026
01:15:47,745 --> 01:15:48,939
He's so young.

1027
01:15:49,105 --> 01:15:51,699
But he's a good man, reaIIy.

1028
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:53,534
What's eating him?

1029
01:15:54,105 --> 01:15:57,541
He has his moods.
It's his foreign mentaIity.

1030
01:15:57,705 --> 01:16:00,299
WouId you Iike something to drink?
-Yes. Coffee, pIease.

1031
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:02,535
You too, PauIa?
-Yes, but not too strong.

1032
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:04,297
I'II be right back.

1033
01:16:32,865 --> 01:16:36,460
Oh, it's you!
Come in. But I'm on my way out.

1034
01:16:36,905 --> 01:16:38,941
There's stiII some couscous
in the kitchen.

1035
01:16:39,105 --> 01:16:42,256
You can warm it up and watch TV.

1036
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:44,058
Or do you want to come aIong?

1037
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,704
No. I stay here.

1038
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:49,215
WiII you be here when I get back?

1039
01:16:51,225 --> 01:16:52,783
See you Iater.

1040
01:17:12,465 --> 01:17:14,262
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought...

1041
01:17:15,185 --> 01:17:16,743
That's aII right, Mrs. Kurowski.

1042
01:17:25,105 --> 01:17:26,504
Goodnight!

1043
01:18:01,465 --> 01:18:03,581
Are you going?
-Don't know.

1044
01:18:04,105 --> 01:18:06,699
Stay here! I hate sIeeping aIone.

1045
01:18:09,345 --> 01:18:10,903
I'II just go wash quickIy.

1046
01:18:14,665 --> 01:18:17,498
Working nights reaIIy
takes it out of me.

1047
01:19:21,385 --> 01:19:23,023
There's this guy at the movies.

1048
01:19:23,505 --> 01:19:25,496
SuddenIy there's an awfuI stench!

1049
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:27,976
He asks the guy in front of him,

1050
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:29,976
"Did you shit your pants?"

1051
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:32,420
And the guy answers,
"Yes, why?"

1052
01:19:34,025 --> 01:19:36,380
A mouse and an eIephant meet.

1053
01:19:36,745 --> 01:19:39,305
The mouse says to the eIephant,
"My, aren't you big!"

1054
01:19:39,465 --> 01:19:41,262
And the eIephant says to the mouse,

1055
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:42,744
"My, aren't you smaII!"

1056
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:46,103
And the mouse repIies:
"WeII, I've been iII for six weeks."

1057
01:19:54,425 --> 01:19:56,893
There he is.
-Yes, thanks.

1058
01:19:59,865 --> 01:20:03,062
Where were you aII night?
I've been worried sick.

1059
01:20:09,785 --> 01:20:11,980
You shouIdn't do this to me, AIi.

1060
01:20:14,945 --> 01:20:17,778
You don't have to say anything.
Just come back!

1061
01:20:19,305 --> 01:20:20,897
I need you, AIi.

1062
01:20:21,745 --> 01:20:23,736
I need you so much!

1063
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:33,939
Who's that, AIi?

1064
01:20:34,745 --> 01:20:37,464
Your grandma from Morocco?
What does she want?

1065
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:24,341
His grandma from Morocco!

1066
01:21:41,785 --> 01:21:42,900
Ten marks.

1067
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:49,139
Another ten.

1068
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:57,460
Fifteen.

1069
01:22:03,705 --> 01:22:04,854
Twenty.

1070
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:20,737
Go to my pIace and get 100 marks
for me! Hurry!

1071
01:22:22,705 --> 01:22:24,377
He get money,

1072
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:25,864
then I pIay more.

1073
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,421
Three whiskies.

1074
01:22:30,585 --> 01:22:33,782
Don't Iet them fIeece you! You're
gambIing away a week's wages.

1075
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:36,664
Who care? Kif-kif!
Understand?

1076
01:23:35,065 --> 01:23:36,100
One!

1077
01:23:37,025 --> 01:23:37,935
Two!

1078
01:23:40,785 --> 01:23:41,615
Ten!

1079
01:23:44,945 --> 01:23:45,980
Fifteen!

1080
01:23:49,665 --> 01:23:50,734
Twenty!

1081
01:23:54,665 --> 01:23:55,814
Twenty-five!

1082
01:23:56,225 --> 01:23:57,453
A coIa, miss!

1083
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:05,500
Shit!

1084
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:10,860
Thanks, and...

1085
01:24:11,825 --> 01:24:12,621
Yes?

1086
01:24:12,865 --> 01:24:15,902
WouId you pIay the gypsy record
for me, pIease?

1087
01:24:16,145 --> 01:24:18,261
<i>The BIack Gypsy</i>?
-Yes, that's it.

1088
01:24:18,585 --> 01:24:19,700
Thanks.

1089
01:25:09,465 --> 01:25:10,898
You dance with me?

1090
01:25:33,385 --> 01:25:35,694
Me sIeep with other woman.

1091
01:25:36,025 --> 01:25:37,856
That's not important, AIi,

1092
01:25:39,585 --> 01:25:41,496
not important at aII.

1093
01:25:41,665 --> 01:25:45,101
I don't want to,
but aIways so nervous.

1094
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:48,902
You're a free man.

1095
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,575
You can do what you Iike.

1096
01:25:54,865 --> 01:25:56,776
I know how oId I am.

1097
01:25:56,945 --> 01:25:59,140
I see it in the mirror every day.

1098
01:25:59,465 --> 01:26:02,104
I can't keep you from doing things.

1099
01:26:03,065 --> 01:26:06,262
But when we're together,
we must be nice to each other.

1100
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:09,622
Otherwise Iife's not worth Iiving.

1101
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:13,097
I don't want other woman.

1102
01:26:13,345 --> 01:26:15,142
I Iove onIy you.

1103
01:26:15,705 --> 01:26:17,104
I Iove you, too.

1104
01:26:17,265 --> 01:26:18,823
Together we're strong.

1105
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:34,455
CaII an ambuIance! Quick!

1106
01:26:42,705 --> 01:26:44,980
Send an ambuIance
to the AsphaIt Bar,

1107
01:26:45,145 --> 01:26:46,863
17 CorneIius Strasse.

1108
01:26:47,025 --> 01:26:49,493
Someone has coIIapsed.
He's groaning terribIy.

1109
01:26:50,265 --> 01:26:51,220
Thanks.

1110
01:27:20,065 --> 01:27:22,625
He has a perforated stomach uIcer.

1111
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:26,063
It happens a Iot
with foreign workers.

1112
01:27:26,385 --> 01:27:28,137
It's the stress.

1113
01:27:29,145 --> 01:27:30,942
And there's not much we can do.

1114
01:27:31,985 --> 01:27:35,978
We're not aIIowed to send them
to convaIesce. We can onIy operate.

1115
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:40,340
And six months Iater
they have another uIcer.

1116
01:27:40,705 --> 01:27:43,538
And him?
-Oh, he'II recover,

1117
01:27:44,465 --> 01:27:47,059
but he'II be back here
again in six months.

1118
01:27:47,665 --> 01:27:49,223
No, he won't.

1119
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:52,184
I'II do everything in my power...
-WeII,

1120
01:27:52,305 --> 01:27:54,182
the best of Iuck, anyway.

1121
01:27:55,225 --> 01:27:56,977
And don't stay too Iong!

1122
01:27:57,225 --> 01:27:58,453
Goodbye!

1123
