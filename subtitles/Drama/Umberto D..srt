1
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,600
THIS FI LM IS DEDICATED TO MY FATHER

2
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,000
RAISE OUR PENSIONS

3
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,300
WE WORKED OUR WHOLE LIVES

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,900
J USTICE FOR PENSIONERS

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
We want an increase![br]We want an increase!

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,700
We want to be heard.

7
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,300
We're taxpaying citizens.

8
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,099
We're starving.

9
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,200
We're tired of waiting.

10
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,300
We want to see the minister.

11
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,300
We want to see the minister.

12
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,700
Silence!

13
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,600
You don't have a permit.[br]You must disperse.

14
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Go home. Go on.

15
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,000
You should be ashamed.

16
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,200
The way you treat us is a disgrace!

17
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,400
Go home. Go on.

18
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,400
Let's go, old geezers.[br]Come on.

19
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,400
Keep him quiet, for God's sake!

20
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Quiet, Flike.

21
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,799
Scoundrels, all of them!

22
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,500
Quiet or they'll hear you[br]and arrest you.

23
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm not talking about the police.

24
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,400
I mean the organizers of the protest.

25
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
They should have gotten a permit.

26
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,100
They wouldn't give us one.

27
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Then we should have stayed home!

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
A 20% increase[br]would be enough for me

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,300
to pay off my debts in a year.

30
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,500
I don't have any debts.

31
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
To tell the truth, I don't either.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,300
- This is our chance. We can go.[br]- Let's go.

33
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,300
Good day.

34
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,200
I have no one,[br]no son or brother, to help me out.

35
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,700
I'm just a good-for-nothing old man.

36
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,000
Orazio Valenti.

37
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Umberto Domenico Ferrari.

38
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,900
Who can live[br]on 18,000 lire these days?

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,600
My landlady charges me 10,000.[br]She even raised my rent, that old -

40
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,600
Go ahead and say it.[br]We're both men.

41
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,700
If she's a bitch, she's a bitch.

42
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,500
Do you need a watch?

43
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,700
No, I have a watch.

44
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,900
I don't have it with me,[br]but it's a very nice watch.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,300
I have two.[br]That's why I'm selling this one.

46
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,700
What make is yours?

47
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,400
It's nice.[br]It has a gold case.

48
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,800
Well, here's where I live.[br]Good-bye.

49
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,400
Good-bye.

50
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Who's done here?

51
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,200
How rude! I'm not finished.

52
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,700
Thank you.

53
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,500
Waitress.

54
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,300
Listen to this.

55
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,300
In a store it would cost you[br]20,000 lire.

56
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,700
- How much are you asking?[br]- 5,000 lire.

57
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,200
My throat feels scratchy.

58
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,900
- Be patient. It'll pass.[br]- I hope so.

59
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
See you tomorrow.

60
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Here we are. He's so cute.

61
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,799
Hey, I saw everything.

62
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,100
Tomorrow I'll kick you out,[br]and your dog too.

63
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,100
I'll kick you out, I said.

64
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,899
You're overreacting.

65
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,200
She'll lose all her customers.[br]Don't listen to a word she says.

66
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,500
- May I walk with you a while?[br]- Of course.

67
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
You can have it for 4,000.

68
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
4,000! That's a lot of money.

69
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,099
But a good watch lasts forever.

70
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,700
I don't care.[br]Look, I'll give you 3,000 lire.

71
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,600
There's more than that in here.[br]It's all in small change, I'm afraid.

72
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,200
- I said 4,000.[br]- It's all in here.

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Listen, you can take the bag

74
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,000
and give it back to me[br]tomorrow at the cafeteria.

75
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
See you.

76
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
Spare some change.

77
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,900
See you.

78
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,000
Spare some change.

79
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
Who's in my room?

80
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,300
Who's in my room?[br]- How should I know?

81
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,300
What's all this yelling?

82
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Be quiet and stop yelling.[br]How dare you behave like this!

83
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,400
Quiet down and come with me.

84
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,100
Get it through your head.

85
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,600
It's not your room. It's mine.[br]- What do you mean, yours?

86
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,400
They're dear friends of mine,[br]just resting for a while.

87
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,800
And why bother making a fuss?

88
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,800
You're leaving at the end[br]of the month anyway.

89
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,300
Leaving.

90
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,900
What a way to treat someone - [br]kicking him out after 20 years!

91
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:50,100
Watch me![br]Meanwhile, pay your back rent.

92
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,700
I have the money right here!

93
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Stop yelling!

94
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,800
Who's she think[br]she's going to kick out?

95
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,500
Where would I go?

96
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
They skin you alive.

97
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,700
They want 20,000 lire for a rat hole,[br]and then it's full of rodents.

98
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,700
- I know.[br]- Kick me out!

99
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,600
She charges 1,000 lire[br]an hour for the room, you know.

100
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
1,000 lire every time.

101
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,300
- Could you give me the thermometer?[br]- Yes.

102
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,900
Here.

103
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
Do you feel sick?

104
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,300
Not too hard.

105
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Did you hear the door just now?

106
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,900
She put them in the living room.

107
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,700
She could have done that before.

108
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
No, she couldn't.[br]There were two others in there.

109
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,000
The dirty, rotten -

110
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Have you seen all the ants?

111
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Can you see anything,[br]Mr. Umberto?

112
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,400
No, nothing.

113
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
You can a little.[br]Did you know I'm pregnant?

114
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
My God.

115
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,600
And you say it just like that?

116
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,700
How do you want me to say it?

117
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,500
- Does she know?[br]- God forbid.

118
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,700
You can go in now.

119
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,300
Are you sure?

120
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,300
Three months, Mr. Umberto.

121
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,500
- Excuse me.[br]- Come in.

122
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,400
Come see.

123
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,700
Look.

124
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,700
The tall one is from Naples.[br]The short one is from Florence.

125
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,200
- Which one is yours?[br]- Both of them.

126
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,000
Which is the father?

127
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,700
I think... the one from Naples.

128
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,000
What do you mean, you think?

129
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,000
They both deny it.

130
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Come here.

131
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,200
Come on. She's crying.

132
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Answer me!

133
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,500
She's done singing.

134
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,300
Bring me a hot water bottle.

135
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,200
- What are you doing?[br]- He wants some hot water.

136
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,600
Come on.

137
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,800
Good boy.

138
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,600
Do you want to play[br]with the ball, Flike?

139
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,199
Come in.

140
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,699
I pay the maid.

141
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,500
If you want hot water,[br]hire your own maid.

142
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm throwing your things out[br]on the 30th.

143
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,700
I'm evicting you.

144
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,200
Kiss the baby for me.

145
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Did you hear me?

146
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Come here, boy.

147
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,100
Good boy, Flike.

148
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Damn these ants!

149
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,900
Ants everywhere.

150
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,100
- What is it?[br]- Where's the thermometer?

151
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,000
On the dresser.

152
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,500
I have to put it back.[br]Otherwise, she'll yell at me.

153
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,900
Come here, please.

154
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,700
What do you want?

155
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,000
Take a look.

156
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,800
What do I have to do?

157
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Look in my throat and tell me[br]if you see a white coating.

158
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,899
It's so big.

159
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,000
Is there a coating?

160
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,700
She's hoping I'll die,[br]but I'm not going to.

161
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,300
Take this to her.

162
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,400
That's 3,000 lire.

163
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,800
And get a receipt.

164
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,500
All right.

165
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,000
Mr. Umberto.

166
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,100
Mr. Umberto.

167
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,500
She says you owe her 15,000,[br]and it's all or nothing.

168
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,500
I've got to go,[br]or she'll yell at me.

169
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,100
Good evening.

170
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,400
How about 2,500?

171
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,400
I said 2,000 yesterday,[br]and I say 2,000 today.

172
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
How about 2,400?

173
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,900
They have great sentimental value.[br]They're practically new.

174
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I've never opened them[br]because I didn't want to ruin them.

175
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm only giving them to you[br]because I have a fever.

176
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Maria.

177
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,800
These ants are driving me crazy.

178
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,500
2,000...

179
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,600
4,000...

180
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,800
5,000.

181
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,400
She'll have the rest[br]when I get my pension.

182
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,000
Get me the thermometer.[br]She's made my fever go up.

183
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,200
15,000.

184
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,700
To pay my debts, I'd have to go[br]a month without food.

185
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Did you do your assignment?

186
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
You didn't have time, eh?

187
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,000
Certain things can happen[br]if you don't know your grammar.

188
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,000
Everyone takes advantage[br]of the ignorant.

189
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,000
Now there's more. You'll have[br]to wait till the 27 th for the rest.

190
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,700
This is ridiculous.[br]First 3,000, then 2,000 more.

191
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,200
Take them back to him.[br]It's all or nothing.

192
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,400
Either he gives me 15,000 lire[br]or I evict him. Go.

193
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
Well?

194
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,700
- Good evening.[br]- Good evening. Go right in.

195
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,700
Excuse me.

196
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,450
What are you doing?[br]Down there.

197
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,600
Madam is at the end of the corridor.

198
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,300
Maria, shut the door!

199
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Her fiance.

200
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,000
I was the only successful one[br]in all Macerata.

201
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,400
Good-bye.

202
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,000
Till tomorrow.

203
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,500
Yes.

204
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,400
What is it?

205
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,500
Yes, a cold.[br]San Martino della Battaglia 14.

206
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Third floor.

207
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,200
Thank you.

208
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,700
What's going on?

209
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,900
Come in.

210
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,800
Stay there. I'll come to you.

211
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,300
Who's Mr. Ferrari?

212
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,600
I am.

213
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,500
I got dressed[br]so I wouldn't keep you waiting.

214
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,800
Sorry. Umberto Domenico Ferrari.

215
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,900
Spalmagulli, Armando.

216
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,300
Please, come in.

217
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,100
I'll just shut my suitcase[br]and then I'm ready.

218
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,700
Mr. Umberto, are you seriously ill?

219
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,200
Yes, it's serious.

220
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,500
Serious.

221
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,300
- You're leaving us in the dark over here.[br]- Shut up.

222
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,499
Are you kidding?

223
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,600
What are you looking at?

224
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
6:30.

225
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Come here. Good boy.

226
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,700
If he realizes I'm leaving,[br]it'll be the end.

227
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,800
Down, boy.

228
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,800
Do me a favor.

229
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,400
Play with the dog a little.[br]Here's a ball and ruler.

230
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,600
I don't feel like playing.

231
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,800
I can't say good-bye to him,[br]or he won't let me leave.

232
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:34,200
Very well.

233
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,000
Go on, boy.

234
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,300
- What are you doing?[br]- Come and play with the ruler.

235
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,900
- Is your boyfriend down there?[br]- Leave me alone.

236
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:51,900
Mr. Umberto.

237
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,500
Don't give him any milk, all right?

238
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
And please keep an eye on him.

239
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,100
All right.

240
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,100
He's fine. He's playing.

241
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,800
Please take care of him.[br]I won't forget you.

242
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,900
I won't be gone long.

243
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,900
Shall we go, Mr. Ferrari?

244
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,400
Yes.

245
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,700
Give me your suitcase.

246
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,700
No, it's very light.[br]Just pajamas and a bar of soap.

247
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,300
Keep it, then.

248
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,200
Bye.

249
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,400
Maria!

250
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,800
This guy's healthier than I am.[br]What's he doing here?

251
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,100
I'd like to keep him a little longer,[br]so he can get the full treatment.

252
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,200
All right.

253
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,100
Thank you, Sister.

254
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Say "ah."

255
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,199
That's fine.

256
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,700
Brush his tonsils with iodine.[br]You can go home tomorrow.

257
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Excuse me, Doctor.

258
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,100
What?

259
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,800
I also have a pain here.

260
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,400
What kind of pain?

261
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Nothing.

262
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,600
Can't you see your fever's gone?

263
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,900
It's just common tonsillitis.

264
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
If you were younger, I'd tell you[br]to have your tonsils taken out.

265
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:26,500
But what's the use, at your age?

266
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,600
You should have insisted.

267
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,900
Mr. Umberto,

268
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,200
You should have insisted.

269
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,800
I'd really like to save[br]a little money, you know.

270
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,100
I'll teach you how to get them[br]to let you stay here.

271
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,400
All I need is one week.

272
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,000
This ward is better than a hotel.

273
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,100
Did you ask the nun for a rosary?

274
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
Thank you. Oh, Sister-

275
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,700
He's such a nice person.

276
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,500
He'd like to stay a little longer.

277
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,700
He needs more treatment.[br]Can't you see how haggard he looks?

278
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,000
Just imagine: His pension isn't[br]even enough to support his dog.

279
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,200
We'll see.

280
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,600
Thank you, Sister.

281
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,100
Ask her for a rosary.

282
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,400
Sister.

283
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,300
Could I have a rosary?

284
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,300
How are you, my dear?

285
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,200
I'm fine.

286
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,500
This was all I could bring.

287
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,100
A banana!

288
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,800
Sit down, dear.[br]Pull up that stool.

289
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,500
May I sit here?

290
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,800
Of course. Sit down.

291
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,199
What about Flike? How is he?

292
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,500
I wanted to bring him upstairs,[br]but it's not allowed.

293
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,800
He's downstairs in the courtyard.[br]- In the courtyard.

294
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,300
Flike's in the courtyard.

295
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,000
Shut that window!

296
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,100
Shut it!

297
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,200
So, is that the father?

298
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,500
Mr. Umberto,

299
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,100
if you asked me[br]to swear to it, I couldn't.

300
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,900
But I sense it was him.

301
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,000
What does he have to say?

302
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,799
Nothing.

303
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,500
When I come back, I'll make him talk.

304
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:26,799
I'll talk to both of them.

305
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,600
Even the short one,[br]the one from Florence.

306
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,700
Both of them.

307
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,400
Give us another one, Sister.

308
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,300
Good morning, Sister.

309
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,300
Your daughter?

310
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,100
Excuse me, Sister.

311
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,900
How is our father?

312
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,500
He's very ill.

313
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,200
So he asked to borrow 4,000 lire,[br]but I didn't give him a cent.

314
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,800
Good move.

315
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,000
Yes, she's marrying the manager[br]of the movie theater.

316
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:21,900
That way she can get in for free.

317
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,500
I hope she doesn't have children.

318
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,600
She says you have to leave[br]because she needs your room.

319
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,200
That's why she's getting married.

320
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,500
Absolutely not.

321
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,400
I'm paying my back rent,[br]so she can't kick me out.

322
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,000
She can't evict me.

323
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Mr. Umberto, he's waiting.

324
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,450
I'm not going to the shelter.

325
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:43,700
Get well soon, Mr. Umberto.

326
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,200
- Tell her I'm not going.[br]- Yes, I'll tell her.

327
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,700
Let her go to the shelter.[br]I'm not going!

328
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,300
During the war[br]she called me Grandpa.

329
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,900
I gave her some meat[br]from time to time.

330
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,700
After the war she went crazy.

331
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,200
She even hates my dog.

332
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,800
If you saw my dog,[br]You'd know it's impossible to hate him.

333
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,500
Take care of yourself, Mr. Umberto.

334
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,000
But I'm coming back here, you know.[br]I'm gonna try again.

335
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,100
Good luck.

336
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,800
I'll come and visit you.[br]What's your address?

337
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,500
- Via San Martino della Battaglia 14.[br]- That's where I'll find you, right?

338
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,500
- Even the police couldn't get me out.[br]- That's the spirit!

339
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,800
Good-bye, and good luck.

340
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,300
- Excuse me, isn't the maid here?[br]- No, but the lady of the house is.

341
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,000
What are you doing?

342
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,300
I'm working.

343
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
This is my room. I live here.

344
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,300
Who said you didn't?

345
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,600
What are you supposed to do here?

346
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,500
A lot of stuff.

347
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,800
Excuse me.[br]Did the maid go out with the dog?

348
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,900
What dog?

349
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,700
My dog!

350
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,900
I'm not here[br]to keep an eye on the dog.

351
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,700
I'm pregnant. You understand?

352
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,200
Good morning.

353
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,800
- Where's Flike?[br]- I don't know.

354
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,400
- What do you mean, you don't know?[br]- I don't know.

355
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,400
Don't make me shout.[br]Where's Flike?

356
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,700
Madam opened the door and he left.

357
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,600
Where were you, you fool?

358
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,500
I kept the door shut,[br]but she kept opening it.

359
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:59,300
If anything's happened to him,[br]I'll kill her.

360
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,700
Please hurry.

361
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,400
- What if I run someone over?[br]- I'll pay the damages. Just hurry.

362
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
- How much?[br]- 200 lire.

363
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,800
- Here.[br]- I don't have change.

364
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,600
Do you have change for 1,000 lire?

365
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,600
Could you make change[br]for 1,000 lire?

366
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,100
Give me that glass.

367
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:54,500
- This one?[br]- Yes.

368
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,500
Fifty lire. 950 is your change.

369
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,000
- There.[br]- Thank you.

370
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,100
- What do you want?[br]- I'm looking for my dog.

371
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,600
You're number 15.

372
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
Excuse me.[br]Is this where you kill them?

373
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,200
Thirteen.

374
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,800
Fourteen.

375
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
Fifteen.

376
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,700
Sixteen.

377
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,400
Fifteen.

378
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,600
- Thank you, sir.[br]- Good-bye.

379
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,300
Yes?

380
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,000
A mutt with intelligent eyes.

381
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,800
White with brown spots.

382
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,900
He ran away from home.[br]- When?

383
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,300
Yesterday,[br]or perhaps the day before.

384
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,200
What do you wish to do?[br]Do you want the dog or not?

385
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,800
- What if I don't take him?[br]- Then we'll have to kill him.

386
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,500
- You'll kill him.[br]- Filippo.

387
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,100
Yes, sir.

388
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,300
Take this gentleman to see[br]the dogs caught in the last two days.

389
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,600
- Come with me.[br]- Thank you.

390
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:14,100
Well, what have you decided?

391
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,000
So you'll kill him?

392
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,000
We have to.[br]What else can we do with them?

393
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,700
- But 450 lire...[br]- Next.

394
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,300
We caught this one the day[br]before yesterday, that one yesterday.

395
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
That one the day before yesterday.

396
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,500
That one ten days ago.

397
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,500
This one yesterday.

398
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,100
And this one the day before.[br]Watch out for the cart.

399
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,199
See, he's not dead!

400
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,900
Good evening, Mrs. Malantoni.[br]Good evening, sir.

401
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,000
What do you want from me?

402
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,600
We'll be going to your funeral,[br]not the other way around!

403
00:56:41,601 --> 00:56:43,700
You think I owe you something?

404
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,300
What are you yelling about?

405
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,000
You wretch! Pay your debts.

406
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,500
My debts!

407
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,200
That's not the reason[br]You want to kick me out.

408
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,600
Tomorrow the doorman[br]will kick you out.

409
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,600
There are laws, you know.[br]I pay my debts.

410
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,300
I worked for the Ministry[br]of Public Works for 30 years!

411
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,700
I've always paid my debts.

412
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,800
Debts!

413
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
She doesn't even know[br]what a bill is.

414
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,000
have seven people to support.[br]Spare some change, please.

415
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:03,100
I have seven dependents.[br]Spare some change.

416
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,800
Thank you.

417
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,100
Battistini.

418
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,400
My dear Ferrari, how are you?

419
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,200
So-so. How about you?

420
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,100
I can't complain.[br]How are things?

421
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,800
- You know. Getting by.[br]- Excuse me. I'm catching the bus.

422
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,800
I'll take the next one.

423
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,200
My dear Ferrari, how are you?

424
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:09,200
I'm having a dispute with my landlady.

425
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm sure I'm going to win.

426
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,600
I'll get an injunction and stop her.

427
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,400
I'll pay 7,500 lire and I'll stop her.

428
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,200
All I need is half the money.

429
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,100
I have to find 2,000 lire.

430
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,800
- You're still at the same address?[br]- Yes, I'm not moving from there.

431
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,700
The landlady would like[br]to kick me out right now.

432
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:41,400
You understand?[br]2,000 lire is all -

433
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,799
I'm sorry.[br]I don't want to miss my bus.

434
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,100
Good-bye, Ferrari.[br]So nice to see you again.

435
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,300
If you see Carloni,[br]give him my regards.

436
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,300
- He's dead.[br]- Dead?

437
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,500
Thank you.

438
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,900
Ma'am, I have two children.

439
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,100
Thank you.

440
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,700
I have seven dependents.

441
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Be still.

442
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:34,200
- Flike, what are you doing there?[br]- Commendatore!

443
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:36,600
How are you, Commendatore?

444
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,800
I was just wondering[br]what Flike was doing here.

445
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,800
He's playing.[br]He plays all day long.

446
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,700
He's so clever.[br]How adorable.

447
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,800
He's so cute.

448
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,300
- How are you?[br]- Fine, thanks.

449
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,200
- Can I buy you a cup of coffee?[br]- I can't. My bus is leaving.

450
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,900
- Just a cup of coffee.[br]- No, thanks. The bus is leaving.

451
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,700
- A drink. Something.[br]- Really, I'd love to, but I can't.

452
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:05,000
- At least allow me to walk with you.[br]- Of course.

453
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,700
What are you doing these days?[br]- Nothing.

454
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,900
I'm a pensioner, so I'm just getting by.[br]I don't do anything.

455
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Lucky you, with nothing to do.

456
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,000
You're late, sir.

457
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,000
Do you think[br]there's going to be a war?

458
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,400
Who knows?

459
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,700
We're leaving.

460
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,900
Good-bye.

461
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,700
- Congratulations once again.[br]- Congratulations.

462
01:04:19,701 --> 01:04:21,700
Thank you, dear.

463
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,500
- All the best, dear.[br]- You promised to come visit us.

464
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,600
- I promise.[br]- Come see how the baby has grown.

465
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:35,800
All right.[br]Give the baby a kiss for me.

466
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,900
- All the best.[br]- Thank you.

467
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,800
- All the best.[br]- Thank you. Good-bye.

468
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:10,200
Don't forget tomorrow,[br]and don't be late.

469
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,600
We can't be late.

470
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,800
Good-bye, dear.

471
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,700
Good-bye.

472
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,100
- Paolo.[br]- What is it?

473
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,500
What is it, Olga?

474
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,300
My dear.

475
01:05:58,700 --> 01:05:59,800
Careful.

476
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,400
Flike, you naughty boy.

477
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,800
You had us all so worried.

478
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,200
You ran away, didn't you?

479
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,800
Have a piece of cake.

480
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,200
She wants to make[br]one big formal living room.

481
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,500
Mr. Umberto, eat the cake.

482
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,700
What's the matter, Mr. Umberto?

483
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,100
I'm tired.

484
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,100
Of her?

485
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,600
It's a little of everything.

486
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,700
Wherever you go,[br]You'll be happier than you are here.

487
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,500
That's the way it goes.

488
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,200
Go on, eat.

489
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,900
Where's he going?

490
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,000
Leaving already, Mr. Umberto?

491
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,900
Yes.

492
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,100
Where are you going?

493
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,000
I found a place.

494
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,200
Nearby?

495
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,000
Yes.

496
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,900
Then we'll see each other[br]from time to time.

497
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,800
Listen, you need to leave as well.

498
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,900
There are lots of jobs in Rome.

499
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,800
Don't stay here.

500
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:08,500
She'll kick me out the minute[br]she finds out I'm pregnant.

501
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,100
Can't you go back to your hometown?

502
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,700
My father would beat me.

503
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,600
Will we meet again, Mr. Umberto?

504
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,700
I left a few things in the dresser.[br]You take them.

505
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,400
Good-bye.

506
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,600
Good-bye.

507
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,800
Get rid of the one from Florence.

508
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,500
Yes, Mr. Umberto.

509
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,600
I'm sorry, but you can't[br]bring the dog on.

510
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,600
- Before 8:00 you can.[br]- You telling me the rules?

511
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,500
If it's a hunting dog, you can.[br]Otherwise, you can't.

512
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,100
I could say I'm going hunting.

513
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,300
For what?

514
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,300
Couldn't I have a gun in my suitcase?

515
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,600
All right.[br]Where are you getting off?

516
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,500
Via Leccosa.

517
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,300
Go.

518
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,300
- That whistle just keeps blowing.[br]- I'm so sleepy in the morning.

519
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,900
He's little, but he's mischievous.

520
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,200
- No, he wouldn't hurt a fly.[br]- If you say so.

521
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,200
- How many dogs do you have?[br]- About 20. Why?

522
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,000
Do you keep them here all day long?

523
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,899
We have fresh air and space.

524
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:21,300
I'd like to board my dog here.[br]Can I see where they sleep?

525
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,200
- They sleep in the house with us.[br]- Three of them sleep with me.

526
01:17:25,201 --> 01:17:28,000
A blind one, plus two others.

527
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,300
They snuggle up against me all night.

528
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,200
I'm going on a trip.[br]I'd like to leave him here.

529
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:39,500
For how long?

530
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:42,900
A while.

531
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,800
Board is 100 lire a day.

532
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:47,800
Bread is expensive.

533
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,899
Right?

534
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,600
There are other expenses:

535
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:55,400
tripe, pasta, tomato sauce,[br]because we cook for them.

536
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,200
And besides the food,

537
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,700
there's the bleach[br]and everything else.

538
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,100
Tripe is expensive,[br]and so is bleach and sawdust.

539
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,400
And we have to eat, too.

540
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,700
I'd like to leave you 5,000 lire.

541
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,200
Actually, almost 6,000.

542
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,700
Plus this suitcase full of stuff.

543
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,400
When are you coming back?

544
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,900
I don't know. We'll see.

545
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,600
See all this nice stuff?

546
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,100
You know, some people leave[br]their dogs here and never come back.

547
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,500
What do you do then?

548
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,200
I run them off.[br]What do you expect?

549
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:14,300
Do you ever walk them?

550
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,300
There's a boy willing to do it,[br]but he wants to be paid.

551
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,100
We keep them here.

552
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,900
We train them,[br]and they get used to it.

553
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,500
No, they don't get used to it.

554
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,500
No. I'm not leaving him here.

555
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Good-bye.

556
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,200
More money and less talk.

557
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,500
You wasted my time.

558
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,500
Daniela!

559
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,100
Mommy!

560
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,400
Hi, honey.

561
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,300
Good boy.

562
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,000
- Hello, Daniela.[br]- Hello.

563
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,300
Daniela, do you really love Flike?

564
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,500
Really and truly?

565
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,199
Yes.

566
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,800
Then you can have him.

567
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,600
Yes. And you can have[br]the leash, too.

568
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,100
- Miss, this dog is mine.[br]- What do you mean, yours?

569
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,800
Yes, it's mine.

570
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:22,800
I'd be very happy[br]if the little girl would take him.

571
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,500
Who will clean up after him?[br]Dogs are dirty.

572
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,900
Guess who'll end up[br]with the dirty work?

573
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,299
- I'll clean up after him.[br]- Oh, sure.

574
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:34,600
No, her mother doesn't want a dog.[br]Come on. Let's go.

575
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,200
He's never any trouble.

576
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,700
He's as obedient as a child.

577
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,300
You'll see. She'll be happy.[br]- Sure, it's a bargain.

578
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,900
But I'm giving him to her for nothing.[br]A dog like him, for nothing.

579
01:22:48,901 --> 01:22:51,000
Right. And that's why[br]You're getting rid of him.

580
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,900
Come on. Let's go, Daniela.

581
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,500
Walk, you spoiled little brat.[br]Come on.

582
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,600
Daniela, let's go.

583
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,200
Flike, come here.

584
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,000
Flike, come here.

585
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,400
Flike, look at the pinecone.

586
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,000
Come on. Here, boy.

587
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:37,400
Come on. Stand up.

588
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,700
Come on.

589
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,600
Come on. Run.

590
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,600
Here it is.

591
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:59,100
Come on, Flike. Up!

592
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,700
Good boy, Flike.

593
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:11,400
Run, Flike. Run!

594
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,100
THE END
