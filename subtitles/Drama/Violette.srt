Everyone will be better.

71
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,619

First I have to e> <CUser.

219
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,339
I had taken you for a bourgeois

220
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,299
whose childhood was bored.

221
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,461
I was wrong.

222
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,504
You have written a beautiful book.

223
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,059
Almighty.

224
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,179

Oest what counts.

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,899
You write long?

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,339
- No.

228
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,379
Well, not much, some items.

229
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,019
This is Maurice who pushed me.

230
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,339
- The Maurice Book?

231
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,859

232
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,939

Germany.

235
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,541
- I know.
You have him?

236
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,782
- No, and I do not expect.

237
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,419
- Maurice Sachs is the opposite of you.

238
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,779
This cache.

239
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,179
Especially behind the words.

240
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,070
Finally, he gave you the impetus
and taste Fécriture.

241
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,499
The pages devoted to it
I like less.

242
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,819
It would be better to remove them.

243
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,744
Keep them for another book may be.

244

You should work some passages.

249
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,219
Your father, for example.

250
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,984
Nothing is known of him.
A fantéme.

251
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,019
This is his léoheté

- I leave Paris. Ernest sold.

271
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,979
He bought a farm in Charente.

272
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,139
Without consulting me.

273
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,099

Leave him, he deserves you not.

I take my life in hand.

291
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,499
Everything will change now.

292
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,059

For years, I dragged a shot!

302

She wanted to throw at him.

303
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,299
But it em'uit.

304

- Why I am not a
published in the White collection?

353
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,219
This coverage is grim, confess.

é cheapest rate.

Tell me we'll meet again, Hermine.

381
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,108

Always the same.

A lot of work.
And always the pupils.

387
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,659
I do not complain.

388
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,619
There ales holiday.

- Your hands.

392
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,339
They have changed.

393
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,546
- This is the dishes.

394
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,819

Music Ambiance.

00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,183
- Tell me about your abortion.

400
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,739
- Nothing é SAY above.
You know as well as me.

401
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,219
- You were é how?

402
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,059
-5 Months and a half.

403
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,219
I almost died.

404
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,979
The baby
d0 be eradicated piece by piece.

405
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,550
It was him or me.

406
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,380
My husband wanted to keep.

407
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,859
- You were married?

408
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,146
- Not long.

409
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,419
Before, I lived with a woman.

410
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,779
Ga But did not work either.

411
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,819
I thought the wife Pardoise erase status
,

412
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,739
make me identical to the other.

413
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,459
- The child you regret?

414
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,189
- Oh... Not.

415
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,779
It would have looked like me.

416
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,299
It would have suffered, I
would have killed him.

417
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,059
My mother did not kill me, I have enough
criticized.

418
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,219
- Marriage is a sham, Violet.

419
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,459
For women, early Fesclavage.

420
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,179
You understood before others.

421
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,751
No freedom for them
without economic freedom.

422
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,430
But it is still far away.

423
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,379
- My 1st love story,
détait board.

424
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,179
Her name was Isabelle.

425
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,619
Qa lasted one school year.

426
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,139
It has been discovered,
my mother has separated us.

427
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,459
I have never seen.

428
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,139
Guess I'll pass.

429
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,710
In the street, in the subway...

430
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,139
- Will tell all ga.

431
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,099
- I can not.

432
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,699
- If I will be, your e CETES.

433
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,459
Will go further.

434
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,099
Tell all.

435
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,499
Your trafficking, and especially your love
, Pavortement.

436
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,343
You will thus help é many women.

437
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,419
- Hi, Castor.

438
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,139
- Ah, Genet, you get e pic.

439
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,659

441
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,139
- You are the greatest.

442
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,505
- No kidding.

443
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,739
Castor told me good your book.

444
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,379
- I do not happen to you calf.

445
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,099
- Well, no false modesty.

446
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,739
You dined with Sartre?

447
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,379
- Yes, as usual was too drunk.

448
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,791
He wanted to go to bed.

449
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,419
I, dest 0U time I wake up.
Scotch!

450
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,819
- No, dest for me.

451
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,185
Sir, 3 scotches.

452
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,539
Excuse me.

453
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,859

454
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,459
Asphyxia.

455
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,499
- What author.?

456
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,819
- Some Leduc, I think.

457
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,219
Leduc.

458
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,779

- Ever heard.

461
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,419
- I did the book, it is nowhere.

462
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,499
You find normal ga?

463
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,579
- This is often the authors
smaller.

464
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,579
The publisher has made a small run.

465
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,179
I command you?

466
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,591
- No, thank you, I'm passing.

467
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,299
What do you mean by
"small print"?

468
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,939
Pardon?
- Be specific.

469
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,899
What sub do you mean?

470
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,819
Qa does not deserve the same
treatment as the others?

471
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,459
No, but say it!

472
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,899
There for Julien Green, here!

473
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,939
- Calm down, you are not
in your normal state.

474
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,510
- Not in my normal state?

475
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,579
Qu'es't-so you say

I understood your petitjeu.

You think I'm Violette Leduc!

478
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,619
I'm not Leduc.

479
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,339
This is a very oHere friend.

480
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,419
Violette Leduc friends it!

481
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,539
And talent!

482
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,986
Fortunately she friends to say!

483
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,579
The door slams.

484
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,709
She cries.

485
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,699
I no longer want to live.

486
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,659
- I know you, you will live.

487
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,741
I will watch.

488
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,379
- I talked é everyone around me.

489
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,059
Everyone seeks
and can not find it.

490
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,099
- Jappellerai Gaston Gallimard

And what I'm living now?

493
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,579
To me,
everything has always been harder.

494
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,579
Since small, everything is hard.

495
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,219
Qa does not stop,
ga will never stop.

496
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,339
- Think Fécriture é, é
Deje what she gave you.

497

I'm going to hang up.

- I love you.

504
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:05,102
The bells are ringing.

505
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,866
- What are You?

506
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,984
- This is because I am ugly
that you do not like me?

507
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,979
- For me, there are few physical.

508
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,659
- Mine displeases you.

509

652
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,025
- Why not give me
your BMO 1st pages?

653
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:44,613
May be I could ask é
Gallimard advance.

654
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,739
- It's too tet.
I want to go after one.

655
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,499
What you read in one sitting.

656
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,779
- You are stubborn.

657
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,179
You want to tell me what it is?

658
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,181
- No.

659
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,549
- At least ga ale deserves to be frank.

660
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,979
- And you?

661
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,579
You never talk about yourself.

662
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,419
- I'm in my test
on the status of women.

663
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,219
I launched e Faveuglette.

664
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,979
I realize the mountain
é which I tackled.

665
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,739
Had a meeting with Sartre

666
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,859
type has yet told me:

667
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,019
. "Think ga
because you're a woman".

668
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,739
Would not argue it

669
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,939
ga as he thought because he was a man.

670
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,219
I checked everywhere and all the time

671
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,139
a man is right in his

672
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,379
and the woman is in the wrong.

673
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,579
I do not know how my
book will be welcomed,

674
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,309
but it supports 0U ga hurts.

675
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,509
I'm used é take hits.

676
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,710
- You've found a title?

677
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,419
- I'm not sure yet, but...

678
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,309
The second Sex can be.

679
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,262
And you?

680
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,261
- I, I know.

681
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,747
Lfiffamée...

682
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,547
Music Drama.

683
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,106
- Violet, Violet!

684
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,939
You're an awful actress
dubbed a troublemaker.

685
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,859
Is taken!

686
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,019
- No, not again, I'm tired!

687
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,899
- If you continue,
I replace you.

688
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,899
- And you hurt me, look!

689
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,539

- I told you that I
pasjouer a mother!

691
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,379
- Do not take the pram!

692
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,459
- If, in fact!

693
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,779
I am grotesque.

694
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,699
Jacques, take my defense.

695
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,139
He persecutes me.

696
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,779
He became nasty.

697
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,379
Tell him he is evil.

698
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,899
- Genet, you are bad.

699
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,710

00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,467
Violette.

702
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,899
- I can not be a mother.

703
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,099
Even laugh, I told you so.

704
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,939
- I understand, Violet.

705
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,379
- No, not you understand.

706
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,747
You are not a woman.

707
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,139
You do not know what
dest to get pregnant.

708
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,459
- You take all tragic,
dest a game.

709
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,699
- A game?

710
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,019
To, ie a game?

711
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,259
Me, I felt abused.

712
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,661
Used worse than ga, humiliated.

713
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,699
I thought you were less
superficial, Jacques.

714
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,299
- I'm really sorry.

715
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,299
Everything hurts you.

716
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,219
We wanted to have fun.

717
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,870
A treat yourself.

718
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,710
- To make me happy?

719
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,579
She laughed.

720
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,629
But just ga?

721
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,948
But what you know my pleasure?

722
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,259
You know what would make me
fun, now?

723
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,547
You know what I would most want?

724
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,979
- Violet'te, ie ridiculous.

725
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,699
Like men, you know.

726
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,702
- Men, women...

727
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,709
It is not question of ga.

728
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,711
Me, I see the child serious
in you.

729
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,630
- Oh, stop!

730
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,579
Violet, do not we leave

731
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,819
on a misunderstanding.

732
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,859
Let me make a move.

733
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,182
I offer a deluxe edition
for your next book.

734
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,339
A limited print on beautiful paper.

735
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:32,219
Did the same thing for
John and his Miracle of the Rose.

736
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,110
Pauvert ga is very good,
is not it, John?

737
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,299
OR in your book Are You?

738
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,859

739
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:45,099
- Perfect. For this publication,
I will give you 100,000 francs.

740
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,499
For you, obviously.

741
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,865
The rest is my office.

742
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,339
Please.

743
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,459
- Simone de Beauvoir will not like ga.

744
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,985
- You're not obliged to tell him.

745
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,019
- I'll think.

746
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,219
- Very well, very well.

747
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,222
Good road and e bientét.

748
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,139
- You've fared well, say so.

749
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:24,739
To The Miracle of the Rose,
I had only 70,000.

750
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,899
You're not close to see, your
100000.

751
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,947
This is a cheapskate.

752
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,219
She laughed.

753
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,219
- Jacques Guérin
This is a perfume, right?

754
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,739
- And a big collector.

755
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,259
I am wary of collectors.
- Why?

756
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,219
-They collect dead things.

757
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,219
These things are dead you know.

758
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,659
The words are alive.

759
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,139
They live, they act.

760
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,299
The cult objects is morbid, right?

761
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,667
- He still saved
manuscripts Proust.

762
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,499

I read on the plane.

771
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,459
- Guerin wants to publish a deluxe edition.

772
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,619

I'm not dead.

They are good, you'll see.

858
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,546
I was wanting more.

859
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,742
Maisje can not invent dozens.

Eggs, I put

863
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,659
with their little bee...

864
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,389
Qa makes me want to cry.

865
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,299
Ernest said that this
maternal estl'instincl.

866
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,950
He is still good, Ernest.

867
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,699
- But...

868
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,111
Violet, what you got?

869
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,539

01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,859
- Fool.

873

- It's back ege.

876
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,139
Finally.

877
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,259
Something evil is good.

878
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:01,219
You'll be able to enjoy.

879
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,779
- Enjoy. Enjoy what?

880
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,539

And you will find.
Be wife, dammit.

Oest not rocket science.

886
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,665
Look at your mother.

887
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,305
OR you?

888
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,099
- Mme de Beauvoir returned?

889
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:56,979
- Still no.

890
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:59,699
- We opened the window.
- This is the maid.

891
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,819
- Are you sure?

892
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,819
- It is not returned.

893
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,979

She followed his mail.

894

- Qa is three months she left.
She returned when?

896
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,939
- I know more than you.
- You know no more?

897
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,299
You are hiding something.

898
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,619
- This is not bientét finished!

899
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,699
Ms. Beauvoir, it is not.

900
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,111
It is not!

901
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,387
Sonnefle.

902
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,619
- What dest?

903
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,579
- Mme de Beauvoir?
- No, no one.

904
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,939
- I come in?

905
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,139
Let me in!

906
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,505
- You are crazy! Classical Music.

907
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:37,108
- Do not forget that these women haTssent.

908
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,099
They haTssent their condition.

909
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,259
Importantly,
they hate themselves.

910
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,339
Unable to love,
they are incapable of loving.

911
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:48,379
There are more than erotic ritual.

912
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,779
- I do not understand.

913
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,499
Their hatred of Madame,

914
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,099
dest their hatred of themselves?

915
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,259
- Obviously.

916
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,262
If you'll take your seats.

917
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,859
It is a rite that must reach

918
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,699
sublime tragedy.

919
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,819
We are in Racine, hear well.

920
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,259
These women do not reach their goals é

921
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,910
but destroy themselves.

922
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,659
Watch this glove.

923
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:25,659
This is not any glove.

924
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,819
This is a rubber glove.

925
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,819
This glove must be
in the heart of your concerns.

926
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:36,419
As you, I will not tell you
it should represent.

927
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,859
- An erotic object.
- It's true.

928
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:42,019
In a gesture you make him leave
dishwater.

929
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:45,979
To become skin gently fantasy.

930
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,179
Think about it, an important dest.

931
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,147
Is taken.

932
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,939
- If you did not like The Hungry,

933
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,979
have the courage to tell me.

934
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,259
- Ah, Violet.

935
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,539
Going to call you.

936
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,859

01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,859
I went there two days.

940
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,219
- You lie!

941
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:12,779
- Dest What the fuck?

942
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,019
Finally, Simone.

943
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,539
- A little silence.

944
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,065
Please.

945
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,659

946
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:29,071
- You've met someone?

947
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,779
- Yes, an American.
Qa you going?

948
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,828
- Like it?
- Qa does not concern you.

949
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,099
I read The Hungry.

950
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,419
Oest what you wrote
more beautiful.

951
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,899
I did not expect so much love e.

952
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,982
This is not so easy for me.

953
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,579
Dest Sartre found a great book.

954
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,139
Gaston Gallimard will
you sign the contract.

955

Nobody runs me the red carpet.

963
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,939
What do you think happens!

964
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,022

Down the hall.

- Thank you.

972
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,859

- You work?

983
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,899
- You think I'm ridiculous?

984
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,979

985

- We're talking about you.

990
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,539
- I am taken aback by some.

991
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,179
Communists, for example.

992
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,459
Camus, quefestime,

993
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,779

- I'm not here to talk about The Hungry.

1001
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,579
You know what I think
failure of a book.

1002
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,419
I do not Pattribue the
fact that you describe

1003
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,819
your love for me.

1004
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,299
Ga Get out of the head.

love with your magon?

He sends me his brother
that I sleep with him.

1419
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:50,939
What to do?

1420
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:52,819
- His brother please?

1421
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:54,662
- No.

1422
02:01:55,620 --> 02:01:57,099
But time passes.

1423
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:59,219
And I am alone.

1424
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:01,339
Always alone.

Nothing changejamais.

1426
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:07,988

And her need for love.

Simone de Beauvoir, hello.

1469
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:51,659
- Hello.

1470
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:54,539
You just preface
The Bétarde Violette Leduc.

1471
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,339
It embodies happiness and poetry.

1472
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,339
Combat a woman for her freedom.

1473
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:02,299
It seems that the company is on the eve é
profound changes

1474
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,259
altering irreversibly

1475
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,579
women's relationship é literature.

1476
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:07,739
Tell us a little more

1477
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:10,179
on your relationship with the author.

1478
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:13,099
What was fundamental Pécriture

1479
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:15,299
démancipation in its process.

1480
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:18,019
- Every writer draws é sincerity.

1481
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:20,619
Each has its own
which resembles no é no.

1482
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:24,059
I do not know more than
integrates Leduc.

1483
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:26,299
The Bétarde clearly shows

1484
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:29,339
a life is resuming
a destiny freedom.

1485
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,939
Tirelessly she questions

1486
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,859
and recreates what she discovered.

1487
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:35,139
In the late 50s, on my advice,

1488
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:38,219
Violet'te
Leduc began to tell his life.

1489
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:39,979
I had to publish my memoirs.

1490
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:42,019
I encouraged é do so.

1491
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:43,259
She laughed to herself,

1492
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:45,859
as if she did not deserve my trust.

1493
02:05:45,860 --> 02:05:47,939
I undeceived etj'ai insisted.

1494
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,179
She was overwhelmed with loneliness,

1495
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:51,659
disappointments and poverty.

1496
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:55,459
I did not believe or é or é
solitude his inner poverty.

1497
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:57,859
One day, she discovered Provence.

1498
02:05:57,860 --> 02:06:02,219
The gentle landscape and wild
é suited this girl from the North.

1499
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:04,659
Sensual, curious, emotional,

1500
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:06,619
she found in this setting serenity

1501
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:09,339
which allowed him to understand,

1502
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:10,939
isolate the motjuste,

1503
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:14,299
construct a work that
finally met the public.

1504
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,499
She mingled
real life and dream life.

1505
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:20,259
Dreams, é his surprise,
were no longer used

1506
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:24,389
to shut out the world, but to reveal
é readers.

1507
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:28,789
I do not know
finer salvation through literature.
