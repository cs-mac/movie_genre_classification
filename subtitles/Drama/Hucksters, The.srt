1
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,736
Well good morning, sir.

2
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:55,524
Well well, Mr Norman.
─ How are you, Franks.

3
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,910
Key, Harry.
─ Yes, sir.

4
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,583
Mr Norman.

5
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,293
Mr Norman.

6
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,878
Oh .. darling.

7
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,005
Betty .. Betty of my life.

8
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,591
I heard you were back. I heard
you checked in yesterday.

9
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,635
And on my day off, too.

10
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:16,767
Betty, honey.

11
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,889
You're more beautiful than ever.
─ Oh.

12
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,351
I've been sat here all morning, waiting
for you to phone and order breakfast.

13
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,021
I've had breakfast.

14
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:29,357
Honey. Will you tell the valet to come
up with the suit I gave him last night?

15
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:30,577
I'm in a hurry.

[ Door knocks ]

17
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,349
Come in.

18
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,502
Good morning, Mr Norman.

19
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,921
Good morning, Mr Glass. How are you?

20
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,674
I pressed them as you
like them. Soft roll.

21
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:57,302
You press the uniform, too?
─ Sure. It came down with the other.

22
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,298
It was a mistake.
I'm through with that one.

23
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:01,681
[ Telephone ]

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,022
Hello.

25
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,188
Oh.

26
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,769
Hello.

27
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:22,553
Yeah.

28
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:24,155
Wasn't it.

29
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:29,619
Goodnight.

30
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,963
Just like old times.

31
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:37,842
Mr Norman. Are you going
back into radio advertizing?

32
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:40,803
It's all I know anything about.
─ What, that same job?

33
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:43,389
Running back and forth between
New York and Hollywood?

34
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,808
No. I'm not going to work
for the same outfit again.

35
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:48,433
I'm going to try for something
really big this time.

36
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,001
I'll know in less than an hour.

37
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:52,804
Would you like me to run you a bath?
─ No thanks. I'm all bathed and shaved.

38
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,318
You'll get what you want.
─ How do you know?

39
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,923
Like you've told my son.

40
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:59,060
When he was trying
to get that first job.

41
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,074
If you don't seem to need a job ..

42
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,637
You are bound to get it.

43
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:05,078
You look like you're
on top of the world.

44
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,913
The job I'm after, Mr Glass.

45
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,318
I not only must convince
them I don't need it.

46
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:11,978
But that I wouldn't take it if they tied
me down and poured it over me.

47
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,749
Well, Mr Norman.

48
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:15,450
I guess that's all.

49
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,091
You'll .. call me if you
need me for anything?

50
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:19,482
Wait a minute, Mr Glass.

51
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,345
Oh no no, Mr Norman. No tip.

52
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:23,919
Tip me double tomorrow.

53
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,807
Today it's on the house.
─ Sure?

54
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,850
Positive. I'd be insulted.

55
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:32,167
Well.

56
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,943
Mr Norman, what did you do that for?

57
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,254
It's neater that way.

58
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:42,573
Now I have exactly an even
fifty bucks in the world.

59
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,908
You don't mean it?

60
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,910
But what a time to throw money away.

61
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,580
That's just it, Mr Glass. I want to
remind myself that money is only money.

62
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:53,334
It's a thought that will help me seem
sincere about not needing a job.

63
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,400
Anything?

64
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:12,395
I want a very <i>sincere</i> necktie.

65
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,230
I beg your pardon?

66
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,566
I want something that
makes me seem sincere.

67
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:19,819
You know: honest, genuine,
upright, trustworthy.

68
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:21,654
Well ..

69
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,574
Here is a hand painted
one in four colors.

70
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:28,494
At thirty-five dollars.

71
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,114
Is that sincere enough?

72
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,251
I think my friend, any more sincerity
would be downright foolhardy.

Oh dear, yes. She did?

81
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:07,234
The first night they were out together?

82
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,623
Well yes dear, you're so right.

Well go on, I'm dying to hear.

00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,650
Did you find out who he is?

85
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,843
Well, suppose we take her out to
lunch one day and get the lowdown?

86
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,597
Alright, dear. Call me later.

Mr V. Norman.

91
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,821
You may go in.
─ Thank you.

87, 88, 89, 90, 91.

94
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,707
No bad after a tough night.

95
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,045
Glad to see you, Vic. How's your wife?

96
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:00,864
I'm not married. Not the type.

97
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,703
Now there is a law of averages for you.

98
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,290
Ninety percent of the time I
get away with that question.

99
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,218
Now let's see.

100
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,117
Before the war you were with JD Richie.

101
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:11,446
In charge of the Hollywood
office for a while.

102
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,877
Before that, radio director for
Pratt and Burke's in New York.

103
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,373
What kind a job are you looking for?
─ Any kind.

104
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:19,388
So long as it pays
$25,000 a year to begin.

105
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,468
With a promise of more.

106
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:22,831
Much, much more.

107
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,842
You lay it right on the
barrel here, don't you.

108
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,065
Hey, I like your necktie.

109
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,821
Yes. I thought you would.

110
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:31,730
What?

111
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:34,278
It cost me thirty-five
bucks just to impress you.

112
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:35,884
Why tell me that?

113
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,770
I thought it would sound sincere.

114
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,534
I want you to know what
a sincere lad I am.

115
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,672
Ha, you're a showman Vic,
right down to your fingertips.

116
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,883
Excuse me a minute.

117
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:47,651
Hello?

118
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:50,911
Check.

119
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:52,981
Check.

120
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:54,568
Right, Mr Evans.

121
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:57,564
Yes, I ..

122
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,257
I see your point.

123
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:01,122
Right, Mr Evans.

124
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:05,511
Evan Llewellyn Evans. Head of
Beautee Soap. Our biggest client.

125
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,333
Of course, Mr Evans.
You're one hundred percent ..

126
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:16,704
I'll jazz up the entire staff.

127
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,048
Right, Mr Evans.

128
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,782
Yes, sir. We'll be seeing you tomorrow.

129
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,390
He doesn't like the commercial on
Beautee Soap's number one radio show.

130
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:33,904
The Figaro Picket Show.

131
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,446
He wants a commercial
that's new, novel and ..

132
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:38,025
Yet what he calls "on the beat".

133
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:41,005
One that mentions Beautee Soap at
least ten times in a single minute.

134
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,114
I'm sorry Vic, but I think I'd better
drop down and see Cooke.

135
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,936
Our man in charge of the Evans account.

136
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:47,695
Maybe we can get together another time.

137
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,778
Sure, sure, I'll be around.
Any old time.

138
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,774
Say incidentally ..

139
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:54,482
I've heard a lot about him.
He must be quite a character.

140
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,267
He gives us nearly ten million
dollars’ worth of business a year.

141
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,272
Yes, he's quite a character.
─ But a lot of trouble?

142
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:02,522
Is he really worth ten
million a year to you?

143
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,730
What do you mean?

144
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:07,760
The way you talked to him on
the phone, you sounded frightened.

145
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,510
That will give you ulcers.

146
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,293
Is that worth ten million a year to you?

147
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:13,977
Hey. Maybe you wouldn't
be scared of him.

148
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,062
Maybe I wouldn't.

149
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:17,599
Say, Vic.

150
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,025
Wait a minute.

151
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,316
I'll tell you this much.

152
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,525
Cooke has had enough
of Evans and vice-versa.

153
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:24,528
Now ..

154
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,464
You might be able to handle the job.

155
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,369
And then again you might not.

156
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,335
It might be a job I'd accept.

157
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,914
Then again .. it might not.

158
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,859
Now this is the part of your
advertizing agency I don't like.

159
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,236
People work down here.

160
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:43,923
When I work, I work all the time.

161
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,802
You worry.
─ It's not the same.

162
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:47,090
Hello.

163
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,538
Vic. Vic, darling!

164
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,922
Oh you mad character. I thought maybe
you'd died or got married or something.

165
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:56,264
Hello, Jean.
─ Darling, this is wonderful.

166
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,412
What am saying, it's heaven. I was
just on my way up for an audition.

167
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:01,547
Oh Jean, this is Mr Kimberly.
─ Miss Ogilvie, Kim.

168
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,524
Hello.
─ Aren't you pretty, Miss Ogilvie.

169
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,059
Well aren't you nice.
I'm doing my hair differently.

170
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:09,606
Vic, you playboy. You know,
I think the army was good for you.

171
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:12,452
Where are you singing now, Jean?
─ El Scirocco. Just for a few more days.

172
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,186
I'll drop in and see you.
─ Tonight?

173
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,186
Maybe.
─ Now, don't be like that.

174
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,903
You know you'll not pick up anything
better than me between now and then.

175
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:23,036
I can see you have
a lot of talents, Vic.

176
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:24,728
A <i>lot</i> of talents.

177
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:27,102
But we've got to, that's all.

178
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:28,810
You know how the old man is.

179
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,571
Well, do the best you can, but ..

180
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,126
Have it by noon.

181
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,501
It started at 8 o'clock this
morning. He called me at 8.

182
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,704
Cooke, you know Vic Norman?
─ Sure. Hi, Cooke.

183
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,809
Why hello, Vic. Glad to
see you. You look swell.

184
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,109
Yeah, never better.

185
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,270
How are you?

186
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,272
It's getting me down, Vic.
It's getting me down.

187
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:46,706
He insists on a new star for
the soap opera. That's the latest.

188
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:50,314
He heard the girl we've got divorced 5
years ago. He don't believe in divorce.

189
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:52,908
Kim, I tell you ..
─ Excuse me, sir but it's 11:30.

190
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,485
Oh yes, Have the radio department
pipe the broadcast in here.

191
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:57,921
Sorry, fellows. We're trying a
new commercial this morning.

192
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:00,713
Pipe the Beautee Soap
broadcast in here immediately.

193

Evans hasn't heard this one yet.

Vic, what do you think?

I get paid for my opinions.

Well I know it’s alright. It's good.

I know something else. He'll hate it.

He's just got it in his head

Now take it easy, old man.

You want Vic to think that we're
running a loony-bin up here?

Not that we don't.

Well, I wouldn't say that
but it's worth considering.

00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:11,054
He might very well be the man
you and I have been looking for.

222
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:12,183
Vic.

223
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,696
I like your style.

224
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:16,072
And if not right now, some day
you're going to work for us.

Even if I have to a job for you.

226
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,294
Well, I'll always be glad
to talk to you about it.

227
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:24,039
So long ..
─ So long.

228
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,115
So long, Cooke.

229
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:29,492
Hey, if you'll pardon a word of advice.

230
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:31,600
Why don't you take the
rest of the day off.

231
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:33,783
Get a massage .. get drunk.

Oh, great. Just the thing.

233
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:37,362
Look here, Vic.

234
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,914
See that? Our new testimonial campaign.

235
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:41,874
Twenty-five women. Society women.

236
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:45,448
Evans picked the names out of the social
register and for all I know, tombstones.

237
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,453
I've got to see that every one of them
agrees to endorse Beautee Soap.

238
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:50,493
Every one of them or
he'll have our heads.

239
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:53,280
He called this morning to ask why I
hadn't done anything about it yet.

240
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,615
What do they get for it?

241
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:56,947
Five thousand dollars to be
paid to their favorite charity.

242
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,826
Who's this on top of your list?

243
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:00,946
Mrs Frances X Dorrance.

244
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,667
Why the star by her name?

245
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,999
Ah, you know. Daughter of an
English Lord. "Sir" something.

246
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,212
Widow of an American General
killed in the Philippines.

247
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,931
Evans wants her particularly.
Society plus war-widow.

248
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:12,459
You get it. Patriotic angle.

249
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,433
Now wait a minute, Cooke. Let's not
bother Vic with our private business.

250
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:18,095
Been nice seeing you, Vic.
Come in again sometime.

251
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:19,946
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

252
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,457
You know, I like that idea.
That's smart advertizing.

253
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,068
What are you talking about, Vic?

254
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,912
How can I even suggest it to her?

255
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:31,546
I happen to know that when they
gave her late husband's DSC ..

256
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:34,074
She wouldn't even allow
photographers in then.

257
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,807
I've been in this business a
long time but I'm not yet so ..

258
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:40,409
Insensitive that I can just walk right
up to a lady like that and ask her.

259
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:41,928
Okay, chum. Take it easy.

260
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:43,503
Take it easy.

261
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:47,512
I'm just as insensitive as they come.

262
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,481
I'll ask her for you.
─ Do you mean it?

263
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,666
You really will?

264
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,844
Maybe you're a little more eager
for a job than you pretend, Vic.

265
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,127
Let's stop being coy.

266
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:00,712
I might possibly take that job if you'd
knocked me down and forced me.

267
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:04,476
So, I'll keep my foot in the door
by doing a little chore for you.

268
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,118
How are you going to go about it?

269
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:08,178
I'll carry a pipe.

270
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,444
Women always seem to trust
a man who smokes a pipe.

271
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,418
If I had a dog, I'd try
and smell a little doggy.

272
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,145
You don't mean to tell me you're
going over there right now? Just ..

273
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,370
Barge in?
─ Oh no. I'll call her first.

274
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:22,730
I always give rich women at least ten
minutes to get the egg off their faces.

275
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,043
So long.

276
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,389
Here .. here .. come here.

277
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:00,075
Hello.

278
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:02,859
Mrs Dorrance, I presume?

279
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,393
I do hope you were
expecting me, Mrs Dorrance.

280
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:19,116
Alright. When did we meet
before, Mrs Dorrance?

281
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,624
Let's see .. Paris? Miami?

282
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,201
The Staten Island ferry?

283
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,561
Or perhaps we were both
being presented at court?

284
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,766
What shall we do, Mrs Dorrance?
Go dancing, maybe?

285
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:33,544
How would that be?
Oh, we'd have a lot of fun.

286
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:36,398
Ellen.

287
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:42,821
Yes?

288
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:44,227
Hello.

289
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:46,487
Mrs Dorrance?

290
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,228
Yes, I am.
─ My name is Norman.

291
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,826
I telephoned you.

292
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,545
Oh yes. The man from the Charity League.

293
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:55,024
Do come in, Mr Norman.

294
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,277
Run along, darling.

295
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:00,990
I'm awfully sorry if Ellen bothered you.

296
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,856
No, not at all. I enjoyed it a lot.

297
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:04,648
It's a sport that might catch on.

298
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:07,227
Thank you, Ellen. We must
do it again sometime.

299
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,313
I'm sorry everything is so disorganized.

300
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:14,089
It's the maid's day out, and the
nurse's day to be in bed with a cold.

301
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,402
If you just go in and
wait I'll be right back.

302
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:18,289
Thank you.

303
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,465
Come on, darling.

304
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:30,789
I don't know how to account for Ellen.

305
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,930
Usually, she's too shy
to speak to strangers.

306
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:34,664
She still hasn't spoken to me.

307
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:36,227
Please sit down, Mr Norman.

308
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:37,743
Now then.

309
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,768
How can I help the Charity League?

310
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:43,967
Well ..

311
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,578
Suppose I begin this way.

312
00:16:47,536 --> 00:16:49,127
I really work for Beautee Soap.

313
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,438
Beautee Soap?

314
00:16:50,663 --> 00:16:54,072
That is, I work for the advertizing
agency that works for Beautee Soap.

315
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:56,860
Do you know about advertizing agencies?

316
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,436
They're not quite the
same here as in England.

317
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,564
I'm an American citizen now,
Mr Norman. But you're right.

318
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:04,816
I'm afraid I don't know
much about such things.

319
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:05,948
Hmm.

320
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,995
People like Beautee Soap employ us to ..

321
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,984
Put on their radio shows and write
their magazine advertizements.

322
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,358
To shout their praises
and sell their wares.

323
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:17,500
To do their huckstering for them.

324
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,230
Their what?
─ Huckstering.

325
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,171
A huckster is a peddler.

326
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:22,751
You know, a hawker.

327
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,404
We're professional hucksters.

328
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:26,623
But with station-wagons
instead of pushcarts.

329
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,712
Oh. It must be very interesting.

330
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:30,662
Yes.

331
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,427
Well then.

332
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,048
I guess I'd better come to the point.

333
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:37,909
Mrs Dorrance, have you ever
noticed in the magazines ..?

334
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:41,935
I mean, lots of times, you see pictures
of people like you endorsing things.

335
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:44,949
Probably, friends of yours.
─ You want me to endorse Beautee Soap?

336
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:48,449
Five thousand dollars will be
paid to your favorite charity.

337
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:52,011
That's what I meant when I said I
represented the Charity League.

338
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:53,727
I see.

339
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:57,405
Well, Mr Norman.
My favorite charity ..

340
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,068
I hope you won't be shocked.

341
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:00,344
Is myself.

342
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:02,822
Is your ..?

343
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:04,786
You'll do it?

344
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,174
Two growing children, you know.

345
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:08,939
And General's widows aren't rich.

346
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,930
And I thought you'd be so hard to sell.

347
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,468
Mrs Dorrance, you have a lot to learn.
─ What do you mean?

348
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:20,630
I mean if you'd played hard to get, I'd
ask the company to offer more money.

349
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:27,382
You won't do it for less than
$7,500. Not a penny less.

350
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:29,462
I'll say that. Maybe
they'll come through.

351
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:30,643
Are you serious?

352
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,426
Well "A", it isn't my money.
And "B", I have an angle in this.

353
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:37,254
If I tell them that you were just
sitting here waiting to be asked.

354
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,551
That means I didn't have
much of a selling job to do.

355
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:41,821
In fact.

356
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,676
With someone as pretty
and photogenic as you.

357
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,747
I'd be willing to help if you
wanted to try for $10,000.

358
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,891
Oh, no thank you.

359
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:56,592
I'm afraid I can't even
accept the extra $2,500.

360
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:59,785
Although I'll be glad to say you
had a terrible time convincing me.

361
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:02,159
Frankly, I think you're
overpaying me as it is.

362
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,000
Hello. I'm Hal.

363
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:08,831
My sister would like
to ask you something.

364
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:11,199
Will you marry her?
─ Now!

365
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:14,552
I'd love to.

366
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,057
Hal, take your sister upstairs.

367
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,164
Mr Norman is entirely too
busy to marry anybody today.

368
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:23,837
And Hal.

369
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,210
Whenever you propose for
your sister in the future.

370
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,465
Say please.

371
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,819
Ellen looks like you.

372
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:39,629
You both have the wonderful quality that
you get better looking as you get older.

373
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,478
Oh dear, we're getting a long
way from Beautee Soap.

374
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,695
I think I see what you mean.

375
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:49,129
Ah .. Mrs Dorrance, shall I arrange an
appointment for you at a photographers?

376
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,473
Say .. tomorrow afternoon?

377
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:52,774
They're in big hurry to
get this campaign started.

378
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:53,647
Tomorrow?

379
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:56,401
Why, yes. Yes, that will be fine.

380
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,590
I'll be free of the children by then.

381
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,443
Why not bring the children along?
I'd love to see them again.

382
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:02,697
Oh, you'll be there?

383
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:03,951
If you'll bring them.

384
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:05,857
Really? Do you really like them so much?

385
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,174
Oh, I do indeed.

386
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,015
Old Papa Norman, the child-lover.

387
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,766
Goodbye.
─ Goodbye, Mr Norman.

388
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,429
No, no dear. I was under the impression
I gave you the correct position.

389
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,948
No, dear.

390
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,870
Your feet are too close together.
Your toes are not pointed enough.

391
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:25,094
Here, watch me.

392
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:29,485
Put one foot up like this and the other
one a considerable distance below it.

393
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:32,059
And don't press the legs together
otherwise they'll just bulge.

394
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:33,615
Now keep the bottle up.

395
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:35,243
Watch the label.

396
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,881
Now hold it.
Ah, that's perfect. Perfect.

397
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:42,001
Point the toes, dear. Point the toes.

398
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,969
Take a deep breath. Smile.

399
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,726
Hold it.

400
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:48,376
Exquisite.

401
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:49,978
Yes, yes. What is it?

402
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:52,592
Oh, I'm Mrs Dorrance.

403
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:54,066
You were expecting me?

404
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,063
Aha, Beautee Soap.
You're right on time, Mrs Dorrance.

405
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,843
Beauty Soap background, please.

406
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:00,211
How do you do, Madam.

407
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,025
How do you do.
─ I'm Michael Michaelson.

408
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,377
And you brought your children. How nice.

409
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,831
Thank you.
─ Would you come with me, please.

410
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,774
We can see what your costume is like.

411
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,057
Oh, a costume for me?
─ Why, of course. Something lovely.

412
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,023
And there's your background.

413
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:17,400
Now then, I wonder if you'll look
best in peach, cerise or black.

414
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,764
Is .. is this for me?

415
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:22,224
Well ..?

416
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:25,915
Oh, they want to make me look
awfully glamorous don't they.

417
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:28,517
You'll look very nice.

418
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:30,717
Very nice.
─ Well thank you, but ..

419
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:32,756
I've never worn one of these things.

420
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:34,548
Even alone in my own bedroom.

421
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:37,592
Mrs Dorrance, I'm only the
photographer. I just do what I'm told.

422
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:40,144
Now, if I were you I would
just put this on and ..

423
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:42,372
Hello, Ellen.

424
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,407
How is my bride of the day, huh?

425
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:47,332
Hello there.
─ Hello.

426
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,001
Oh, very smart.

427
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,748
This is Miss Kennedy from
Mr Evans' downtown office.

428
00:21:51,914 --> 00:21:53,530
She's his personal advertizing advisor.

429
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,437
Miss Kennedy. Mrs Dorrance.
─ How do you do?

430
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:56,773
How do you do.

431
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:58,401
And this is Mr Michael Michaelson.

432
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:00,243
Mr Norman.
─ Thank you, Miss Dorrance.

433
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,879
Hello, Hal.
─ Hello.

434
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,495
Well then Mrs Dorrance, do
you think we might get to work?

435
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:08,138
Do you suppose they thought
they were hiring Lady Godiva?

436
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,446
I hadn't seen these.
─ Don't you like them?

437
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,585
Well, frankly ..
─ But Mr Evans approved them.

438
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,967
Mr Evans doesn't have to wear them.

439
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:19,301
I'm surprised he doesn't want to
photograph Mrs Dorrance in a bubble-bath.

440
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,070
Don't be silly, Mr Norman.

441
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:23,122
Beautee Soap <i>doesn't</i> bubble.

442
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:24,676
Well.

443
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:27,563
Could I wear a slip or
something under it?

444
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,253
One never does.
─ certainly not.

445
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:33,268
They are going to see through Mummy.

446
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:35,062
You're so right, Hal.

447
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,383
Mr Norman.
─ It will be alright.

448
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:41,003
I think we'll photograph Mrs Dorrance
wearing an evening dress.

449
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:43,534
Sitting in a straight chair
with a plain background.

450
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,294
Hal standing on her right
and Ellen on her left.

451
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,751
I'd much rather.

452
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:50,729
Perhaps you don't understand.

453
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:53,937
Mr Evans didn't suggest
this layout, he <i>ordered</i> it.

454
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:56,908
Miss Kennedy, you've registered
your objection. We've all heard it.

455
00:22:57,592 --> 00:22:59,900
But I represent the Kimberly
Advertizing Agency.

456
00:23:00,265 --> 00:23:02,635
And the Kimberly Advertizing
Agency arranged this appointment.

457
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,360
Now then .. there is only
one thing left for you to do.

458
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,831
Here's a nickel. Go telephone Mr Evans.

459
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,605
He'll hear about it soon enough.

460
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,037
And be sure and get my
name right: Victor Norman.

461
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:16,362
Do you have a plain, straight chair?

462
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:18,707
Mr Norman, if Mr Evans
thought I had anything to do ..

463
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:21,571
I'll take full responsibility.
─ I guess you don't like your job much.

464
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:24,872
Please, Mr Norman.

465
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,725
Vic.

466
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,383
Vic .. you've been so nice to me.

467
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:30,696
I don't want to cost you your job.
─ Don't worry.

468
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,437
I wouldn't let you pose in one
of those things. Not you.

469
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,180
Do you have a long, Queenly,
kind of a gown at home?

470
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,819
Well, I have a long dress.
─ Hmm .. good.

471
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:42,301
Set up a straight chair
on a plain background.

472
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,417
While I take Mrs Dorrance
home to get another dress.

473
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:45,346
Alright.

474
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:48,518
Mrs Dorrance, please. The children.

475
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,037
We send him off for cheesecake
and what does he bring back?

476
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:55,283
Whistler's mother.

477
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,344
My head! This migraine is killing me.

478
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,017
Migraine? What about my ulcer?

479
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,352
Good morning, gentlemen.

480
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:04,140
Where have you been, Vic? Where you
been? We've been looking for an hour.

481
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,278
I'm sorry. I've been
downstairs, cutting a record.

482
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:09,630
I have here old Doc Norman's special
prescription for ailing commercials.

483
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:10,975
Please Vic, sit down.

484
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,275
What were you thinking about, Vic?
─ Pretty good, I think.

485
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,719
It may be just what Evans looks for.
─ See that?        ─ Sure.

486
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:17,607
That's what Evans is
looking for .. my head.

487
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,163
I take it you have seen
the Dorrance photographs?

488
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:22,527
We've seen the photos.
─ Dignified, don't you think?

489
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,516
What is it? What are you trying to do?
Lose me a ten-million dollar account?

490
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:28,038
Evans didn't like the pictures?
─ We haven't heard from him yet.

491
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:30,511
This is will be the worst we
ever had. I feel it in my bones.

492
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:32,945
I'll bet it's a number three.
─ They have numbers?

493
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:34,950
We go by how many taxis
of people he sends for.

494
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,215
If one little thing goes wrong he starts
tearing into everything. Everything.

495
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:40,646
One day I was a few minutes late
for a meeting and he got sore.

496
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,724
He sent for three taxi-loads
of people from here.

497
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,885
Our writers had to meet
with his copywriter.

498
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,458
Our writers with his staff layout.

499
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:49,115
I thought maybe you were
the boy we were looking for.

500
00:24:49,215 --> 00:24:49,883
I am.

501
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:52,958
Sure. And you put me in a spot like
this. What am I supposed to tell him?

502
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:55,153
You won't tell him anything.
I'll tell him.

503
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:57,855
Take me down and introduce me
as the guy that caused the trouble.

504
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,106
What will you say?
─ I'll think of something.

505
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,343
You two guys kill me.

506
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,054
I saw troops before D-Day in Normandy
and they weren't half as scared as you.

507
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,177
If they'd been meeting Evans instead of
Germans, it might have been different.

508
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:15,783
Mr Kimberly, he called. Right away.
He wants to see you right away.

509
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:18,009
What is it? Number two, number three?

510
00:25:18,242 --> 00:25:20,637
Mr Kimberly .. the number four.

511
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:27,647
Now Vic, you sit here.

512
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:30,645
Mr Evans sits at the head of the table.
─ I guessed that.

513
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:32,768
And Vic, whatever you do,
don't disagree with him.

514
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,599
Am I supposed to look bright or
does that call for a bigger salary?

515
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,422
Just don't tell him he's wrong.

516
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,395
Nobody ever has and I
guess nobody ever will.

517
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:40,462
That's right.

518
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:50,458
Gentlemen, Miss Kennedy.

519
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,718
I would like to introduce
Mr Victor Norman.

520
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,521
Vic, this is Mr Paul Evans.

521
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:56,021
Mr Evans' son.

522
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:58,294
Mr Allison, special
assistant to Mr Evans.

523
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:00,922
Mr George Rockton, chief
counsel to Beautee Soap.

524
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,742
And Miss Kennedy you already know.

525
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:23,541
Mr Evans.

526
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:25,607
May I present Mr Victor Norman.

527
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,524
Mr Victor.

528
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:46,985
Mr Norman, you've just seen
me do a disgusting thing.

529
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,516
But you'll always
remember what I just did.

530
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:55,701
You see Mr Norman, if nobody remembers
your brand you won't sell any soap.

531
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:56,930
Check?
─ Check.

532
00:26:57,332 --> 00:26:58,635
You see, Mr Foreman.

533
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:02,805
You see Mr Norman, I've got my
own ideas on how to sell.

534
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,266
I believe in selling by demonstration.

535
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:10,156
Any other way is all wet.

536
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:14,259
See what I mean?

537
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:18,002
You see, Mr Foreman, this
company gives your agency ..

538
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,762
Ten million dollars a year
to spend on advertizing.

539
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:22,824
Do you know why? I'll tell you.

540
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,182
I'll tell you a secret about the
soap business, Mr Norman.

541
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,955
There is absolutely no
difference between soaps.

542
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:32,470
Absolutely none, except
for perfume and color.

543
00:27:32,928 --> 00:27:33,800
Soap is soap.

544
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:36,336
Oh, maybe we have a
few manufacturing tricks.

545
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:38,894
But the public don't
give a hoot about that.

546
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:41,958
The difference is in
selling and advertizing.

547
00:27:42,555 --> 00:27:45,272
We sell soap twice as fast
as our nearest competitor.

548
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:49,253
Why do we outsell them? Because
we out-advertize them. Right?

549
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,141
Right.
─ Right.

550
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:54,827
We out-advertize our
competitors, Mr Norman.

551
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,708
There is something
remarkable about that.

552
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:57,870
Listen.

553
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,812
We spend on average, three million
dollars a year <i>less</i> than they do.

554
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:03,960
We out-advertize them.

555
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:07,373
And out-sell them, but on less money.

556
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:09,650
Does that convey a thought to you?

557
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,533
It does to me. It means to me
that we know what we are doing.

558
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:16,061
Well, sales principles are not theory.

559
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,689
They are proven facts.

560
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:18,985
Example.

561
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:21,435
Beautee Soap, Beautee Soap,
Beautee Soap!

562
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:24,560
Repeat until it comes out of their ears.
Repeat until they say it in their sleep.

563
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,320
Irritate them, Mr Norman.

564
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:28,914
Irritate! Irritate! Irritate them!

565
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:31,097
Never forget!
Irritate them, knock them dead!

566
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:33,575
See what I mean?

567
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:39,267
Now, sir.

568
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:43,443
Here Mr Doorman, is a little idea
that just happened to come to us.

569
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,938
Just dropped down out of the blue.

570
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:50,676
A mere detail that we did a chat-chat
about for nearly three months.

571
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,440
A small point.

572
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:54,669
And all the people in
this room whose income ..

573
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:58,822
Not counting mine, must
aggregate a million dollars a year.

574
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,713
Thought this was a
pretty good little idea.

575
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:03,545
Right on the beam.

576
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,592
Fits all our proven theories.

577
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:08,210
Check?
─ Check.

578
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:13,032
Now you young man, you
don't like our little old idea.

579
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,965
Why?

580
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:16,895
I challenge you to give me a reason why.

581
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:22,544
Because, Mr Evans.

582
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:27,122
A careful examination of the layout
revealed a single disturbing element.

583
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:29,847
The element to which I refer, Mr Evans.

584
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:33,014
Is inherently opposed
to the basic qualities ..

585
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,151
To the very essence, of Beautee
Soap's appeal to the millions.

586
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:40,242
And what is this disturbing
element, Mr Norman?

587
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,393
Well, I'm sure you all know better than
I that Beautee Soap sells for 7 cents.

588
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:46,494
It goes into the homes of the masses.

589
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:50,597
Beautee Soap was not meant for
the minority of .. ladies of leisure.

590
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:52,869
Now then, this picture.

591
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:54,980
That loose and flossy negligee.

592
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,557
Leg art? Is that Beautee Soap?

593
00:29:58,235 --> 00:30:01,260
A bored and sophisticated
woman in a dubious boudoir?

594
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:04,330
Oh that disturbs me, Mr Evans.

595
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:06,885
Beautee Soap is a clean product.

596
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:11,095
And your advertisement is not clean.

597
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:18,382
Mister Norman.

598
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,272
I take my hat off to you. You're right.

599
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:29,606
Mr Evans.

600
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:32,580
It may interest you to know that
Mr Norman sat up all last night ..

601
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,738
Working out a twist on your
present commercial idea.

602
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:37,122
If you'd care to hear it,
we have it here on a record.

603
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:38,500
Play it.

00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:39,365
"<i>Correct, Barbara Hascombe</i>?"
─ "<i>Not much time for talking</i>."

623
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,485
"<i>Got to get sonny cleaned
up with Beautee Soap</i>."

624
00:31:41,877 --> 00:31:44,401
"<i>Sonny, hold still! You're
getting it in your mouth</i>."

625
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:47,256
"<i>I know it, Ma. I just love that soap</i>."

626
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:48,680
"<i>There you have it, folks</i>."

627
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,834
"<i>Beautee Soap is
cleaning up the country</i>."

628
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,922
"<i>For Beautee is, as Beautee does</i>."

629
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:54,299
"<i>So don't forget ..</i>"

630
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:56,974
"<i>Ha ha .. love that soap</i>!"

631
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,133
Hmm.

632
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,497
I like it. I like it, Mr Norman.

633
00:32:06,032 --> 00:32:07,870
Love that soap. Love that soap.

634
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:10,314
They'll all be saying it.
It's on the beam.

635
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,242
Only cut that line about it being
Hollywood's favorite bar ..

636
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:14,942
Next to the Mocambo.

637
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:18,315
Mr Norman, Beautee Soap
is second best to nothing.

638
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:20,167
Hollywood's favorite bar.

639
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:22,007
And don't you forget it.

640
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:24,361
Right?
─ Right.

641
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:26,992
Mr Kimberly.

642
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:31,430
I dare say you've an idea of absorbing
Mr Norman in your organization.

643
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,532
Yes, sir. I thought we might start
him out as Mr Cooke's assistant.

644
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:35,765
Salary?

645
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,825
Well, I thought an expense account for
a while. Let him draw what he needs.

646
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:39,838
Excellent.

647
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:42,912
I see Mr Norman, you have your teeth.

648
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:44,623
In our province.

649
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:47,658
My felicitations, Mr Norman.

650
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,182
You are very kind, Mr Evans.

651
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:53,393
Very, very, kind.

652
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:01,607
Dinner tonight. My house.

653
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,397
Truffles and champagne.
Get yourself a girl. We'll celebrate.

654
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:07,985
Check.

655
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:30,780
Hello?

656
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,497
Oh, yes.

657
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:35,472
Vic.

658
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:36,825
It's like this, Kay.

659
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:39,823
First, the boss wants me to dine with him
and his wife tonight at his apartment.

660
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:41,015
Second.

661
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:45,280
The deal is mixed up with the way you'd
have looked in the transparent negligee.

662
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,414
Yes, I .. I guess I would have looked ..

663
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:50,901
Awful alright.

664
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:54,208
I mean, it's not exactly the
sort of thing I should wear.

665
00:33:55,354 --> 00:33:57,142
It's just the sort of
thing you <i>should</i> wear.

666
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,858
The only thing is it would have
been much too good for Evans.

667
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:01,547
Now, about tonight?

668
00:34:01,988 --> 00:34:04,832
I wish you could see the eager
expression on my face right now.

669
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:07,254
If you'd only come.

670
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:11,049
Kimberly is on the left side.
─ Thank you.

671
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:14,372
Oh, I'm losing my earring.

672
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:22,307
I wish we were going someplace else.

673
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,854
Alone.

674
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,861
Why? Don't you like the Kimberlys?

675
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:28,941
This was a mistake,
my bringing you here.

676
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:30,905
Kim will talk business all the time.

677
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,568
Aren't we a little late as it is?

678
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:37,352
First, the Stork Club.
I haven't been there in 4 years.

679
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:39,265
Table in the corner.

680
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,542
I might even order some wine.

681
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,672
You are very persuasive.
─ Good.

682
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,082
You know what you are, Kay?
You're an honest person.

683
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:55,749
You say what's on your mind.

684
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:59,048
I haven't much experience with honest
people and I'm not sure I like them.

685
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,444
How can you tell what
they're going to do next?

686
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,298
Good evening.
─ That's what I mean.

687
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:05,842
You can't trust an honest person.

688
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:06,783
Down?

689
00:35:07,256 --> 00:35:08,115
Sorry, chum.

690
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,446
Yes, sir?
─ Kimberly?

691
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,339
Yes, sir.
─ I'm Victor Norman.

692
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,247
Just a minute, sir. I'll tell
Mrs Kimberly you're here.

693
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:21,615
I still think we should have
gone somewhere else.

694
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:23,989
I think the butler does, too.

695
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,617
Good evening.

696
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:29,636
Good evening, Mrs Kimberly.
I'm Victor Norman.

697
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:31,497
How do you do.
─ And this is Mrs Dorrance.

698
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,243
Mrs Kimberly, Kay.
─ How do you do.

699
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:34,371
How do you do.

700
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:36,844
Please come in.

701
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:41,452
It's awfully nice of you
to drop in like this.

702
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:44,145
Do you two live near here?

703
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,870
Oh, I live a few blocks away.

704
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,136
Vic asked me to join him for
dinner. I do hope it was alright.

705
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:52,567
Oh .. oh how nice. I'm so glad.

706
00:35:52,772 --> 00:35:54,829
Maybe Kim didn't tell you?
He did ask us.

707
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:56,779
As a matter of fact,
he didn't mention it.

708
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,911
He just said we were
going out to dinner.

709
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:01,237
But that's perfectly alright.
Really, it is.

710
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:02,617
Do sit down.

711
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,234
Martinis, Conrad.

712
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,367
Lots of times he doesn't tell me.

713
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:08,717
He came home a little bit ..

714
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:11,236
He was celebrating something.

715
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:13,471
Are you in business with him?

716
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,335
In a manner of speaking.

717
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,146
I gather they had a busy day with ..

718
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:18,787
Is his name "Evans", Vic?

719
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,017
Oh, if today was Evans' day,
that explains everything.

720
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,560
Whenever Kim sees Evans he
either has to celebrate or forget.

721
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,095
I gather that today was a celebration.

722
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,127
Yes, today we came out the winners.

723
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:31,497
Just luck.

724
00:36:31,804 --> 00:36:32,833
I'm so glad.

725
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,934
His life really belong to that
Mr Evans and his other clients.

726
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:39,582
They are all that way in the
advertizing business. Or most of them.

727
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,044
Isn't Mr Norman?

728
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:44,010
I .. don't think so.

729
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,360
Are you, Vic?

730
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,715
Don't tell Kim, but the answer is "no".

731
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,355
I'm not that sincere.

732
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:50,826
Whoa ..

733
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,480
Well, well .. our dinner guests.

734
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:58,233
Good evening. Good evening.
─ Kim, this is Mrs Dorrance.

735
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:01,651
Whoo .. oomph ..

736
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,425
"Oomph" .. it sounds
like yogi or something.

737
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,119
Oh, he doesn't mean
any harm, Mrs Norman.

738
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,672
Oh .. Mrs Dorrance.

739
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,379
Oh I'm so sorry. Mrs Dorrance.

740
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,880
Whenever he's had a couple of drinks
he thinks that all women are "oomph".

741
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:17,444
All women. Anybody.

742
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:19,493
Oh my, I didn't mean ..

743
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:21,298
I know just what you meant.

744
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:24,046
I do seem to be off on the
wrong foot this evening.

745
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,116
Well I guess I did it again, lover.

746
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,877
I forgot to tell you who we
were having for dinner.

747
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,756
But Vicky here, wrote the
most <i>beautiful</i> commercial.

748
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,405
"<i>Love that soap</i>."

749
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:36,312
I'm sorry. I'm afraid now it
is going to be business talk.

750
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,844
The two subjects: business and "oomph".

751
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:41,767
Well, what else is there?
─ There's always Mah Jong.

752
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:44,272
Kim, we're going out to dinner you know.

753
00:37:44,372 --> 00:37:47,051
Sure. Where would you like to go, Vic?
─ Wherever you say, Kim.

754
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,153
Well, I thought of some
quiet restaurant, but ..

755
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,431
Now that I see how
"oomph" Mrs Dorrance is, I ..

756
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:54,742
Do I have to say thank you
every time you say that?

757
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:56,858
No, it isn't necessary.
Say, I've got an idea.

758
00:37:57,398 --> 00:38:00,460
I know a gay, noisy place where we
can get some wonderful steaks but ..

759
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:02,944
Maybe Vicky-boy wouldn't
want to go there.

760
00:38:03,044 --> 00:38:04,578
Why not?
─ El Scirocco.

761
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:07,264
That singer friend of yours
is pretty "oomphy" herself.

762
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:10,484
And a man can have too much
"oomph" in the same room.

763
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:15,491
It doesn't matter to me where we go.

764
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:17,288
Why not let the girls decide?

765
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,514
Where would you like
to go, Mrs Dorrance?

766
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:20,642
Oh.

767
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,013
El Scirocco by all means.

768
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:25,593
My shoes and socks, Conrad.
My shoes and socks.

769
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,970
You got to wear shoes
and socks at El Scirocco.

770
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:47,975
[ Singing: ]
"<i>Why do we talk with our eyes
as we sit across the table</i>?"

771
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:56,263
"<i>Why do we walk arm-in-arm
whenever we are able</i>?"

772
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:03,226

778
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,153
"<i>Don't tell me</i>."

779
00:39:35,217 --> 00:39:38,642
"<i>It's just a lie</i>."

780
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:45,674
"<i>Why whisper words I have never known</i>."

781
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:55,620
"<i>Or speak your heart
whenever we're alone</i>."

782
00:39:56,889 --> 00:40:01,389
"<i>No, don't tell me</i>."

783
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:07,120
"<i>It isn't fair</i>."

784
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:11,931
"<i>For I'm foolish</i>."

785
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:16,958
"<i>I'll start to care</i>."

786
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:23,537
"<i>Why are angels singing high above</i>?"

787
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:30,120
"<i>Oh don't tell me I'm</i> .."

788
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:34,725
"<i>In love</i> .."

789
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:48,450
She is very attractive.
─ Yes, she is.

790
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,404
She's better than that. She's "oomph".

791
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,649
Shush, darling.
You're attracting attention.

792
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,404
I think Kim, maybe we'd better ..

793
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:56,826
Hello Vic, my honey.
─ Hello, Jean.

794
00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:59,593
What are you drinking?
─ Why Vic, don't you remember?

795
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:02,785
Always straight Scotch,
right after my number.

796
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,922
This is Mrs Dorrance and Mrs Kimberly.
Miss Ogilvie.           ─ How do you do.

797
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:08,144
Mr Kimberly you've met.
─ Yes.         ─ How do you do.

798
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:10,444
One straight Scotch with a water chaser.
─ Yes, sir.

799
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,761
I enjoyed your song, Miss Ogilvie.
I really enjoyed it very much.

800
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,960
Why, thanks.

801
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,008
You know, I close here tomorrow night.
─ Then what?

802
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:20,590
Then I'm off to Hollywood.
They're giving me a screen-test.

803
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,704
Why, Hollywood? Why
aren't you on the radio?

804
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:25,190
Why isn't somebody as
terrific as her on the radio?

805
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,588
Just show me how.

806
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:29,525
It must be great fun being a singer.

807
00:41:30,164 --> 00:41:31,036
It's alright.

808
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:32,956
What do you do?
─ I ..?

809
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:36,357
Oh nothing.
─ She has two fine kids.

810
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:37,919
They'd keep anyone busy.

811
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,520
Oh, you're married!
Oh now, that's wonderful.

812
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:43,012
That's the racket to be in.
Marriage and kids.

813
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:45,459
You know, someday I'm going to
get married and have a dozen.

814
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,120
Please don't get married.

815
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,201
All that oomph ought
to stay in circulation.

816
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,911
I think it's time to go home now, Kim.
─ Well, I don't.

817
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:56,491
Why don't you be nice to Vicky-boy?

818
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,031
And other radio people. People
who will get you a radio spot.

819
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,440
If Vic can do me a favor,
I'm sure he will.

820
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:06,092
Wont you, honey?
─ I'll see what I can do.

821
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,603
Oh, they're calling me now. I have to
go back and do a number with the band.

822
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,729
I'll phone you.
─ When?          ─ Tomorrow.

823
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,376
Alright, goodnight.
─ Goodnight.

824
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:14,684
Goodnight everybody.

825
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:19,244
Now there is the kind of a girl
a man would like to get a job for.

826
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,780
If you know what I mean.

827
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,924
She's a great girl.

828
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:23,653
And a very good friend of mine.

829
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:25,801
Ah, friendship ..

830
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:28,688
Nobody is anybody's friend.
I haven't got any.

831
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:33,072
Kim has had one too many. He has
lots of fine friends. Lots of them.

832
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,273
Of course.

833
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:35,980
Sure. That's right, lover. Name one.

834
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:37,285
Name one.

835
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:39,684
Why Kim, there are hundreds.
─ Name one.

836
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,902
Well Kim, just at this moment, I ..

837
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:45,753
I know exactly how you feel,
Mrs Kimberly. I get the same way.

838
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,906
While one is accustomed ..
─ She can't name one.

839
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:49,327
Not one. You see, Vic?

840
00:42:49,577 --> 00:42:50,865
I don't see what it proves.

841
00:42:50,965 --> 00:42:53,067
I'm telling you how to be
a success in this business.

842
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:57,346
I started as a dumb kid out of Princeton
with maybe fifty bucks to my name.

843
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,610
An old friend of my father’s out
of the goodness of his heart ..

844
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,435
Gave me a job with his
advertizing agency.

845
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,439
Old Harley Adler.
You ever know him, Vic?

846
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,938
No, I never knew him.

847
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:10,602
Well he had a nice little agency, old
Harley Adler did. A nice little agency.

848
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:13,134
All based on the Beautee Soap
account. That's what he had.

849
00:43:13,234 --> 00:43:16,541
Excuse me Kim, they're playing a foxtrot.
It's the only thing I know how to dance.

850
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:18,195
Want to hear the rest of it?

851
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,116
You're the hostess, lover.
Make them sit down.

852
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:24,904
Want to hear the secret of my success?
You always ask to talk of my business.

853
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:28,064
Alright, Kim. What is it?
What <i>is</i> the secret of your success?

854
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:29,576
I've never told anybody.

855
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,504
Not even my psychoanalyst.

856
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:34,807
Old Harley Adler was doing fine.

857
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,588
Until he got involved in some tax
difficulty and bribed his way out of it.

858
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:42,363
But just somehow or other,
the FBI heard about it.

859
00:43:43,402 --> 00:43:45,710
They arrested old Harley Adler
and they carried him away.

860
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:48,295
Put him in a big, black jail.

861
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:51,875
People have always
wondered who told the FBI.

862
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:54,119
Because if somebody hadn't
have told the FBI ..

863
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:56,287
They wouldn't have carried
old Harley Adler away.

864
00:43:57,265 --> 00:44:00,456
And I wouldn't have had the Beautee Soap
account to start a business of my own.

865
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:03,200
Who could have told?

866
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,231
Who could have told?
Who could have told ..?

867
00:44:19,428 --> 00:44:20,214
Kay.

868
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,724
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:25,448
Don't be silly.

870
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:26,915
It was a very ..

871
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,453
Interesting evening. Thank you so much.

872
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:33,502
We must be sure to
exchange Christmas cards.

873
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:35,954
I beg your pardon?

874
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,398
You've never met people
like that, have you?

875
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:40,682
I'm glad I met them.

876
00:44:41,452 --> 00:44:43,811
They might be from Mars for
all they have to do with you.

877
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:46,842
That goes for me too, doesn't it.

878
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,923
I don't understand you, Vic.

879
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:54,845
Who are you? What are you?

880
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:56,727
It is very simple.

881
00:44:57,288 --> 00:44:59,558
I came from the middle-west,
a town called Ford Madison.

882
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,668
I went back once to bury my mother.

883
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:04,721
I have no roots, no past, no future.

884
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,699
But that goes for almost
all the people in my world.

885
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:09,857
I would say you had
a great deal of future.

886
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:13,073
Oh sure. A series of nightclubs
like the one we've just left.

887
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:16,332
Maybe someday, if I'm very lucky,
I'll have a life like Kimberly.

888
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,393
Even the house in Connecticut,
I'll never have time to visit.

889
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,597
Knowing you, you'll find time.
You are not like Kimberly.

890
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:25,895
No, I'm not.

891
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:29,869
We're almost there.

892
00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:33,851
Driver, it's just on the right.
Past that lamp-post.

893
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:38,466
Vic, thanks for everything.

894
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,812
A fascinating evening. That testimonial.

895
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,211
And the negligee business. Everything.

896
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:46,829
No. Please, please don't get out.

897
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:49,783
Kay.

898
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,576
Get back in the cab.

899
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,368
Get in, Kay.

900
00:46:10,913 --> 00:46:13,434
Driver. Go to the corner
of 54th and 2nd Avenue.

901
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:16,397
What's there?

902
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:18,924
A garage where they'll rent me a car.

903
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,696
Where are we going?

904
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:22,409
I don't know.

905
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:24,517
Out of the city.

906
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,590
Have you ever seen dawn from a beach?

907
00:46:28,337 --> 00:46:28,923
No.

908
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,664
We'll go out on Long Island.
Jones Beach.

909
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,199
Somewhere.

910
00:46:35,232 --> 00:46:36,006
Yes, Vic.

911
00:46:38,439 --> 00:46:39,546
You know, it's funny.

912
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:42,089
Every time I get all set to
give you a big sales talk.

913
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,424
You've already made
up your mind to give in.

914
00:46:44,942 --> 00:46:45,964
That testimonial.

915
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:47,853
Dinner tonight.
─ Yes.

916
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:49,423
Why?

917
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:52,753
I don't know. I really don't.

918
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:55,820
You frighten me a little, but ..

919
00:46:58,408 --> 00:47:02,664
It's funny that you of all people, would
think to go for a drive in the country.

920
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,011
Kay .. whatever there is between us.

921
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:09,940
It has nothing to do with the
advertizing business or New York.

922
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,312
Isn't that true?
─ Yes.

923
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:16,729
Vic, I want you to understand something.

924
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:19,025
It's just this.

925
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:21,766
I'm not an unhappy woman.

926
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,270
I like my life, my home and my children.

927
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:28,153
I'm not lonely.

928
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:31,219
It's the same with me.

929
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:33,792
I don't want anything from you.

930
00:47:34,844 --> 00:47:35,760
Except you.

931
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:53,333
Vic.

932
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:54,729
Hmm?

933
00:47:55,503 --> 00:47:57,164
You know, when I first met you.

934
00:47:57,643 --> 00:47:59,342
I wasn't sure I even liked you.

935
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:03,646
That seems so long ago.

936
00:48:08,658 --> 00:48:11,116
Oh, I didn't know
life could be like this.

937
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,433
I feel ten years old.

938
00:48:14,594 --> 00:48:16,298
I wish I had known you
when you were ten.

939
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:18,922
I was always too tall.

940
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,395
As a young girl I was taller
than most of the boys.

941
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:25,981
So I pretended to be critical of
them. I must have been hateful.

942
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,564
I know I was hateful. I was told.

943
00:48:29,122 --> 00:48:31,980
I was the biggest smart-alec that
ever whistled in front of a pool-room.

944
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,497
Darling, don't run yourself down.

945
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:36,210
Alright.

946
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:39,558
Kay, I was right wasn't I?
About coming out here?

947
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,330
You are, too.

948
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,646
There are too many things
in the way in a town.

949
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,504
Yes.

950
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:49,660
Kay.

951
00:48:51,245 --> 00:48:54,646
I know a pleasant little inn. Up on
the Connecticut coast near Clayport.

952
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:58,377
What?

953
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:00,757
It's called The Blue Penguin Inn.

954
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:08,129
Vic .. I like you.

955
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:11,095
I find you very ..

956
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:13,712
Well, I like you.

957
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:17,268
But if you think that means
I'd go off to a hotel with you ..

958
00:49:18,646 --> 00:49:21,164
Why .. it's just out of the question.

959
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:22,917
What?

960
00:49:24,312 --> 00:49:26,218
We must be talking
about different things.

961
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,107
You didn't think that was
a proposition, did you?

962
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:31,840
Yes .. yes, I did.

963
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:34,966
Well look honey, you got me all wrong.

964
00:49:35,399 --> 00:49:36,226
Oh look.

965
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:38,088
Look, here's my room over here.

966
00:49:38,486 --> 00:49:41,664
And then way over there on the other
side of the hotel, that's your room.

967
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,110
Why, I mean we might be on a
boat or a train or something.

968
00:49:44,636 --> 00:49:46,160
That wouldn't worry you, would it?

969
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:47,673
No.
─ Well then.

970
00:49:48,328 --> 00:49:50,020
Oh look honey, we'd have fun.

971
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:51,788
Do you like to sail?

972
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:53,181
Yes. Very much.

973
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:56,635
They have three of four of the neatest,
whitest little cat-boats you ever saw.

974
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:00,906
We'll have them put us up in a lodge,
get a boat, and hove for the open sound.

975
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,321
Oh, we can lie on the beach, go fishing.

976
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,246
Dine on the terrace by moonlight.

977
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,884
You know it.

978
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,318
We can watch the dawn
come up on the beach again.

979
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:11,357
All of that is for us.

980
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,200
That's for us, isn't it, Kay?

981
00:50:14,475 --> 00:50:16,342
Yes Vic, I guess that's for us.

982
00:50:17,513 --> 00:50:21,519
Look. The inn is only seven minutes
from Clayport Station by taxi.

983
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:22,973
You ask for me at the desk.

984
00:50:23,073 --> 00:50:25,779
But why say that now? Are you
going to leave me to walk home?

985
00:50:26,044 --> 00:50:28,136
No. But I'm not going
to mention it again.

986
00:50:29,246 --> 00:50:30,891
It's five o'clock on a Saturday morning.

987
00:50:31,524 --> 00:50:32,883
I'm leaving right after lunch.

988
00:50:32,983 --> 00:50:35,028
There is a later train that
gets to Clayport at four.

989
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,575
You? You'll come or you'll not come.

990
00:50:38,053 --> 00:50:40,903
I'm not going to phone you, I'm not going
to huckster you into coming out there.

991
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:44,505
But all day long, I'll be using
a little huckster telepathy.

992
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:46,571
I'll be saying to myself.

993
00:50:46,986 --> 00:50:49,640
Kay .. please come to
The Blue Penguin Inn.

994
00:50:52,062 --> 00:50:55,208
I don't think I'm going to be much use
to the Kimberly Advertizing Agency.

995
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,400
My mind won't be on soap.

996
00:51:04,392 --> 00:51:06,845
Get me The Blue Penguin Inn,
Clayport, Connecticut.

997
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:09,573
That's right, Blue Penguin Inn.

998
00:51:17,938 --> 00:51:20,759
Oh Mr Norman, it's 10:31.
I'm awfully sorry.

999
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,747
What is so upsetting about 10:31?

1000
00:51:24,573 --> 00:51:27,204
Mr Cooke said that while he was away
you were to handle all his business.

1001
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:28,912

Miss Hammer. Take a memorandum.

00:52:12,636 --> 00:52:14,242
Mr Kimberly. Dear Kim.

1017
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:18,212

listening to the radio much.

Kim.

1020

In that time, it's gotten worse.

1021
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,612
If possible .. more irritating.

1022
00:52:27,988 --> 00:52:29,654
More commercials per minute.

1023
00:52:30,177 --> 00:52:33,932

Paragraph.

1025

I know how tough Evans is and ..

1026
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:40,926
Some of the other sponsors.

1027
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:44,365
But I think we make a great mistake
in letting them have their own way.

1028
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:46,473
We're paid to advise them.

1029
00:52:47,227 --> 00:52:48,503
Why can't we advise them ..

1030
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:51,402
That people are grateful for what free
entertainment they get on the air.

1031
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:55,190
Grateful enough to buy the
product that provides good shows.

But.

1033

They have some rights, Kim.
It is <i>their </i>homes we go into.

1034
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:03,684
They're not grateful to people
who get one foot in the door ..

1035
00:53:03,784 --> 00:53:05,742
By pretending to offer
them music and drama ..

1036
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:08,409
And then take too much
time in corny sales talk.

I want to go on record as saying that I
think radio has to turn over a new leaf.

1039
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:16,677
We've pushed and badgered the listeners.

1040

We've sung to them and screamed at them.

We've insulted them, cheated
them and angered them.

Someday, 50 million people are going to
reach out and turn off their radios.

Sir.

1054
00:53:47,242 --> 00:53:48,858
What's the matter? You think I'm wrong?

1055
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:50,446
I wouldn't say.

1056
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:52,229
Do you ever listen to the radio?

1057
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,933
Yes, sir.
─ And?

1058
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:56,339
Well, I'd get back at it.

00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,496
How?

1060
00:53:58,547 --> 00:53:59,948
It may sound silly, but ..

1061
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,100
I make it a point of honor.

1062
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:06,226
A point of honor <i>never</i> to buy
anything that's advertized that way.

00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,128
Hello?

1067
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,170
Oh hello. Blue Penguin Inn?

1068
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:22,968
Is Mrs Michaels there?

1069
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,193
Mrs Michaels, the owner.

1070
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:27,974
She's not here anymore.
My name is Blake. I'm the new owner.

1071
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:29,580
What is it you want?

1072
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:33,317
I always used to have the same rooms
in the back of the second floor.

1073
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,496
Number 4.

1074
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:35,980
And then number 37.

1075
00:54:37,252 --> 00:54:40,330
Way over on the other side.
Yeah. I'd like them for the weekend.

1076
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:43,044
Yes, it will cost you 20 dollars
a night for them two layouts.

1077
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,589
Yeah. Well, how do I know you'll come?

1078
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:48,520
People call up, reserve rooms ..

1079
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,186
And then they have a fight or
something and I'm left holding the bag.

1080
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:53,051
I'll be there. No later than three.

1081
00:54:53,445 --> 00:54:54,518
Yes. This afternoon.

1082
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:57,885
Now, sir. About the new
testimonial campaign.

1083
00:54:58,112 --> 00:54:59,843
Right now, I'm going
away for the weekend.

1084
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:00,657
Now?

1085
00:55:01,613 --> 00:55:04,208
Well if anything comes up, I'll call
you at The Blue Penguin Inn.

00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:06,204
You do and I'll cut off your ears.

1087
00:55:06,478 --> 00:55:08,884
Where you're concerned, you never
heard of The Blue Penguin Inn.

1088
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:10,403
Is that clear?
─ Yes, sir.

1089
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:13,183
Yes, sir. I never heard of
The Blue Penguin Inn.

1090
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:15,383
Clayport 42499.

1091
00:55:15,627 --> 00:55:16,728
Goodbye, Miss Hammer.

1092
00:55:16,828 --> 00:55:18,819
Goodbye, Mr Norman. Have a nice weekend.

1093
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:20,553
Wherever you're going.

1094
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:31,322
Four years since you've been here, huh?

1095
00:55:32,974 --> 00:55:34,073
A long time.

1096
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:38,373
I knew I hadn't seen you with
the regular weekend crowd.

1097
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:56,491
Alright, so we don't keep it so good.

1098
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,731
How about sending up a
boy with a new chair?

1099
00:55:59,831 --> 00:56:02,413
Mister, we got one boy
and he keeps busy.

1100
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:10,614
Alright. Let’s have a look at 37.
See if it's any better.

1101
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:13,037
Room 37 is rented.

1102
00:56:13,322 --> 00:56:15,538
Couldn't hold it for you.
But I got this one for you.

1103
00:56:16,517 --> 00:56:17,132
Six.

1104
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:18,998
It's nicer.

1105
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:20,886
Well, here you are.

1106
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,205
How is this one?

1107
00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:28,280
I asked you for 4 and 37. Why
didn't you save them for me?

1108
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:31,262
What are you, a numerologist?
What difference does it make?

1109
00:56:31,618 --> 00:56:32,948
This is the best room we got.

1110
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,560
And these connect,
right through that door.

1111
00:56:36,276 --> 00:56:36,901
No.

1112
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:38,208
No?

1113
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:41,963
Well, alright.

1114
00:56:44,537 --> 00:56:48,042
Maybe if you ask real nice, the folks in
37 would be willing to change with you.

1115
00:56:48,437 --> 00:56:49,980
If .. if it matters to you.

1116
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:51,515
No, no. It's alright. Here.

1117
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,364
Here's five dollars. How about
some flowers for the rooms?

1118
00:56:54,638 --> 00:56:55,396
Oh, sure.

1119
00:56:55,922 --> 00:56:58,126
Plenty in the garden.
All you got to do is pick them.

1120
00:57:04,956 --> 00:57:06,683
The Blue Penguin Inn, please.

1121
00:57:07,479 --> 00:57:09,015
Did you say "The Blue Penguin Inn"?

1122
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:10,680
Yes, do you know where it is?

1123
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,249
Oh sure, I know where it is.

1124
00:57:12,949 --> 00:57:14,079
It's out on the point.

1125
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:21,648
It's none of my business but maybe
you're one of the old crowd.

1126
00:57:22,034 --> 00:57:24,198
Did you used to go there
when Mrs Michaels ran it?

1127
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:25,087
No.

1128
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:26,476
Okay.

1129
00:57:26,832 --> 00:57:29,682
So, I shut my mouth and I take
you to The Blue Penguin Inn.

1130
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:01,737
Hey, lady.

1131
00:58:02,505 --> 00:58:03,181
Look.

1132
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:04,581
Over there.

1133
00:58:05,234 --> 00:58:06,723
That's The Blue Penguin Inn.

1134
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:09,256
Why, it looks charming.

1135
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:11,878
Yeah .. yeah.

1136
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:33,559
Hello. Here is the bellboy.

1137
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:35,226
Hasn't anyone been asking for me?

1138
00:58:35,326 --> 00:58:36,683
"A Mrs Dorrance?"

1139
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,429
Nope. Nobody come in yet.

1140
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:40,822
Alright. Thank you.

1141
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:03,905
Hey hey, don't bang it so hard.

1142
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:07,022
Let him play, let him play.
It's his funeral, ain't it.

1143
00:59:07,285 --> 00:59:09,390
Hey look! Ten, twelve ..

1144
00:59:10,103 --> 00:59:11,297
Fifteen.

1145
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:15,687
Excuse me.
─ Twenty-one thousand.

1146
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:17,041
Well, how about it?

1147
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:19,872
I still say you hadn't ought to
bang it so hard. You'll wear it out.

1148
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:22,631
Alright. Me now, huh.
─ Just a minute, just a minute.

1149
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:24,516
Yeah?

1150
00:59:28,387 --> 00:59:31,240
Is there something I can do for you?
─ I'm looking for a Mr Norman.

1151
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:33,051
Oh, you're Mrs Dorrance?

1152
00:59:33,635 --> 00:59:34,250
Yes.

1153
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:35,645
Right this way, please.

1154
01:00:14,288 --> 01:00:15,561
If you need anything, call.

1155
01:00:16,643 --> 01:00:17,296
Oh ..

1156
01:00:18,558 --> 01:00:20,056
This here connects with room 4.

1157
01:00:20,269 --> 01:00:21,485
You want me to unlock it?

1158
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:23,524
Room 4?

1159
01:00:23,847 --> 01:00:25,331
Yeah. Mr Norman's room.

1160
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,308
Oh.

1161
01:00:31,635 --> 01:00:33,064
I see. Thank you.

1162
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:39,363
Hey.

1163
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:01,458
[ Telephone ]

1164
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:05,866
[ Telephone ]

1165
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,070
[ Telephone ]

1166
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,383
Hello?

1167
01:01:15,483 --> 01:01:18,217
Mr Norman, I'm so sorry
but they made me.

1168
01:01:18,555 --> 01:01:21,936
They said they'd fire me if I didn't
call you. Mr Kimberly himself phoned.

1169
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:23,961
Why did they put you to the torture?

1170
01:01:24,165 --> 01:01:25,624
It's something about Mr Evans.

1171
01:01:25,872 --> 01:01:27,201
It's something critical.

1172
01:01:27,825 --> 01:01:30,118
There is to be a big meeting
about it in Mr Evans' office.

1173
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:31,567
Tomorrow morning at 11.

1174
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:33,313
But tomorrow is Sunday.

1175
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:35,286
Oh well, alright.

1176
01:01:36,047 --> 01:01:37,950
They'll miss me in the
choir, but I'll be there.

1177
01:01:39,336 --> 01:01:40,065
Goodbye.

1178
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:06,966
Well, you sure cut things thin.

1179
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,081
11 o'clock means 11 o'clock.

1180
01:02:09,276 --> 01:02:11,409
I know. But I hoped to go
over some things with you.

1181
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:13,026
What?
─ Well, the first thing ..

1182
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:16,500
The last time I noticed you neglected
to answer Evans' rhetorical questions.

1183
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:18,527
I mean those "rights" and "checks".

1184
01:02:18,627 --> 01:02:20,934
I know it seems childish, but he
likes to have them answered.

1185
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:22,941
Anyway, it doesn't cost anything.

1186
01:02:23,925 --> 01:02:25,051
Incidentally, Vic.

1187
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:27,664
I'm sorry about the way I
behaved the other night.

1188
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:29,065
Oh, forget it.

1189
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:30,716
In front of Mrs Dorrance and all.

1190
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:32,858
She's quite a lady, Vic.

1191
01:02:33,398 --> 01:02:35,002
Who?
─ Mrs Dorrance.

1192
01:02:37,746 --> 01:02:39,083
Oh .. her.

1193
01:02:39,398 --> 01:02:40,642
Now, about today's crisis.

1194
01:02:41,043 --> 01:02:44,030
Yesterday, the old man heard a comedian
named Buddy Hare, do a guest appearance.

1195
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:46,741
He was on some program which originated
in Hollywood. Do you know him?

1196
01:02:48,366 --> 01:02:50,138
Sure. An ex-burlesque comedian.

1197
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:51,740
He does comedy bits and B movies.

1198
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,939
But the old man is nuts about him. He
talks about writing a new show for him.

1199
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:58,143
Yeah, I see .. you want a rough
estimate of our chances?

1200
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,505
Go ahead.
─ Well.

1201
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,640
Get the biggest Hollywood
stars you can to support him.

1202
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,237
Buy the most expensive time
available on a big network.

1203
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:08,105
Hire America's top-name
band, get the best writers.

1204
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:10,048
And you've probably got a flop.

1205
01:03:10,236 --> 01:03:11,383
Fine, fine.

1206
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:14,379
And if we refuse to do the job,
Evans will get another agency.

1207
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:18,009
If we do the job and flunk, he'll hold
us responsible and get another agency.

1208
01:03:18,787 --> 01:03:20,047
Happy Sabbath, friend.

1209
01:03:22,327 --> 01:03:23,314
Here is Mr Evans.

1210
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:30,253
Sit.

1211
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:40,588
Due to the fact that nobody but me does
any talent scouting for this company.

1212
01:03:40,855 --> 01:03:42,412
I am forced to work on Sunday.

1213
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:46,215
We'll let that pass, at this moment.

1214
01:03:46,878 --> 01:03:48,198
I think Buddy Hare is great.

1215
01:03:49,009 --> 01:03:51,449
A sort-of Bob Hope and Jack Benny
combined in one. Check?

1216
01:03:51,717 --> 01:03:52,853
Check.
─ Check.

1217
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,420
Mr Norman.

1218
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,840
You'd better make him pretty good.

1219
01:04:00,023 --> 01:04:01,044
Well, he is.

1220
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,561
And it seems to me we ought
to give the compass a whirl.

1221
01:04:05,026 --> 01:04:08,626
And see if this chap Buddy Hare
is headed in our direction.

1222
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:12,417
I don't want you fellows
to miss the last bus.

1223
01:04:14,425 --> 01:04:16,369
Let's not be like straws in the wind.

1224
01:04:18,034 --> 01:04:18,992
See what I mean?

1225
01:04:23,508 --> 01:04:26,155
Now you're in at the
beginning of this, Mr Norman.

1226
01:04:27,143 --> 01:04:31,470
I shall expect you to carry the ball
right down the field for a touchdown.

1227
01:04:32,529 --> 01:04:33,573
It's your baby now.

1228
01:04:34,844 --> 01:04:38,792
Well sir, I don't mean to forget
that you thought of using Hare.

1229
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:41,539
I wouldn't want any
credit I didn't deserve.

1230
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,769
Let's get this clear, Mr Norman.

1231
01:04:46,828 --> 01:04:50,762
You fellows at the agency are just as
enthusiastic about him as I am. Right?

1232
01:04:51,156 --> 01:04:51,828
Right.

1233
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:56,090
I therefore consider that you,
representing the agency ..

1234
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:59,525
Recommend him just as
much as I do. Check?

1235
01:04:59,822 --> 01:05:00,494
Check.

1236
01:05:02,878 --> 01:05:06,785
Now, Mr Norman is new here. I'd like
to talk to him alone for a few minutes.

1237
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:22,755
Mr Buddy Hare.

1238
01:05:25,657 --> 01:05:29,633
While you and Kimberly were
enjoying your holiday yesterday.

1239
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:33,930
I had my personal staff
gather a little information.

1240
01:05:34,921 --> 01:05:39,101
It seems that his agent is a
Mr David Lash from Hollywood.

1241
01:05:41,335 --> 01:05:43,109
I know Dave.
─ Do you?

1242
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:45,912
Did you know Mr Lash was in New York?

1243
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:47,394
No.

1244
01:05:47,972 --> 01:05:50,474
I took the trouble to discover that.

1245
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:54,971
Mr Norman, it has been my experience.

1246
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,695
That somehow or other, whenever I want
a man like Buddy Hare the price goes up.

1247
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:01,215
I don't like that.

1248
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:02,808
I understand.

1249
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:07,429
Mr David Lash has reservations
to go back to Hollywood ..

1250
01:06:07,747 --> 01:06:09,627
Today on the Centurion Chief.

1251
01:06:10,576 --> 01:06:14,541
I'll be aboard and set the deal before he
has a chance to hear you want Buddy Hare.

1252
01:06:15,345 --> 01:06:16,132
Excellent.

1253
01:06:17,043 --> 01:06:18,654
Now, one other point of business.

1254
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:22,597
Last night a change in the commercial
was <i>not </i>teletyped to the coast.

1255
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:27,679
I am told that the tele-typist
in your office was at fault.

1256
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:29,599
Fire her.

1257
01:06:34,826 --> 01:06:35,887
She's a nice girl.

1258
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:37,558
Doesn't make many mistakes.

1259
01:06:38,545 --> 01:06:39,932
I can't fire her just for that.

1260
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:44,374
What's her name?

1261
01:06:47,288 --> 01:06:49,054
I don't think I'll tell you, Mr Evans.

1262
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:59,294
No doubt Mr Norman,
you have your good reasons.

1263
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:02,377
For treating me in
this cavalier fashion.

1264
01:07:08,773 --> 01:07:11,234
You've only a few hours in
which to catch your train.

1265
01:07:13,605 --> 01:07:16,923
I can only say that if you want
a permanent job with me.

1266
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:19,622
You'd better come back from Hollywood ..

1267
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,608
With Buddy Hare and
a very funny radio show.

1268
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,000
Very funny.

1269
01:07:37,784 --> 01:07:39,229
Very funny.

1270
01:07:41,643 --> 01:07:43,828
Driver .. we've got a few
minutes before train time.

1271
01:07:44,282 --> 01:07:45,755
Let's go over toward Sutton Place.

1272
01:07:45,972 --> 01:07:47,711
22 Barton Lane.
─ Yes, sir.

1273
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:52,775
Yes, sir?
─ Mr Norman to see Mrs Dorrance.

1274
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:55,248
I'll call her.
─ It's important. I haven't much time.

1275
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:10,290
Good afternoon, Vic.

1276
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:14,979
You <i>would</i> have a gardener.

1277
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:17,827
It's a very small garden.
Does that make it any better?

1278
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,623
I don't know why I
bother to see you at all.

1279
01:08:24,984 --> 01:08:26,900
Except that I'm not
used to being stood up.

1280
01:08:28,836 --> 01:08:30,860
It gets me sore. Very sore.

1281
01:08:33,074 --> 01:08:34,032
I'm sorry.

1282
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,278
Cigarette?

1283
01:08:50,116 --> 01:08:51,837
What gets me is, you didn't trust me.

1284
01:08:52,681 --> 01:08:55,857
You didn't trust me to come up there and
see yourself that it was on the level.

1285
01:08:57,502 --> 01:08:58,773
Was it on the level, Vic?

1286
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:05,832
No .. no, it wasn't.

1287
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:10,795
Rooms 4 and 6. Connecting door.

1288
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:14,711
You didn't even bother with
appearances, did you.

1289
01:09:15,506 --> 01:09:16,836
It was all pretty obvious.

1290
01:09:18,912 --> 01:09:21,138
You may not believe it,
but I didn't plan it that way.

1291
01:09:22,331 --> 01:09:24,138
I admit that once it had happened, I ..

1292
01:09:25,801 --> 01:09:27,442
Well, I figured it might be convenient.

1293
01:09:29,278 --> 01:09:31,635
You'll say anything to win
your point, won't you.

1294
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,212
Make any promise.

1295
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:35,285
That's the kind of a guy I am.

1296
01:09:35,895 --> 01:09:37,324
I haven't kidded you about that.

1297
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:42,362
Well, I didn't believe you.

1298
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,385
I thought you were more than that.

1299
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:47,095
Now you know.
─ Now I know.

1300
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:52,320
And I guess it's like I
told you once before.

1301
01:09:52,892 --> 01:09:54,862
We must be sure and
exchange Christmas cards.

1302
01:09:56,139 --> 01:09:58,070
We're just different kinds
of people, that's all.

1303
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:03,018
I can't change, Vic.
─ Neither can I.

1304
01:10:04,106 --> 01:10:06,161
If we forgot this, it would
just be a little while ..

1305
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:09,427
Until I'd be inviting you to a Blue
Penguin Inn again someplace.

1306
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:14,118
And I'd do that same
thing I did yesterday.

1307
01:10:19,068 --> 01:10:21,171
I'm going to Hollywood.
I'm on my way to the train now.

1308
01:10:23,296 --> 01:10:23,909
Oh.

1309
01:10:24,703 --> 01:10:25,579
For how long?

1310
01:10:26,728 --> 01:10:27,629
A week or two.

1311
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:34,141
Have a nice trip, Vic.

1312
01:10:39,432 --> 01:10:40,304
Goodbye, Kay.

1313
01:10:56,959 --> 01:10:58,575
Well, he's my agent and he should know.

1314
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:01,277
He said, listen honey, a girl's got
to have at least one mink coat ..

1315
01:11:01,377 --> 01:11:04,018
Or she won't have any respect in
Hollywood. So, I took the coat.

1316
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:06,184
Jean!

1317
01:11:07,547 --> 01:11:10,476
I don't believe it. Vic! Vic, baby.

1318
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:11,685
Hello, honey.

1319
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:14,496
I thought you were already out there.
─ I'm glad I'm not.

1320
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:16,321
Oh, so am I.

1321
01:11:17,017 --> 01:11:19,213
Oh Jean, you look good. Awful good.

1322
01:11:19,618 --> 01:11:21,463
Have you gotten prettier
since I last saw you?

1323
01:11:21,654 --> 01:11:23,478
I don't know. Does it
seem that way to you?

1324
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:25,478
Luscious-er and luscious-er.

1325
01:11:25,705 --> 01:11:27,975
Oh that's good, huh?
─ That's very good.

1326
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:29,594
How'd you find me?

1327
01:11:29,694 --> 01:11:32,291
Were you going through the cars
shopping to see what you could pick up?

1328
01:11:32,391 --> 01:11:34,150
Believe it or not,
I was looking for a man.

1329
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,037
Dave Lash.

1330
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:38,557
Oh the agent. He's up in the Club Car.
Or at least he was a few minutes ago.

1331
01:11:39,277 --> 01:11:40,407
Club Car?
─ Club Car.

1332
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:43,366
Wait a minute.

1333
01:11:44,177 --> 01:11:46,231
I see him down there.
There is only one thing.

1334
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:48,707
When there's a break in the
conversation, mention Buddy Hare.

1335
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:50,632
Mention him good, or mention him bad?

1336
01:11:50,827 --> 01:11:53,140
Bad. You hate him as bad as
if he were another singer.

1337
01:11:53,552 --> 01:11:54,310
I get it.

1338
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,567
Hello Dave.
─ Oh, hello Vic.

1339
01:12:02,844 --> 01:12:05,608
Jean Ogilvie. Well well.
Sit down, won't you.

1340
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:08,001
You two know my new assistant.
Freddy Callahan.

1341
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:09,885
How do you do.
─ Have something to drink?

1342
01:12:09,985 --> 01:12:12,218
It seems like we always meet
on planes or trains, Dave.

1343
01:12:12,445 --> 01:12:15,114
Yeah. I haven't seen you since
before you went into the Army.

1344
01:12:15,355 --> 01:12:16,456
Glad to see you back.

1345
01:12:16,994 --> 01:12:18,831
<i>There's</i> a smart operator, Freddy.

1346
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:20,838
I'm trying to teach Freddy the business.

1347
01:12:20,954 --> 01:12:23,228
So far all he's taught me is how
to lose to him at Gin Rummy.

1348
01:12:23,781 --> 01:12:24,854
What's cooking, Vic?

1349
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:26,716
Why are you on the way to the coast?

1350
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,508
Oh, the scenery.

1351
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,531
Take a look. Isn't the Hudson beautiful?

1352
01:12:30,906 --> 01:12:32,394
Yeah, lovely. Lovely isn't it.

1353
01:12:33,054 --> 01:12:34,469
That's typical .. of all of us.

1354
01:12:35,196 --> 01:12:36,326
What's American to us?

1355
01:12:36,616 --> 01:12:39,270
A blank space between New York and
Hollywood where people buy soap.

1356
01:12:39,724 --> 01:12:41,527
That Freddy, is lesson number one.

1357
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:44,954
When a guy like Vic won't tell an agent
why he's on his way to the coast.

1358
01:12:45,284 --> 01:12:47,201
It means that he intends
to buy some talent.

1359
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:50,453
And he's afraid we're going to raise
the price on him. Isn't that right, Vic?

1360
01:12:50,553 --> 01:12:51,674
You are the teacher.

1361
01:12:51,774 --> 01:12:54,571
Whoever you'll buy, you may just as
well buy him from us.            ─ Why?

1362
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:56,488
We handle everybody. Everybody good.

1363
01:12:56,588 --> 01:12:57,615
The boy is right.

1364
01:12:57,835 --> 01:12:58,763
You know what?

1365
01:12:58,863 --> 01:13:00,711
People are beginning
to say I'm a monopoly.

1366
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,157
Hmm. You even handle me.

1367
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,333
Since when, Jean?
─ Oh, a couple of months ago.

1368
01:13:04,535 --> 01:13:06,378
Your office is getting
a screen-test for me.

1369
01:13:06,676 --> 01:13:09,706
There you are, Vic. Nothing but
the best. That's Lash Incorporated.

1370
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,109
Oh don't give me that.
You'll handle anybody.

1371
01:13:12,665 --> 01:13:14,484
Why I hear you even handle Buddy Hare.

1372
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:15,805
That's right.

1373
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,580
What are we doing with him?
─ Trying to get him a radio show.

1374
01:13:18,997 --> 01:13:21,738
Boy, this is where I turn in my
radio for a vacuum cleaner.

1375
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:24,089
No Jean, I think you're too hard on him.

1376
01:13:24,265 --> 01:13:26,202
Buddy isn't that bad.
Not nearly that bad.

1377
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:29,487
And between us, she's right. You know
Dave, we ought to get rid of that guy.

1378
01:13:29,587 --> 01:13:31,471
We get him any work
since he's been with us?

1379
01:13:31,571 --> 01:13:33,684
One guest spot.
─ Oh, that's not enough.

1380
01:13:33,857 --> 01:13:36,222
When we've gotten him a good
job and he's eating regular.

1381
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,265
Then we'll drop him. Not until.

1382
01:13:38,365 --> 01:13:40,047
Jean, let's go to Marvin in the diner.

1383
01:13:40,147 --> 01:13:42,426
Wait a minute. You haven't told
me who you're buying from us.

1384
01:13:42,526 --> 01:13:44,665
So far you haven't mentioned
anybody but Buddy Hare.

1385
01:13:44,765 --> 01:13:47,040
And I'm not going to buy him
just to get Dave off the hook.

1386
01:13:47,653 --> 01:13:49,139
We'll see you around.
─ Goodbye.

1387
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,285
See you later.

1388
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:52,823
Dave.

1389
01:13:54,758 --> 01:13:56,877
You've never seen me sell, have you?
─ No, I haven't.

1390
01:13:57,048 --> 01:13:59,522
Well before I got to the back of
a desk I used to be pretty good.

1391
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,651
I know that.

1392
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:02,421
That Vic is a smart boy.

1393
01:14:02,796 --> 01:14:04,043
And Buddy Hare is a lemon.

1394
01:14:04,143 --> 01:14:06,375
But I'll bet you five bucks
I sell Buddy Hare to Vic.

1395
01:14:07,628 --> 01:14:09,119
I'll take that bet.
─ Sucker.

1396
01:14:11,854 --> 01:14:14,481
Mr David Lash, David Lash.
Telegram for Mr David Lash.

1397
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:15,402
Here.

1398
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:18,846
Mr Lash?

1399
01:14:18,948 --> 01:14:21,057
No, but I'm traveling with him.
I'll take it for him.

1400
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:22,125
Sign there, sir.

1401
01:14:23,552 --> 01:14:26,183
You wouldn't want to take one for a
Mr Valentine too, would you, sir?

1402
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:27,890
No, I'm afraid not.

1403
01:14:28,324 --> 01:14:29,254
Thank you, sir.

1404
01:14:33,565 --> 01:14:36,723
You know, this brings up an interesting
question of comparative morals.

1405
01:14:37,526 --> 01:14:38,690
To deliver this or not?

1406
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:42,501
You mean someone might be telegraphing
him that you really <i>want</i> Buddy Hare?

1407
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,923
Exactly.

1408
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:46,871
You know, when I was
a little girl in Brooklyn.

1409
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,864
We had a party-line phone.

1410
01:14:52,123 --> 01:14:55,724
It seems that a racehorse named
Honey Lamb paid nine dollars for two.

1411
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,410
Thanks, Jean.
─ I enjoyed it.

1412
01:14:59,701 --> 01:15:01,918
You could be a lot of help to
a girl like me, couldn't you.

1413
01:15:02,525 --> 01:15:03,369
In what way?

1414
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,439
In a business way, naturally.

1415
01:15:06,258 --> 01:15:07,632
Want a secretary, Mr Norman?

1416
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,023
How's your shorthand?
─ Some people like it.

1417
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:13,096
I'll bet you were a tough little girl.

1418
01:15:13,304 --> 01:15:14,851
I still am, for the wrong guy.

1419
01:15:15,935 --> 01:15:17,071
And for the right guy?

1420
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:18,599
For the right guy.

1421
01:15:19,372 --> 01:15:21,248
For the right guy Vic, I'm not so tough.

1422
01:15:24,883 --> 01:15:27,481
You know, I never much
liked train trips before, but ..

1423
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:29,773
This one is going to be just dandy.

1424
01:15:30,219 --> 01:15:30,988
Isn't it?

1425
01:15:31,546 --> 01:15:32,418
I don't know.

1426
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,540
What do you mean, you don't know?

1427
01:15:35,806 --> 01:15:39,077
You're .. you're trying awfully hard to
sell yourself on me, aren't you, Vic.

1428
01:15:40,201 --> 01:15:42,043
What are you talking about?
─ I know you.

1429
01:15:42,434 --> 01:15:43,902
I know you like a book, honey.

1430
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:47,626
You're on the rebound aren't you,
from that Mrs Dorrance?

1431
01:15:48,308 --> 01:15:50,743
I haven't got anybody
on my mind but you.

1432
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,892
Maybe you'll convince me of that.

1433
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:55,769
That's all I ask, Vic.

1434
01:15:56,633 --> 01:15:59,831
Just make me believe that and
everything else will be just dandy.

1435
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,179
America's first hucksters.

1436
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:21,016
Mister, you like to buy Indian suit?

1437
01:16:21,414 --> 01:16:22,372
Never wear them.

1438
01:16:22,488 --> 01:16:23,689
No. Children's suit.

1439
01:16:24,267 --> 01:16:25,569
Your Missy not got children?

1440
01:16:26,118 --> 01:16:27,448
Want to make something of it?

1441
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,755
Mister. Maybe you know some children?

1442
01:16:30,124 --> 01:16:31,569
Little boy, little girl children.

1443
01:16:34,242 --> 01:16:35,431
No, no. I guess not.

1444
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:38,468
Oh yes, come to think of it. Mister does
know a little girl and a little boy.

1445
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:41,841
I'd almost forgotten about
Mister and his love for children.

1446
01:16:42,868 --> 01:16:45,040
Special price.
Ten dollars with full feathers.

1447
01:16:47,883 --> 01:16:50,358
Come on, honey. Let's take a walk.
─ No. I'll go buy some magazines.

1448
01:16:50,576 --> 01:16:52,811
I'd hate to come between two
kids and their Indian suits.

1449
01:16:54,707 --> 01:16:56,129
All aboard!

1450
01:16:57,931 --> 01:16:58,625
Three.

1451
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,018
Well, you got me with ten.
That's the game.

1452
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:06,295
Well, I think I'll go to bed. I want to
be fresh when I get in in the morning.

1453
01:17:06,395 --> 01:17:08,316
Yeah, one more game
and I'll throw you all out.

1454
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:11,773
Vic, I wish you'd give more thought to
Buddy Hare. Then I'll drop the subject.

1455
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:15,490
Dave, I told you once. I don't think
Buddy Hare has a change of the big time.

1456
01:17:15,738 --> 01:17:18,027
Anybody can put on a good
show with a good comedian.

1457
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:19,694
Why don't you do it the hard way?

1458
01:17:19,933 --> 01:17:21,582
Oh no. I'm an easy-way boy.

1459
01:17:21,994 --> 01:17:23,834
I'd make my living
lying down if I could.

1460
01:17:24,262 --> 01:17:25,535
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1461
01:17:26,037 --> 01:17:27,832
I'll give him to you
at his bottom salary.

1462
01:17:28,723 --> 01:17:30,454
Put him in a cheap
show with good writing.

1463
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:31,849
Why don't you try it?

1464
01:17:31,949 --> 01:17:33,489
Well Dave, I'll tell you.
─ Yes?

1465
01:17:34,313 --> 01:17:36,498
You convince me. I'll buy Buddy Hare.
─ You'll what?

1466
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:38,926
On condition that you give me
an option letter right now.

1467
01:17:39,026 --> 01:17:41,654
We'll write it out ourselves. I don't
want lawyers complicating things.

1468
01:17:41,754 --> 01:17:44,097
Anything you say.
─ Deal?              ─ It's a deal.

1469
01:17:46,132 --> 01:17:47,834
Well, kid.
─ I don't know how you did it.

1470
01:17:48,237 --> 01:17:49,424
I'm going to frame this.

1471
01:17:49,844 --> 01:17:52,080
It proves that my hand
hasn't lost its skill.

1472
01:17:52,538 --> 01:17:54,320
I sold the biggest lemon in our stable.

1473
01:17:54,693 --> 01:17:57,357
I sold Buddy Hare to a
smart guy like Vic Norman.

1474
01:17:57,844 --> 01:18:00,199
How's that for salesmanship?
─ Oh, it’s fine. Just fine.

1475
01:18:00,492 --> 01:18:01,822
Only one thing is ..
─ What?

1476
01:18:02,089 --> 01:18:03,276
Can I tell him now, Vic?

1477
01:18:03,576 --> 01:18:05,049
He's bound to hear in the morning.

1478
01:18:07,352 --> 01:18:08,639
Well, that lemon of yours.

1479
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:12,151
That's the man that Vic was sent out
here to buy. For Evan Llewellyn Evans.

1480
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:18,689
Well you're a smart businessman, Vic.

1481
01:18:18,888 --> 01:18:19,968
You're a good sport.

1482
01:18:20,068 --> 01:18:21,903
And Freddy, here is
your five dollars back.

1483
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,883
And there is mine. Because I
didn't sell anything. I was had.

1484
01:18:25,277 --> 01:18:27,140
You can keep a secret, can't you?
─ Oh, sure.

1485
01:18:27,356 --> 01:18:29,459
You do and I have an idea
you'll have a rise in salary.

1486
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,668
Hey, I'm beginning to
like this business.

1487
01:18:37,374 --> 01:18:38,335
[ Buzzer ]

1488
01:18:42,748 --> 01:18:43,701
[ Buzzer ]

1489
01:18:48,759 --> 01:18:49,900
[ Buzzer ]

1490
01:18:58,587 --> 01:19:00,205
Who is it?
─ Freddy. Freddy Callahan.

1491
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:01,657
I got Buddy Hare with me.

1492
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:04,402
Morning Vic, old man. Well, here he is.

1493
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,430
Buddy Hare!

1494
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:06,989
Hiya, chum.

1495
01:19:07,422 --> 01:19:08,498
Just call me Buddy.

1496
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:11,750
Hiya. Most folks call me Vic.
You can call me Victor.

1497
01:19:11,938 --> 01:19:13,883
Oh the boy is sharp and fast.

1498
01:19:14,602 --> 01:19:17,460
Buddy's all excited about the show. He's
got a lot of good ideas for you. Really.

1499
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,332
Yeah, I got material that will lay them
in the aisles. It will fracture them.

1500
01:19:20,432 --> 01:19:22,227
Don't worry about a thing. Not a thing.

1501
01:19:22,327 --> 01:19:24,475
Right now I'm getting cleaned up.
So if you'll just ..

1502
01:19:24,575 --> 01:19:25,726
[ Buzzer ]

1503
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:28,326
Somebody send for a
couple of hot writers?

1504
01:19:28,426 --> 01:19:30,463
Herman and Gaver.
Scripts made while you wait.

1505
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:32,478
How is Norman, the white
hope of radio and ..

1506
01:19:32,578 --> 01:19:34,302
The fair-haired man of American go.

1507
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,024
George, you've been collaborating too
long. You finish each other's sentences.

1508
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:40,427
You know George, I think ..
─ He's got something there.

1509
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:41,256
So do I.

1510
01:19:41,856 --> 01:19:44,068
Wait a minute, I'm the
comic around here.

1511
01:19:44,269 --> 01:19:46,554
I guess you know Buddy Hare.
─ Yeah. We know him.

1512
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:49,043
Hey, what are you doing here, Buddy?
─ He's your comedian.

1513
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:50,322
Swell.

1514
01:19:51,094 --> 01:19:52,167
Buddy. Your writers.

1515
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:54,168
Writers? Who needs them?
Look Vic, you ..

1516
01:19:54,349 --> 01:19:57,503
You guys start thinking up a character
for Buddy to play. I'll finish shaving.

1517
01:19:57,823 --> 01:19:59,858
Why, that's okay by me.
I can work any place.

1518
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,608
And he wants a character.
─ He's got one.

1519
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:07,620
Oh now Vicky, forget about
them writers, will you.

1520
01:20:08,043 --> 01:20:10,026
I've forgot more jokes than
those guys ever knew.

1521
01:20:10,401 --> 01:20:13,245
Hey listen, what kind a program are we
going to give this character Evans, huh?

1522
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,660
What's the matter? Cigar bother you?
─ Oh no.

1523
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,064
I wouldn't miss a morning without it.
─ Oh, swell.

1524
01:20:19,182 --> 01:20:23,032
Any kind of a program you want I can
give you. Without no help from nobody.

1525
01:20:23,373 --> 01:20:26,002
I ain't one of them baggy-pants
slap-shoot comics. You know what I mean?

1526
01:20:26,304 --> 01:20:27,797
I work strictly class.

1527
01:20:28,168 --> 01:20:30,666
Everyday clothes, just like I've
got on. See what I mean?

1528
01:20:30,957 --> 01:20:33,107
Yeah, I think I see what you
mean. A man of distinction.

1529
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:35,234
You've got it. Class with a capital "K".

1530
01:20:35,546 --> 01:20:37,802
Whatever kind of a program
you want, I got it .. hey.

1531
01:20:38,009 --> 01:20:40,326
You want a hotel routine?
I've got a swell one.

1532
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,703
This one is murder.

1533
01:20:41,926 --> 01:20:43,257
I live in a swell hotel.

1534
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,849
I got a nice 2-dollar room and hot
and cold running chambermaids.

1535
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:47,123
The rooms are so small.

1536
01:20:47,223 --> 01:20:49,181
You must go in the hall
to change your mind.

1537
01:20:49,281 --> 01:20:51,325
Yeah. All the mice walk
around hunchbacked.

1538
01:20:51,425 --> 01:20:54,106
Then the dining room. Say,
the dining room ceiling is so low ..

1539
01:20:54,328 --> 01:20:55,775
All they can serve is flounder.

1540
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:58,747
Alright. Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1541
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,757
Here's one I made up out of my own mind.

1542
01:21:02,523 --> 01:21:03,460
He has a mind?

1543
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:05,228
Look, you say to me ..
─ Hold it.

1544
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,257
Where did you dig up this crock of corn?

1545
01:21:08,723 --> 01:21:09,824
Oh, I've been around.

1546
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:11,460
Round the burlesque houses?

1547
01:21:11,797 --> 01:21:13,657
Oh, I was sort of an Emcee.

1548
01:21:14,226 --> 01:21:15,718
An Emcee in a burlesque house?

1549
01:21:17,147 --> 01:21:18,489
Merchandiser of candy.

1550
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,895
I see .. a candy butcher.

1551
01:21:22,967 --> 01:21:26,066
Say, maybe we can work out something
where you do sort-of a gag commercial.

1552
01:21:26,392 --> 01:21:27,551
Kid with the announcer.

1553
01:21:27,786 --> 01:21:29,202
What sort of spiel did you give?

1554
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:30,153
Well ..

1555
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:32,799
The acoustics in here
ain't so hot but ..

1556
01:21:33,368 --> 01:21:34,841
It used to go something like this.

1557
01:21:35,069 --> 01:21:36,888
I used to walk out on
the stage and I'd say:

1558
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:41,443
Alright, before the show starts, I've an
announcement for the patrons here.

1559
01:21:41,889 --> 01:21:44,231
Those of you who are regular
patrons of the Getty Theater.

1560
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,866
Are well acquainted with
our fine selection of candy.

1561
01:21:47,133 --> 01:21:49,818
Now I represent the
Beautiful Sky Candy Company.

1562
01:21:50,355 --> 01:21:53,294
Makers of those delicious
chocolate-covered California fruits.

1563
01:21:53,512 --> 01:21:55,101
I .. I guess I'll be gone.

1564
01:21:55,629 --> 01:21:56,323
Yeah.

1565
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:58,996
You have a chance to win.

1566
01:21:59,301 --> 01:22:02,259
A genuine water watch
of Warner Massachusetts.

1567
01:22:02,857 --> 01:22:04,403
I heard what you said, young man!

1568
01:22:04,682 --> 01:22:07,834
You said this was not a genuine
water watch of Warner Massachusetts.

1569
01:22:07,934 --> 01:22:10,063
Well now, to be sure, it's not
a hundred-dollar watch.

1570
01:22:10,163 --> 01:22:12,278
It is not a fifty dollar watch.
But it is ..

1571
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:16,173
A genuine ten-dollar water watch
of Warner Massachusetts.

1572
01:22:16,705 --> 01:22:17,721
My confederates ..

1573
01:22:20,128 --> 01:22:22,317
My confederates and myself
will pass through the audience.

1574
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:26,531
Our one purpose is for
the program to sell soap.

1575
01:22:28,267 --> 01:22:29,757
See what I mean? Soap.

1576
01:22:30,227 --> 01:22:31,314
Hey, I got it.

1577
01:22:31,484 --> 01:22:33,358
It came to me like a flash.
Get a load of this.

1578
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,909
Now. I walk out onto
the stage like this, see.

1579
01:22:38,843 --> 01:22:39,544
I slip.

1580
01:22:40,834 --> 01:22:43,295
The announcer comes out,
holds the microphone over my face.

1581
01:22:43,686 --> 01:22:44,992
I say .. "Hiya folks".

1582
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,583
"You got to fall for the Beautee Soap."

1583
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:49,766
No.

1584
01:22:52,502 --> 01:22:53,095
No?

1585
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:55,769
I think I have it. I think I
know what to do with him.

1586
01:22:55,869 --> 01:22:58,749
We know what to do with him. First, take
a little strychnine, add some cyanide ..

1587
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:00,049
Boys, this is serious.

1588
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:02,595
We have to work with this guy.
We have to get something out of him.

1589
01:23:04,322 --> 01:23:05,161
I got it!

1590
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,447
I got it.

1591
01:23:06,933 --> 01:23:08,132
The "painter" routine.

1592
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:10,351
I go to the door like this, see.

1593
01:23:10,999 --> 01:23:11,823
Good.

1594
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:14,816
I am painting the door with black paint.

1595
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:16,847
You are furious.
─ Right.

1596
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,709
You say to me: go!

1597
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:21,029
And never darken my door again.

1598
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,461
Great, huh?
─ Oh, great. Only do it.

1599
01:23:23,656 --> 01:23:25,214
Never darken my door<i>step</i> again.

1600
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,610
I like it. I like it.

1601
01:23:28,624 --> 01:23:30,721
Never darken my doorstep again ..

1602
01:23:35,066 --> 01:23:37,312
I'm sorry Buddy, but I want to
talk to the boys for a while.

1603
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,268
Listen. Would you
like a peephole routine?

1604
01:23:39,368 --> 01:23:41,753
Of the peephole, by the
peephole, for the peephole.

1605
01:23:42,016 --> 01:23:43,175
I'll call you tomorrow.

1606
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:47,674
Now this is it.

1607
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:50,039
We'll make this dope a
sideshow barker, the thing he is.

1608
01:23:50,207 --> 01:23:51,736
A carnival, circus kind of a guy.

1609
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:53,447
Yeah. That he could play.

1610
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,825
Not bad. Not bad. Might be alright.
─ [ Buzzer ]

1611
01:23:56,421 --> 01:23:57,674
Oh no, not again.

1612
01:23:59,354 --> 01:24:00,169
Hey, now ..

1613
01:24:00,696 --> 01:24:02,327
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1614
01:24:04,316 --> 01:24:04,962
Yes?

1615
01:24:05,062 --> 01:24:06,512
I'm from the office, Mr Norman.

1616
01:24:06,612 --> 01:24:08,911
Oh. Oh, come in.
─ Thank you.          ─ Sit down.

1617
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:10,656
Hi, fellahs.
─ Hi, Gloria.

1618
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,633
I tried phoning you, but the hotel
operator said she couldn't ring you.

1619
01:24:13,893 --> 01:24:16,411
Yeah. I hate being
disturbed in the morning.

1620
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:19,573
An urgent message came by teletype
from Mr Kimberly in New York.

1621
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:21,474
"Mr Norman from Mr Kimberly."

1622
01:24:21,726 --> 01:24:24,838
"Evans wants to know what kind of a
show you are planning for Buddy Hare."

1623
01:24:25,049 --> 01:24:28,023
"He says shoot him general descriptions
so we can chat-chat about it here."

1624
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:29,837
"Let me have answer immediately."

1625
01:24:30,385 --> 01:24:31,429
Here is the answer.

1626
01:24:31,793 --> 01:24:32,465
Ready?

1627
01:24:33,347 --> 01:24:35,078
Tell him it's to go
chat-chat in the lake.

1628
01:24:35,934 --> 01:24:37,675
I'm making this
audition record. Not him.

1629
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:39,088
Check.

1630
01:24:39,497 --> 01:24:40,398
Sign it "Vic".

1631
01:24:41,226 --> 01:24:42,810
Are you really that sure of yourself?

1632
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:44,535
I don't know. I try to act like I am.

1633
01:24:45,286 --> 01:24:46,436
Thank you, Mr Norman.

1634
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:48,192
Goodbye, boys.
─ Goodbye, Gloria.

1635
01:24:50,978 --> 01:24:52,022
Goodbye, Mr Norman.

1636
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:52,939
Goodbye.

1637
01:24:55,354 --> 01:24:56,954
How are you fixed for dates out here?

1638
01:24:57,141 --> 01:24:59,186
Okay, I have a girl.
─ You mean, you got one already?

1639
01:24:59,576 --> 01:25:01,593
Yeah, she's cooking me dinner
tonight. Now listen ..

1640
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:06,124
The way I see this show is a normal gag
comedy format with a band for support.

1641
01:25:06,703 --> 01:25:09,094
The main thing is to get new,
fresh material for Buddy.

1642
01:25:10,142 --> 01:25:12,492
Now, in making him
into a sideshow barker.

1643
01:25:12,985 --> 01:25:13,800

You're just what a guy needs, Jean.

Am I, Vic?

1659

You're an awful pretty girl.

Hey, come on. You've got
to help me with dinner.

1664

The cocktails are in the icebox.

1665
01:26:57,126 --> 01:26:59,544
You've been here a whole day and
no suntan yet. What's the matter?

1666
01:26:59,832 --> 01:27:02,202
Been standing over a hot script.
Working with the writers.

1667
01:27:02,419 --> 01:27:05,215
Is the show going to be good?
─ It might. It just might.

1668
01:27:05,731 --> 01:27:07,381
And we can use a singer.
─ Hey.

Jean, if that screen-test deal
of yours doesn't work out ..

Will you promise to
sing the way I tell you?

Oh Vic, that would be wonderful.

1672
01:27:15,084 --> 01:27:15,699
Yes.

1673
01:27:16,061 --> 01:27:17,620
But will you sing the way I tell you?

1674
01:27:17,995 --> 01:27:19,813
Well, that depends on what you tell me.

1681
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:36,390
That's old-fashioned. Modern
singing is soft, not loud.

1682
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:38,655
And off the beat.
That's what the public want.

1683

Unfortunately, what the public
wants has nothing to do with radio.

Hmm.

Vic.

1688
01:27:52,211 --> 01:27:54,073
Isn't it nice we're both
in the same business?

1689

cozier, don't you think so?

01:28:32,443 --> 01:28:34,088
I should have brought my house slippers.

1696
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:37,684
You know, I like doing
things for you, Vic.

1697
01:28:38,669 --> 01:28:40,170
I like having you around the house.

1698
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:43,614
I'm what you might call a
"Vic Norman" kind of a gal.

1699
01:28:45,099 --> 01:28:46,572
You know, I think you are at that.

1700
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,227
And as for me, Jean honey?

1701
01:28:55,177 --> 01:28:57,967
Whoever's apartment this is
must be crazy for penguins.

1702
01:28:58,698 --> 01:29:00,858
What's the matter? Are you
allergic to them or something?

1703
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:04,414
You might put it that way.

1704
01:29:06,255 --> 01:29:07,302
What is it, honey?

1705
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:10,227
Oh nothing, Jean. Nothing at all.

1706
01:29:10,686 --> 01:29:13,050
Now where we? What witty
thing was I trying to say?

1707
01:29:13,334 --> 01:29:15,438
Oh yes: Jean.
─ It's her, isn't it?

1708
01:29:16,194 --> 01:29:17,696
Something just reminded you of her.

1709
01:29:18,891 --> 01:29:20,021
I was right, wasn't I?

1710
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,461
Let's skip it, Jean.

1711
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,998
And stop interrupting me when ..
─ I was right.

1712
01:29:25,697 --> 01:29:27,498
I haven't got a chance, have I.

1713
01:29:29,153 --> 01:29:30,672
Oh Vic, you're in love with her.

1714
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:39,387
Look, Jean. Why don't
we go out to a movie?

1715
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:43,352
Sure.

1716
01:29:44,028 --> 01:29:44,824
Why not.

1717
01:29:46,543 --> 01:29:48,813
Maybe we can find a western
with a lot of shooting in it.

1718
01:29:49,925 --> 01:29:52,343
I don't feel much like sitting through
a mushy love story, do you?

1719
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:10,504
Vic.

1720
01:30:11,735 --> 01:30:12,579
Who's there?

1721
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,296
It's Kay.

1722
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:35,677
Honey, you're what was missing.

1723
01:30:36,461 --> 01:30:37,647
You are what I missed.

1724
01:30:38,203 --> 01:30:39,690
Oh, me too.

1725
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:41,868
I missed you.

1726
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:43,778
I missed you so much.

1727
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,118
You're a long ways from home, darling.

1728
01:30:55,269 --> 01:30:59,140
I suppose I ought to pretend I had
sudden urgent business in California.

1729
01:31:00,022 --> 01:31:01,118
I do, actually.

1730
01:31:03,258 --> 01:31:04,867
You know what, Mr Norman?

1731
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:06,564
You're pretty.

1732
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:09,750
Do you know what?

1733
01:31:09,993 --> 01:31:10,987
You're crazy.

1734
01:31:12,261 --> 01:31:13,187
I guess I am.

1735
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:15,862
I just couldn't stand it any longer.

1736
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:17,814
I simply got on a plane.

1737
01:31:19,245 --> 01:31:20,375
It's like I once said.

1738
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:21,926
You're an honest woman.

1739
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:25,502
I suppose you're used
to this sort of thing.

1740
01:31:26,199 --> 01:31:27,743
Having women chase you.

1741
01:31:30,036 --> 01:31:31,223
I hate to tell you this.

1742
01:31:31,698 --> 01:31:33,670
But hardly anyone ever chases me.

1743
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:36,669
Chasing me is a sure sign of insanity.

1744
01:31:38,476 --> 01:31:39,794
Now that I'm here ..

1745
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,010
I don't know what to say.

1746
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:46,754
Nothing has really changed since
we had that fight in New York.

1747
01:31:51,191 --> 01:31:52,152
Yes, it has.

1748
01:31:52,617 --> 01:31:54,475
A lot has changed.
─ What?

1749
01:31:56,597 --> 01:31:57,469
I don't know.

1750
01:31:57,663 --> 01:31:59,394
When I heard your
voice a minute ago, I ..

1751
01:32:03,064 --> 01:32:04,944
Honey .. do you have a place to stay?

1752
01:32:06,852 --> 01:32:08,458
I have a reservation on a plane back.

1753
01:32:09,582 --> 01:32:10,718
I've got two hours.

1754
01:32:11,794 --> 01:32:13,684
I just wanted to see you again.

1755
01:32:17,713 --> 01:32:19,043
Why not stick around a while?

1756
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:20,742
It's a nice country.

1757
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:22,724
Alright.

1758
01:32:23,607 --> 01:32:24,936
I just wanted to be asked.

1759
01:32:26,578 --> 01:32:27,851
I know the ropes, like you.

1760
01:32:28,637 --> 01:32:29,964
Maybe I can get you a room.

1761
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,044
Maybe I can get you a room.

1762
01:32:32,485 --> 01:32:33,709
Way over there.

1763
01:32:48,562 --> 01:32:49,878
Good morning, good morning.

1764
01:32:49,978 --> 01:32:52,184
Oh Mr Norman, we've been
looking all over for you.

1765
01:32:52,284 --> 01:32:55,206
They want you at the teletype right now.
─ Take it easy, honey. Haven't you heard?

1766
01:32:55,306 --> 01:32:56,607
All is right with the world.

1767
01:32:57,074 --> 01:32:59,691
Oh Mr Norman, they've been trying to
get you all morning on the teletype.

1768
01:32:59,818 --> 01:33:03,053
Send two, no three dozen roses
to Mrs Frances Dorrance ..

1769
01:33:03,284 --> 01:33:04,720
At the Sunset Hills Hotel.

1770
01:33:05,255 --> 01:33:06,013
Yes, sir.

1771
01:33:07,008 --> 01:33:09,163
Oh Mr Norman, they're
going crazy in New York.

1772
01:33:09,336 --> 01:33:10,609
I'll tell them you're here.

1773
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:13,268
Trouble, huh? Trouble is
not what I want this morning.

1774
01:33:13,445 --> 01:33:14,931
What does it seem to be about?

1775
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:16,725
Mr Norman, we've lost Buddy Hare.

1776
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:18,577
After all that time you've spent on him.

1777
01:33:19,088 --> 01:33:20,751
What? We can't lose him.

1778
01:33:21,502 --> 01:33:22,363
Here it is.

1779
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:24,668
"Kim to Vic."

1780
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:26,997
"This is serious."

1781
01:33:27,878 --> 01:33:30,988
"Lash gave Keeves Agency .."

1782
01:33:31,384 --> 01:33:33,030
"Option on Hare."

1783
01:33:33,644 --> 01:33:35,534
"Prior to yours."

1784
01:33:36,178 --> 01:33:39,286
"Dave has left us holding the bag."

1785
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:41,385
Oh that Mr Lash, he's so dishonest.

1786
01:33:41,887 --> 01:33:42,731
No he's not.

1787
01:33:43,018 --> 01:33:45,609
There must be a mistake.
Dave Lash is an honest man.

1788
01:33:46,296 --> 01:33:48,928
Call him. Tell him I'm on my way over.
Tell Mr Kimberly this:

1789
01:33:49,103 --> 01:33:51,874
Relax, Kim. I'll fix it someway.
Love and kisses, Vic.

1790
01:33:54,323 --> 01:33:55,628
Hello, Vic.
─ Hello, Dave.

1791
01:33:55,728 --> 01:33:57,002
Meet the legal battery.

1792
01:33:57,367 --> 01:34:00,186
This is Harry Spooner and Joe Lawrensön.
─ How do you do.

1793
01:34:00,286 --> 01:34:02,812
Vic, the Keeves people called
me up a month or so ago.

1794
01:34:02,977 --> 01:34:04,550
And said no dice on Buddy Hare.

1795
01:34:04,952 --> 01:34:06,315
Unconsciously, I wrote it off.

1796
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,119
But Keeves, legally,
still have the paper.

1797
01:34:09,513 --> 01:34:11,246
And Keeves, legally, have Buddy Hare.

1798
01:34:11,737 --> 01:34:12,524
You don't.

1799
01:34:12,624 --> 01:34:15,822
It's like he said, Mr Norman.
Keeves owns Hare. You don't.

1800
01:34:16,315 --> 01:34:18,577
Besides, I've examined the
option you wrote on the train.

1801
01:34:19,051 --> 01:34:21,353
Any good lawyer could break it in court.
─ Uhuh.

1802
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:24,151
Since when did your office
start going in for legal cuties?

1803
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:26,315
Harry, you know I don't
go for that kind of stuff.

1804
01:34:26,415 --> 01:34:28,138
Dave, I have one little idea.

1805
01:34:28,405 --> 01:34:30,447
It will satisfy Keeves,
and it will satisfy me.

1806
01:34:30,906 --> 01:34:32,837
But it would cost Dave Lash
quite a bit of money.

1807
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,799
Well, how much?
─ The idea is this.

1808
01:34:35,185 --> 01:34:37,528
You tell Keeves you'll get
them a top comedy name.

1809
01:34:37,997 --> 01:34:41,384
And you get them the top name at the
price they would have paid Buddy Hare.

1810
01:34:41,852 --> 01:34:43,011
<i>You</i> pay the difference.

1811
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:44,488
Why, that would run in to ..

1812
01:34:45,335 --> 01:34:48,315
Why, that would cost us .. that
would cost us a thousand a week.

1813
01:34:48,415 --> 01:34:50,059
For more than a year.
─ It might, Dave.

1814
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:52,325
Mr Lash, let us take this into court.

1815
01:34:52,575 --> 01:34:55,392
We'll win, and it will only cost you a
hundred dollars or so in court fees.

1816
01:34:55,658 --> 01:34:57,045
You have us on retainer anyway.

1817
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:59,965
Dave, can I see you alone for a minute?
─ Yeah. You heard him, boys.

1818
01:35:00,923 --> 01:35:03,112
We won't go far. I think
you're going to need us.

1819
01:35:07,464 --> 01:35:08,108
Dave.

1820
01:35:08,524 --> 01:35:10,567
This is important to me.
─ I can see that.

1821
01:35:11,876 --> 01:35:14,122
Do you remember one night on
a plane four or five years ago?

1822
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:15,455
What night?

1823
01:35:15,555 --> 01:35:17,288
We happened to be
traveling East together.

1824
01:35:17,388 --> 01:35:19,055
I was getting ready to go into the Army.

1825
01:35:19,155 --> 01:35:21,543
And you were going back to New York
to attend a certain luncheon.

1826
01:35:21,929 --> 01:35:23,329
Remember?
─ Luncheon?

1827
01:35:24,145 --> 01:35:25,679
I'm not much of man for luncheons.

1828
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:27,849
You were in a talkative mood.

1829
01:35:27,949 --> 01:35:30,084
You said when you were a kid
on New York's East side ..

1830
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:33,125
That you were arrested for stealing
some pennies and sent to reform school.

1831
01:35:33,842 --> 01:35:34,600
Remember?

1832
01:35:36,503 --> 01:35:38,008
Sometimes I talk too much.

1833
01:35:38,744 --> 01:35:40,332
Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of.

1834
01:35:43,705 --> 01:35:45,740
Later you told me you were
going back to New York ..

1835
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,150
To be awarded a scroll by some kind
of civic benevolent organization.

1836
01:35:49,896 --> 01:35:51,198
The kid who'd gone straight.

1837
01:35:51,466 --> 01:35:54,951
Something about setting a fine example
for underprivileged kids like you were.

1838
01:35:56,998 --> 01:35:57,642
Dave.

1839
01:35:58,937 --> 01:36:01,630
I think that's something to be proud of.
─ Well I <i>am</i> proud of it.

1840
01:36:02,406 --> 01:36:06,368
I give quite a bit of money each year to
run boys' clubs in my old neighborhood.

1841
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:08,721
Decent clubs where
kids can get together.

1842
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:11,408
Without drifting around the
streets or sitting in pool rooms.

1843
01:36:12,175 --> 01:36:14,521
Why .. they're a great bunch of kids.

1844
01:36:15,385 --> 01:36:17,863
They've got my picture on the
wall of each one of the clubs ..

1845
01:36:17,963 --> 01:36:19,699
As if I was something terrific.

1846
01:36:20,503 --> 01:36:22,321
And you're going to let those kids down.

1847
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:24,532
Let them down?

1848
01:36:25,497 --> 01:36:27,485
What are you talking about?
─ Dave, think a minute.

1849
01:36:28,169 --> 01:36:30,186
When this thing about
Buddy Hare gets talked around.

1850
01:36:30,561 --> 01:36:32,126
And it's bound to get around, Dave.

1851
01:36:33,095 --> 01:36:35,570
You know there are a lot of people
who hate to see a guy like you ..

1852
01:36:35,738 --> 01:36:37,887
A guy from the wrong side
of the tracks, get ahead.

1853
01:36:39,045 --> 01:36:40,948
What do you think those
people are going to say?

1854
01:36:41,348 --> 01:36:42,937
That an agent made a mistake?

1855
01:36:44,146 --> 01:36:46,188
No .. you know better than that, Dave.

1856
01:36:47,028 --> 01:36:49,519
They're going to say it
was crooked. Dishonest.

1857
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:53,433
They're going to say you can never
trust a guy with any kind of a record.

1858
01:36:55,561 --> 01:36:58,293
Now, how do you think that's going to
look to the kids you're trying to help?

1859
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,944
How do you think it'll
look to those kids ..

1860
01:37:01,044 --> 01:37:03,328
Who think you've done it the
hard way and look up to you?

1861
01:37:32,148 --> 01:37:33,535
Dave, I hit you where you live.

1862
01:37:34,013 --> 01:37:35,117
And I didn't mean to.

1863
01:37:36,979 --> 01:37:38,424
The next thing I know, I'll be ..

1864
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,458
Beating women and kicking children.

1865
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,590
Dave, I'd consider it a favor
if you'd forget I ever said it.

1866
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:47,771
What you said is true.

1867
01:37:49,143 --> 01:37:50,872
Go ahead with your Buddy Hare show.

1868
01:37:52,323 --> 01:37:54,937
I'll work it out some way.
Maybe even the way you suggest.

1869
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,334
Dave, I've done a rotten thing.

1870
01:38:01,926 --> 01:38:03,457
And I want to ask you to forgive me.

1871
01:38:03,674 --> 01:38:05,477
You've got your Buddy Hare. You won.

1872
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:07,812
I ask you to forgive me.

1873
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:10,231
I have respect for you, Vic.

1874
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:12,984
You got what you came for.

1875
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:15,627
This is one time I'd rather
be forgiven than respected.

1876
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:18,559
Like I said, I have respect for you.

1877
01:38:25,545 --> 01:38:27,693
And I wish I could say
the same thing for myself.

1878
01:38:28,841 --> 01:38:29,909
About myself.

1879
01:38:43,909 --> 01:38:45,032
So now you know.

1880
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,397
Now you know what a heel I am.

1881
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:51,200
Come on, darling. Don't worry about it.

1882
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:53,876
Everyone has done things
they're ashamed of.

1883
01:38:56,503 --> 01:38:58,532
I can't imagine <i>you
</i>doing anything like that.

1884
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:02,152
I rather like being on a
pedestal but don't overdo it.

1885
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:06,451
Oh we're so lucky, darling.

1886
01:39:09,379 --> 01:39:10,166
Aren't we?

1887
01:39:16,573 --> 01:39:17,918
Come on, Kay .. let's walk.

1888
01:39:33,799 --> 01:39:34,872
Beautiful, isn't it.

1889
01:39:35,272 --> 01:39:37,633
They call it poetic inspiration.
─ They should.

1890
01:39:42,921 --> 01:39:44,445
You didn't answer my question.

1891
01:39:45,006 --> 01:39:46,279
I said aren't you we lucky.

1892
01:39:47,065 --> 01:39:49,108
That we have each other.
Nothing else matters.

1893
01:39:51,353 --> 01:39:52,397
A <i>lot </i>else matters.

1894
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,161
A lot.

1895
01:39:55,285 --> 01:39:55,908
Kay.

1896
01:39:56,306 --> 01:39:57,779
I want you to go back to New York.

1897
01:39:57,943 --> 01:39:59,416
The first plane we can get you on.

1898
01:40:02,516 --> 01:40:03,579
Alright, Vic.

1899
01:40:05,216 --> 01:40:07,080
Don't be like that.
That isn't what I mean.

1900
01:40:08,013 --> 01:40:09,715
I mean I don't want
any Blue Penguin Inn.

1901
01:40:10,168 --> 01:40:12,140
I want everything to be right about us.

1902
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:16,206
You know if I bring off this Buddy Hare
show, I'll be a man with a good job.

1903
01:40:16,832 --> 01:40:19,108
A man who can afford to support
a house near Sutton Place.

1904
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:22,327
Oh .. Vic.

1905
01:40:22,592 --> 01:40:23,464
Vic, darling.

1906
01:40:24,033 --> 01:40:25,792
And I used to say that
money is only money.

1907
01:40:25,892 --> 01:40:27,846
Why, it's clothes for you,
school for the kids.

1908
01:40:27,946 --> 01:40:30,264
Stop being a breadwinner and kiss me.

1909
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:13,442
I can't think.
─ Want some more coffee?

1910
01:41:13,676 --> 01:41:15,484
No no, it's no use. I'm dead.

1911
01:41:15,734 --> 01:41:17,107
I got to go home.
─ Sit down.

1912
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:19,278
You know I had a wife once.

1913
01:41:19,378 --> 01:41:20,823
Bet she's gone to Mexico by now.

1914
01:41:20,923 --> 01:41:23,421
If you stop beating, finish the
script, maybe you'll see her again.

1915
01:41:23,521 --> 01:41:24,364
Thanks, pal.

1916
01:41:24,904 --> 01:41:27,712
You know this is the best work you two
have done. One more day and we're in.

1917
01:41:28,154 --> 01:41:29,456
I'll tell you what.
─ What?

1918
01:41:30,371 --> 01:41:32,696
Maybe it will give us an idea.
Read the script aloud again.

1919
01:41:32,796 --> 01:41:34,016
Oh no, Vic. Not that.

1920
01:41:34,116 --> 01:41:35,869
If you read those
jokes just once more ..

1921
01:41:35,969 --> 01:41:37,299
So help me, I'll kill myself.

1922
01:41:37,756 --> 01:41:41,021
Let's hope Evans doesn't feel the same
when I get to New York with the record.

1923
01:41:41,302 --> 01:41:43,034
On the other hand, let's hope he does.

1924
01:42:08,181 --> 01:42:08,997
Hello, Vic.

1925
01:42:09,192 --> 01:42:11,579
Do you ever go to bed?
─ Come, get into my car. We must hurry.

1926
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:13,673
What for?
─ Evans. A meeting in 20 minutes.

1927
01:42:13,866 --> 01:42:15,981
At two o'clock in the morning?
─ Well, you know Evans.

1928
01:42:16,665 --> 01:42:19,053
Tell me, what happened?
Did everything go alright?

1929
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:20,549
It was a good audition.

1930
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:22,823
Buddy Hare was as funny
as can be expected.

1931
01:42:23,061 --> 01:42:25,004
I've got the record here.
─ Where are you going?

1932
01:42:25,219 --> 01:42:27,300
I've got to make a phone
call. Evans can wait.

1933
01:42:27,472 --> 01:42:29,229
Can't you make your
phone call later, Vic?

1934
01:42:36,696 --> 01:42:38,399
[ Telephone ]

1935
01:42:40,556 --> 01:42:41,975
[ Telephone ]

1936
01:42:45,045 --> 01:42:45,759
Hello?

1937
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:48,908
Vic.

1938
01:42:49,732 --> 01:42:50,994
My darling, where are you?

1939
01:42:51,676 --> 01:42:52,863
I'm in La Guardia Field.

1940
01:42:54,033 --> 01:42:56,223
Oh, you sound so warm and sleepy.

1941
01:42:57,038 --> 01:42:58,311
"I've missed you, darling."

1942
01:42:59,196 --> 01:43:00,183
"Do you love me?"

1943
01:43:01,295 --> 01:43:02,406
I adore you.

1944
01:43:03,863 --> 01:43:06,435
I'll throw on some clothes and
you come over here right away.

1945
01:43:06,787 --> 01:43:08,609
I can't. Meet me at Evans' office.

1946
01:43:09,018 --> 01:43:11,141
Stay in your car. Park
on the Wall Street side.

1947
01:43:11,539 --> 01:43:13,384
When you get there,
blow the horn three times.

1948
01:43:13,694 --> 01:43:14,732
"To say hello."

1949
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:16,328
"This is it, honey."

1950
01:43:16,563 --> 01:43:18,575
"This is where I take them
for our year's income."

1951
01:43:20,608 --> 01:43:21,595
I have to go now.

1952
01:43:21,763 --> 01:43:24,371
The man who is about to
pay our grocery bill awaits.

1953
01:43:25,072 --> 01:43:26,002
Remember honey.

1954
01:43:26,364 --> 01:43:27,414
Three times.

1955
01:43:31,846 --> 01:43:34,922
Let's go. Why take a chance on
irritating the old man at this time?

1956
01:43:35,102 --> 01:43:37,214
I wouldn't think of irritating
him at a time like this.

1957
01:43:37,383 --> 01:43:39,685
It's too important to me now.
─ Then come on, come on.

1958
01:43:40,034 --> 01:43:42,272
Kim. I'm in love. I'm engaged.

1959
01:43:42,527 --> 01:43:45,411
Well that's fine, Vic. That's fine.
But I'll congratulate you in the car.

1960
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:47,000
It's Kay. Kay Dorrance.

1961
01:43:47,383 --> 01:43:50,033
No kidding. That's wonderful, Vic.
─ She has two children.

1962
01:43:50,133 --> 01:43:53,145
I know. I saw their pictures. Remember?
You can tell me all about it in the car.

1963
01:43:53,332 --> 01:43:54,405
Children cost money.

1964
01:43:54,722 --> 01:43:56,490
Nurses and cereals and things.

1965
01:43:57,108 --> 01:44:00,007
Kim, make it thirty-five
thousand instead of twenty-five.

1966
01:44:00,174 --> 01:44:02,334
Now look here, Vic. If you
think you can get away with ..

1967
01:44:02,746 --> 01:44:03,390
Okay.

1968
01:44:03,681 --> 01:44:05,816
Thirty-five thousand dollars
a year <i>if </i>Evans okays you.

1969
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:06,810
Plus bonuses.

1970
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:08,698
Plus bonuses.
─ Okay, Chum.

1971
01:44:09,002 --> 01:44:10,924
Now let's go take care
of Evan Llewellyn Evans.

1972
01:44:17,288 --> 01:44:18,690
This place feels like a morgue.

1973
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:20,635
Vic, I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

1974
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,396
It's locked.

1975
01:44:29,445 --> 01:44:30,804
The trañscription, please.

1976
01:44:31,449 --> 01:44:33,027
Mr Evans wants to hear it first.

1977
01:44:33,797 --> 01:44:34,814
Without you.

1978
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,138
Give her the records.

1979
01:44:39,316 --> 01:44:40,872
You are both to wait here.

1980
01:44:41,836 --> 01:44:43,606
Welcome home, Mr Norman.

1981
01:44:50,349 --> 01:44:51,708
He's building up to something.

1982
01:44:51,822 --> 01:44:52,666
I'm worried.

1983
01:44:52,994 --> 01:44:54,124
You're always worried.

1984
01:44:54,676 --> 01:44:56,579
Are those records alright?
Is the show alright?

1985
01:44:56,679 --> 01:44:58,345
In my opinion it will make people laugh.

1986
01:44:58,445 --> 01:45:01,142
If they happen to want to laugh.
As for Evans, how do I know?

1987
01:45:01,242 --> 01:45:03,243
And the singer? How did
the drummer girl turn out?

1988
01:45:03,343 --> 01:45:05,073
I didn't use a drummer girl.
─ You didn't?

1989
01:45:05,501 --> 01:45:07,318
I think we get a brand-new
singing star, Kim.

1990
01:45:07,424 --> 01:45:08,636
Who?
─ You know her.

1991
01:45:08,736 --> 01:45:10,743
A girl named Jean Ogilvie.
─ Jean Ogilvie?

1992
01:45:11,106 --> 01:45:13,171
Vic! A nightclub singer. A nobody!

1993
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:16,114
Everybody was a nobody once.
─ Yeah, but lots of them stay nobodies.

1994
01:45:16,622 --> 01:45:19,228
Take it easy, Kim.
─ Take it easy? Something is cooking.

1995
01:45:19,328 --> 01:45:22,308
There has been ever since you refused to
send an outline of the Buddy Hare show.

1996
01:45:22,597 --> 01:45:25,358
He hasn't mentioned it since, Vic. I say
he's setting the stage for something.

1997
01:45:25,605 --> 01:45:28,716
Oh look, Kim. We can't lose.
─ Why can't we lose?

1998
01:45:28,913 --> 01:45:31,246
I told you. Because I'm in
love now. And I can use him.

1999
01:45:31,775 --> 01:45:34,450
I'm not going to let him tie a can on
our tails just the minute I need him.

2000
01:45:34,804 --> 01:45:37,898
I won't let the old goat do that to us.
─ Shush. Vic, not so loud.

2001
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:39,841
He may have the place wired.

2002
01:45:41,093 --> 01:45:42,423
I think I'm going to be sick.

2003
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,446
Hey, cut it out, will you.

2004
01:45:45,085 --> 01:45:47,708
You're beginning to <i>me</i> Evans- happy.
─ Well, it's about time.

2005
01:46:03,386 --> 01:46:04,828
You may come in, now.

2006
01:46:16,331 --> 01:46:18,341
Good morning, Mr Norman.
─ Good morning, sir.

2007
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:20,930
Good morning, Kimberly.
─ Good morning, Mr Evans.

2008
01:46:27,825 --> 01:46:30,649
Allison, bring me the letter I
wrote earlier this evening.

2009
01:46:57,489 --> 01:47:00,575
I take the position that a man either
knows where he's going or he doesn't.

2010
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:01,706
Right?
─ Right.

2011
01:47:02,879 --> 01:47:03,551
Right.

2012
01:47:15,783 --> 01:47:17,890
This letter is to my youngest son.

2013
01:47:18,429 --> 01:47:20,443
Evan Llewellyn Evans the 3rd.

2014
01:47:22,323 --> 01:47:24,997
Dear son, you've been overseas
in the army of occupation ..

2015
01:47:25,097 --> 01:47:27,865
For seven months and three
days at this time of writing.

2016
01:47:29,206 --> 01:47:33,122
My son, I detect a profound note of
discouragement in your letters to me.

2017
01:47:33,808 --> 01:47:36,324
My dear Captain Evan
Llewellyn Evans the 3rd.

2018
01:47:36,519 --> 01:47:40,248
I take the position that a man knows
where he's going or he doesn't.

2019
01:47:40,899 --> 01:47:44,987
And if he doesn't he must chat-chat
with himself and his associates.

2020
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,652
Not to go off half-cocked
on his own. Check?

2021
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:49,967
Check.
─ Check.

2022
01:47:53,411 --> 01:47:55,763
That son, is what I call organization.

2023
01:47:55,863 --> 01:47:58,676
As it applies to an individual
as well as a group.

2024
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,588
The rest of the letter is personal.

2025
01:48:01,983 --> 01:48:04,074
I wonder if my son will get the point.

2026
01:48:04,337 --> 01:48:06,209
It's a beautifully made point, Mr Evans.

2027
01:48:06,492 --> 01:48:08,898
Excellent. Makes me wish
I had a son to write to.

2028
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:14,234
The letter has a bearing
on that province.

2029
01:48:17,054 --> 01:48:20,153
Mr Norman, you chose to go off on
your own and make an audition record.

2030
01:48:20,612 --> 01:48:23,764
You chose to ignore our
normal procedure of chat-chat.

2031
01:48:24,573 --> 01:48:26,245
Chat-chat, and double chat-chat.

2032
01:48:26,956 --> 01:48:29,400
You went off by yourself and
did things your own way.

2033
01:48:29,651 --> 01:48:31,282
Tonight we heard the records.

2034
01:48:31,732 --> 01:48:34,934
Tangible proof of what comes
of your going off on your own.

2035
01:48:35,753 --> 01:48:37,746
The proof of the pudding
is in the eating, right?

2036
01:48:37,846 --> 01:48:38,927
Right.
─ Right.

2037
01:48:39,027 --> 01:48:41,773
After hearing those
records, I can only say ..

2038
01:48:42,254 --> 01:48:44,377
That you, as an individual ..

2039
01:48:45,077 --> 01:48:46,140
Are well organized.

2040
01:48:46,316 --> 01:48:48,254
Your program is excellent, Mr Norman.

2041
01:48:48,494 --> 01:48:49,957
Excellent .. right?

2042
01:48:50,282 --> 01:48:50,954
Right.

2043
01:48:51,292 --> 01:48:53,704
Frankly, I wouldn't have
been surprised if it wasn't.

2044
01:48:53,804 --> 01:48:55,301
But it was. It was good.

2045
01:48:55,644 --> 01:48:56,602
And that singer!

2046
01:48:56,924 --> 01:48:59,799
That Jean Ogilvie. Now, that's a voice.

2047
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:03,605
[ Singing: ]
"<i>Over there .. over there</i>!"

2048
01:49:03,896 --> 01:49:06,841
"<i>Rat tat de ta dat dah dah</i>!"

2049
01:49:07,037 --> 01:49:09,513
Ha ha. Mr Norman ..

2050
01:49:10,069 --> 01:49:11,645
I congratulate you.

2051
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:15,813
You wear the mantle of Beautee Soap now.

2052
01:49:17,482 --> 01:49:20,872
Mr Kimberly, have you discussed
salary with Mr Norman?

2053
01:49:21,219 --> 01:49:23,781
Well, we've talked about
$35,000 a year plus bonuses.

2054
01:49:24,656 --> 01:49:26,884
Well, Mr Norman.
Is that satisfactory to you?

2055
01:49:40,162 --> 01:49:42,945
Thirty-five thousand dollars
a year is a lot of money.

2056
01:49:44,544 --> 01:49:45,571
A lot of money.

2057
01:49:46,357 --> 01:49:47,757
Right?
─ Right.

2058
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:53,721
And right now, I'm a
man who needs money.

2059
01:49:55,966 --> 01:49:56,724
Mr Evans.

2060
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,016
Tonight, you had a little sport with me.

2061
01:50:00,198 --> 01:50:01,877
A little sadistic sport.

2062
01:50:03,648 --> 01:50:05,257
A childish thing of no importance.

2063
01:50:05,798 --> 01:50:07,821
You got me to say "right"
when you wanted me to.

2064
01:50:08,925 --> 01:50:11,965
And you succeeded in introducing
me to your general manager.

2065
01:50:12,388 --> 01:50:14,143
Your foreman.
─ My foreman?

2066
01:50:14,453 --> 01:50:15,917
Your foreman: <i>fear</i>.

2067
01:50:16,195 --> 01:50:17,596
Your overseer:<i> fear</i>.

2068
01:50:17,905 --> 01:50:19,947
The thing that keeps these
people in line for you.

2069
01:50:22,354 --> 01:50:24,673
I didn't know about "fear"
before, but I do now.

2070
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:27,339
I know what it is to be so
worried about your job ..

2071
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:30,355
That you'll kick around a perfectly
nice guy like David Lash.

2072
01:50:31,054 --> 01:50:32,756
A guy who's never
been anything but kind.

2073
01:50:33,067 --> 01:50:35,204
A guy who does a lot of
good for a lot of people.

2074
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:38,786
I'll tell you something.

2075
01:50:39,247 --> 01:50:40,999
I don't like being made to feel afraid.

2076
01:50:41,342 --> 01:50:44,911
Mr Evans, there isn't enough money
in the world to make me work for you.

2077
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:45,931
Vic, Vic!

2078
01:50:46,031 --> 01:50:47,938
Heaven knows Mr Evans, you're a big one.

2079
01:50:48,426 --> 01:50:50,421
The big, rich, successful one.

2080
01:50:51,655 --> 01:50:54,059
But there are others. Tyrants, despots.

2081
01:50:54,318 --> 01:50:56,514
You and your kind,
wherever you do business.

2082
01:50:57,555 --> 01:50:59,048
I think that for a man like you ..

2083
01:50:59,148 --> 01:51:03,194
To control so much of what goes over
the air into the homes of America is ..

2084
01:51:04,857 --> 01:51:06,352
Well, it's all wet.

2085
01:51:10,283 --> 01:51:11,242
See what I mean?

2086
01:51:27,741 --> 01:51:28,590
Darling.

2087
01:51:29,942 --> 01:51:30,958
What's the matter?

2088
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:34,610
Oh darling, they didn't like
your show? Oh, I'm sorry.

2089
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:36,469
They did like the show.
They liked it fine.

2090
01:51:36,603 --> 01:51:38,191
Then what in the world has ..?
─ Kay.

2091
01:51:38,662 --> 01:51:40,793
I've got something to tell
you you're not going to like.

2092
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:43,371
Get in the car ready.
Let's drive up to your house.

2093
01:52:13,548 --> 01:52:15,079
Darling, what is this? Where are we?

2094
01:52:15,824 --> 01:52:18,066
Bolton market.
They start early down here.

2095
01:52:21,159 --> 01:52:23,852
Vic, I can't stand it any longer.
What is it that's wrong?

2096
01:52:24,558 --> 01:52:25,659
Honey, it's bad news.

2097
01:52:25,867 --> 01:52:28,513
I want to get you firmly seated in your
own living room before I tell you.

2098
01:52:28,613 --> 01:52:29,863
No. <i>Now,</i> Vic.

2099
01:52:30,362 --> 01:52:32,589
Please, I'm really quite a big girl.

2100
01:52:33,129 --> 01:52:34,754
You are going to tell me now.

2101
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:49,211
Darling, I see you troubled too often
with what you've been doing, What is it?

2102
01:52:49,612 --> 01:52:50,427
What is it?

2103
01:52:51,466 --> 01:52:53,768
I just threw away my job. I got fed up.

2104
01:52:55,058 --> 01:52:58,030
You and I are going to have to wait a
long time before we can be married.

2105
01:52:58,430 --> 01:52:59,875
That's what I wanted to tell you.

2106
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,713
So, if you want out, Kay ..

2107
01:53:02,693 --> 01:53:03,365
I see.

2108
01:53:03,574 --> 01:53:04,933
It's a matter of self-respect.

2109
01:53:05,385 --> 01:53:08,203
Just getting out of the Army and all, I
don't know. Things look different to me.

2110
01:53:08,548 --> 01:53:09,925
I was becoming ..

2111
01:53:10,165 --> 01:53:11,691
Like that guy over there.

2112
01:53:12,057 --> 01:53:15,699
Aye, aye, aye! Step right down here
friends and get your fountain pens.

2113
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:18,143
You can't afford to be without one.
Now here they are.

2114
01:53:18,363 --> 01:53:19,481
You understand, Kay?

2115
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,427
Of course I understand.

2116
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,688
You're such a child, darling.

2117
01:53:24,186 --> 01:53:27,213
You've come to hate the business you're
in and you just want to drop it and ..

2118
01:53:27,664 --> 01:53:29,839
Go and live on a beach
in Tahiti or something.

2119
01:53:29,939 --> 01:53:30,893
That's an idea.

2120
01:53:30,993 --> 01:53:32,909
Yes. But Vic, you're too good for that.

2121
01:53:33,538 --> 01:53:35,444
Why don't you sell
things you believe in?

2122
01:53:35,908 --> 01:53:37,838
And sell them with dignity and taste?

2123
01:53:38,386 --> 01:53:41,499
That's a career for any man. A career
to be proud of. What's wrong with that?

2124
01:53:42,295 --> 01:53:44,024
Nothing .. nothing at all.

2125
01:53:44,532 --> 01:53:45,233
Except.

2126
01:53:46,508 --> 01:53:48,237
This is all I have in the world.

2127
01:53:48,899 --> 01:53:52,744
It'll take a long time and all that time
no dough for clothes for you, for nurses.

2128
01:53:52,844 --> 01:53:53,916
That's it, isn't it.

2129
01:53:54,166 --> 01:53:56,426
When you say money, you mean <i>big</i> money.

2130
01:53:56,687 --> 01:53:58,359
And that just doesn't matter, Vic.

2131
01:53:58,767 --> 01:54:00,636
That's not something you base a life on.

2132
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:02,476
If you do, then you're Kimberly.

2133
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,564
But us ..?

2134
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,221
Oh, Vic.

2135
01:54:05,788 --> 01:54:07,395
You wonderful dope.

2136
01:54:07,845 --> 01:54:10,636
You and I are going to get married
just as soon as we can get a license.

2137
01:54:11,085 --> 01:54:12,988
And then you're going to
do what you want to do.

2138
01:54:13,174 --> 01:54:16,234
And that's what matters.
Doing what you want to. Not money.

2139
01:54:18,517 --> 01:54:20,796
You mean that, don't you.
─ Yes, I do.

2140
01:54:21,915 --> 01:54:23,321
Well, you asked for it.

2141
01:54:23,509 --> 01:54:24,985
Who's going to have the next one?

2142
01:54:27,576 --> 01:54:28,805
What did you do that for?

2143
01:54:29,203 --> 01:54:31,969
Now we're starting out with exactly
an even nothing in the world.

2144
01:54:32,343 --> 01:54:33,830
It's neater that way.

2145
01:55:23,551 --> 01:55:24,579
T-G
