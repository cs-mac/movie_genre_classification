<i>[This is a fictional story based on
actual historical figures and events]</i>

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,109
Did you see the guest's face?

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,960
I did open the door for him.

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,140
Our goal is the State Palace.

6
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,600
This was an unexpected event.

7
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:30,199
Use this opportunity to get a
clear look at his face.

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,310
This is a heaven-sent opportunity.

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,609
Should we make the call?

10
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,439
It is not yet time.

11
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,299
What's going on?

12
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,500
You're supposed to
be in the bridal room.

13
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,250
Tell me everything that you know.

14
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,650
What exactly have you
done to In Yub's family?

15
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,519
I came running over here to
ask to you that question.

16
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,670
You told me not to say a word in prison.

17
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,760
You knew the
State Councilor was innocent.

18
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:07,560
Yet, you stayed silent.

19
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,599
Why?

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,830
For what reason?

21
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,110
Do you suspect your father now?

22
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,960
Let go!

23
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:08,250
I have to go. Let me go!

24
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you think you're doing?

25
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,599
I have to see the King.
I have something to tell him.

26
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,969
Are you insane?

27
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,449
That's no place for you to butt into.

28
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,199
Give it back.

29
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,139
What will you do with that?

30
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,169
Those are my father's last words,
written in his blood.

31
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,590
In his last moments, he did whatever
he could to relay that message.

32
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,930
Here is the evidence
of my father's innocence.

33
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,419
If you show that to the King,
do you think he'll right this wrong?

34
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,819
It's the King's job to listen
to the plea of his citizens.

35
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,939
Citizen?

36
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,900
- You are a slave.
- Isn't a slave a citizen of this land?

37
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,460
If I feel something is unjust,
I have the right to make an appeal.

38
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,539
Get your act together.

39
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:11,280
It was the King that decreed the
death sentence upon the State Councilor.

40
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,920
In the end, it was the King who ordered
him to be killed, not anyone else.

41
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,240
Do you think an appeal from you
will make him even bat an eye?

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,110
I'm going to find out.

43
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll find evidence so irrefutable,
they won't be able to dismiss it.

44
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,730
I'll find the real traitors and
bring them to the King.

45
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,000
I will avenge the unjust and
bloody death of my father!

46
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,800
Lift your head.

47
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,500
Your daughter was pregnant with
my child when she disappeared?

48
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,699
Yes, Sire.

49
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,230
Why has she kept this from me?

50
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,889
The Queen had sent her
away to another household

51
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,529
and kept her under close watch.

52
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:20,379
She wasn't been able to find a way.

53
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,970
She wasn't afraid to
lose her lowly life, but...

54
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,790
She was in fear of losing your child,
so she has been on the run.

55
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,980
Can you prove that what
you are saying is true?

56
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,339
This is what you put in your hair
before you became King.

57
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,470
I was told that you gave it to my
daughter as a token of affection.

58
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,410
When she received this...

59
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,360
I recall that she cried tears of joy.

60
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,689
The other half is in the
child's possession.

61
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:11,399
When the child was born,
he had a birthmark on his shoulder.

62
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,370
You will be able to verify
the child with the birthmark

63
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,310
and the other half of the hairpin.

64
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,980
Then...

65
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,189
where have the mother and son gone?

66
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,860
They were taken in by
a group of merchants, but...

67
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,410
they are people who never
stay in one place.

68
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,000
I lost contact long ago.

69
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,540
You must find them and bring them to me.

70
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,360
If I can find that child...

71
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,279
Then the ones who tried
to tamper with my bloodline...

72
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,240
The Queen and the in-laws will have to
answer for the crime they committed.

73
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,870
I will do my best to follow your order.

74
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,670
Eun Ki.

75
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,449
Father... are you okay with
sacrificing an innocent man?

76
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,500
The State Councilor's crime's are
determined by the nation.

77
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,000
Your father just...
wanted to keep you alive.

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,360
That is what a parent is.

79
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,779
She was about to be my bride.

80
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,339
We were going to
spend our lives together.

81
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,809
A noble man wanted to
run away with a servant girl.

82
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,269
What parent in their right
mind would allow that?

83
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:39,860
Son!

84
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,330
How can you be here on the
first night of your marriage?

85
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,029
Do your duty as a newlywed husband.

86
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,580
If our two families' relationship sours
because of your rash behavior

87
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,730
how will you take responsibility for it?

88
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,629
I will never... let this go.

89
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,440
Please tell the truth.

90
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,100
Tell the truth directly to In Yub.

91
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,470
Please head back carefully.

92
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,029
Wait just a little bit longer.

93
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,899
He must have had a lot to drink,
so he's getting some air.

94
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,269
Ba Woo is looking for him.

95
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:03,279
It's alright, Mother.

96
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:09,090
It's not so bad,
getting some last moments with you.

97
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,580
Master! Where have you been?

98
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,580
Master! Master!

99
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,799
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,759
How could you disappear
on your first night?

101
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,929
It's none of your business.

102
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,779
Kim Eun Ki.

103
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,779
I cannot let you off the hook anymore.

104
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,470
Didn't you already know?

105
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,480
Didn't you marry her off
knowing full well how I felt?

106
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:57,090
So... you think you can behave in
this irresponsible manner?

107
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,649
- Is that what you're saying?
- This is me doing my best.

108
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,820
Be satisfied that I've accepted
this marriage at all.

109
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,690
Don't expect anything more from me.

110
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,159
Where have you been all this time?

111
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,769
Master?

112
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,899
My hairpiece is getting heavy.

113
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,700
Isn't it hard?

114
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,519
Waiting for someone who isn't coming?

115
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,230
Isn't it difficult for you?

116
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,830
Because I feel like it's killing me.

117
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,299
What's the reason for
movement from the King?

118
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,509
The Defense Minister had been ordered
to find the whereabouts of a woman.

119
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,799
There was no way to find her,
but her mother was alive.

120
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,990
Today, that old woman and
the King had a meeting.

121
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,240
So, it's a woman that's
connected to the King?

122
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,480
I suppose.

123
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,600
Once I can verify, I will let you know.

124
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,940
Have you secured the item
that In Yub is holding?

125
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,610
I've confirmed it.

126
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,539
Get it and take care of it quietly.

127
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,639
The timing is just right, isn't it?

128
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,059
Her former betrothed one has just
married another woman.

129
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,850
She will be full of grief.

130
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,769
She will be miserable
enough to commit suicide.

131
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,860
I've seen the note,
but I could not decipher it.

132
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,730
In order to understand its meaning,
we need to keep her alive.

133
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,340
It wouldn't be wise to wait too long.

134
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,129
If Moo Myung cannot take care of her,
you will do it.

135
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,269
Keep a close eye on them.

136
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,340
Are you saying you
don't trust Moo Myung?

137
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,370
Even if it wasn't for real...

138
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,090
he considered marrying In Yub.

139
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,379
Moo Myung is not acting like himself.

140
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,850
Moo Myung has never shunned his duties.

141
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,570
That's why he's dangerous right now.

142
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,080
He's a person who has never
behaved this way before.

143
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,340
You girls are eating by yourselves?

144
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,690
You should share the food with everyone.

145
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,940
We brought some food over a while ago.

146
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Let's see...

147
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,120
No one's sharing their food with me.

148
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,889
- I wonder why.
- Huh?

149
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:19,179
Why won't anyone eat with you?

150
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,960
Well, because... well...

151
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,029
I haven't been here long...

152
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,080
It's not because you
don't know your place?

153
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,480
We got ourselves a
fighting rooster here.

154
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,000
Didn't you two work in the same house?

155
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,889
It's not enough that you spoke so rudely
to the master that you formerly served.

156
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,139
You have the nerve to beat her,
and then even try to marry her?

157
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,000
You've got to be crazy!
You must be insane!

158
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,470
Is she still my master?

159
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,070
She and I are now at the same level.

160
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,860
So why do I have to crawl at her feet?

161
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,049
This is why you shouldn't bring
beasts into your home.

162
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,429
Didn't you think of Lord Gook at all?

163
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:55,769
- He was so good to us!
- That's right.

164
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,570
I didn't.
I didn't think about him at all!

165
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,990
Nobleman or not, when you fall...
you can't do anything.

166
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,529
What did I do wrong?

167
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,649
Just because you have a mouth,
don't speak so freely!

168
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,169
- You bastard!
- Get your act together.

169
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,580
You and Miss In Yub are both just maids.

170
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,480
Jerk! You deserve a death sentence!

171
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,620
Poong Yi isn't technically wrong.

172
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,610
I'm going to hit you again!

173
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,470
Just eat this.

174
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,099
Yes.

175
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:59,539
Did you sleep well?
Did you have good dreams?

176
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:03,369
Last night we had a very
special guest come to our home.

177
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:08,319
Yes, the King came by.

178
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,430
Is that true?

179
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,420
He left the palace in order to
congratulate you on your wedding.

180
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,970
Who else in Joseon can say they've
received such a guest?

181
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,430
How unfortunate.

182
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,160
I missed an opportunity
to meet the King.

183
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,240
Isn't that right, Husband?

184
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,309
Out of all the academics,
the King has high expectations for you.

185
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:34,450
He's had interest in you since he heard
about your trip to Ham Heung.

186
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:39,410
If that's the case...
I better focus on my studies.

187
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,880
I may not be able to perform my duties
as a newlywed husband due to my studies.

188
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,230
- I hope you understand.
- Still...

189
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,059
It wouldn't do to keep a
new bride in solitude.

190
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,410
That is not how a man should behave.

191
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,089
Wife, I'm sure he would not do that.

192
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,869
I'm sure you don't feel
comfortable living here.

193
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:05,259
Think of it as your own home,
and live comfortably.

194
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,910
Thank you for your kindness.

195
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,900
Wait.

196
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,690
My son-in-law is eager to
get back to his studies.

197
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,400
But what is my son up to?

198
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,349
I wonder if he's awake.

199
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,069
Is this even possible? Really?

200
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,450
I need to spread this around.

201
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,430
Yoon Seo, are you still sleeping?

202
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:42,619
What were you doing?

203
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,180
Were you reading a book?

204
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:54,140
Yes, well...

205
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,609
I'm curious,
what kind of book is my son reading?

206
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:58,779
Have you eaten?

207
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,920
- Father, I...
- Here, let's see.

208
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,579
You were looking at a picture book?

209
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:11,039
Do you intend to take the National Exam
or some sort of a courtesan exam?

210
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,509
- What is this, so early in the morning?
- Father, the thing is...

211
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:17,609
It's too early in the morning for this!

212
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,920
Don't you look at your
brother-in-law and feel anything?

213
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,279
You're family now, and people
will start comparing you two!

214
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,339
Father, I am working very hard.

215
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,849
But, you need a lot of good luck
to pass the National Exam.

216
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,769
So maybe you can recommend
me for a government post...

217
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,799
A son of a Defense Minister?

218
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,559
Getting a job through
connections is a shame!

219
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,299
Not a glory!

220
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:57,049
I'm going to confiscate this dirty thing

221
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:01,670
so please, get your act together!
Focus on your studies.

222
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,779
That crazy bastard!

223
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,609
Oh, wow!

224
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,099
Oh my...

225
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,880
What was the reason my husband was
so late to enter the bridal room?

226
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,960
Was it because of In Yub?

227
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,730
The thing is...

228
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:54,289
Before he was supposed to enter,
he was briefly with In Yub.

229
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,940
He disappeared after that.

230
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,990
What were you thinking,
not even informing me?

231
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,829
If something like that happened,
you should have come and found me.

232
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,970
I sat alone in the bridal room
like a dummy.

233
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,069
And I waited.

234
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:15,480
I'm sorry, Miss.

235
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,680
What did the two of them do?
What did they talk about?

236
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,900
From now on, watch them like a hawk.

237
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,930
Do not leave anything out, and tell me
everything going on between them.

238
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,029
Do not worry, Miss.

239
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:41,549
I'll keep my eyes on her and make sure
she doesn't go near Master Eun Ki.

240
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,650
No, don't.

241
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:48,250
The heart yearns for
what it cannot have.

242
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,599
It will be easier to
manage what I can see.

243
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:56,079
It would serve me better to
lay out the straw mat for them.

244
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:57,109
Excuse me?

245
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:01,829
When my husband returns,
get In Yub to attend on him.

246
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:03,609
Do you really mean it?

247
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:08,049
I want to observe what they do when
they're confronted with one another.

248
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,180
Which one is my husband's?

249
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,420
The one I'm making.
Do you want to make it yourself?

250
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,430
No.

251
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,400
- What did you put in?
- It's just a little something.

252
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,799
- Hello.
- Good day.

253
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:48,329
These are food preferences for Eun Ki,
sent by the in-laws.

254
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,160
He doesn't like overly seasoned food.

255
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,039
- And he prefers fish over beef.
- I'll take that into account.

256
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:59,470
Someone else should be
preparing the medicine.

257
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,880
Sincerity is half of the
process behind the preparation.

258
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,240
What is that, Mother?

259
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,250
It's brain medicine for my
son and my son-in-law.

260
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,980
How nice would it be if
your brother and your husband

261
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,710
both pass the National Exam?

262
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,299
Just let In Yub prepare the medicine.

263
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:24,250
The have their long history,
she has more sincerity than anyone here.

264
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,710
That makes sense.

265
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:35,640
In Yub.

266
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,859
I trust you'll prepare my
husband's medicine well.

267
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:56,369
Your Majesty.

268
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,079
Is it true that you could not
sleep last night, as well?

269
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,450
I've developed insomnia ever since
my father left for Ham Heung.

270
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,930
Day or night, I cannot fall asleep.

271
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,750
Could there be anything
more miserable than this?

272
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,289
With that in mind,
I'd like to prescribe a solution.

273
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,609
A prescription for insomnia?

274
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:31,569
I've brought a master musician.

275
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:33,960
Would you like to hear?

276
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:36,990
No, thank you.

277
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,869
I assume it will be
a female entertainer.

278
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,109
This palace is already
overflowing with women.

279
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,170
Then, I shall rescind the offer.

280
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,829
I apologize for interrupting...
Your Majesty.

281
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,230
Though I am a female entertainer...

282
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,210
I am not here as a woman.

283
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,990
You are out of line.
How dare you speak without permission?

284
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,569
That's alright.

285
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:08,650
Tell her to enter.

286
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,950
I will not come in and see the King.

287
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,480
Instead, allow me to play
my music from out here.

288
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:21,940
That sounds good.

289
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,569
Just play your music and leave.

290
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:27,670
<i>Those are my father's last words,
written in his blood.</i>

291
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,799
<i>In his last moments, he did whatever
he could to relay that message.</i>

292
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:36,920
Here is evidence
of my father's innocence.

293
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:46,569
You all better wipe
the plates thoroughly.

294
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:50,089
You better not leave water spots.

295
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:53,470
- Here, drink this.
- Hey, I want some water too.

296
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,059
Get it yourself.

297
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,180
What's with the favoritism?

298
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,670
- What is this? It's bitter.
- Just drink it.

299
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,380
- It's good for you.
- What is it?

300
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,670
It's herbal medicine!

301
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,829
Why would a slave get herbal medicine?

302
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,849
We prepared some in the kitchen.

303
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,670
It's a special medicine that's supposed
to make you really smart.

304
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,009
It's not like I'm taking an exam,
what would be the point?

305
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:16,279
You can drink it and get smart yourself.

306
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:19,009
So, you're giving this to me?

307
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,900
Wow! I'm getting more clever!

308
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:25,400
Hey!

309
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm getting so smart!

310
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:33,289
Hey! Don't laugh!

311
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,869
Why you little...

312
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,410
Ji Bu...

313
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,430
Lim Jae Woo...

314
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,619
Jung...

315
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,019
Betrothed one...

316
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:36,430
Father... innocent...

317
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,839
Knowledge...

318
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:42,829
Father of betrothed?

319
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,299
I have a favor to ask.

320
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,369
You know the dagger that you gave me?

321
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:06,089
Teach me how to use it.

322
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:23,390
The main purpose of a dagger is...

323
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,720
to stab your target.

324
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,349
You can use it to make
wounds in specific places.

325
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,880
Being a woman,
if you can't win on your first blow...

326
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,549
you won't get a second chance.

327
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:40,079
So, make your first blow a fatal one.

328
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,789
Right here... the heart.

329
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,789
When you're stabbing,
hold the dagger with both hands.

330
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:56,470
Use one palm to cover the
top of the dagger's handle.

331
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,420
Next, hold it close to
your body and stab.

332
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,390
Like this... in one motion.

333
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,690
Here. You try.

334
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:09,219
What did your father's last words say?

335
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,530
He said that he is innocent.

336
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,030
Will that amount to anything
without a witness or a corroborator?

337
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,269
There is someone who
holds the key to everything.

338
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:41,329
Yoon Ok.

339
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,429
Did you really complete your
first night together?

340
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,210
Of course, Mother.

341
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,579
Do not keep secrets from your mother.

342
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:57,909
There can't be anything
I don't know about.

343
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:01,949
Lady, Master Eun Ki has arrived.

344
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:05,539
- Alright. Has he had his dinner?
- Yes.

345
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:07,760
He had his dinner at Sung Kyun Kwan.

346
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,969
I'll send a maid to bring him
water to wash his hands.

347
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:14,179
- A maid will attend on him.
- Yes, Miss.

348
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:18,130
Give him his herbal medicine
before he sleeps.

349
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,659
The medicine we prepared is
in the kitchen, isn't it?

350
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,159
Tell them to bring that out.

351
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,880
Why don't you come too, Mother?

352
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Me?

353
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,210
You went out of your
way to prepare it.

354
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,610
With your encouragement,
he'll be able to study harder.

355
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,250
Where have you been this time?

356
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:55,389
Master Eun Ki is home.
Go and give him this.

357
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,840
- Me?
- It was Miss Yoon Ok's orders.

358
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:25,480
Master... I have brought
water for you to wash yourself.

359
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,530
They said you just arrived.

360
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,289
Come in.

361
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:11,880
Why does my father compare me to Eun Ki?

362
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,440
Why won't he just use
his power to get me in?

363
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,000
Why is he making me
take this National Exam?

364
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,460
Dan Ji!

365
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,539
Dan Ji, Dan Ji!

366
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:25,079
Dan Ji, Dan Ji, Dan Ji!

367
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,679
Come here. Sit down.

368
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,719
What brings you by?

369
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,840
Are we playing a surprise-visit game?

370
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,829
I'm totally open to it.

371
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:38,389
Give this back to Lady Kang.

372
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,989
I'm so scared, I can't do this anymore.

373
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:44,860
Okay.

374
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,400
No matter what the origin, I was going
to accept it since it was from you.

375
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,329
But I'm so scared of Lady Kang,
I can't even wear it.

376
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,269
I have no use for this thing.

377
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:56,329
That's right! If you get caught,
you'd be in big trouble.

378
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:58,579
Wow! Good thing we avoided that.

379
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,280
Dan Ji, Dan Ji, Dan Ji...

380
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Dan Ji.

381
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,869
I will get a new ring, just for you.

382
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:08,900
Forget it!

383
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,369
How could you be so clueless
about a man's pure heart?

384
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,099
A thief with a pure heart?

385
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,280
Thief... thief?

386
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,130
I temporarily borrowed that
from my wife just for you.

387
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:29,349
Heaven is my witness that I
have nothing to be ashamed of.

388
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,420
Dan Ji... Dan Ji?

389
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,829
Husband... it's me.

390
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:47,929
Your mother has prepared
some herbal medicine for you.

391
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:51,849
Oh, Wife!
Please just wait a moment, Wife.

392
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
- I'm coming in.
- Wait one moment.

393
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,519
What are you waiting for?

394
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,369
- Excuse me?
- Aren't you here to wash me?

395
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,179
<i>I made you a promise.</i>

396
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,199
<i>After the wedding,
you would wear two rings.</i>

397
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,760
<i>We'll run away together.</i>

398
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:50,699
<i>There's no other way.</i>

399
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:54,449
<i>If we're to be together,
this is the only way.</i>

400
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,840
<i>It ends here.</i>

401
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:04,130
<i>Your fate, and mine...</i>

402
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,559
<i>ends here.</i>

403
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,869
<i>Remember all our days past...</i>

404
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,030
<i>and please forget about me.</i>

405
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,199
<i>I hope that you will be happy someday.</i>

406
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,010
Should I prepare your bedding?

407
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,679
Why are you learning how to use a knife?

408
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,719
Because I must fight.

409
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,190
I'm going to exonerate my father
of the false charges.

410
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,909
If you don't need anything,
I'll get going.

411
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,559
Eun Ki!

412
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,829
It seems there is someone inside.

413
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,019
I sent in a maid to serve him.

414
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:57,550
- Why are you doing this?
- Take out your knife!

415
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,800
Stab me.

416
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,630
You can stop me.

417
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:08,880
- I said stab me.
- Eun Ki...

418
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,190
Kill me now...
And get your revenge against my father.

419
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,769
Mother, I think we should
come back another time.

420
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:41,909
It's not the right time to...

421
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,670
What in the world is this?

422
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:01,590
Let's go, Mother.

423
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,260
I'm sure there is an explanation.

424
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,590
It could just be
a misunderstanding.

425
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,519
In Yub!

426
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,630
I was the one who instigated it.
Punish me instead.

427
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,610
You dare to lay your hands
on my daughter's husband?

428
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,849
Even as a lowly servant,
you still do not know your place.

429
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:25,789
You've made this mess,
and now you will pay the price.

430
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:27,659
Follow me out, right this instant.

431
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,230
I'm sorry about this, son-in-law.

432
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,500
These are the actions of a
tactless maid, please understand.

433
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,849
In Yub!

434
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:49,320
If you continue to interfere,
In Yub will not be safe.

435
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,519
Oh my! Didn't I mention that it's hot?

436
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:15,309
Mother made this medicine so that you
can focus on your National Exam studies.

437
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:18,800
I added a little something
else in there.

438
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,659
- What did you add?
- Dodder grass seed.

439
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,679
What's that, exactly?

440
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,360
It's a libido booster.

441
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,710
Wife, I can't eat things like this!

442
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,590
Even without this, I'm about to
break my chamber pot every night.

443
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,829
I might not be highly
ranked in studies, but...

444
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:45,800
This down here... no joke!

445
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,380
What! That's nonsense.

446
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:54,010
Since we've been married, we've slept
together twice, maybe three times.

447
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,579
They were annual events.

448
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:59,780
A noble lady like you shouldn't
be saying things like that.

449
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,630
Well, honestly...

450
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,420
I have something I need
to talk to you about.

451
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,519
I'm in the middle of studying right now.

452
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:11,110
- Later, we'll talk later.
- I've waited a really long time!

453
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,920
When are we going to have a child?

454
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,130
Once I pass the National Exam,
we'll really get down to it.

455
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:22,860
Come on now.
You've had your medicine.

456
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,179
Come on!

457
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:28,690
I'm really getting into my studies now.

458
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,920
I think I can pass the exam.

459
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,760
Forget about that!

460
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:36,789
Wife! Wife! Stop!

461
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,179
Oh my!

462
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,460
What is this... ouch.

463
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,409
What am I going to do?

464
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:11,059
My ring...

465
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,880
You!

466
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,440
Bring the Head Maid and Moo Myung.

467
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:36,389
Don't do this!

468
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:39,510
- Don't do this.
- Miss, please let go!

469
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,449
What's this all about?

470
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,469
Mother! Please punish Dan Ji!

471
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:54,219
This wench has taken everything from me.

472
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,059
She stole my ring, and my husband!

473
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:59,630
No Lady! I did not steal the ring.

474
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,389
Oh no! Dan Ji!

475
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:03,760
What are you going to do?

476
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,139
The moral fiber of the servants' hall
has reached an all-time low.

477
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:20,590
You two lowly slaves dare to covet the
men in this household?

478
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,610
Your master's husband's at that!

479
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,599
Dan Ji even committed robbery.

480
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,449
Lady, why are you doing this?

481
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:28,894
I told you,
Master Yoon Seo gave it to me.

482
00:47:28,894 --> 00:47:30,340
Shut your mouth!

483
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,710
You hid it, knowing who it belonged to.

484
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,460
You are no different than a thief!

485
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,099
Lady, this is all my fault.

486
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,969
I did not raise my daughter properly.

487
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:45,559
For the crime of robbery and misconduct,
Dan Ji will be branded and flogged.

488
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:49,710
For the crime of lewd conduct,
In Yub will be flogged.

489
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,599
- Lady, please!
- Let me go at once!

490
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,079
Lady, for my sake...
please forgive her this once.

491
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,840
Do not do to Dan Ji
what you did to Ok Yi.

492
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,559
I've treated you too well.
You don't know when you've gone too far.

493
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,469
Do not speak so rashly.

494
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,969
Is Moo Myung out there?

495
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:23,309
A servant guilty of committing the crime
of robbery will be branded in the face.

496
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:24,869
I assume you know this.

497
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,429
Lady!

498
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,030
Forgive her! Lady!

499
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,380
Do not forget this
moment of hot suffering.

500
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,369
And do not touch another person's
belongings ever again.

501
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:41,579
Brand her forehead!

502
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:48,239
Head Maid! Save our Dan Ji. Please!

503
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:14,420
Lady!

504
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:35,110
No, you can't! Mom!

505
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:52,340
You should not be interfering!

506
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,610
Forgive Dan Ji, Mother.

507
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,900
- Husband!
- Dan Ji is not a thief.

508
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,750
- I gave it to her.
- Do not get involved.

509
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,590
- Get out of here!
- I was the one who was wrong!

510
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,599
I stole my wife's ring.

511
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,119
Lady... Dan Ji's mother needs
medical attention.

512
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:13,369
We can postpone the punishment
of the two for tomorrow.

513
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:15,599
We must move Dan Ji's mother.

514
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:20,849
In Yub and Dan Ji will be
locked up down here.

515
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:22,869
The punishment will continue tomorrow.

516
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,210
Yoon Seo and your wife... follow me!

517
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,360
Get me some cold water.
Bring soju and tofu too.

518
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,560
Disrobe her and check on the wound.
Use cold water to cool it down.

519
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,290
Put the cold tofu on it.
Check the inner house kitchen.

520
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,760
We have some badger oil left.
Bring it. It will help with the wound.

521
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,850
Yes.

522
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,820
You can't do it.

523
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,730
You can't take my Dan Ji.

524
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,510
You can't do it to my Dan Ji.

525
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,710
You're not going to kill her, right?

526
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,990
You're not going to kill her
like you killed Ok Yi, right?

527
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,190
Is she for real?

528
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,120
Be careful what you say.

529
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:34,280
Your mother was quite amazing.

530
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,090
Throwing her body in
the way to save you.

531
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,590
She was scared I'd end up like Ok Yi.

532
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,200
Who is that?

533
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,940
The Head Maid brought her up too.

534
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,050
She was one of us maids,
before you came.

535
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:57,050
This Ok Yi, she was like us?

536
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,390
When something like this happens,
is it always Moo Myung who punishes?

537
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:10,800
A noble would never get
blood on their hands.

538
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,600
How does he do it, even with orders?
We are all family now, after all.

539
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,720
You're a bit strange.

540
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,440
You seem like a real maid now.

541
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,600
I am a real maid.

542
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:37,550
I wonder if my mother is alright.

543
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,410
This is unfair. This is so unfair!

544
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,510
It was Master Yoon Seo
who came after me first.

545
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,450
And I'm the villain in all of this?

546
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:52,060
We were in this all together,
but only the maids' life gets ruined.

547
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,520
And what wrong has my mother done?

548
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,570
How hot it must have been...

549
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,620
How much pain she must have felt...

550
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:29,880
Eun...

551
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,260
Wait. Where are we going?

552
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,290
Let's go inside.

553
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,870
My father has agreed to save you.

554
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:27,830
You know very well that he isn't
someone who would do that.

555
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,790
He will keep his promise.

556
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,850
I threw my whole life away for it.

557
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,390
I'm sure you have a
lot to ask him as well.

558
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:55,470
<i>The father of your betrothed
knows that I am innocent.</i>

559
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:08,420
Okay.

560
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,390
Let's go inside.

561
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:32,220

<i>You're like a dog that fetches even
his own family members to his master.</i>

563
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,010
<i>What kind of person is
Lord Kim Chi Kwon?</i>

564
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:50,840
She will come to realize her
fate as a maid is set in stone.

565
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:54,170
<i>Fine. Once I create the perfect time,
I will return.</i>

566
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:57,660
Everything in this house is mine...
forever.

567
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,810
Where do you plan on selling us off to?

568
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:04,690
Look forward to it. It's a place
you'll get a lot of admiration.

569
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:07,140
I have determined where
one of you will go.

570
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,160
You two can decide
which one of you will go.

571
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,210
It must be a son...

572
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,260
They are looking for a surrogate woman.

573
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,660
What is this nonsense you're saying!
