220
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:06,460
    16? HE'S JUST               
    A KID, MAN.                 

221
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:09,130
COPS KICK THE SHIT              
OUT OF KIDS, TOO.               

222
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,400
         WE'RE FIGHTING        
        FOR OUR FREEDOM...     

223
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,136
    Judge: THE BLACK COMMUNITY  
        WAS A FAMILY,           

224
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,738
        A STRONG FORCE          
    TO BE RECKONED WITH.        

225
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,407
        THE GHETTO              
    WAS NEVER HEAVEN.           

226
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,409
    WE HAD OUR CROOKS           
        AND DRUNKS              

227
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,911
    AND THE ESTABLISHMENT       
        EXPLOITING US.          

228
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,846
        AS LONG AS WE           
    SUFFERED IN SILENCE,        

229
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,848
        THE AUTHORITIES         
        LEFT US ALONE.          

230
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,418
         WE SHALL NOT          
        BE MOVED...            

231
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,019
            BUT...              

232
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:36,257
    THAT SILENT-SUFFERING SHIT  
        WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE.    

233
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,259
    YOU SAID ALL THE PANTHERS   
    WOULD BE HERE.              

234
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,829
WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.   
THAT'S BOBBY SEALE.             

235
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:43,530
            AND THAT--          
            THAT'S HUEY.        

236
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,433
    SHIT, AIN'T TOO MANY OF YOU 
    MOTHERFUCKERS OUT THERE.    

237
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,269
HEY, MAN, IT ONLY TAKES         
A SINGLE GRAIN OF SAND          

238
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,770
TO MOVE THE WORLD.              

239
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,506
         WE SHALL NOT          
        BE MOVED...            

240
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:54,442
            WHAT THE SAM HILL   
            IS THIS?            

241
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,077
                A VIGIL FOR     
                SOME PICKANINNY 

242
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:57,278
                GOT HIT HERE.   

243

        BADGE NUMBERS, Y'ALL.

00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:02,516
    Cop: VIGIL, MY ASS.

    NOW LISTEN UP.              

246
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,953
    YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS       

247
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:08,622
        TO DISPERSE             
    AND RETURN TO YOUR HOMES.   

248
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,424
        FAILURE TO DO SO        

249
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:13,361
        WILL RESULT             
    IN YOUR IMMEDIATE ARREST.   

250
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,035
         WE SHALL NOT         

251
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,404
         WE SHALL NOT          
        BE MOVED

         WE SHALL NOT         

253
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:28,575
     WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED    

254
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:31,645
     JUST LIKE A TREE         

255
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:34,048
         THAT'S PLANTED        
        BY THE WATER           

256
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,484
            YOU ARE RESISTING   
            ARREST.

00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:40,621
     WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED    

258
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:45,993
     WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED    

259
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:48,462
         WE SHALL NOT--

00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,463

        HEY, Y'ALL, THE COPS    
        COVERING THEIR BADGES.

00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,103
        THEY CAN'T DO THAT!     

264
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,371
                    MOM!

HEY, LOOK, THIS OBSERVER        
STUFF AIN'T WORKING.            

269
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:03,770
THE COPS COVER THEIR BADGES,    

270
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,540
AND EVEN IF WE DO REPORT IT,

271
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,009
        I KNOW WE NEED          
    TO STAY DISCIPLINED.

275
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:16,950
        WE MUST TURN            
    THE OTHER CHEEK, BROTHERS.  

276
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,452
OH, MAN.

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,455
    REMEMBER, THE MEEK          
    SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH.    

278
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,457
        WAIT, WAIT, HOLD.       
        LOOK, FELLAS,

280
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,662
        IS PRAY                 
    FOR THEIR FORGIVENESS.      

281
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,264
        THEY KNOW NOT           
        WHAT THEY DO.           

282
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,765
            HEY, NO OFFENSE,    
            REVEREND,

            PRACTICING ON US    

284
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,301
            FOR 400 YEARS.      

285
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:37,538
            THEY KNOW EXACTLY   
            WHAT THEY DOING.    

286
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,840
        BROTHER MALCOLM SAID    
        WE NEED TO STOP SINGING 

287
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:42,643
        AND START SWINGING.     

288
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,978
Y'ALL CAN RANT AND RAVE,        

289
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,380
BUT IT'S THE POLICE             
WHO GOT THE GUN.                

290
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,482
    SHIT, IF BLACK FOLKS        
    HAD GUNS,                   

291
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,985
    WE'D PROBABLY SHOOT         
    EACH OTHER WITH THEM.       

292
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:52,486
AW!                             
                        TCH!    

293
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:55,489
    LORD, WHY DON'T THEY        
    SHOW US NO RESPECT?         

294
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,491
        BECAUSE THEY DON'T      
        HAVE TO.                

295
00:12:57,558 --> 00:13:00,394
    THEY THINK THEY CAN         
    BRUTALIZE US AND LOCK US UP 

296
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,296
        WITHOUT A JURY          
        OF OUR PEERS            

297
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,165
        'CAUSE WE'RE IGNORANT   
        TO THE LAWS.            

298
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:07,101
        WE NEED TO ORGANIZE,    
        KEEP OUR SHIT CORRECT,  

299
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,702
        AND EXERCISE OUR        
        CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,004
        AS CITIZENS

        AND ARM OURSELVES.      

302
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,908
        THEN IF THEY TRY        
        TO BRUTALIZE US         

303
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:15,442
        OR VIOLATE OUR RIGHTS,  

304
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,677
        WE GOT A RIGHT AND MEANS
        TO DEFEND OURSELVES.    

305
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:18,279
WHAT THE HELL                   
THE BOY SAYING?                 

306
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:20,747
            THE MAN SAID        
            WE CAN CARRY GUNS.  

307
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:21,748
            IT'S LEGAL.         

308
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,017
        THAT'S RIGHT.           

309
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,585
Y'ALL GOING TO                  
GET GUNS AND SHOOT COPS?        

310
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:27,587
            NO, IT AIN'T ABOUT  
            SHOOTING COPS.      

311
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,456
            IT'S ABOUT GETTING  
            THE MAN'S ATTENTION 

312
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:31,625
            AND SHOWING         
            OUR COMMUNITY       

313
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:34,795
        THAT WE AIN'T GOT TO    
        TAKE THIS SHIT NO MORE. 

314
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:36,396
    THE ESTABLISHMENT,          
    IT DON'T LISTEN             

315
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:38,498
    WHEN WE SING, PRAY, OR BEG. 

316
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,501
BUT THEY SEE SOME DISCIPLINED   
    BROTHERS WITH GUNS,         

317
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:44,404
THEY'LL KNOW THE BLACK PANTHER  
    PARTY FOR SELF DEFENSE      

318
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:47,507
    IS SERIOUS ABOUT DEFENDING  
    THE RIGHTS OF OUR PEOPLE.

ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!        

322
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:55,115
        [LAUGHTER]              

323
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,284
        FREE AT LAST,           
    MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.    

324
00:13:57,352 --> 00:14:01,188
    GOD HAS DELIVERED US        
    FROM THE LION'S DEN.        

325
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,493
            REVEREND, WE BLACK

            A STOPLIGHT.

        OF SHINES               

408
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,163

        THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS.  

411
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,902
IS IT POSSIBLE WE CAN           
MAKE A DEAL WITH THEM?          

412
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,439

611
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,774
     THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SERVE
     THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

619
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:27,457
     THE PIGS. THEY'RE SUPPOSED 
     TO PROTECT AND SERVE.      

620
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,660
    THEY DON'T DO NOTHING       
    BUT PATROL AND CONTROL.     

621
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,962
WE CALL THEM PIGS

00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:10,068
                Judge: YEAH.    

1306
00:53:10,136 --> 00:53:12,437
ALL RIGHT. I EXPECT             
TO HEAR FROM YOU REAL SOON.     

1307
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:16,441
HUEY NEWTON TAKES A CRAP,       
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.        

1308
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:18,944
OTHERWISE, I'M GOING            
TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU.        

1309
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:21,947
I WON'T BE NEAR AS FRIENDLY     
AS I WAS TODAY.                 

1310
00:53:22,014 --> 00:53:23,949
JUDGE, YOU GOT TO               
REMEMBER SOMETHING--            

1311
00:53:24,016 --> 00:53:26,952
YOU GOT A LOT AT STAKE          
HERE.                           

1312
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:29,955
LOOK, THE PANTHERS              
ARE GOING TO LOSE.              

1313
00:53:30,022 --> 00:53:31,456
THE ONLY QUESTION IS            

1314
00:53:31,523 --> 00:53:34,459
ARE YOU GOING TO LOSE           
ALONG WITH THEM?                

1315
00:53:34,526 --> 00:53:36,161
        YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE    
        YOUR FUTURE,            

1316
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:37,462
         YOUR MOTHER, YOUR LIFE.

1317
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:39,697
        NOW THINK ABOUT IT.     

1318
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:43,868
ALL RIGHT, SOLDIER,             
GO ON. GET OUT OF HERE.         

1319
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:44,902
    GO ON.                      

1320
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:52,010
    Bobby: HOW Y'ALL DOING      
        OUT THERE?              

1321

        ALL RIGHT!              

1322
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:54,846
        YOU KNOW,               
    IT'S INTERESTING.           

1323
00:53:54,913 --> 00:53:56,814
    JUST AS BLACK PEOPLE        
    START TO EXERCISE           

1324
00:53:56,882 --> 00:53:58,883
    THEIR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS,   

1325
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:01,352
        THE PIGS                
    WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW.     

1326
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:04,355
        WE AIN'T GOING          
    TO MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM    

1327
00:54:04,424 --> 00:54:06,858
    TO HAVE NO UNARMED TARGETS, 
            ARE WE?             

1328

    AND ENJOY YOURSELVES

    IS YOUR COMMUNITY.          

1330
00:54:11,263 --> 00:54:12,297
     IT'S OUR COMMUNITY.        

1331
00:54:12,364 --> 00:54:13,799
    IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.     

1332
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:14,733
        THAT'S RIGHT.           

1333
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:18,036
    JUST DO ME ONE FAVOR.       

1334
00:54:18,103 --> 00:54:20,539
    SAVE ME SOME OF THAT        
    BARBECUE OUT THERE.         

1335

         OH-HO OH-HO          

1338
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:39,841

1339
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,376
     YOU'LL STILL BE YOU      

1340
00:54:42,444 --> 00:54:44,879
 ONE THAT'S DONE               
ALL THE THINGS

        FOR YOU TO BEAR        

1344
00:54:52,454 --> 00:54:54,355
 THINGS TO GO THROUGH         

1345
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:57,058
 IF YOU'RE GOIN'

            WONDERFUL PICNIC.

    GUNS, WE'LL BE STRAIGHT.

COMING LATER.

1354
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:14,242
HUEY, WE GOT                    
29 PANTHERS GOING,

1357
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:20,682
    THIS IS GOING TO BE         
    A COLOSSAL EVENT.           

1358
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,184
    WE'RE GOING TO TURN         
    THE CAPITAL OUT.            

1359
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,686
                FAR OUT, BABY.

1363
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,025
YOU AIN'T GOING                 
WITH US, HUEY.

        OF US AS IT IS.         

1366
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:39,967
THE PIGS DON'T KNOW             
HOW MANY PANTHERS THERE ARE.    

1367
00:55:40,035 --> 00:55:42,437
IF BOTH OF US SHOW UP,          
THEY MIGHT PUT 2 AND 2 TOGETHER.

1368
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,971
WE AIN'T EVEN 100 STRONG,

IT'S DECIDED. YOU STAY.

1378
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,361
    HEY, JUDGE,

    ROUSTING YOU. YOU OK?       

1380
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,834
YEAH, MAN.                      
IT WAS JUST HARASSMENT.         

1381
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,470

        PIGS, MAN, THEY BE      
        GRABBING AT ANYTHING.   

1383

SO WHAT'S THE PIG'S NAME?       

1384
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,481
                BRIMMER.        

1385
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,983
YOU GOT TO STAY COOL

ICY-GODDAMN-COOL.

THE STRONGEST WEAPON WE GOT.

LET ME GUESS. THAT PIG          
WANTS YOU TO CALL HIM           

1389
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,493
AND TELL HIM                    
WHAT WE'RE DOING.               

1390
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,494
                    YEP.        

1391
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,996

JUST THAT,                      

1392
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:46,000
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU       
WHAT TO FEED THE PIG.           

1393

            PRETTY THICK, HUEY.

FOR ALL OF US.                  

1401
00:57:07,272 --> 00:57:08,705
    WELL, ISN'T THAT NICE.

GOVERNOR, ARE YOU RUNNING       
FOR THE NATIONAL TICKET?        

1404
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:15,145
        ARE YOU KIDS            
    ALL FROM THE SAME AREA?     

1405

GOVERNOR,                       
WHAT ABOUT THE MULFORD ACT?     

1406
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:22,819
    I'D SAY THE SAME THING      
    I SAY TO ALL THE YOUTH.     

1407
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:24,321
    REMEMBER THE 3 Rs--

00:57:28,293 --> 00:57:30,227
    AND YOU CAN BECOME          
    LAWYERS, DOCTORS.           

1410
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:32,162
    THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S       
        ALL ABOUT.

A MILITANT ACTION?              

1413
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:43,023

1416
00:57:47,194 --> 00:57:48,595

    AIMED TO KEEP BLACK PEOPLE  
    DISARMED AND POWERLESS      

1420
00:57:54,669 --> 00:57:55,769
        WHILE THE RACIST

CALL THE POLICE.                
CALL THE POLICE NOW.            

1430
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,436
    YOU GUYS CAN'T...           

1431
00:59:03,504 --> 00:59:06,439
        WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS.    
        YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE. 

1432
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:08,441
WE'RE HERE TO OBSERVE           
THE ASSEMBLY.                   

1433
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:10,427
YOU TRYING TO DENY US           
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS?      

1434
00:59:13,731 --> 00:59:14,731
            MY GOD!             

1435
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:26,510
                CALL SECURITY.  

1436
00:59:26,578 --> 00:59:28,178

1437
00:59:30,415 --> 00:59:31,715
    Radio: 29 ARMED NEGROES     

1438
00:59:31,782 --> 00:59:33,350

    THE BLACK PANTHER LEADER,   

1440
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,354
        CALLED THE NEW          
    ANTIGUN PROPOSAL RACIST.    

1441
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:39,356
    GOVERNOR REAGAN             
    HAD THIS TO SAY.            

1442
00:59:39,424 --> 00:59:42,359
Reagan: THE BLACK PANTHERS      
ARE A MILITANT FRINGE GROUP     

1443
00:59:42,427 --> 00:59:44,344
WHO ARE USING FEAR              
AND INTIMIDATION                

1444
00:59:44,412 --> 00:59:45,846
AGAINST THE OAKLAND             
POLICE DEPARTMENT.              

1445
00:59:45,913 --> 00:59:48,348
    Reporter: THE BLACK PANTHER 
    PARTY MADE A WRONG TURN     

1446
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,851
    AND ACCIDENTALLY WALKED     
    ONTO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR     

1447
00:59:50,918 --> 00:59:52,853
        INSTEAD OF              
    THE VISITORS GALLERY.       

1448
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,855
THE BLACK PANTHERS              
ARE NOT ANTIWHITE.              

1449
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:55,856
WE ANTIOPPRESSION.              

1450
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:58,375
YOU CAN'T FIGHT RACISM          
WITH RACISM.                    

1451
00:59:58,442 --> 01:00:00,310
    Reporter: THE LAW           
    THE PANTHERS BROKE          

1452
01:00:00,378 --> 01:00:02,312
        IS DISTURBING           
        THE ASSEMBLY.           

1453
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,798
    26 BLACK PANTHERS HAVE BEEN 
    ARRESTED IN SACRAMENTO.     

1454
01:00:04,866 --> 01:00:07,300
    Judge: WE LOST BOBBY.       
    HE SERVED 6 MONTHS          

1455
01:00:07,368 --> 01:00:09,870
    FOR TAKING                  
    THAT WRONG TURN.            

1456
01:00:09,937 --> 01:00:11,872
    THE MULFORD ACT             
    EVENTUALLY PASSED,          

1457
01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:14,875
    SO WE LOST THE RIGHT        
    TO CARRY GUNS.              

1458
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:17,878
    ONE THING WE DID GET        
    WAS WORLDWIDE ATTENTION.    

1459
01:00:17,945 --> 01:00:20,380
    YEAH, DISCIPLINED NIGGERS   
        MARCHING WITH GUNS,     

1460
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:23,183
        THAT GOT                
    EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION.      

1461
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,324
    THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY     
        FOR SELF DEFENSE        

1462
01:00:31,392 --> 01:00:34,193
    CLAIMS TO BE THE VOICE      
    OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY.     

1463
01:00:34,261 --> 01:00:36,196
    HOWEVER, ANALYSIS           
    OF OUR FIELD REPORT         

1464
01:00:36,264 --> 01:00:38,698
    REVEALS A HIGH LEVEL        
    OF ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS.   

1465
01:00:38,766 --> 01:00:40,700
        WE'VE BEEN DOWN         
        THIS ROAD BEFORE.       

1466
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:42,202
        WHAT WE HAVE HERE       

1467
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,771
        IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE    
        OF OUTSIDE AGITATION.   

1468
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:46,907
        BLACK TERRORISTS        
        ON THE FLOOR            

1469
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:48,007
        OF A STATE CAPITOL?     

1470
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:49,208
        I WON'T HAVE IT.        

1471
01:00:49,276 --> 01:00:51,277
        THIS IS OBVIOUSLY       
        AN ORGANIZATION         

1472
01:00:51,345 --> 01:00:54,280
    FUNDED AND MASTERMINDED     
    BY SOME COMMUNIST POWER     

1473
01:00:54,348 --> 01:00:56,282
        HOSTILE                 
    TO THE UNITED STATES.       

1474
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,518
    THE ONLY QUESTION IS        
        WHICH ONE?              

1475
01:00:58,586 --> 01:01:00,454
        BEFORE WE CRUSH         
    THESE UNGRATEFUL COONS,     

1476
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:02,889
        FIND OUT                
    WHO THEIR REAL BOSS IS.     

1477
01:01:02,957 --> 01:01:03,890
YES, SIR.                       

1478
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:04,825
        GENTLEMEN.              

1479
01:01:17,788 --> 01:01:20,990
    WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.     
    GET IN THE BACK SEAT.       

1480
01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:22,892
    WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY.       

1481
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,395
    WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME      
        ABOUT THIS PARTY        

1482
01:01:25,463 --> 01:01:26,896
    YOU BOYS WERE PLANNING      
        AT THE CAPITOL?         

1483
01:01:26,964 --> 01:01:28,632
THE SHIT WAS SPONTANEOUS.       

1484
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,134
    YOU TOLD THE PRESS.         
    YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.         

1485
01:01:31,202 --> 01:01:32,902
            REMEMBER            
    WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR.     

1486
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,738
WHATEVER YOU SAY,               
MAN.                            

1487
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:36,240
        YOU SASSING ME?         

1488
01:01:36,307 --> 01:01:39,075
        YOU LITTLE PIECE        
            OF SHIT!            

1489
01:01:39,277 --> 01:01:41,845
        I'LL GET YOUR BLACK ASS.
        SASS ME, WILL YOU?      

1490
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:45,098
        GET OUT OF              
        THE FUCKING CAR!        

1491
01:01:45,165 --> 01:01:47,634
        "WHATEVER YOU SAY,      
        INSPECTOR BRIMMER."     

1492
01:01:47,702 --> 01:01:49,636
        YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT,   
        WHATEVER I SAY.         

1493
01:01:49,704 --> 01:01:50,637
        I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE  
        YOUR WIRY HEAD'S        

1494
01:01:50,705 --> 01:01:51,705
        SCREWED ON STRAIGHT.    

1495
01:01:51,772 --> 01:01:53,439
        GET UP HERE.            

1496
01:01:53,508 --> 01:01:55,842
        YOU KNOW HOW EASY       
        IT WOULD BE             

1497
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:56,910
        FOR YOU TO DISAPPEAR?   

1498
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:01,714
    ALL THESE DRIVERS SEE       
        IS A WHITE COP          

1499
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:03,816
    AND A BLACK CONVICT         
        IN HANDCUFFS.           

1500
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:05,418
        YOU UNDERSTAND?         

1501
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:06,853
            YEAH, WHAT          
            DO YOU WANT, MAN?   

1502
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:08,788
I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR ASS      
OUT OF NEUTRAL.                 

1503
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:11,291
SET THE PANTHERS                
ON A PLATE FOR ME.              

1504
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,426
 SET THEM UP                    
 FOR ARMED ROBBERY.             

1505
01:02:13,494 --> 01:02:14,427
            THE PANTHERS        
            DON'T ROB NOBODY.   

1506
01:02:14,495 --> 01:02:15,428
            THEY DON'T OPERATE  
            LIKE THAT.          

1507
01:02:15,496 --> 01:02:16,496
YOU JUST DO IT.                 

1508
01:02:16,564 --> 01:02:17,998
LIKE YOUR MAN SAYS,             

1509
01:02:18,065 --> 01:02:19,666
"BY ANY MEANS                   
NECESSARY."                     

1510
01:02:19,734 --> 01:02:22,502
            OK! ALL RIGHT!      
            ALL RIGHT!          

1511
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:23,436
ALL RIGHT.                      

1512
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:26,806
SOMETHING                       
FOR YOUR TUITION.               

1513
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:29,442
GET BACK                        
IN THE FUCKING CAR.             

1514
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:33,964
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BRO?          

1515
01:02:34,032 --> 01:02:36,967
WHERE'S JUDGE? I AIN'T          
SEEN HIM AROUND LATELY.         

1516
01:02:37,035 --> 01:02:39,970
        BETWEEN SCHOOL, HIS JOB,
        AND THE PANTHERS,       

1517
01:02:40,038 --> 01:02:42,472
            HE'S BEEN RUNNING   
            KIND OF RAW.        

1518
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,075
I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK.           

1519
01:02:46,577 --> 01:02:47,844
    HEY!                        

1520
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:51,064
I KNOW THIS FOOL AIN'T SELLING

2063
01:27:54,284 --> 01:27:56,851
    IT'S GOING TO WORK.         

2064
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,554
        JUST MAKE SURE THE FOCUS
        STAYS ON FREEING HUEY.  

2065
01:28:01,674 --> 01:28:04,142
WE CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH            
OF THESE THINGS.                

2066
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:06,611
    WE GOT MOVIE STARS          
    CALLING UP TO HELP.         

2067
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:09,014
    BROTHERS AND SISTERS,       
    IT'S NATION TIME.           

2068
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:11,516
            I WISH WE DIDN'T    
            NEED THESE BUTTONS. 

2069
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:13,518
                I WISH          
                HUEY WAS HERE.  

2070
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:14,686
        ME, TOO.                

2071
01:28:14,753 --> 01:28:17,189
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT,            
MY BROTHER?                     

2072
01:28:17,256 --> 01:28:18,690
        LOOK AT THIS.           

2073
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:20,692
    Judge: YOU COULD JAIL       
        A REVOLUTIONARY,        

2074
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:23,028
    BUT YOU COULDN'T            
    JAIL THE REVOLUTION.        

2075
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:25,363
        DESPITE THE PIGS        
        AND THE FBI,            

2076
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:27,232
        OUR POWER BASE          
    IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY      

2077

    CONTINUED TO GROW.          

2078
01:28:29,435 --> 01:28:30,869
    EVEN MOM CAME AROUND.       

2079
01:28:30,937 --> 01:28:32,070
                    WELL?

                    OF THAT WIG.

2082
01:28:40,213 --> 01:28:42,047
ELDRIDGE,

                    OF YOUR SON.

Judge: EVERYTHING IN HERE--     

2090
01:28:57,964 --> 01:29:00,332
BUTTER, SALT, GREASE--          

2091
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:02,334
YOU ARE                         
THE MALNUTRITION PANTHER,       

2092
01:29:02,401 --> 01:29:03,935
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.            

2093
01:29:04,003 --> 01:29:06,437
        Y'ALL NEED              
        TO BE EATING MORE.      

2094
01:29:06,505 --> 01:29:08,340
        RUNNING AROUND HERE     
        LIKE SCARECROWS.        

2095
01:29:08,407 --> 01:29:10,842
        YOU DON'T EAT,          
        YOU DON'T SLEEP.        

2096
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:13,345
        TAKE THIS HAT OFF       
        AT THE TABLE.           

2097
01:29:13,412 --> 01:29:14,846
        AIN'T NO WAY TO LIVE.   

2098
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:16,348
                IT'S GOOD       
                TO BE SKINNY--  

2099
01:29:16,415 --> 01:29:18,350
                EASIER TO RUN   
                FROM FAT PIGS.  

2100
01:29:18,417 --> 01:29:21,353
    TV: WE BRING YOU            
THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL REPORT.   

2101
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:24,322
    MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.      
WAS KILLED TONIGHT IN MEMPHIS,  

2102
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,358
    SHOT IN THE FACE            
    AS HE STOOD ALONE           

2103
01:29:26,425 --> 01:29:28,860
    ON THE BALCONY              
    OF HIS HOTEL ROOM.          

2104
01:29:28,928 --> 01:29:30,762
    HE DIED IN A HOSPITAL       
        AN HOUR LATER.          

2105
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:32,764
        LAST NIGHT,             
        HE SAID THIS...         

2106
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:34,866
    King: I JUST WANT           
    TO DO GOD'S WILL.           

2107
01:29:34,934 --> 01:29:36,701
                HE NEVER        
                HURT NOBODY.    

2108
01:29:36,769 --> 01:29:40,038
    HE HAS ALLOWED ME TO GO     
    UP TO THE MOUNTAIN,         

2109
01:29:40,106 --> 01:29:42,374
    AND I'VE LOOKED OVER        

2110
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:46,378
        AND I'VE SEEN           
        THE PROMISED LAND.      

2111
01:29:46,445 --> 01:29:48,880
        I MAY NOT               
    GET THERE WITH YOU,         

2112
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:51,783
        BUT I WANT YOU          
        TO KNOW TONIGHT         

2113
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:53,885
    THAT WE AS A PEOPLE         

2114
01:29:53,953 --> 01:29:56,288
        WILL GET                
    TO THE PROMISED LAND.       

2115
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:58,390
        [CHEERING]              

2116
01:29:58,457 --> 01:30:00,325
    SO I AM HAPPY TONIGHT.      

2117
01:30:00,393 --> 01:30:02,827
        I'M NOT WORRIED         
        ABOUT ANYTHING.         

2118
01:30:02,895 --> 01:30:04,996
    I'M NOT FEARING ANY MAN.    

2119
01:30:05,064 --> 01:30:07,498
        MINE EYES               
    HAVE SEEN THE GLORY         

2120
01:30:07,566 --> 01:30:09,935
        OF THE COMING           
        OF THE LORD.            

2121
01:30:15,607 --> 01:30:18,343
         HEY, JOE             

2122
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:19,945
     A-WHERE YOU GOIN'        

2123
01:30:20,012 --> 01:30:21,712
         WITH THAT GUN         
        IN YOUR HAND?          

2124
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,581
Judge: WHEN KING'S MESSAGE      
        OF NONVIOLENCE          

2125
01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:25,850
        ENDED                   
    IN HIS VIOLENT DEATH,       

2126
01:30:25,918 --> 01:30:27,352
    FOLKS FINALLY REALIZED      

2127
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:30,422
        THAT THEY COULDN'T      
    PRAY THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM-- 

2128
01:30:30,489 --> 01:30:33,425
    JUST WHAT THE PANTHERS      
    HAD SAID ALL ALONG.         

2129
01:30:33,492 --> 01:30:35,026
    AMERICA WAS BURNING.        

2130
01:30:35,094 --> 01:30:39,130
    NATIONWIDE, OUR ENROLLMENT  
    DOUBLED IN 2 WEEKS.         

2131
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:41,132
NO, NO.                         
NO MORE WORDS!                  

2132
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,633
 NO MORE WORDS.                 

2133
01:30:42,701 --> 01:30:44,135
NO MORE SITTING.                

2134
01:30:44,203 --> 01:30:45,636
 NO MORE PRAYING,               

2135
01:30:45,704 --> 01:30:48,139
WAITING FOR THE PIGS            
TO KILL US.                     

2136
01:30:48,207 --> 01:30:50,342
LATER FOR LYING DOWN,           

2137
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:52,377
WAITING TO GET SHOT             
LIKE DOGS.                      

2138
01:30:52,445 --> 01:30:54,879
NONVIOLENCE DIED IN MEMPHIS     
WITH DR. KING.                  

2139
01:30:54,947 --> 01:30:56,381
WE MUST RETALIATE.              
WE GOT THE FUCKING GUNS.        

2140
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:58,083
IT'S TIME                       
TO USE THEM.                    

2141
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:01,419
                HOLD ON,        
                MOTHERFUCKER!   

2142
01:31:02,888 --> 01:31:05,323
BROTHER, I HEAR YOU,            
BUT I DISAGREE.                 

2143
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:07,925
AND WE BOTH KNOW                
HUEY DISAGREES.                 

2144
01:31:07,994 --> 01:31:09,394
    YEAH, WE GOT GUNS,          

2145
01:31:09,462 --> 01:31:11,829
        BUT THE PIG             
    HAS GOT MORE GUNS.          

2146
01:31:11,897 --> 01:31:14,332
    THE PIG HAS GOT             
    THE NATIONAL GUARD.         

2147
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,867
    I AIN'T AFRAID TO FIGHT,    

2148
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:17,369
    BUT WE AIN'T STUPID EITHER. 

2149
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:19,904
    THIS HERE IS A TIME         
    TO BE SMART.                

2150
01:31:19,972 --> 01:31:21,906
            NO. LATER FOR THAT. 

2151
01:31:21,974 --> 01:31:22,907
    NO, LATER FOR YOU.          

2152
01:31:22,975 --> 01:31:24,609
NOW LISTEN UP, MAN.             

2153
01:31:24,676 --> 01:31:28,179
WHAT, WE GOING TO FORGET        
ABOUT HUEY AND HIS TRIAL?       

2154
01:31:28,247 --> 01:31:30,181
START KILLING PIGS?             

2155
01:31:30,249 --> 01:31:32,050
START THE REVOLUTION NOW        

2156
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:34,452

LEADERS IN JAIL?        YEAH.   

2157
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,889
MAN, IF WE DO THAT,             
HUEY'S A DEAD MAN.              

2158
01:31:37,956 --> 01:31:40,425
WE'RE ALL DEAD.                 

2159
01:31:40,493 --> 01:31:42,427
NO, MAN. WE STAY COOL.          

2160
01:31:42,495 --> 01:31:44,329
                    OH, WHAT?   

2161
01:31:45,931 --> 01:31:47,798

            LATER FOR THAT.     

2164
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:56,241
        IT IS TIME TO INTENSIFY 
        THE STRUGGLE.           

2165
01:31:56,308 --> 01:31:58,709
            THAT'S WHAT IT IS.  

2166
01:32:29,408 --> 01:32:30,508
                GOT TO GO.      

2167
01:32:30,576 --> 01:32:32,177

01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:49,143
                WHAT ABOUT      
                ELDRIDGE?       

2279
01:37:49,211 --> 01:37:51,646
                YOU DID GET HIM 
                OUT ON BAIL?    

2280
01:37:51,714 --> 01:37:53,381
        YEAH,                   

2281
01:37:53,448 --> 01:37:56,818
        BUT THINGS              
        GETTING TOO HOT.        

2282
01:37:56,886 --> 01:37:58,386
        ELDRIDGE IS...          

2283
01:37:58,453 --> 01:38:00,121
    IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR.      

2284
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,834
THE FREE HUEY THING'S           
BECOME                          

2285
01:38:12,902 --> 01:38:16,004
A BIT OF A RALLYING CRY         
FOR THE LEFT,                   

2286
01:38:16,071 --> 01:38:18,339
ESPECIALLY WITH                 
BOBBY SEALE RUNNING AROUND      

2287
01:38:18,407 --> 01:38:19,707
FANNING THE FLAMES.             

2288
01:38:19,775 --> 01:38:20,875
            RALLYING CRY!       

2289
01:38:20,943 --> 01:38:22,810
            THAT'S INSURRECTION!

2290
01:38:22,878 --> 01:38:25,713
SIR, THE PANTHERS HAVE          
BECOME VERY RESOURCEFUL.        

2291
01:38:25,781 --> 01:38:27,214
I'M AFRAID                      
WE'VE UNDERESTIMATED            

2292
01:38:27,282 --> 01:38:29,316
THEIR SUPPORT                   
IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.         

2293
01:38:29,384 --> 01:38:30,985
THAT'S THEIR POWER BASE.        

2294
01:38:31,053 --> 01:38:33,988
THEY SAY A BLACK PANTHER        
IS BORN EVERY MINUTE            

2295
01:38:34,056 --> 01:38:35,623
IN THE GHETTO.                  

2296
01:38:35,691 --> 01:38:38,826
        TELL HIM I WANT THAT    
        POWER BASE NEUTRALIZED! 

2297
01:38:38,894 --> 01:38:41,529
MR. HOOVER WISHES THE ULTIMATE  
CONTINGENCY IMPLEMENTED.        

2298
01:38:41,597 --> 01:38:43,230
        YOU MEAN...             

2299
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:45,166
                THAT'S EXACTLY  
                WHAT I MEAN!    

2300
01:38:46,569 --> 01:38:49,737
AND AGENT RODGERS, THIS         
CONVERSATION NEVER OCCURRED.    

2301
01:38:58,948 --> 01:39:00,815
Dorsett: RODGERS,               
THIS IS NO GOOD.                

2302
01:39:00,883 --> 01:39:02,316
        Rodgers: CUT THE COMEDY.
        YOU'VE BEEN TAKING      

2303
01:39:02,384 --> 01:39:05,336
        MONEY FROM THE MOB      
        FOR YEARS.              

2304
01:39:05,403 --> 01:39:08,523
GENTLEMEN, FORGIVE ME           
FOR KEEPING YOU.                

2305
01:39:10,392 --> 01:39:13,328
AHH, DORSETT, NO MATTER         
HOW WE DENY IT,                 

2306
01:39:13,395 --> 01:39:17,031
WE ALWAYS END UP ON             
THE SAME SIDE OF THE COIN.      

2307
01:39:17,233 --> 01:39:19,100
IT'S ALMOST FUNNY.              

2308
01:39:19,167 --> 01:39:20,902
    HONESTLY,                   
    IT TURNS MY STOMACH.        

2309
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:22,971
        NEITHER YOUR STOMACH    
        NOR YOUR OPINION        

2310
01:39:23,038 --> 01:39:25,006
        MATTERS HERE, DORSETT.  

2311
01:39:25,074 --> 01:39:28,042
        WHAT MATTERS IS THAT    
        MR. TYNAN'S CLIENTS     

2312
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:31,045
        AND THE BUREAU HAVE     
        COME UP WITH A SOLUTION 

2313
01:39:31,113 --> 01:39:32,546
        TO OUR PANTHER PROBLEM. 

2314
01:39:32,615 --> 01:39:34,548
THE FINAL SOLUTION,             
YOU MIGHT SAY.                  

2315
01:39:34,617 --> 01:39:37,602
OUR CLIENTS, OF COURSE,         
ARE VERY PLEASED                

2316
01:39:38,036 --> 01:39:40,287
MR. HOOVER DECIDED TO TAKE      
OUR SUGGESTION TO HEART.        

2317
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:43,357
BY THE WAY, WHY DID             
HE CHANGE HIS MIND?             

2318
01:39:43,425 --> 01:39:44,626
    WOMAN'S INTUITION.          

2319
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:48,129
            ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN
            CONTROL THE PRODUCT?

2320
01:39:48,196 --> 01:39:50,031
            CAN YOU ASSURE US   

2321
01:39:50,099 --> 01:39:52,366
            THAT THIS WILL NOT  
            GET OUT OF HAND?    

2322
01:39:52,434 --> 01:39:53,668
OF COURSE.                      

2323
01:39:53,736 --> 01:39:55,637
OUR CLIENTS HAVE                
VAST EXPERIENCE                 

2324
01:39:55,704 --> 01:39:57,138
IN THESE COMMUNITIES.           

2325
01:39:57,205 --> 01:39:58,640
IT'S JUST A MATTER              
OF DEGREES.                     

2326
01:39:58,707 --> 01:40:01,643
YOU GIVE US FREE REIGN          
IN THE GHETTO,                  

2327
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:02,810
WE SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.         

2328
01:40:02,878 --> 01:40:04,044
I'LL ASSURE YOU                 
OF ONE THING.                   

2329
01:40:04,112 --> 01:40:07,047
THE PACIFYING QUALITIES         
OF HEROIN ARE FORMIDABLE.       

2330
01:40:07,115 --> 01:40:10,551
A JUNKIE'S POLITICS             
ARE NOT LIKE YOURS AND MINE.    

2331
01:40:10,619 --> 01:40:13,053
I'LL EVEN READ                  
THE FUTURE FOR YOU--            

2332
01:40:13,121 --> 01:40:14,822
VERY SOON,                      
THE JIGABOOS--                  

2333
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,324
NO OFFENSE--                    

2334
01:40:16,392 --> 01:40:19,260
THE JIGABOOS WILL BE            
WANTING THE STUFF SO BAD--      

2335
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,162
TRYING TO GET,                  
TO SELL--                       

2336
01:40:21,229 --> 01:40:22,830
THEY'LL BE BLOWING              
EACH OTHER'S BRAINS OUT.        

2337
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:24,332
        IT'S NOT A RACIAL ISSUE.

2338
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,768
        IT'S A MATTER           
        OF LAW AND ORDER.       

2339
01:40:26,835 --> 01:40:28,269
OF COURSE.                      
AT ANY RATE,                    

2340
01:40:28,337 --> 01:40:30,571
WE JUST SET THEM UP             
AND STEP BACK.                  

2341
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,591
    WHEN CAN YOU GET IT         
    OUT IN THE STREETS?         

2342
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:35,092
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.           

2343
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,962
WE'LL MANUFACTURE AND           
DISTRIBUTE FROM A WAREHOUSE.    

2344
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:39,463
DORSETT KNOWS THE LOCALE.       

2345
01:40:39,531 --> 01:40:40,598
        I REITERATE.            

2346
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:42,600
        WE NEED ASSURANCES      
        ON CONTAINMENT...       

2347
01:40:42,668 --> 01:40:45,603
        THAT IT STAYS STRICTLY  
        WITHIN THE PROBLEM AREA.

2348
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:48,940
        I WANT YOU TO PUT       
        SOMEBODY ON THIS.       

2349
01:40:49,007 --> 01:40:52,142
        KEEP TABS               
        ON THE NEW OPERATION.   

2350
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:53,778
        NO OFFENSE.             

2351
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:58,816
        YOU TALK AS IF          
    THIS THING'S BEEN DECIDED.  

2352
01:40:58,884 --> 01:40:59,850
                    IT HAS BEEN.

2353
01:41:01,787 --> 01:41:03,487
PIGS FIND HIM YET?              

2354
01:41:03,555 --> 01:41:05,890
            NO, THEY HAVEN'T.   

2355
01:41:05,958 --> 01:41:07,357
            THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

2356
01:41:07,425 --> 01:41:09,660
            WHO WAS IN THE CAR  
            WITH YOU.           

2357
01:41:09,728 --> 01:41:11,328
            GOOD LUCK, HUEY.

01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:28,512
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!            

2368
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:31,015
    BROTHERS AND SISTERS,       
    STOKELY CARMICHAEL!         

2369
01:41:33,301 --> 01:41:37,638
    YOU SAY THAT HUEY P. NEWTON 
    IS A PRISONER OF WAR.       

2370
01:41:37,706 --> 01:41:40,641
    NOW, MANY PEOPLE SAY        
    THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE        

2371
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:43,143
    OR THAT THE PARTY           
    IS EXAGGERATING.            

2372
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:44,245
                        NO!     

2373
01:41:44,312 --> 01:41:45,747
    BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR--    

2374
01:41:45,814 --> 01:41:47,248
    IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR          

2375
01:41:47,315 --> 01:41:51,185
    THE UNITED STATES HAS       
DECLARED WAR ON BLACK PEOPLE.   

2376
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:52,353
        [SHOUTING]              

2377
01:41:54,172 --> 01:41:55,606
    NOW, SHE DID THAT           

2378
01:41:55,674 --> 01:41:59,110
    WHEN SHE TOOK THE FIRST     
    BLACK MAN FROM AFRICA.      

2379
01:41:59,177 --> 01:42:02,179
    AH, SHE NEVER CAME OUT      
    AND SAID THE WORDS--        

2380
01:42:02,247 --> 01:42:04,098
    "I DECLARE WAR              
    ON BLACK PEOPLE."           

2381
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:05,832
    NO, SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.     

2382
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,402
        BUT LET US STUDY        
        OUR HISTORY.            

2383
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:10,404
    TO THIS DAY,                
    THE UNITED STATES           

2384
01:42:10,472 --> 01:42:12,106
    HAS NOT DECLARED WAR        
        ON VIETNAM,             

2385
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:13,607
    BUT THERE IS VIETNAM.       

2386
01:42:13,675 --> 01:42:19,012
        AND THEY DID NOT        
    DECLARE WAR IN NORTH KOREA, 

2387
01:42:19,081 --> 01:42:22,015
    BUT THEY SURE FOUGHT

2388
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:26,019
    AND THEY DID NOT DECLARE WAR
        ON THE INDIANS.         

2389
01:42:26,088 --> 01:42:28,021
    THEY JUST WIPED THEM OUT.

2392
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:32,593
            THAT'S RIGHT!       

2393
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:33,627

2394
01:42:33,695 --> 01:42:35,629
        WE MUST DEFINE          
        OUR POSITION.           

2395
01:42:35,697 --> 01:42:37,731

2407
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:04,975
WE KNOW FOR SURE                
THERE WAS A PASSENGER.          

2408
01:43:05,043 --> 01:43:06,977
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHO.         

2409
01:43:07,045 --> 01:43:09,980
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE       
THOSE YOUNG BROTHERS.           

2410
01:43:10,048 --> 01:43:12,983
THEY DO A LOT OF GOOD           
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.           

2411
01:43:13,051 --> 01:43:15,286
        YOU EVER HEARD          
        ABOUT THE COMMON GOOD?  

2412
01:43:15,354 --> 01:43:17,788
        THE UNITED STATES       
        OF AMERICA IS MORE      

2413
01:43:17,856 --> 01:43:19,490
        THAN A SIMPLE COLLECTION
        OF GHETTOS.             

2414
01:43:19,557 --> 01:43:20,992
        THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT  

2415
01:43:21,059 --> 01:43:22,493
        ON CAPITALISM           
        AND DEMOCRACY.          

2416
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,495
        IN A DEMOCRACY,         
        THE MAJORITY RULES.     

2417
01:43:24,562 --> 01:43:27,831
        WE ARE A MINORITY UNLESS
        WE INTEGRATE FULLY.     

2418
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,334
WHOSE SIDE                      
ARE YOU ON, BROTHER?            

2419
01:43:30,402 --> 01:43:34,021
            NO. WHOSE SIDE      
            ARE YOU ON, OFFICER?

2420
01:43:34,088 --> 01:43:34,938
        NOW, YOU SAY            

2421
01:43:35,006 --> 01:43:37,275
        THAT HUEY NEWTON        
        OPENED FIRE THAT NIGHT  

2422
01:43:37,342 --> 01:43:38,776
        WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION.

2423
01:43:38,843 --> 01:43:40,778
        WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE? 

2424
01:43:40,845 --> 01:43:42,780
        IT WAS A DARK NIGHT.    

2425
01:43:42,847 --> 01:43:44,782
        THERE WAS               
        LOTS OF CONFUSION.      

2426
01:43:44,849 --> 01:43:46,284
WELL, SIR,                      
I WAS THERE.

    THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WERE.     

2428
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,121
     HE WAS THERE.              

2429
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:52,623
    HE SAW EVERYTHING.          

2430
01:43:52,691 --> 01:43:55,125
    AND HE IS NOT ON TRIAL.     

2431
01:43:55,193 --> 01:44:00,498
    HE DOES NOT NEED TO LIE     
    TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE.

2437

        YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS      

2712
01:57:37,914 --> 01:57:40,849
        TO COME OUT             
    WITH YOUR HANDS UP!         

2713
01:57:40,917 --> 01:57:43,686
            5...4...            

2714
01:57:43,753 --> 01:57:46,589
            3...2...            

2715
01:57:46,657 --> 01:57:47,690
            ONE!                

2716
01:58:24,661 --> 01:58:27,096
    Judge: WELL, WE FINALLY     
    GOT THAT STOPLIGHT.         

2717
01:58:27,163 --> 01:58:29,098
    THEY PUMPED IN THE DOPE     

2718
01:58:29,165 --> 01:58:31,100
        TO NEUTRALIZE           
    THE BLACK COMMUNITY         

2719
01:58:31,167 --> 01:58:33,235
        AND DESTROY             
    THE PANTHER POWER BASE,     

2720
01:58:33,303 --> 01:58:36,238
        BUT DRUGS OVERFLOWED    
    THE BORDERS OF THE GHETTO   

2721
01:58:36,306 --> 01:58:38,474
    AND ENDED UP ON ALL         
    AMERICA'S DOORSTEP.         

2722
01:58:38,541 --> 01:58:39,958
LOOK AT THAT!                   

2723
01:58:40,026 --> 01:58:43,262
    DESPITE ONGOING PERSECUTION 
    BY THE AUTHORITIES,         

2724
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:46,265
    THE PANTHERS CONTINUED TO   
    PROVIDE BREAKFAST PROGRAMS, 

2725
01:58:46,333 --> 01:58:47,866
    SICKLE CELL ANEMIA TESTING, 

2726
01:58:47,934 --> 01:58:49,868
        EVEN SCHOOLS            
    FOR THE COMMUNITY.          

2727
01:58:49,936 --> 01:58:51,837
    BEFORE THEY WERE            
    EVENTUALLY CRUSHED,         

2728
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:53,339
    THE PANTHERS HAD CHAPTERS   

2729
01:58:53,406 --> 01:58:56,342
    IN ALMOST EVERY STATE       
        OF THE UNION            

2730
01:58:56,409 --> 01:58:57,843
        AND SEVERAL             
    FOREIGN COUNTRIES.          

2731
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:00,846
        IT CAME OUT LATER       
    THAT HOOVER AND THE FBI     

2732
01:59:00,913 --> 01:59:03,782
    USED ILLEGAL TACTICS        
    TO DESTROY THE PANTHERS.    

2733
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:06,785
    SEVERAL PANTHERS ARE STILL  
        BEING HELD IN PRISON    

2734
01:59:06,853 --> 01:59:09,388
    ON TRUMPED-UP CHARGES.      

2735
01:59:09,456 --> 01:59:15,261
    HUEY WAS KILLED IN 1989     
        IN A DRUG DEAL.         

2736
01:59:15,328 --> 01:59:16,762
        BOBBY LIVES             
    IN PENNSYLVANIA.            

2737
01:59:16,829 --> 01:59:18,930
    HE TEACHES AND LECTURES.    

2738
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:32,244
    THE WAY I SEE IT,           

2739
01:59:32,312 --> 01:59:34,480
    THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES.     

2740
01:59:56,169 --> 01:59:58,604
     NOW IS THE TIME TO FREE   
    YOUR MIND AND YOUR SOUL    

2741
01:59:58,672 --> 01:59:59,838

    I'VE NEVER BEEN TOLD       

2743

     LADIES, WE GOT TO DEMAND  
        WHAT WE WANT           

2744

     AND WHAT WE WANT          
    IS RESPECT, RIGHT?

2780
02:01:55,422 --> 02:02:00,258

02:02:00,327 --> 02:02:04,196
     THAT LOVE'S IN NEED       
        OF LOVE TODAY          

2782
02:02:04,263 --> 02:02:07,867
     BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE 

2783
02:02:07,934 --> 02:02:11,203
     BUT STILL I KNOW         

2784
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:13,539
 WHEN YOU'VE                   
TAKEN ALL
