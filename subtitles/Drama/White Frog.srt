lt's called comparative
advantage, B.B.

And though it is impossible

100
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,221
not to feel distraught,
even angry,

101
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,988
at this seemingly
senselessloss,

102
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:30,791
God has also given
a healing gift

103
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,821
to those of us
who are believers--

104
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,460
the knowledge that
what others call death

105
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,834
is not actually an ending,

106
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,771
but a new beginning.

107
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:44,971
This young man,
who we all loved so much

108

whom we will all miss
so terribly--

Chaz has begun the next stage
in his amazing journey

110
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:55,982
with a new life
and a new flesh--

111
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:59,116
more perfect than anything
we can even imagine.

112
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,323
Let us be inspired
by the life of Chaz Young,

113
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:08,926
to make our own lives
a testament to your glory.

114
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,402
He was with us.

115
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:16,067
We enjoyed his company,
basked in his spirit.

116
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:20,341
And now he's gone from us
in the flesh,

117
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,316
but his memory will remain
with us forever.

118
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,117
Let us all strive
to live up to that memory,

119
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:33,114
to live up to the gift
which you have given us

120
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,290
by letting us know
this remarkable young man.

121
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:41,858

to sit around and be boring.

You know, he'd want us
to have fun.

He wanted to come with us.

lf he wants to come,
he can ask.

338
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:19,622
You come out, okay?

339
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,218
Yeah, l won't bother you.

340
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:23,888
You just...

341
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:24,953
Come right out.

342
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,927
You guys want more juice?

343
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,434
No, thank you.

344
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:33,868
Hey, Nick.

345
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:35,396
Can we turn the TV on?

346
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,873
Yeah, that's a great idea.

347
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:08,536
( laughing )

348
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,666
( TVpIayIng )

349
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:15,075
Did you see that?

350
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:18,040
( laughter )

351
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,013
Where's Nick?

352
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,178
He's under the table.

353
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,550
Nick, come on,
mind your manners.

354
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,648
( stuttering )

355
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:29,286
This is no time
for lsaac Newton.

356
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,023
You can be better.

357
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:31,995
Come on, bemod.

358
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,157
Bemod, just like Chaz used to do.

359
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:37,134
- ''... on the seashore...''
- lrene.

360
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,501
''...and then finding
a smoother pebble.''

361
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:41,199
Mr. Young, can we go home now?

362
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,104
Your parents are gonna
pick you up at 6:00.

363
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:44,438
''...whilst the great ocean--''

364
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,670
Nick, come on!

365
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,045
Did that really just happen?

366
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,003
Don't you dare...

367
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,167
l'm no pushover like your parents.

368
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:28,478
Are you still getting anxiety attacks?

369
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,454
No...

370
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,457
Except when...

371
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:35,750
No.

372
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,087
Finish the thought.

373
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,091
Sometimes...

374
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:47,504
l forget what he sounded like.

375
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:50,372
My mother died,
and l can still hear her.

376
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:56,445
( whining voice )
''Ohh! ''you so smart!

377
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:59,314
''Why you don't become doctor?

378
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:03,310
''Oh, shrink not doctor.

379
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:08,190
''Shrink just somebody you pay
so they pretend to like you.

380
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:12,390
''Yeah, you gonna be doctor,
then marry doctor,

381
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:16,800
''then have baby,
someday gonna be doctor.

382
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,697
Or mommy gonna die!''

383
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:22,800
Was it your fault that--
that she died?

384
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,373
Oh, who knows?

385
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,811
Maybe that's why
she's still on my case.

386
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:31,106
Dead people,
they come and go

387
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:32,810
like they own you.

388
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:34,643
( chuckles )

389
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:36,176
Sometimes l feel like

390
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,280
taking a restraining
order out against her.

391
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:41,417
''Ohh, so messy!

392
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,190
''Oh, you gotta clean sometime!

393
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:47,164
''You know, every day
just a little bit.

394
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,100
''Little bit by little bit.

395
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:52,160
''Then one day...

396
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:55,105
Oh! Surprise!
All clean!''

397
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,437
( chuckling )

398
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:04,174
( knock on door )

399
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,652
l love you, B.B.

400
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:50,355
Good night.

401
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,789
( indistinct chatter )

402
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:03,773
Make room for me, Nick.
l'm coming in.

403
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:05,503
( laughs )

404
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,773
What are you gonna do,
police the kid?

405
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:11,577
Mm-mm. No way, man.

406
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,312
That's more your speed,
Mr. Ayn Rand.

407
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,445
Have you even read
TheFountaInhead?

408
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:18,854
l figure l get
two cards for free...

409
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,824
So l ain't paying
until l see a pair.

410
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,156
( laughs )

411
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:23,889
What's so funny?
That's what you do.

412
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,328
No, l don't.

413
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:27,661
But seriously, how come
you've never played before?

414
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,860
l couldn't afford to lose.

415
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:30,799
And now?

416
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:33,303
l still got some of
the money Chaz paid me.

417
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,499
Nick looks like he's having fun.

418
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,303
But if you guys don't let me win,

419
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,832
my dad will beat the shit out of me,

420
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:42,404
and then l'll have to beat
the shit out of you.

421
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,675

- Really?
- No way.

That's 201 .

He's bluffing.

433
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:16,311
Maybe he caught
the flush on the river.

434
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:17,975
Why don't you pay up
and find out?

435
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:19,581
Nah, forget it.

436
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:22,712

poker face.

437
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:29,953
What'd you have?

438

( chuckles )

442
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,402
Bluffing is intense.

443
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,737
This kid's like a whiz.

444
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,242
How do you know that?

445
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:46,767
l memorized all the odds.

446
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:49,439
Nick, don't tell everyone
what you're thinking.

447
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,311
That's stupid.

448
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,782
play the man,
not the cards.

449
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:55,479
Well, tell me about Chaz.

450
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,920
Your brother was
always jealous of me.

451
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,981
No, go ahead, laugh.
Laugh, guys.

452
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:03,358
Because seriously, l really do
feel like Chaz felt smothered.

453
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:07,297
Sometimes l even think that he wishes
he was born into a different family.

454
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,366
Are you joking?

455
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:12,563
l'm sorry. l wasn't thinking.

456
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:17,398
Chaz said that Friday nights
were video game nights.

457
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,467
Why would he lie to me?

458
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,604
Maybe he didn't want
to corrupt you,

459
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:23,671
lose your respect.

460
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:26,684
lf he always won,
where did his money go?

461
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,854
Nick, where--
Wait up, dude!

462
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:38,727
- All right. See you guys later.
- Later.

463
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,754
Am l the only one
who thinks this kid

464
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,629
is an absolute weirdo?

465
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:42,997
He's gotAsperger Syndrome.

466
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:44,058
Like Rain Man.

467
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,827
No, no, more like Monk.

468
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:49,669
Chaz thought the kid
could be - more normal.

469
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,733
He was working with him,
doing bemod.

470
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:53,073
What the hell is bemod?

471
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:56,644
B-e-m-o-d.
Short for behavior modification.

472
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:58,342
Encourages him to open up,

474
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:20,099
Nick, what are you doing?

475
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:33,676
I Iooked everywhere.

476
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,982
Where would you hide your stuff?

477
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,885
School locker.

478
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:39,753
My dad cleaned it out.

479
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:45,360
Well, remember that time
when he screwed up

480
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,558
and he had to do
community service?

481
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,089
He never stopped going,

482
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:51,967
even though he didn't
have to anymore.

483
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:53,129
Maybe he has a locker there.

484
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:57,407
Do you know where that place is?

on you since--

502
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:52,247
This is Miss Lee.

503
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,617
She was Chaz's drama teacher.

504
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,718
Freshman year.

505
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:59,195
And this is Nick...Young.

506
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:02,730
Nick, l've heard--
heard so much about you.

507
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:08,733
Well, welcome to the Firehouse.

508
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:11,139
You know, your brother
suggested the name.

509
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,609
Before that, l called it the
Diversity Connection Center.

510
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:14,703
Lame, huh?

511
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,737
Why are you wearing that hat?

512
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,877
You've never dreamed
of being a flying nun?

513
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:22,284
MIss Lee, I'm out of gIue.

514
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:26,712
l like the trucks.
Nice touch.

515
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,056
You dIdn't IIkethe feathers?

516
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:30,890
They kept making me sneeze.

517
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:35,192
We've got our
big show coming up.

518
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:38,862
This doesn't look like
a real community center place.

519
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:42,270
Well, you know about
the library incident, right?

520
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,172
Chaz was gambling online.

521
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:48,907
lt was either suspension
or 50 hours community service.

522
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:52,246
Even after he finished his service,
Chaz kept coming back here.

523
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:54,683
Did you take his money?

524
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:56,214
What he donated.

525
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:58,779
How much money
did you take?

526
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:03,321
He gave over $20,000.

527
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:06,121
He just kept giving
and giving.

528
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:07,791
Said that he had to.

529
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:08,992
lt was his dream.

530
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:12,594
l'm glad you made it here
by yourself.

531
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:15,940
Why don't you stick around?
l'll show you--

532
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:17,942
No, no, l'm-- l'm sorry.

533
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:20,206
Nick's--
Nick's gotta get home.

534
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:26,242
Chaz called the community
service place the Firehouse.

535
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:32,948
How do you know that?

536
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,088
Randy took me there.

537
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,288
lf you want to do
community service,

538
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,058
l'll talk to the pastor,

539
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,692
but l don't think you should be
doing everything your brother did.

540
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:43,826
Tell me what it means.

541
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,165
Nick.

542
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:50,231
The beach.

543
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:52,208
Honey, l don't think
you have to--

544
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:54,768
When you were little boys,

545
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:58,839
we would take you
to the beach on sundays.

546
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:03,843
At dusk, homeless people
would get ready for sleep

547
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:06,652
next to their shopping carts,

548
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:09,854
and Chaz would always ask,

549
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,863
''Why can't we
take them home, Mommy?''

550
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,060
Do you remember, B.B.?

551
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:27,003
Years later, we were
driving through Skid Row,

552
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:31,106
and Chaz spotted
an abandoned firehouse,

553
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:33,879
old and charming,

554
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:37,285
squished between tenements.

555
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:39,881
And he said
he'd buy it one day

556
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:42,791
and he'd keep it open
for everyone.

557
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,988
He said everybody
should have a place

558
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:48,760
where they feel safe
and protected.

559
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,039
''
''

560
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:12,189
What's your password?

561
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,324
''i''.

562
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:22,431
''o''.

563
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:28,367
''e''?

564
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:48,156
( beeps )

565
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,890
I dIdn't reaIIze
we Iost so much.

566
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:57,765
But nobody could read people
the way Chaz could.

567
00:40:57,802 --> 00:40:59,326
$25,000?

568
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,237
That's gotta be more
than my entire family has.

569
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:04,241
My mom cleans two,
three houses every day

570
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,867
and the church once a week.

571
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,377
You gonna volunteer up there?

572
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,242
l'm not sure.

573
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,510
l'll go with you
if you change your mind.

574
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,512
Any friend of your brother's
is a friend of mine.

575
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,251
l'll be right back.

576
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:23,250
( cell phone rings )

577
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:25,387
( Doug )
Hey, dude, where are you?

578
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,522
Uh, something's come up.

579
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:28,993
Yeah, rIght.

580
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:30,898
l took care of him yesterday.
lt's your turn.

581
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,898
Try and remember how you felt
when you turned 15.

582
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,874
What do l have to offer
some 15-year-old kid?

583
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,337
just look further ahead
and relax.

584
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,405
( tires screeching )

585
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,348
Bemod, dude. Come on.

586
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:49,012
Come on, shake it off.

587
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,378
( revs )

588
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,945
Nick, stop!

589
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:58,086
Good job.

590
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:00,290
Almost hit a lamppost,
but good job.

591
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:04,558
Do you want to
volunteer at the firehouse?

592
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,362
No. But don't let that
stop you, buddy.

593
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:12,868
Did Chaz have sex
with that Miss Lee,

594
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,571
or was he in love?

595
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:16,436
Wait, what?
Did he have sex with who?

596
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:20,884
Didn't you see the pictures...
Of them dancing?

597
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:22,808
And?

598
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,389
You can tell me...

599
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:28,016
Were they in love?

600
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:29,854
( laughs )

601
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,059
Why are you laughing?

602
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:35,929
'Cause Miss Lee's a lesbian.

603
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:36,899
A lesbian?

604
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,903
She came out in the school newspaper
before she left.

605
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:45,342
l--l can't crack
Chaz's password.

606
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:46,843
Huh?

607
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:48,539
Chaz said l could
read his emails

608
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,479
if he was abducted by aliens.

609
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:52,106
Nick, Chaz was joking.

610
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:54,617
Nobody wants other people
to read their stuff.

611
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,955
But l'm his brother.

612
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:02,348
Come on, let's go again.

613
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,621
Concentrate this time.

614
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:05,920
please don't hit a lamppost.
lt's expensive.

615
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:07,453
- Okay.
- All right. Reverse.

616
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:13,631
Five, six, seven, eight.

617
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:18,965
( rap musIc pIayIng )

618
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:27,280
Glad you made it.

619
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:29,013
Hey, do either of you dance?

620
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:30,520
Nick can play the piano.

621
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:32,146
How'd you know that?

622
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:33,656
How do you think?

623
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:35,591
He said, ''i'm your dad.

624
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,526
Look, l brought you a Barbie.

625
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:40,121
l hope you'll be as pretty
and famous as a Barbie

626
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:41,062
when you grow up.''

627
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:43,089
Then he went to talk
with my uncles.

628
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:44,465
l never saw him again.

629
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:50,470
Lucy, l am so proud of you.

630
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:52,669
Let me know if you
want this to be in our show.

631
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,309
Otherwise, no one will see it.

632
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:03,486
What's in there?

633
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:05,216
Video diaries
Chaz was collecting

634
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,019
to show at our
fundraising event.

635
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:09,049
Chaz thought this would
be a good way

636
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:11,084
for the Firehouse kids
to get stuff off their chest.

637
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:12,959
Most of them have
made more than one.

638
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:15,556
Did Chaz make one?

639
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:21,162
l want to see it.

640
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:23,139
Sorry, Nick, l don't have it.

641
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,699
l was gonna ask you
to check his computer.

642
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:28,104
His laptop's gone.

643
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:30,443
Then it's probably gone.

644
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:32,608
He said he needed to edit it.

645
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,379
What would he talk about?

646
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,578
Sorry, Nick...

647
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,314
l never saw it.

648
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:42,319
Nick, wait...

649
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:45,685
You should make one.

650
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:54,332
''
''

651
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:15,109
( sobbing )

652
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:32,295
When did Chaz lose his virginity?

653
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:33,598
God, you're one-track-minded.

654
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:35,832
''lf l have ever made
any valuable discoveries''--

655
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:37,097
Stop.

656
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:38,540
( laughs )

657
00:47:00,498 --> 00:47:01,726
What are those?

658
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:03,596
puffins.

659
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:05,864
Chaz's favorite cereal.

660
00:47:06,103 --> 00:47:07,195
lt was?

661
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,838
pretty good.

662
00:47:17,882 --> 00:47:20,578
You're not the only one
who knows stuff about him.

663
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:22,745
l'll take those.

664
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:23,878
( laughs )

665
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:26,387
( indistinct chatter )

666
00:47:33,164 --> 00:47:35,894
Mmm. ( whistles )

667
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:37,259
Damn...

668
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:40,198
Nick does it again.

669
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:44,637
Have you ever heard
ofjamie Gold?

670
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:45,733
No.

671
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,142
jamie Gold was
a Hollywood producer

672
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:55,176
who won $12 million in
the World poker Championship.

673
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,380
And-- l don't know, man--

674
00:47:57,421 --> 00:47:58,718
Your brother was good.

675
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,223
Chaz was really good.

676
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:03,522
But you're...better.

677
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:04,892
You know?

678
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,159
Get these cards mixed good.

679
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,895
How do you do it?

680
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:14,200
l mean, l'll say this--

681
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:16,297
lf you want to go pro,

682
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,207
l'll be your financial backer
and your manager.

683
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:21,804
Thoughts?

684
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:22,869
Hmm?

685
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:24,939
Suggestions?

686
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:27,807
ldeas?

687
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:29,318
Okay.

688
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:32,355
Let's flop it.

689
00:48:37,962 --> 00:48:40,192
Okay...

690
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:41,596
Fold, too.

691
00:48:57,581 --> 00:48:58,673
300.

692
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:03,276
Randy! He's bluffing.

693
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,447
He's bluffing, bluffing,
bluffing, bluffing.

694
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:07,480
Can you shut up
for once in your life?

695
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:10,584
Ooh, l didn't know it was
that time of the month. My bad.

696
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:11,754
l call.

697
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:14,857
Let's see 'em.

698
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,536
Shit.

699
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:25,599
No way. No way, dude!

700
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:29,511
Thank you very much.
Don't mind if l do.

701
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:30,740
Yo, l'm sorry, man.

702
00:49:30,781 --> 00:49:31,475
l'm wrong.

703
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:33,380
And, you know,
it happens occasionally.

704
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:35,009
You know, just occasionally.

705
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:41,022
Knew it!

706
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:45,629
Hey, Nick,
come outside with me.

707
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:48,997
Come on.

708
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:53,531
Good job, bro!

709
00:49:57,675 --> 00:49:59,370
What were you gonna say next?

710
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:02,509
You lied.

711
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:04,776
You're not stupid,
so what are you?

712
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:07,306
Willfully obnoxious
or just mean?

713
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:09,376
You threw the game
on purpose.

714
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,479
What, and you were
gonna tell everyone?

715
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,649
Seriously? How would that
have made Doug feel?

716
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,688
Answer me.

717
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:19,887
You broke the rules.

718
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,922
Doug's been nothing
but nice to you.

719
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:24,934
Since when are the rules
in a stupid game

720
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,027
more important than
your friend's feelings?

721
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:32,305
lt's never just about
the cards or the money.

722
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:35,675
Tell me you get it.

723
00:50:35,713 --> 00:50:38,079
Tell me you can
understand if you try.

724
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:50,816
Chaz?

725
00:50:57,968 --> 00:50:59,959
Are you hungry?

726
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:01,436
B.B.?

727
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:26,995
What are you doing?

728
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:30,532
Good dental hygiene
is very important.

729
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,964
You can't do that.

730
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:35,665
That's gross.

731
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,575
Good point.

732
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:54,153
Chaz was the only one
who made me feel normal.

733
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:57,389
Now you have to
do that yourself.

734
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:01,898
How can l do that?

735
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:05,433
By practicing the things
that Chaz made you do.

736
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:07,027
Without him?

737
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:10,905
l--i can't.

738
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,499
lt's not easy.

739
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,907
lt's not gonna
happen overnight.

740
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:19,006
But that's what
bemod is all about.

741
00:52:21,985 --> 00:52:25,580
You gotta keep trying until you
start to feel normal.

742
00:52:34,932 --> 00:52:38,663
That was a really nice thing
you did for Doug.

743
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:47,807
l shouldn't have jumped
all over you.

744
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,069
l'm sorry.

745
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:52,948
( bell tolls, people chatter )

746
00:52:56,854 --> 00:52:57,946
Nick?

747
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:59,683
Luke wants to play
chess with you.

748
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,987
- No.
- B.B.

749
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:05,553
Nick, what did we agree on?

750
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:05,823
No!

751
00:53:05,863 --> 00:53:07,763
We'll all have brunch,
and then you'll play chess--

752
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:10,062
We did this last week.

753
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,965
l gave him
the biggest handicap--

754
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:14,527
Queen odds--
and l still beat him.

755
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,869
Then give him Queen
and two rooks.

756
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:18,465
Okay--

757
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:19,771
For the love of--

758
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,675
Why can't you just
try to act normal?

759
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:23,543
l am tired of you
making me feel

760
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,877
like you're
a ticking time bomb!

761
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:26,849
Try to act normal,
or else!

762
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:28,249
- Oliver!
- Oh, that's it!

763
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:31,045
Oliver, stop it!

764
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:33,249
You're making such a scene.

765
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:38,120
I started to wonder
Ifmaybethe hospItaI

766
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:41,028
had made a mistake
and given us someone else's son.

767
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:43,023
Really?

768
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:48,170
l read about a lot of cases
just like that on the internet.

769
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:51,231
But what made you think
it had happened to you?

770
00:53:51,275 --> 00:53:53,243
No one in my family
or lrene's family

771
00:53:53,277 --> 00:53:56,610
has Nick's problems,
and as he grew older,

772
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:58,239
he started to look
less like us,

773
00:53:58,282 --> 00:53:59,977
less Chinese, even.

774
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:02,144
To me, he looks a lot like Chaz.

775
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:06,751
lt was stupid.

776
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,519
l had a D.N.A. test done.

777
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:11,886
And lrene
is like my mother--

778
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:16,195
she has a bad habit of opening
other people's mail.

779
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:17,996
Must've made her very upset.

780
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,965
Upset.

781
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,670
l know he's my son...

782
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:36,175
But still, l can't help thinking
of Nick as Chaz's shadow.

783
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:38,881
And now it's like...

784
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:40,253
Some cruel joke.

785
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,917
Chaz is gone.

786
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:45,788
That's my punishment.

787
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:49,125
For what?

788
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,932
Oh, isn't it obvious?

789
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,048
''
''

790
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:47,151
What was there?

791
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:40,040
B.B., you're back.

792
00:56:41,078 --> 00:56:42,773
Did you go shopping with Randy?

793
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,177
Can l see?

794
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:59,322
He's spending too much
time with Randy.

795
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:00,954
just stop it.

796
00:57:00,997 --> 00:57:03,158
lt's strange, don't you think?

797
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,462
Did you see?

798
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:05,963
He got orange.

799
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:07,936
Can you get him
to buy orange?

800
00:57:07,971 --> 00:57:12,101
l thought you wanted him
to have friends.

801
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:15,942
l'm the one who's trying
to help him find friends.

802
00:57:15,979 --> 00:57:18,174
At church, every week.

804
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:42,494
( Chaz )
It's okay, Ken.

805
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:44,366
Don'tworry about the cameras.

806
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:46,773
They're just there.
They're just In the corner.

Come on, taIk to me.

811
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:58,380
( Ken )
When my mom sIgned me up
for camp In MaIIbu,

812
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:01,788
Iwas reaI excIted.

813
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:04,259
I've never seen the ocean before.

814
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:06,524
But how couId we afford It?

815
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:10,130
She saId Itwas a specIaI camp,

816
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:13,967
free for kIds affected by AIDS.

817
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:18,998
So I was, IIke,
"Oh... I IIe and say I have AIDS?"

818
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:23,235
She saId, "No, baby...

819
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,043
I have AIDS."

820
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:29,878
Chaz made this video
of Ken a while back.

821
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,218
Ken said it was okay
to give you a copy.

822
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:33,552
Would you like that?

823
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,829
( tires screeching )

824
00:58:48,805 --> 00:58:50,397
( beeping )

825
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:53,398
What's that?

826
00:58:56,546 --> 00:58:58,411
Here, switch spots.
Let me see.

827
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:16,462
Hey, can you, uh,
hand me the manual

828
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:18,364
from the glove compartment?

829
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,950
l thought Chaz had these.

830
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:44,015
Are--

831
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:46,961
Are you gay?

832
00:59:57,641 --> 00:59:58,869
Yes.

833
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:02,636
Did Chaz know?

834
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,369
Yes, Nick.

835
01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:05,881
That's against the rules.

836
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:07,406
Nick, listen to me.

837
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,247
No. lt's not allowed.

838
01:00:10,153 --> 01:00:12,314
''A man may imagine
things that are false,

839
01:00:12,355 --> 01:00:14,118
but he only can understand
things that are true,

840
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:16,284
for if it be false,
the apprehension of them

841
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:17,258
is not understanding.''

842
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:20,229
Nick, l loved your brother,
and he loved me.

843
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:21,127
No.

844
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,291
Chaz was gonna tell you,
he really was.

845
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,096
- No!
- Stop it.

846
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:27,035
just stop it!

847
01:00:29,572 --> 01:00:30,664
You're a bad influence.

848
01:00:30,907 --> 01:00:31,601
My dad was right.

849
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:33,131
You're a bad influence!

850
01:00:33,176 --> 01:00:34,666
Nick, listen to me.

851
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:36,469
You're a liar...and a cheat!

852
01:00:36,513 --> 01:00:40,005
Do you spend time with me
'cause l look like Chaz?

853
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,484
Do l turn you on
or something?

854
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,316
Nick, stop it!

855
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:47,014
Why didn't he tell me?

856
01:00:47,057 --> 01:00:49,355
He meant to, but...

857
01:00:49,392 --> 01:00:50,689
He kept procrastinating.

858
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:52,656
Chaz wanted to come out,

859
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:55,460
but he didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

860
01:00:55,498 --> 01:00:57,090
Well, he's right!

861
01:00:57,133 --> 01:00:58,566
Hypocritical...lying...

862
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:01,661
Disgusting freak!

863
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:04,105
Chaz went out of his way
to love and protect you

864
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,165
because you're
not normal, either.

865
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:09,042
Well, screw normal,
and screw you!

866
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,138
Me - a bad influence?

867
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:13,112
lf you hadn't been
so damn needy,

868
01:01:13,149 --> 01:01:14,446
Chaz would've ridden
with me in my car

869
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:16,111
and he would've still
been alive today.

870
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:19,716
l'm gay...

871
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:21,446
So what?

872
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:23,423
That's a crime?

873
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,223
And you know what?

874
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:30,692
We never even
held hands in public.

875
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:35,036
Why?

876
01:01:35,672 --> 01:01:39,438
Because of people like you
and your stupid homophobic family.

877
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:43,070
You think you loved
your brother?

878
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:45,741
No...

879
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:48,578
I loved your brother.

880
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,751
You didn't even know
who your brother was.

881
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:20,241
Yo. Where is everyone?

882
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,383
You guys hungry?
l want to order pizza.

883
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:27,123
l got in! l got into Yale!

884
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:29,523
What?! No way, bro! Congrats!

885
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,187
l'm so excited,
l can't even think straight.

886
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:34,059
Has anybody heard from Ajit?

887
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:35,655
No! Hope he got in.

888
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:37,165
l'm sure he got in.

889
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,758
His grades were better than mine.

890
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:39,359
Whatever, man.

891
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:42,599
Good news or not,
we're gonna get plastered tonight.

892
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:44,664
- Yeah!
- Congrats, man.

893
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:47,671
What's up?

894
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:51,513
You get in?

895
01:02:51,648 --> 01:02:53,741
Yeah? You?

896
01:02:53,783 --> 01:02:54,750
Wait-listed.

897
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:55,751
Damn.

898
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:57,309
Wait-listed means half-in.

899
01:02:57,353 --> 01:02:59,321
No, man, l haven't even
told my parents.

900
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:00,686
l don't know what to tell them.

901
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:02,247
l can talk to my dad.

902
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:05,261
He's one of the key
fundraisers for Yale.

903
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:07,058
- Really?
- Yeah, for sure.

904
01:03:07,097 --> 01:03:08,462
God, l don't even
know what to say--

905
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:09,795
pathetic!

906
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:12,701
You guys are just like--

907
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:15,363
You lose all this money!

908
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:17,669
- You know why you all come here?
- What the hell?

909
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:19,607
lt's to forget that
you've got no friends!

910
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:21,576
But then you can't
even get into Yale

911
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:24,546
without your
parents' money and--

912
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:26,105
Without them, you're nothing!

913
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:27,138
Shut the hell up!

914
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:28,241
Hey!

915
01:03:32,288 --> 01:03:33,585
Nick.

916
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:35,318
Let him go.

917
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:37,757
How's he gonna get home?

918
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:38,726
He's not a baby.

919
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:40,490
There's a bus stop
down the street.

920
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:48,502
jesus...

921
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:51,266
What happened
between you two?

922
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:57,209
He found out that l'm gay.

923
01:03:58,348 --> 01:04:00,714
You're gay? Since when?

924
01:04:02,452 --> 01:04:03,817
Sorry.

925
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:10,718
And Chaz was, too.

926
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,695
Whoa. What is--
What's going on?

927
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:18,200
Hey, Mr. A.p. Math,
can you not put 2 and 2 together?

928
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:21,431
Wait, you're saying that
you and Chaz were lovers?

929
01:04:24,674 --> 01:04:26,608
What about the--the--

930
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:28,167
What about all the babes?

931
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:34,173
l wanted to create
a friendly environment.

932
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:42,186
You guys think
we can still hang out?

933
01:04:42,225 --> 01:04:43,920
Heh...

934
01:04:44,294 --> 01:04:46,626
As long as you're
still buying, man, of course.

935
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:48,290
Hell yeah.

936
01:04:48,431 --> 01:04:49,398
Yeah, man...

937
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:51,696
Any lover of Chaz's--

938
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:53,429
Wait, no, that's not
gonna come out right.

939
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:55,334
( laughter )

940
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,668
Nick?

941
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:01,504
Are you getting ready?

942
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:04,840
Your Aunt May's gonna
be here any moment.

943
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:06,678
LeavemeaIone.

944
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:10,542
We're going to your
favorite dim sum place.

945
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:12,680
Nick, open the door!

946
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:16,784
Nick, l'm just gonna
get the key.

947
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:21,628
( sighs )

948
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:23,564
You're not dressed?

949
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:28,295
Are you sick, B.B.?

950
01:05:28,338 --> 01:05:29,703
Stop calling me that.

951
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:32,435
There is no reason
to get upset, B.B.

952
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:35,239
l'm not your B.B.,
and l'm not your baby.

953
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:37,746
please, we've got to stop fighting.

954
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,749
Sooner or later, we've got
to get back to normal?

955
01:05:40,783 --> 01:05:41,750
Normal?

956
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:46,483
You mean like having a brother
who's gay?

957
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:48,490
What are you talking about?

958
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:51,459
Your perfect Chaz was gay,
and you didn't even know--

959
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:52,461
Be quiet!

960
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:54,520
Stop it, both of you!

961
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:56,759
You don't like the fact
that he was gay,

962
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,323
so you slap me?I

963
01:05:58,368 --> 01:06:01,428
You're the one
who needs beating.

964
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:03,666
You are grounded.

965
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:06,004
lf you hadn't grounded Chaz,

966
01:06:06,242 --> 01:06:08,005
he would've been
driving that day,

967
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:09,506
and not biking.

968
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:11,877
He would be alive today.

969
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:13,472
lt's all your fault!

970
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:14,949
That is enough!

971
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:18,681
You know he's a gambler?

972
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:24,351
And the Firehouse--
the place he volunteers at--

973
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:27,625
is filled with illegals,
and it's run by a lesbian.

974
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:35,461
He made video diaries there...

975
01:06:35,505 --> 01:06:38,497
probably telling
everyone about Randy--

976
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:39,735
his boyfriend.

977
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,299
Nick!

978
01:06:45,815 --> 01:06:48,340
''
''

979
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:31,623
( knock on door )

980
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:34,690
( lrene )
Nick?

981
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,691
Let's get some lunch, huh?

982
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,862
We can talk about
what happened this morning.

983
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:46,932
l'm sure it's all
a horrible misunderstanding.

984
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:50,707
Nick, open the door, please.

985
01:07:57,353 --> 01:07:58,980
l'll go get the key.

986
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:03,859
Nick?

987
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,451
Nick!

988
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,676
These permits are expired.

989
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:39,853
( indistinct chatter )

990
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:41,186
( lrene )
Miss Lee?

991
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,961
Mr. And Mrs. Young, hi.
What a surprise.

992
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:49,487
The show doesn't start--

993
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:50,760
Miss Lee, Where's nick?

994
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,165
He's not here yet.

995
01:09:53,803 --> 01:09:55,134
Where is he?

996
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:56,968
Doug, do you know
where Nick is?

997
01:09:58,074 --> 01:09:59,098
No.

998
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:01,507
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Young.

999
01:10:01,544 --> 01:10:03,102
Why? What's wrong?

1000
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:05,943
Nick...

1001
01:10:05,982 --> 01:10:07,882
l think Nick's run away from home.

1002
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:10,249
What?
Should we call the police?

1003
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:12,977
No, call the other guys
and see if they know where he is.

1004
01:10:13,022 --> 01:10:15,684
And if not, ask them
to go look for him.

1005
01:10:15,725 --> 01:10:16,749
All right.

1006
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,760
You should wait in my office.

1007
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:20,022
You mentioned a show.

1008
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:22,860
Yes, l am sure
Nick will be here for this.

1009
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:23,957
You should stay.

1010
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,264
And, in fact,
we're playing video diaries,

1011
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:27,992
and you'll hear Chaz
on one of them.

1012
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:30,028
Video diaries?

1013
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:33,132
l really think you'll be proud
of what your son accomplished.

1014
01:10:33,175 --> 01:10:34,733
Nick heard it, and he--

1015
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:36,142
What's on the diary?

1016
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:38,009
Oh, it's really about Ken.

1017
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:39,674
Who is Ken?

1018
01:10:39,715 --> 01:10:41,774
Ken and Chaz
made some tape together?

1019
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:43,614
A DVD, yeah.

1020
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:45,883
Saying what? Doing what?

1021
01:10:45,922 --> 01:10:48,891
Ken talked about AlDS
and a first kiss, l think.

1022
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:51,086
l'm sorry, l've heard
so many of the tapes that--

1023
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:52,287
Miss Lee?

1024
01:10:53,062 --> 01:10:54,620
Excuse me.

1025
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:59,533
That must be what Nick saw
that made him think Chaz was--

1026
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:01,901
But they're showing it
in public.

1027
01:11:01,938 --> 01:11:04,566
This is not their property.
This is private.

1028
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:08,133
( speed dialing )
Who are you calling?

1029
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:14,315
Hi. May?

1030
01:11:14,684 --> 01:11:16,311
Yeah, it's me.

1031
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:18,176
We have an emergency.

1032
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:20,152
Can you be our attorney?

1033
01:11:20,289 --> 01:11:22,951
l doubt Nick's at school,
but you never know.

1034
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:26,758
Does Cameron know
the way to the cemetery?

1035
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:28,559
No. Um, and you're not
gonna believe this,

1036
01:11:28,598 --> 01:11:30,896
but Chaz's parents are trying
to shut down the Firehouse.

1037
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:35,229
Tell Miss Lee l think
l know someone who can help.

1038
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:39,730
''
''

1039
01:11:48,117 --> 01:11:49,345
May.

1040
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:51,347
Hi, how are you?

1041
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:53,111
Thank you for coming.

1042
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:54,986
Of course.
That's what family is for, right?

1043
01:11:55,024 --> 01:11:57,288
Don't worry. This is gonna be easy.

1044
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:04,599
- Dad.
- Yeah, hi.

1045
01:12:04,634 --> 01:12:05,965
l need you to come with me.

1046
01:12:06,002 --> 01:12:07,299
Can't right now.

1047
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:08,826
lt's important.

1048
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:09,929
l need your help.

1049
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,145
You, uh, in a hurry?

1050
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:20,306
Dad, l need to
tell you something.

1051
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:27,016
l'm gay.

1052
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:31,021
ls that it?

1053
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,857
Wait, you knew?

1054
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,727
Why didn't you tell me?

1055
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:38,063
l'm supposedto
tell you that you're gay?

1056
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,125
l think you're supposed
to tell me that.

1057
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:42,729
Well, you could've
saved me so much agony.

1058
01:12:42,772 --> 01:12:44,330
Agony?

1059
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:45,704
Discomfort.

1060
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:50,004
So, uh, what prompted
this confession?

1061
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:53,907
Nick saw pictures
of me and Chaz

1062
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:56,179
taken in a photo booth.

1063
01:12:56,218 --> 01:12:57,207
Nude?

1064
01:12:57,253 --> 01:12:58,743
Dad!

1065
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,388
ls that it? Hmm?

1066
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:06,224
'Cause if so, l really should
get back to my work.

1067
01:13:06,262 --> 01:13:08,890
No, no, it's about this
community service center.

1068
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:12,025
Chaz's parents want to
close the place down today,

1069
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:15,902
just because of a show that
they think is gonna out Chaz.

1070
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:18,099
We need your legal help.

1071
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,040
Oh, friends in need.

1072
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:21,907
Wind in my hair.

1073
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:23,969
l'm feeling young again.

1074
01:13:24,013 --> 01:13:26,675
Maybe l'll even crash
your poker party.

1075
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:30,914
No, this is not
about being...homophobic.

1076
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:33,148
You are slandering
the memory of our son,

1077
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:35,180
who is not here
to defend himself.

1078
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:36,919
l think you've misunderstood.

1079
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:39,860
There is nothing on that video diary
about Chaz being gay.

1080
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:41,886
But you think he was, don't you?

1081
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:43,455
l know he was.

1082
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:45,758
Acknowledging the truth
is not slander.

1083
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:48,065
You're just saying that
because you are gay.

1084
01:13:48,104 --> 01:13:50,834
All gay people think
everyone is gay.

1085
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:53,341
( laughs )
Come on.

1086
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:55,468
l don't know why
you're laughing, Miss Lee.

1087
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,339
You've broken so many laws,
l don't know where to begin.

1088
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,076
Expired permits,
unlawful assembly,

1089
01:14:01,117 --> 01:14:02,948
rampant zoning violations,

1090
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:05,010
contributing to the delinquency
of a minor,

1091
01:14:05,054 --> 01:14:06,487
creating a public nuisance,

1092
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:09,452
countless failures
to obtain licenses or permits.

1093
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:12,325
And l'm gonna guess you never
got any consent forms signed

1094
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:14,090
by any of the parents, did you?

1095
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,835
So here's the situation.

1096
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:23,896
Either we shut this
place down completely,

1097
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:26,965
or you hand over
anything created by

1098
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,500
or pertaining to Chaz Young
to his parents.

1099
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:31,839
Sorry to interrupt.

1100
01:14:31,881 --> 01:14:35,282
Miss Lee, your attorney,
Mr. lra Goldman is here.

1101
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:38,514
Dad, you remember
Mr. and Mrs. Young, right?

1102
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:42,190
l'm sorry we're not meeting
under happier circumstances.

1103
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:44,818
please, Mr. Goldman,
don't interfere.

1104
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,852
All we're doing is trying to protect
the memory of our son.

1105
01:14:47,897 --> 01:14:49,956
How do you think
Chaz would feel if he knew

1106
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:52,058
you were trying to
shut down the Firehouse--

1107
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:55,036
the only place in the world
where he could be himself?

1108
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:56,537
That's not true.

1109
01:14:56,772 --> 01:14:58,103
What do you know?

1110
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:01,143
A lot more than you think.

1111
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:04,146
You all want the whole world
to think Chaz was abnormal.

1112
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,977
You mean gay?

1113
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:07,539
Like my son?

1114
01:15:07,783 --> 01:15:10,877
Your family is your business.

1115
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,854
Our family is ours.

1116
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:15,880
Speaking of family,
have you located Nick?

1117
01:15:28,838 --> 01:15:31,432
( IIne rIngIng )

1118
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:41,473
( IIne rIngIng )
jeez.

1119
01:15:48,591 --> 01:15:50,286
( indistinct chatter )

1120
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:56,460
l'm jesus...

1121
01:15:56,498 --> 01:15:58,864
l can help you.

1122
01:16:02,371 --> 01:16:05,135
Hey, Edie! Edie!

1123
01:16:05,174 --> 01:16:07,404
You want to play angel cards?

1124
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:13,178
Boy, you pay in for the story?

1125
01:16:20,856 --> 01:16:23,120
Edie, go get us some burgers!

1126
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:33,597
Eat your burger first.

1127
01:16:33,636 --> 01:16:36,161
What's so important
in that computer?

1128
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:39,106
Chaz said if he was
abducted by aliens,

1129
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,972
l could read
everything he wrote.

1130
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:49,979
( beeps )

1131
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:59,025
Maybe l forced him to lie...

1132
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:00,961
By the way l am.

1133
01:17:01,096 --> 01:17:04,930
No. Lying to others is okay.

1134
01:17:04,967 --> 01:17:08,300
But lying to yourself
is not okay.

1135
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:11,135
l used to have an
angel card for lies,

1136
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:13,403
and if l didn't want
to tell somebody something,

1137
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:15,637
l would just kind of--

1138
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:18,106
( beep )

1139
01:17:18,147 --> 01:17:20,945
l wish l had somebody
that loved me like that.

1140
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:25,248
Will you cry for me
when l'm gone, Nick?

1141
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:30,389
Mother of God--
''l love Nick''.

1142
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:31,358
What?

1143
01:17:31,393 --> 01:17:32,655
''l love Nick''!

1144
01:17:32,695 --> 01:17:34,424
That's the code!

1145
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:36,931
You're--you're crazy.

1146
01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:38,058
No!

1147
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:42,595
''i...Love...Nick''.

1148
01:17:42,638 --> 01:17:43,536
( beep )

1149
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:45,369
That was the
stupidest password.

1150
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:47,500
l mean, the only person
who really loved him--

1151
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,247
Chaz!

1152
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,053
lnbox, 48. Drafts, 11 .

1153
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,454
Dear NIck...

1154
01:18:03,492 --> 01:18:05,585
I needto teII you somethIng.

1155
01:18:05,627 --> 01:18:08,619
But I can't seem to
do It In person,

1156
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:11,132
so I'm gonna try It
theFIrehouseway.

1157
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:14,260
I encouragethe kIds
that I mentorthere

1158
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:17,295
to teII storIes In vIdeo dIary.

1159
01:18:17,339 --> 01:18:20,035
The kIds, IIke you,
Iook up to me.

1160
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:23,135
But...

1161
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:26,045
What you don't know Is--

1162
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:29,974
Is that I'm a fraud
and a coward.

1163
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:32,078
BydefInItIon,
I'm a dIfferent breed

1164
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,420
from our parents,
and so are you, NIck.

1165
01:18:35,457 --> 01:18:39,416
You live in this bubble,
but you're always the real you.

1166
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:42,487
And--
But you don't pretend.

1167
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,460
And l've always been
jealous of that.

1168
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:50,631
They say that Aspies
can't communicate.

1169
01:18:50,672 --> 01:18:53,641
Oh, they are wrong.

1170
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:57,509
You--you laugh, you sulk,
you roll on the floor.

1171
01:18:57,546 --> 01:19:00,276
You communicate,
if not only in words,

1172
01:19:00,315 --> 01:19:02,180
in moods.

1173
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:07,145
Soon l'm gonna tell
the world l'm gay.

1174
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,622
And when the shit
hits the fan,

1175
01:19:08,657 --> 01:19:11,148
l'm gonna need you
to watch my back.

1176
01:19:12,494 --> 01:19:14,519
l love you, bro.

1177
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:18,759
Chaz needs me.

1178
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,401
Wow! l should take
you to 'Nam, man!

1179
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:32,107
They love orange there.

1180
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:35,173
The sun,
the monks' robes,

1181
01:19:35,217 --> 01:19:38,084
row houses painted orange.

1182
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,680
Oh, those guys really
celebrated life.

1183
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:44,283
Too bad we had to
kill so many of 'em.

1184
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:45,623
Thanks, jim.

1185
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:47,426
( continues indistinctly )

1186
01:20:06,215 --> 01:20:08,206
Grandma said a long time ago

1187
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,777
that Vietnamese people
used to eat coconut frogs.

1188
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,412
Oh, yeah.

1189
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:15,184
Coconut and frogs.

1190
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:18,656
They'dtakea coconut
and makea smaII cut

1191
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:20,389
and Insert a tadpoIe.

1192
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:22,829
Then, a few weeks Iater,
they'd open upthecoconut

1193
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:26,699
to fInd a bIInd frog
wIthwhIte skIn.

1194
01:20:26,735 --> 01:20:28,726
It hadthe smoothest skIn

1195
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,568
and the softest
coconut-fIavoredmeat.

1196
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:38,211
For most of my IIfe,
I've been one ofthose tadpoIes.

1197
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:42,612
l can't believe--

1198
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:45,219
( whisper )
You'rechargIngus?

1199
01:20:45,254 --> 01:20:46,346
By the hour?

1200
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:49,619
What happened to
''That's what family's for''?

1201
01:20:49,658 --> 01:20:52,491
l'm giving you
the not-for-profit rate!

1202
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:55,196
Nick!

1203
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:03,536
We're so sorry
for fighting with you.

1204
01:21:03,572 --> 01:21:06,405
Whatever you want to say,
we want to hear it, okay?

1205
01:21:06,441 --> 01:21:09,774
l found it--
Chaz's video diary.

1206
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:11,176
That's great, Nick.

1207
01:21:11,213 --> 01:21:13,647
We'll watch it together
at home.

1208
01:21:13,682 --> 01:21:15,912
The lawyers can
settle this themselves.

1209
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:17,846
Nick, your parents
and their attorney

1210
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:21,253
are gonna sue Miss Lee if she
doesn't close down the Firehouse.

1211
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,258
You're all acting
like we're heartless.

1212
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:25,590
We're doing this
because we love Chaz.

1213
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:29,591
We're starting
a scholarship in his name.

1214
01:21:29,631 --> 01:21:30,893
He was so smart.

1215
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:31,922
Everyone liked him.

1216
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,657
He had his head on straight.

1217
01:21:33,702 --> 01:21:37,229
We'll always remember him
as an ideal son--

1218
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:38,432
But l knew.

1219
01:21:38,473 --> 01:21:39,701
lrene, no, no.

1220
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:40,730
l knew.

1221
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:43,404
l tried not to tell myself.

1222
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:44,810
l thought if l didn't say it,

1223
01:21:44,846 --> 01:21:45,938
it wouldn't be true,

1224
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:47,910
or it would just be a phase.

1225
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:48,939
You know?

1226
01:21:49,885 --> 01:21:52,183
This is not about outing the dead.

1227
01:21:52,221 --> 01:21:55,418
This is pure speculation
on all of your parts.

1228
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,618
Chaz isn't here
to speak for himself.

1229
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,456
But l am...

1230
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:01,189
l know.

1231
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:04,694
Hey, guys, l'm sorry,
l don't want to interrupt.

1232
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:08,294
But, um...
people are starting to arrive.

1233
01:22:08,337 --> 01:22:10,862
Send them home.
There's not gonna be a show.

1234
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:13,807
May, you go home.

1235
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,400
How can you--
You can't just give up--

1236
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:18,538
She is billing by the hour.

1237
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:43,269
l'm glad Chaz didn't die a virgin.

1238
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:48,906
Nick, love the orange.

1239
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:50,605
That's a nice shirt.

1240
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,281
Ajit...

1241
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:55,840
l didn't mean to say those--

1242
01:22:55,884 --> 01:22:57,283
lt's all good, man.

1243
01:22:59,721 --> 01:23:01,712
All right, let's get this show going.

1244
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:03,657
.'Y ou know
how l, l, l, l do .

1245
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:04,784
.'Don't worry about me .

1246
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:05,884

1250
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,356

1251
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:13,527

1252
01:23:13,568 --> 01:23:14,557

1257

1258
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:25,377

1259
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:27,905

1262
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:33,912
.'T here's no way
you can't see .

1263
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,928
( music fades out )

1264
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:46,963
Good evening, everybody.

1265
01:23:47,002 --> 01:23:50,062
As you know, we recently
lost one of our very own--

1266
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:51,772
Chaz Young.

1267
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:55,538
And l'm happy to introduce
Nick Young,

1268
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,841
who has something
very special to share.

1269
01:24:16,698 --> 01:24:19,963
Grandma saId a IongtImeago
thatVIetnamesepeopIe

1270
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:22,799
used to eat coconut frogs.

1271
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:24,362
Oh, yeah.

1272
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:26,567
Coconut and frogs.

1273
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:29,441
They'dtakea coconut
and makea smaII cut

1274
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:31,343
and Insert a tadpoIe.

1275
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,678
Then, a few weeks Iater,
they'd open upthecoconut

1276
01:24:33,715 --> 01:24:36,548
to fInd a bIInd frog
wIthwhIte skIn.

1277
01:24:36,585 --> 01:24:37,677
( click )

1278
01:24:44,726 --> 01:24:45,750
Go.

1279
01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:55,527
Go on.

1280
01:25:07,382 --> 01:25:11,512
After a couple of weeks...

1281
01:25:13,922 --> 01:25:16,720
You open the coconut...

1282
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:21,393
And you'll see...

1283
01:25:23,465 --> 01:25:28,493
A blind frog with...

1284
01:25:28,537 --> 01:25:30,505
with white skin.

1285
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:39,812
And it'll have
the smoothest skin

1286
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:47,414
and the softest
coconut-flavored meat.

1287
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:50,620
''
''

1288
01:25:53,094 --> 01:25:56,962
For most of my life...

1289
01:25:56,998 --> 01:26:00,161
l've--l've been like...

1290
01:26:00,502 --> 01:26:02,868
one ofthose tadpoles.

1291
01:26:05,474 --> 01:26:07,567
Growing up
in this strange world

1292
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:12,672
that never seemed right,

1293
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:15,444
but trying my best

1294
01:26:15,484 --> 01:26:20,581
to fit in, to grow...

1295
01:26:20,622 --> 01:26:22,112
lnto a frog.

1296
01:26:32,634 --> 01:26:37,469
After spending time
at the Firehouse,

1297
01:26:37,506 --> 01:26:39,838
it hit me.

1298
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:46,604
Our parents wanted us
to be perfect.

1299
01:26:46,648 --> 01:26:52,018
They had an image
of what perfect should be.

1300
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:54,521
But in the end,

1301
01:26:54,556 --> 01:26:57,184
l don't deserve to live in a coconut.

1302
01:26:57,225 --> 01:26:59,955
No one does.

1303
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:01,926
( crying )

1304
01:27:13,675 --> 01:27:16,610
Chaz was gay,

1305
01:27:16,645 --> 01:27:18,875
and l have Asperger's.

1306
01:27:18,914 --> 01:27:22,816
But l agree with Chaz.

1307
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:24,876
l am not a white frog.

1308
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:29,584
And l will not be
a white frog,

1309
01:27:29,624 --> 01:27:35,085
even if l'm weird
or different or strange.

1310
