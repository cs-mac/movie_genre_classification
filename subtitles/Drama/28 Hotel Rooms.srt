2
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,667
Lift your leg up.

3
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,207
Is this seat taken?

4
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,181
What's good to eat here?

5
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,958
The chocolate explo--
explosion cake. It sounds--

6
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
That sounds good.

7
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:19,231
Or-Or not.
What do you think?

8
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,233
You look good.

9
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:27,472
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm just doing press
for my book.

10
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,341
I'm doing a tour. Yeah.

11
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,943
Crazy time, actually.

12
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,845
I was at this party last night
with all these
famous people there.

13
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:38,650
Prince played at it,
which was pretty--
pretty cool.

14
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,719
Oh.

15
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,888
What are you doing here?

16
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,656
Just work.

17
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,226
What is it that you do again?
What--

18
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,562
Analytical processing.

19
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,397
Ah.

20
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,600
Data mining.

21
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:59,338
It's really more, uh,
predictive analysis.

22
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,973
Do you speak English?

23
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,815
Where's home again
for you?

24
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,684
- Seattle.
- Right. Seattle.

25
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,020
You?
New York.

26
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,259
- You ready sir?
- Hey. Uh--

27
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,930
I'm gonna get that
chocolate explosion cake.

28
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,898
And, uh--
You know what?
Make it two.

29
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,401
One for the lady over there.

30
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,336
- None for me, thanks.
- No-- Get it--

31
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,739
No, one is--
that's fine.
One is fine.

32
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,409
Okay.
We could split it,
if you want.

33
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,546
- Hey.
- Hey.

34
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,815
I gotta get down to the lobby.
Someone's picking me up at 9:00.

35
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,017
Sorry. Did I wake you?
No, no.

36
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,987
It's-It's fine.
It's fine.

37
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:00,792
I left my number for you.
If you're, you know,
in New York.

38
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,494
If you wanna give me
a shout.

39
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,432
I'm never gonna call you.

40
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,439
Okay.

41
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,844
Have a good day.

42
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,462
You okay?

43
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,865
Yeah, yeah.

44
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,679
I broke up with my girlfriend.

45
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,983
Not for you, obviously.
Why did I-- I didn't--

46
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,852
I don't know
why I just said that.

47
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,921
Well, I'm married now.

48
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,225
Yeah, I figured.

49
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,128
Hey, how was your wedding?

50
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,696
You have fun?

51
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,872
Were there--
Were a lot of people
at the--

52
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,807
a lot of people
at the wedding?

53
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,477
Grandmas, grandpas?

54
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,484
You have a band
or a deejay?

55
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,220
You like to dance?

56
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,963
What's your name again?

57
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,835
You said you weren't gonna
call me. You lied.
Why did you call me?

58
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,639
Was it the penis?

59
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,508
It's handsome.

60
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,611
It's a handsome penis.
Is that why?

61
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,145
That's it.

62
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,522
Why did you call?

63
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,776
What?
Tell me something
about yourself.

64
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,711
Like what?
Anything.

65
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,914
You wanna know
my favorite color?

66
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,049
You like your work?
Yes. I love it.

67
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,889
What?
Come on.

68
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,858
You wanna know--
You wanna know
my favorite color?

69
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,793
No, I don't wanna know
your favorite color.

70
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,930
Tell me-- Tell me--
What would you--
Just stop talking.

71
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,733
Do you have a--
you have a middle name?

72
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,902
Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.
Are you gonna tell me?

73
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,171
No.
You're just gonna keep
turning off the light?

74
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,739
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

75
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,274
I'm gonna--

76
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,209
I'm gonna break
the fuckin' lamp
over your head.

77
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,753
All right.

78
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,790
All right.
You get one question.

79
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,191
One.

80
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,109
Hold on.
I'm thinking.

81
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,182
Only one?

82
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,818
Don't push it.

83
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,664
No, no. I get one question.
I get one que--
Well, time's running out.

84
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,866
Turn the light out.
Turn it off?

85
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:38,003
Turn it off.
Goin' off.

86
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,411
When's your
next conference?

87
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,821
Do you have any brothers
and sisters?

88
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,060
Are your mom and dad
still together?

89
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,399
Are you a Democrat
or a Republican?

90
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,804
Have you ever seen
a Ronald Reagan film?

91
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,742
Do you like vanilla
or chocolate?

92
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,379
Vanilla? Chocolate?

93
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,957
Would you rather be eaten
by a shark
or die in an earthquake?

94
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,162
Shark.

95
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,906
Would you rather have
a superpower--

96
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,141
I didn't even finish
what I was about to say.

97
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,111
Would you have-- rather have
a superpower to fly--

98
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,914
or to turn me
into a buffalo?

99
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,178
See ya.

100
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,914
I, uh--
I read your book.

101
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,486
- Oh, yeah?
- It surprised me.

102
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,921
It's just a book.

103
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,758
It's not just a book.
It's a best seller.

104
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,494
It's in every airport.

105
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,330
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

106
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,900
I really liked it.
Good.

107
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,869
You're a very good writer.

108
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,171
Yes, I am.

109
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,373
I'm not just saying that.
No, I know.

110
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,076
I'm good.
No, thank you.

111
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,178
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
That's very nice of you.

112
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,183
I, uh--
Um, I met someone.

113
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,419
I have a girlfriend.
It's not a serious thing.

114
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:12,524
I just wanted to be honest
with you, if that, uh--
I don't know the rules.

115
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,926
We keep on doing this,
and you're gonna have
to leave her for me.

116
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,800
Maybe you should
leave him for me.

117
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,325
Oh, my God. I gotta go.
What am I doing here?

118
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,227
Have a good flight.
See ya.

119
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,406
Oh, my--

120
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,976
Oh, shit.
Alarm.

121
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,146
Uh-- It's not worth it.
It's not worth it.
Don't do it. Don't do it.

122
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:11,182
Don't-- Don't do it! What--
That's what I'm talkin' about.

123
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,896
I used to be in,
like, a special ed,
um-- I'm serious.

124
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:29,934
Like a special ed--
math class. And uh--

125
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,003
Like, was this
last year?
It kind of scarred me forever.

126
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,205
And there was this one kid,
Timmy Eckensterner.

127
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:40,011
And he was a total fucking
freak of nature.

128
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,414
And there was this wonderful
girl, Mariana Steins.

129
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,984
She was born
with a hole in her heart.
How do you re-- What?

130
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:50,321
Yeah. She-She was, like,
a little thing with an Afro,
and she was--

131
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,190
She was a neighbor,
Mariana Steins.

132
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,259
Did she survive, or did she die
from her heart?
She survived.

133
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:58,162
She's-She's still going.
She's a wonderful human being.

134
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,266
But the kids made fun of her
and then made fun of me,

135
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:05,370
'cause I was hanging out
with her, you know.

136
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,321
Who was the first person
you ever kissed?

137
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:27,091
Christian Iveson.

138
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:33,097
Iveson?
Braces.
He had braces. I did not.

139
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,533
Did he stick his tongue
in your mouth?
Mm-mmm.

140
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,535
No. He was pretty wimpy.

141
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,371
What about the first time
you had sex?

142
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,674
Mmm.

143
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,943
How old were you?

144
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,679
Eighteen.
College.

145
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,048
All my friends-- Uh--
They all had already had sex.

146
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,183
So I also felt pressure,
'cause I was, like--

147
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,386
like the only person, you know,
who, like, hadn't done it yet.

148
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,056
When was--
Who broke your heart
the first time?

149
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,558
Ashley Luden.

150
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,561
She would never sleep with me.
And I really wanted to make--

151
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:07,231
I was-- "Wow, we've been dating
a long time. I want <i>this</i> to be
the first girl I sleep with.

152
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,434
This is gonna be special."
And then she broke up with me...

153
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,269
and fucked half the school.

154
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,171
Really. She did.
No!

155
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:19,377
Yeah. It was like--
I don't know. I turned Ashley
into a complete slut.

156
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,147
Where-Where was that Ashley?
Where was that Ashley?

157
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,050
You ever have an experience
with a girl?

158
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,585
Mm-mmm.
No?

159
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,690
I did with a guy.
You did?

160
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,727
Yeah. When I was a kid.

161
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,629
We'd play, like, G.I. Joes.
And then--

162
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,733
And then I'd get shot,
and he'd nurse me
with a blow job, you know.

163
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,501
Wow.

164
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,571
Yeah. But I could--
I was so young,
I couldn't even come.

165
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:50,274
I got a blow job.
This is-- This is not
gonna make you like me.

166
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,377
You have, like,
the blow job chronicles.

167
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,779
"The Blow Job Chronicles."

168
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,583
"My first blow job--

169
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,218
started with a boy."

170
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:07,658
I'm a king in Monaco,
so fuck everybody.

171
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,396
I'm the king
of the most serene republic
of San Marino.

172
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,765
I'm the king of Liechtenstein.

173
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:18,036
Do you wanna be
my princess?

174
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,471
I've never been crowned at all.

175
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,474
Excuse me.
I've never been crowned at all.

176
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,309
Oh, terrific.

177
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,280
Can we get
two more of these, please?

178
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,216
Bring the pain.
I don't think
you feel any pain.

179
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,221
Drink up.

180
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,561
- What part of the hotel is this?
 - What floor are we on?

181
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,064
Wake up!
Go!

182
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,200
They're comin' after us!

183
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,469
Run.
Look at me.
Look at this.

184
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,304
Come on. Let's go. Run!

185
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,705
Run!
Oh, my--

186
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,243
Can you feel the pain now?

187
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,479
Oh, God, get up. Okay.

188
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,281
Come on. Come on.

189
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,386
- This way, this way!
- You're gonna get it. Come on.

190
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,125
What should we do?

191
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,661
No, where--
Where? What?
Is this--

192
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,362
Oh, my God.
Come on, get it.

193
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,530
Get in.

194
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,570
I love your feet.

195
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,872
If-- When I see
a beautiful woman,

196
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:32,844
and I look down
and I see ugly feet,
I get very turned off.

197
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,280
And vice versa.
If I see great feet,

198
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,684
and then I look up
and see an ugly woman,
I might be extremely turned on.

199
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,220
Oh, oh, oh.
What? No, it's gonna--

200
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,422
You-- It's good,
it's good, it's good.
What?

201
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,157
You don't like that?
No, it's good.

202
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,627
This nail is so small
that it's--
It looks so sad, this nail.

203
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,198
But you have to--
Don't you feel
for the underdog a little?

204
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,834
I do.
Like,
"poor little guy"?

205
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,471
It's odd that you have--
you have no nail there.

206
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,708
It's kind of--
it's kind of freakish.

207
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,911
It's gettin'
kinda scary.
Shut up and paint it.

208
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,281
Is it that you--
Did you dance
when you were a kid?

209
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,749
Yeah.
You did?

210
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,584
Mm-hmm.
Like ballet?

211
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,453
Mm-hmm.
Really?

212
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,388
Did you do
modern dance?
Mm-hmm.

213
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,390
Jazz?
Mm-hmm.

214
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,459
Did you ever break-dance?
Mm-mmm.

215
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,428
Barefoot Polynesian hula?
Mm-hmm.

216
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,898
- I'm so bad at this.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,746
What do you even like
about me?

218
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,315
Could you tell me?

219
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,484
Yeah, sure.
Okay.

220
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,322
Do it.

221
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,291
You want me to--

222
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,598
You want me to tell you
what I like about you?

223
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,634
Yeah.
Um--

224
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,304
What do you mean?
List. Like-Like
make the list.

225
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,805
Like a
top ten list?
Yeah.

226
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,308
That's impossible to do.
I can't sum it all up.

227
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,411
It's not impossible.

228
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,751
Um, I think you're
a very smart woman,

229
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,653
which isn't saying much
compared to me.

230
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,755
But it's good. Very good.

231
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,858
Um--

232
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,928
You're beautiful.
That goes without saying.
Sexy.

233
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,598
I love your eyes.

234
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,403
Great eyes.
Um-- I love
your moles.

235
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:22,640
Um--

236
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:27,411
Your--
The way you-you walk.

237
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,680
Look good doing it.

238
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,850
Um--

239
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,954
I feel...
really ugly.

240
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,627
Just... a horrible person.

241
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,137
But then--

242
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,475
I like you.

243
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,621
I go to sleep.
When-- When I wake up, I--

244
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,724
I can't concentrate at work
I can't--

245
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,732
I love him.

246
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,737
I love him.

247
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,742
I think.

248
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,414
I don't know what to think.

249
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,684
Yeah.

250
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,489
I know.

251
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,459
I know.

252
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,180
What do you like
about me?

253
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,488
Something. Good.

254
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,862
See? It's hard.
It's not easy.

255
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,969
I like your laugh.

256
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,973
I like when you cry too.
But I-- I don't like when you're
sad, but I like when you cry.

257
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,808
There something--
How about both at once?

258
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,243
When you laugh and cry?
You like that?

259
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,479
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I love that.

260
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,682
You do it--
And when you laugh
your nostrils kind of flare.

261
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:49,520
They're-They're almost, like,
breathing. Right now.

262
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,789
It-- It's beautiful.
That might be my number one.

263
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,190
Oh, God.

264
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,765
Bye.
Bye.

265
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,835
Don't go.
Yeah, let's live here.

266
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,771
Take another flight.
I can't. He's picking me up
from the airport. I gotta go.

267
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,073
Bye.
Bye.

268
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,582
I love you.

269
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,762
Now would be a good time
to express your feelings,
reciprocal or otherwise.

270
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,731
Yes.
Yes?

271
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,266
I love you.

272
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,703
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this.

273
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,974
What <i>are</i> we doing?

274
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,611
We're--

275
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,981
I don't know.
You tell me.

276
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,918
I don't know.
I'd like to know.

277
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,689
We could keep meeting.

278
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,992
You mean cheating.
Yeah. I suppose.

279
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,796
Well, let's call it
what it is.
I wanna keep doing this.

280
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,205
I'm happy.
No, I'm happy.

281
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:24,048
Okay. Yeah, well,
I'm still working through
that section.

282
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,654
Okay. That-That's
awesome, Lauren. Bye.

283
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,891
So?
So, he loved it.

284
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:36,927
I told you. He's a genius.
No, he loves everything though.
That's his way.

285
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,629
He's very--
He's always very kind.

286
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,798
No, no, no--
I'm telling you,
this is the one.

287
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,636
This is the one.
It's better than the first one.
Come on. Trust me. I know.

288
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,705
- I hope you're right.
- I know I'm right.

289
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,139
And I read it.
To my second book.

290
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,141
Yeah.
You look beautiful.

291
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,143
So do you.

292
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,080
In a manly way.

293
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,150
Give me a kiss.

294
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,086
Give me a kiss.
Listen.

295
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,822
I want a kiss.
Hey. Look over there.

296
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:07,257
Hey, what's that?
It's the Empire State Building.

297
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,727
We're gonna climb that tonight.
We're goin' nuts tonight.

298
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,730
We're gonna eat.
We're gonna eat light.

299
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:16,333
We're gonna have a nice dessert.
We're gonna get drunk on wine.

300
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,003
And then we're gonna
fuckin' dance.

301
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,239
Seriously. I'm giving you
a fuckin' New York tour.
It's starting tonight.

302
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,308
Starting tonight.
No, I have--
I've had dinners with...

303
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,879
so many people from New York
at work, these offices, I--

304
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,382
You got recognized today. It's--
That's so rare.
It never happens.

305
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:34,818
I know. And yet--
I mean, you know--

306
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,757
It's not safe.

307
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,931
I understand.
I don't think you should feel
paranoid. New York's a big city.

308
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,434
I don't think anyone's
gonna recognize you.
If they recognize you--

309
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:53,437
If they recognize it, we can
be friends. We can be friends
walking around New York city.

310
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,339
I know. Look, I have an idea.

311
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,074
You're not gonna be sorry.

312
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,376
Just give it a chance.

313
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,314
Does it involve food?

314
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:07,384
- It's gonna be great.
- Better be, like,
the greatest idea ever,

315
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,286
'cause I'm really,
really into my idea.

316
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,188
It's--

317
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,800
It's totally amazing, because
the fact that they gave me
more than one team this time...

318
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:01,405
means that they see me
as somebody who, um--

319
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,775
It's good. It's just,
it's really, really good.

320
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:09,079
And it means I have the power
to actually do something
for once.

321
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,049
The only problem is Aaron.

322
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:15,119
Fucking Aaron is gonna try
to fuck things up for me
as usual,

323
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,888
'cause he's always jealous.

324
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,895
Now, if we merge,

325
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:29,466
then I'll end up
being in a position
to run those teams too.

326
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,102
So-- I'm cold.

327
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,105
I can handle him.

328
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,977
Now I just gotta kick ass.

329
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,545
Then I can pick my projects.

330
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:45,215
Only wanna answer to Charlie.
That's all I wanna do anyway.

331
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,422
Am I talking too much.
I'm talking too much.

332
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:55,159
No.

333
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,328
Are you okay?
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

334
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,933
Is this you stoned?

335
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,969
You get all paranoid
and distant?
I'm fine.

336
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,371
I had a thing.

337
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,241
With her?
No.

338
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,314
You can tell me about her.
No, it's not her.
It's just-- It's nothing.

339
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,916
What?

340
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,924
My book got killed.

341
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,832
Like really killed.

342
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,908
The reviews were--

343
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,011
It was like I murdered
their children or something.

344
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,281
You know what? You just
gotta move on. It's your
second book, you know.

345
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,884
"Move on."
Move on to what?

346
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,919
It's--
No one's gonna read
my book now.

347
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,454
Well, I think it's good.

348
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:08,432
Nobody gives a shit.
I mean, no one cares.

349
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,135
You know, I wanna do something
in my life.

350
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:17,074
I wanna-- I want--
You know? I want--

351
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,176
Come on, you're just stoned.
Come on.

352
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,979
I want what I do to matter.
What I do matters.

353
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,917
And I don't wanna
just move widgets around.

354
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,421
You mean, like,
ensuring the continuing growth
of major corporations?

355
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:35,292
Hey, without you, who'd exploit
the people, rape the land
and make billions?

356
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,628
That's not very funny.

357
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,463
Actually, it is.

358
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:43,433
I'm paid fairly
for the work I do.

359
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,069
What?

360
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,039
High school teachers
barely exist
over the poverty line.

361
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,941
Maybe I deserve more.
Maybe--

362
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:54,211
Maybe my contribution
to the health of this nation
is actually worth more.

363
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,914
Dollars, right?
It's all about dollars.

364
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:59,483
Yeah. Actually, it is.

365
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:03,520
You don't create anything.
I mean, you don't--
You just move numbers around.

366
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,688
Mmm.
Right?

367
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,225
I create efficiency,

368
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,160
which creates wealth.

369
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,430
For what?
For money.

370
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,534
If you do it for the money,
then you're just a whore.

371
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:20,203
I do it just for the money.
Seriously.

372
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,577
Wow.
Look at you,
you bourgeois pig.

373
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:32,215
Look at you,
commie bastard.

374
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,318
Seriously.
Seriously?

375
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,189
- Yeah.
- Okay. Seriously, I think
that life is fucking short.

376
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:42,459
And we're animals,
and we have to fucking fight
for our food,

377
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:46,363
and the weak die,
and the strong survive.

378
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,365
Wow. Who are you?

379
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,267
And what are you doing
in my room?

380
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,343
What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?

381
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,311
You're leaving?

382
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,352
Not everyone gets to just lay
around and have their fucking
feelings all day long.

383
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:12,422
Okay? And, you know,
gets to sort of turn everything
that they think or they see...

384
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:16,293
into some meaningful reflection
of life that makes the world
a better place.

385
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:19,629
It's just a book.

386
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,332
"The best part of this"--

387
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:26,303
"The best part of this
self-loathing travesty
of a novel is its length.

388
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:29,272
At 139 pages,

389
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:32,209
at least one only has
to suffer through it briefly."

390
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,715
Not just a book.

391
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,267
- Why wouldn't you?
Do you love her?
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,403
- Of course I love her.
- Then do it.

393
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,271
You want me to do it.

394
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:04,608
I don't want you to do anything.
Yes, you do.
You want me to do it.

395
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,244
No. I want you
to do what you feel.

396
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,079
Yeah, you know why?
Why?

397
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:12,816
Because you want an out,
that's why.

398
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,252
No.
Yes.

399
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:19,823
I'm saying,
<i>if</i> you love her,
if that's true,

400
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,792
then you should ask her.

401
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,508
Why aren't we together?
We are together.

402
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,178
Why aren't we living together?

403
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,580
Oh, you mean,
like, "together" together.

404
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,582
Really, like,
the house and chimney,

405
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,417
and the picket fence
and the doggies.

406
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,352
Let's see. Um--

407
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,289
You have a husband.

408
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:57,094
You have a girlfriend.
Yes. Right. I forgot.
There's that.

409
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,197
Husband. Girlfriend. Husband.
I'm serious.

410
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,806
Get a divorce.

411
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,895
- You want me to get a divorce?
- Yes.

412
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,197
Are you serious?
You want me to get a divorce?
Yes.

413
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,665
Because you're getting married.

414
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,503
And I think that you should.

415
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:22,279
Is anybody doing it
buffalo-style?

416
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:33,957
How's things goin' down there?
Your lives turning out just
the way you thought it would?

417
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:39,329
What?
 Your lives turning out just the way you thought it would?

418
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:45,202
Whoo!
I know. It's a fucking puzzle.

419
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:50,540
Help me put it together.

420
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,382
Shh.

421
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,591
How was it?
Did you have a-a band
or a deejay?

422
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,426
Uh, we had a deejay.

423
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,229
Were there a lot
of people there?

424
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,966
Like 70 something, 75.
Oh, yeah?

425
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:18,969
-It was at night, right?
Isn't that what you said?
-Yeah, it was a beautiful night.

426
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,838
It actually
was supposed to be
bad weather, but--

427
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,975
It sounds corny,
but it was kind of
a magical day.

428
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:28,278
You know, I-I don't...
know how much
I believe in it,

429
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,014
the whole thing as an
institution, but I actually had
a fucking great time.

430
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,616
Mm-hmm.

431
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:40,690
I never get her anything or--
I buy her presents,
but I take her to the store,

432
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:44,427
and I ask her, you know,
pick out whatever she likes,
and she hates that, so...

433
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,564
I surprised her with this.

434
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,867
I got her--
I gave her
my grandmother's ring.

435
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:54,938
Which was-- It really meant
a lot to me, 'cause I love
my grandmother.

436
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,975
She-She passed away
a couple years ago.

437
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,745
She just-- She went nuts.
She loved it, you know?

438
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,750
What?

439
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,887
You mad?
No.

440
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,628
- You asked.
- I know. I shouldn't have.

441
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,766
We could never be married,
you and I.
Oh, yeah?

442
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:25,001
No.
Why not?

443
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:29,939
Well, you hate the way
I stay up late and keep you
up late at night working.

444
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:34,878
What about how early
I have to get up?
And how early I fall asleep?

445
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,915
There you go. That's annoying.
You go to bed
at 8:30 at night, Grandma.

446
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:43,486
- You hate how I am cold
and withholding.
- No.

447
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,855
- Come on.
- Mmm, I don't.

448
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,758
Little bit.
Here's the thing.
I share a lot with you,

449
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,362
and I tell you a lot
about what's going on with me,
and at this point in our--

450
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:57,334
whatever we are,
whatever this is,
I-I-- I probably overshare,

451
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,736
but I tell you a lot
about what's going on with me.

452
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:02,372
You, I don't know.
It's a mystery, so--

453
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:05,909
Every now and then,
it would be nice to know
what the fuck you were thinking.

454
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,078
You're right.
We could never be married.

455
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,435
You're mad now?

456
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,772
No, I'm fine.

457
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,011
You always like
to fucking rewrite history.
That's-That's what you do.

458
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:45,415
And then you act.
You replay it back
in your own fucking way,

459
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,952
and you always
paint me out
to be the fucking asshole.

460
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:52,122
Do you not?
Well, you're being
an asshole.

461
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:55,992
I like spending time with you,
I'm sorry. I like, fucking,
spending time with you.

462
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,962
You do. That's all I want to do.
Okay. I don't know. I just--

463
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:01,664
I just wanna know
you're there for me too.
I know, I know. It's just...

464
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,834
when I'm outside,
when I'm alone,
when I'm away from you,

465
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,870
and I wanna spend
some time with you,

466
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:09,672
and I text you,
and I try to find you,
and then you're not anywhere--

467
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,875
I know it sounds like
I'm being a pussy.
You know what my life is like!

468
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,710
I know--
You know what my life
is like!

469
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,912
I know it sounds
like I'm being a fucking pussy,
but for me--

470
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,481
I can't give you
more than I'm giving you.
I can't give you more than that.

471
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:21,885
I'm not asking that.
All I'm asking for
is a fucking-- a text message!

472
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,686
A fucking text message!

473
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,890
I'm not asking for anything
that fucking important!

474
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,491
Okay?

475
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,731
I'm in it too!
I'm in it too, okay?
I'm in it too.

476
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,534
Don't make me out to be
a fucking asshole.

477
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,639
I just don't know how--

478
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,843
How?

479
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,181
To be in this room
with you.

480
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:53,783
I don't know how to be
in this room with you.

481
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,722
I mean, I--
You know what I mean?
Like, I want to see you.

482
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,125
I'm here for you.
I came here for you.

483
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:06,896
But I don't know how--
Right now
I don't feel like...

484
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,698
you want me here.

485
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,834
I don't feel like
I should be here.
I don't know--

486
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,736
I don't know how to, like,
want to be here with you.

487
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,706
I don't feel like you want to
be-- I mean, I know you're
saying that, but I--

488
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,075
I want to be with you.
I feel like
you want to kill me.

489
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,910
I don't want to kill you.

490
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:26,015
I want you fully--
I want you--

491
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,486
I want to walk outside.
I want to walk outside.

492
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:32,522
I want to be outside,
walking with you.

493
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:34,858
I don't want to be
in a fucking hotel.

494
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,561
I'm tired. I can't open
the fucking-- Can you open
the windows here?

495
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,129
Can you even open
the fucking windows here?

496
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,599
You'd fucking jump out.
That's why.

497
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,835
No, I'm not gonna--
I'm not gonna jump out.
I want some fucking air.

498
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,747
Okay.
I can open 'em?

499
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,616
Open your eyes.

500
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,190
I'm on the porch.

501
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,660
It's, uh--

502
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,231
It's small, but cozy.

503
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,336
My house.

504
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,305
It's our house.

505
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,875
And it's me,

506
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:08,878
and we--
our three kids are playing
out in the yard,

507
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,281
and-and-and-and
I'm reading the paper.

508
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,252
Got my coffee.

509
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,190
Got you.

510
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,929
We have a little shed
so I can do my pottery.

511
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,036
You do pottery?

512
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,737
I'm very good.
Really?

513
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,172
Yes.
You are?

514
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,774
Yes, I am.

515
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,409
Don't laugh at me.

516
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:41,344
Okay, we'll get a shed.

517
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,819
And we're surrounded by trees.
Lots of trees...

518
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,954
and a vegetable garden.

519
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,956
I always wanted a chicken coop.

520
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,992
Let's get a chicken coop.

521
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:58,795
That you feed.
That we make the kids feed.

522
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:00,897
Hey, guys!

523
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:04,333
Mom wants you to feed
the chicken coop.

524
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:06,903
Okay.
I'm not gonna touch
the chickens.

525
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:10,039
I just wanted a coop.
The kids can feed 'em.

526
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,382
You okay?

527
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,719
Yeah.

528
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,357
Yeah.

529
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,136
It's a nice thought.

530
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,440
We don't have to have
the chicken coop
if it makes you upset.

531
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:48,111
No, no, no, no.
We have a house.
We have a porch. Pottery shed.

532
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:52,315
Got your fucking chickens.
Yeah. We eat vegetables
from the fucking garden.

533
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,250
Yeah. Then fuck.

534
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,885
Or make love.

535
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,487
Sweet--

536
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,458
Sweet, gentle lovemaking.

537
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,851
I'm gonna kill her.

538
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,123
Gonna kill her,
but--

539
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,465
She-- She writes critics--

540
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,468
anonymously--
the ones that kill me,
you know.

541
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,470
She dissects their critique.

542
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:51,574
She-- She defends me.

543
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,390
We leave them,

544
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,060
and we're together.

545
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,830
Really together.

546
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,920
I mean--

547
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:48,090
Oh, fu--

548
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,992
That's--

549
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:01,637
I'm gonna raise the baby
with him--
with my husband.

550
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:11,147
I'm gonna have the baby--
I'm gonna have a-a family.

551
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,984
With him.

552
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,357
You're gonna have
a family with him?

553
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,469
I wish it could be yours.

554
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,371
I-- I gotta--
I gotta get some air.

555
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,639
Gonna take a walk.

556
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,657
It's really cold.

557
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,630
I didn't pack for that.

558
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,471
Did you?

559
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,708
What?
This-- No?

560
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,717
I got coffee--
I got, uh, French roast,
whole milk.

561
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,512
I don't drink coffee
anymore.

562
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,649
My stomach.

563
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,400
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

564
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,644
I don't think I can stay.

565
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,784
I don't want to stay.

566
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,223
I shouldn't have
married him.

567
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,294
This room is small.

568
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:55,831
I want make it work
for my daughter.

569
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,867
The color.
My parents had a--

570
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,337
Makes it
look smaller.
a horrible divorce.

571
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,742
I'm not gonna
do that to her.
I can't do that to her.

572
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,395
What's her name?

573
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,305
Emma.

574
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:45,014
That's nice.

575
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,318
That's nice.

576
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,572
<i>Hey. Hey. It's me.</i>

577
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,941
<i>Um--</i>

578
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,810
<i>Look, I know we--</i>
<i>we have--</i>

579
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,880
<i>I know we haven't talked,</i>
<i>but I just want you to know</i>
<i>I'm really--</i>

580
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,082
<i>I'm thinking about you,</i>
<i>and I-- I'm-- I'm--</i>

581
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:31,387
<i>I know you didn't,</i>
<i>you know--</i>

582
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,923
I know this isn't what
we were planning, and I just
want to talk to you.

583
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:38,894
<i>I think I'm--</i>
<i>I think I'm really ready</i>
<i>to just--</i>

584
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,931
<i>just, you know,</i>
<i>be friends with you, or--</i>

585
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:46,869
or just I want you in my life
in some shape or form,
so I--

586
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,904
I want to talk to you more
about everything.

587
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:53,108
So just give me a call
if-if-- when you can.

588
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,445
<i>Okay. Don't--</i>
<i>Don't forget to erase</i>
<i>this message.</i>

589
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,748
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

590
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,572
Surprise.

591
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,576
What are you doing here?

592
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:30,779
I was at the reading.
You were?

593
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,182
Mm-hmm.
I didn't see you there.

594
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:35,684
Yeah, I know.
I was hiding.
I was at the back.

595
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,634
Can I come in?

596
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,938
Oh, yeah.
Please, come in,
come in, come in.

597
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,643
We moved.
I'm in Portland, Maine now.

598
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,012
Can't believe it.
She wanted to get out
of the city,

599
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,048
and I was
bitching and moaning,
but now I'm happy.

600
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,750
We got a great garden,
and, uh--
Yeah.

601
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,920
Stop calling me.
You got my messages?

602
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:14,790
Yeah. Stop calling me.
Stop calling <i>me.</i>

603
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,592
Stop calling <i>me.</i>

604
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,928
Stop calling me.

605
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:48,524
I know. I miss you too.
That's-- It's just--

606
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:50,559
Two more cities
and I'm home, okay?

607
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,729
So don't freak out
before I get there.

608
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:55,864
Okay. Go to sleep.
I gotta-- I gotta rest.

609
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,133
I gotta wake up and do it
all again in the morning.

610
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,769
I love you.
I love you so much.

611
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,939
Okay. Good night.

612
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,253
When Emma came out--
When we were in the hospital,

613
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,391
I saw all these roses.

614
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:05,994
On her head.
All over.
Like-- Like hair--

615
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,698
But-But roses.
I was like,
"Oh, my God. Look.

616
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,934
She's so amazing.
She has roses
on her head."

617
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,672
It was blood.

618
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,774
I was severely medicated.

619
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,216
I'm an English teacher.

620
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,725
Really?
Yeah. I took a--

621
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,896
I took a job at a college.

622
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,068
I--

623
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,305
I actually like it.
I actually--

624
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,743
I'm actually pretty good at it.

625
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:56,478
I bet you are.

626
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,381
And I leave there,
and I feel--

627
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,851
at peace.

628
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:18,233
Is Emma's dad--
Is-Is-- Is he good--
good--

629
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,502
good dad?

630
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,012
She doesn't want kids.

631
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:49,558
I'm sorry.

632
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,128
I'm sorry. The--
The plane was fucking delayed.

633
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,096
I'm sorry.
Mmm.

634
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:57,299
Hi.
Mmm. Hi.

635
01:03:57,301 --> 01:04:00,135
Mmm. Oh.
You need to brush your teeth.

636
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:02,037
Okay.

637
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:04,973
Did you get my text?
Mm-mmm.

638
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:07,375
You didn't get it?
I fell asleep.

639
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:11,479
I mean, we get on the plane,

640
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:15,083
and we wait
for about an hour.

641
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:23,491
Then we have to get off.
And they sat me in between
these two enormous people,

642
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:26,461
and they're eating
fucking Chinese food
the whole time, and--

643
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,497
Do I smell like Chinese food?

644
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,941
Hey.

645
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:41,343
Sex.

646
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,580
Best sex of your life,
right now, right here.

647
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,024
I'm gonna do it anyway.
Is that okay?
I'll be quick.

648
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:20,482
I'm taking as much work
as I can home now, but--

649
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:22,584
Yeah.
now she's not napping, so--

650
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,689
You know, you pay someone else
to raise your kid,
or you do it yourself,

651
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:30,091
but it's like when I'm home
I feel like I should
be at work,

652
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,193
and then when I'm at work,
I feel like I should
be at home.

653
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:34,195
I'm just tired all the time.

654
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:36,298
I bet.

655
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,135
You forgive me?

656
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:43,939
Yeah, I forgive you.
For what? Sleeping?

657
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:46,408
You were tired.
Of course I forgive you.

658
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,378
Are you writing?

659
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,153
It'll come.

660
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,457
It will come.

661
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,463
What time's your flight?

662
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,465
What time is it?

663
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:14,269
I gotta go in 10 minutes.

664
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:17,072
No. You're kidding.
Yeah. Yeah.

665
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:20,041
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

666
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:23,278
I totally ruined it.
Oh, don't apologize.
It's fine.

667
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,414
No, it's not.
You didn't come all this way
just for some $40 orange juice.

668
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:29,417
I came all this way
'cause I like to
sleep next to you.

669
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:32,287
I love those bony hips.

670
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:36,157
I'm the one
that should be apologizing...

671
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,728
'cause I entered you
last night
without your permission.

672
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:42,630
- Oh, you did?
- Did you feel me enter--

673
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:45,066
Was that what that was?
Because I felt something.

674
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,539
You felt something?

675
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,709
Like-Like-- Like what?
An earthquake?

676
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:58,013
No. No, I thought--
It was like a mosquito bite
or something.

677
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,081
Did you say mosquito?

678
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,621
Is that a dick joke?

679
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,723
Don't you have to pack
or something?

680
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:11,393
You all ready to go?
Want me to call you a cab?

681
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:14,562
How does my penis
compare to your husband's?

682
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,277
What'd you guys do
for dinner?

683
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,480
Again? No, no, no.
It's okay.

684
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,157
Wait, is that Emma crying?

685
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,394
Yeah, I hear that.
What happened?

686
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:53,301
You did not.

687
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:57,205
No, it's not funny at all.
Put her on.

688
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,313
Hi, honey.
Are you okay?

689
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,585
He's not hiding
in the closet.
I promise.

690
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,822
He's not gonna break into
your room at night.
I'm sure.

691
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:17,592
Because he's not a terrorist.
He's a linguist.

692
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,694
He's a very nice man.

693
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,797
And-- Okay.

694
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,333
All right.

695
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:27,235
Can I talk to Daddy?

696
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:32,140
Don't tell her
that Noam Chomsky
is hiding in the closet, okay?

697
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,443
Okay.

698
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,480
No, no, no. That's fine.

699
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:40,448
All right. I'll call you
tomorrow when I land.

700
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:44,786
I love you too.

701
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:45,854
Bye.

702
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,612
Yeah.

703
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,317
Hey. Hey.
You got my message
about changing rooms.

704
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,419
Yeah. Listen, listen, um--
Where's your luggage?

705
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,921
I can't stay.
I have, like, five minutes.
I can't, um--

706
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:28,856
Uh--

707
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,658
He's here.

708
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:34,562
Who's here?
My husband.
He's-- He's here.

709
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,864
He wanted to come.
It was like a last-minute thing.
He just said,

710
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:40,301
"You know, just, uh,
come with you as, like,
a romantic little--

711
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:42,237
like, 'without Emma' getaway
right after the conference,"

712
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,372
so I'm gonna have
the conference tomorrow,
and then we're, uh--

713
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:45,940
we're vacationing here
in-- in this hotel.

714
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,775
So he's here right now.

715
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,314
Okay.

716
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,733
Say something.

717
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:13,768
Let's tell him the truth.

718
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,706
I-- I-I--

719
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:21,342
I mean, this is
a great opportunity.
Let's just go down-- What room?

720
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:23,611
- I can't do that right now.
- I'm gonna do it with you.
I'm gonna help you.

721
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,713
No, I--
We're gonna
go down there together,

722
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,749
and we're gonna
tell him the truth.
I can't--

723
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:30,018
I'll do it with you.
What room are you in?
I can't. I'm telling you.

724
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:33,421
I can't do this right now.
I can't leave him right now.

725
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,361
Please.

726
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:44,399
Can we talk about this?
I want to talk
about this with you--

727
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,769
This is so stupid.
This is so stupid.
I can't do this right now.

728
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,004
I can't do this right now.
Yeah. I know.
You can't do this right now.

729
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:51,973
What are you-- Don't do this.
What are you doing?

730
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,741
Stupid.
Okay? I just-- I can't--

731
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:55,643
Get the hotels.
I want to be with you.

732
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,945
Right, I get the hotels.
I get the hotels.
I get you for a day.

733
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,481
I get you for two days.
If I'm lucky,
I get you for three days.

734
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,983
You knew this is how
it was gonna be.

735
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,786
I'm so fuckin' tired
of not having you
when I want you.

736
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:07,021
If I want to have you,
I want to have you.

737
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:08,923
I'm not--
I don't want to
share you anymore.

738
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,592
I'm not leaving him.

739
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:13,795
I thought you knew that.

740
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,732
Do me a favor
and don't send me, uh,

741
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:19,934
any more text messages
or voice mails.

742
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:23,638
Don't tell me how much
you love me and how much
you miss me and want to see me.

743
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,341
Just don't do that anymore.
That's what you want?
That's really what you want?

744
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:27,742
Yeah.

745
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,981
Go ahead. Get out.

746
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,951
This is what it is, right?

747
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,787
Go back to your husband.

748
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,627
I don't want to--
I don't want to do this
anymore, okay?

749
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:48,830
- I don't want to
do this anymore.
- This is the situation.

750
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:51,632
It's not the situation
that I fuckin' wanted, okay?

751
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:54,402
- You know what? Just get the
fuck out of my room. Leave.
- Just stop. Stop.

752
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:56,437
Get the fuck out--
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Don't touch me.

753
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:58,606
I'm the fuckin'--
Get off me.

754
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,541
Stop it.
You're hurting me.
I'll fucking kill you.

755
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:03,077
I am gonna fucking kill--
Let me go!

756
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,146
Get out of my life!
Stay the fuck out of--

757
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:07,615
Stay the fuck out of my life,
you cunt!

758
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,684
You fucking cunt!

759
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:51,112
I love you.

760
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:53,014
I love you.

761
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:19,006
Let's go through it again.
Okay.

762
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,277
Six months.
Six months.

763
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,613
Six months.
Six months,
we're together.

764
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,282
In six months,
