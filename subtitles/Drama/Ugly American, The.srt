1
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,760
You're from Baker?

2
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,440
Tell Baker I told him all I know already.

3
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Tell him I want to live in peace,
that it's no use to go on tormenting me.

4
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,400
I know nothing about that case of coins.

5
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,640
Now that gold has disappeared, but if
he'd listened we could have avoided this.

6
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,160
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

7
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,440
They couldn't uncover any more.

8
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,240
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

9
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,640
Go back and tell him that.

10
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,240
Word's around you had a visitor.

11
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,840
And Baker knows it.

12
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
Name of Jackson.

13
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,640
Well?

14
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,160
Jackson was here.

15
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,560
Or Baker's got it all wrong.

16
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,240
He's not wrong.

17
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,960
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

18
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,000
about the cash box.

19
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,680
That's not what I'm being paid for.

20
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,480
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

21
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,680
Why do you think
Jackson is assuming another name?

22
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,600
I would have found him already.

23
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,880
When I start off
to find somebody, I find 'em.

24
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,880
That's why they pay me.

25
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,280
What is Baker paying you?

26
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,480
That your family?

27
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,760
Yes.

28
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Nice family.

29
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,360
What does he pay you for murdering me?

30
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,880
500 dollars, to get the name.

31
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,760
The name.

32
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,960
Carson... Bill Carson.

33
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,480
That's what he calls himself now.

34
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,080
It's a lot of money. One thousand.

35
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,160
A thousand dollars?

36
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And some in gold. It's a tidy sum.

37
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,760
But when I'm paid...

38
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,800
I always see the job through.

39
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,880
It's you. Any information?

40
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,680
Too much.

41
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
He said quite a bit
that should interest you.

42
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,280
And one or two things that interested me.

43
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Such as?

44
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,280
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

45
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,880
That's your bit.

46
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Keep talking.

47
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,880
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box

48
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,880
which just happened to disappear.

49
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
That's my bit.

50
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Anything else?

51
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,080
Not enough for you, eh?

52
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,080
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again.

53
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,760
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

54
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,960
Here... Here you are.

55
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,400
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.

56
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,800
Worth 500 dollars.

57
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah. I almost forgot.

58
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
He gave me a thousand.

59
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,680
I think his idea
was that I kill you.

60
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,200
But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid
I always follow my job through.

61
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,960
You know that.

62
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,680
No! Angel Eyes!

63
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,680
No. No pistol, amigo.

64
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,800
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.

65
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, amigo...

66
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,080
You know you got a face beautiful enough
to be worth 2,000 dollars?

67
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,800
Yeah...

68
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
But you don't look like the one
who'll collect it.

69
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,680
A couple of steps back.

70
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,160
Thank you.

71
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,880
How much are you worth now?

72
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,880
How much?

73
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,680
2,000 dollars.

74
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,680
That's right, 2,000 dollars.

75
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,360
2,000 dollars.

76
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,160
I hope you end up in a graveyard,

77
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,160
with the cholera and the rabies
and the plague!

78
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,920
Cut me loose! Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard! Put me down!

79
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,920
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

80
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,200
Cut me loose!

81
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,040
You can still save yourself.
Let me go and I'll pardon you.

82
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Let me go.

83
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,720
I feel sick.
The blood is rushing to my...

84
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,520
I'm dry, Blondie.
Agua... Water...

85
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,520
You swine!

86
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,920
You son of a bitch! Let me go!

87
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,400
You're brave with a man who's tied up.
Come back.

88
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,120
Come back and fight.

89
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,040
You bastard.

90
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,600
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

91
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,320
- Cut it out.
- I'm an honest farmer.

92
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,520
I'm innocent of everything.

93
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,200
So you're an honest farmer?

94
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
You recognise this man?

95
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,640
Yeah, it's you.

96
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,520
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

97
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,720
Roll it up. I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

98
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,200
To hell with all you sheriffs
and all who gave birth to you.

99
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,520
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

100
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,840
Judas! You sold my hide. But you won't
enjoy that money, not a penny.

101
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,840
If there's justice in the world,
that money will go to the undertaker.

102
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,680
You know who you are?

103
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,040
Want to know whose son you are?

104
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,480
You don't. I do. Everybody does.

105
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,920
You're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

106
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,720
And your mother, she's...

107
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,080
You bastard!

108
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,640
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

109
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,520
Wanted in 14 counties of this state,
the condemned is found guilty

110
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,440
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery
of citizens, state banks and post offices,

111
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,200
the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison,

112
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,920
perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children,

113
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,400
inciting prostitution, kidnapping,

114
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,840
extortion, receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods,

115
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,720
passing counterfeit money, and,
contrary to the laws of this state,

116
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,120
the condemned is guilty
of using marked cards...

117
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,120
Therefore, according
to the powers vested in us,

118
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
we sentence the accused here before us,

119
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,800
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan-Maria Ramirez...

120
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,840
Known as "The Rat".

121
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
.. to hang by the neck until dead.

122
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,040
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

123
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,920
Five for you.

124
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
One, two, three, four... five for me.

125
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,320
Five for you and five for me.

126
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,640
Know how much you're worth now?

127
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,000
- No. How much?
- 3,000 dollars.

128
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,520
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend:

129
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,920
those with a rope around their neck
and the people who do the cutting.

130
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,720
The neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks.

131
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,320
So the next time I want more than half.

132
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,840
You may run the risks, my friend,
but I do the cutting.

133
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,920
If we cut down my percentage...

134
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,120
Cigar?

135
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,400
.. liable to interfere with my aim.

136
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,320
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

137
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,320
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive,

138
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,120
he understands nothing about Tuco.

139
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Nothing.

140
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,320
Wanted in 15 counties of this state,

141
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,920
the condemned standing before us...
sitting before us,

142
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,320
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan-Maria Ramirez,

143
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,280
has been found guilty by the circuit court
of the following crimes:

144
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,120
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace,
raping a virgin of the white race,

145
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,400
statutory rape of a minor
of the black race,

146
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,640
derailing a train...

147
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,720
Hey, Angel Eyes.

148
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,840
- What d'you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book.

149
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,920
A unit escorting a cash box of gold coins
meets a Yankee ambush

150
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,720
and only three of 'em are saved -
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

151
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
What wasn't saved was the coins.

152
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,120
But the army holds a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

153
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,920
He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.

154
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
- I know his name.
- But not who you're looking for. I do.

155
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,720
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

156
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,440
Where is Carson?

157
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,640
All I know is Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

158
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,800
He lives with a girl called Maria.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

159
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,000
- Where is she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?

160
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,840
Someplace fairly near.

161
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,520
Santa Ana.

162
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Adios, half-soldier.

163
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

164
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,120
.. and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

165
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,240
He then hired himself out
as guide to a wagon train,

166
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,400
and, after receiving payment in advance,

167
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,840
deserted the wagon train on
the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians.

168
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,600
I'm glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes.

169
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,000
- Convicted people don't always hang.
- What do you mean?

170
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,000
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

171
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,480
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

172
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,240
For all these crimes,
the accused has made a full confession.

173
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,720
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

174
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,520
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

175
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,400
Let's get the hell out of here!

176
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,400
What are you trying to say?
Anybody can miss a shot?

177
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,400
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

178
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,720
You never had a rope round your neck.
Let me tell you something.

179
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,920
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass.

180
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,800
Yeah. You're right.

181
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,520
It's getting tougher.

182
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,920
The way I figure, there's really not too
much future with a sawn-off runt like you.

183
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,200
What do you mean?

184
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,040
I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than 3,000 dollars.

185
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,920
What do you mean?

186
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,760
I mean our partnership is untied.

187
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,760
Oh, no, not you.

188
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,560
You remain tied.

189
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,520
I'll keep the money
and you can have the rope.

190
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,560
You filthy, double-crossing bastard.
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...

191
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,560
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

192
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,640
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

193
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,360
Adios.

194
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,560
You filthy bastard! Come here!

195
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,760
Come here. Cut this rope off.
Get off that horse, you filthy coward.

196
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,960
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

197
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,880
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up
by your thumbs! You pig! You vulture!

198
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,360
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

199
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,560
Such ingratitude.
After all the times I've saved your life.

200
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,000
Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.

201
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,840
You wouldn't leave me here. Come back.

202
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,560
Wait, Blondie! Listen...

203
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,840
I believe madam is home.

204
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Sweet dreams.

205
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,960
You filthy rats!

206
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,160
Maria?

207
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,960
Is that you, Bill?

208
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,880
Bill!

209
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,760
Arh!

210
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,440
Who are you?

211
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,440
What do you want with me?

212
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,760
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

213
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,360
I don't know him.

214
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,560
You were calling to him in the dark.

215
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
Where is he?

216
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,680
What are you gonna do to him?

217
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,160
I'll ask the questions.

218
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,160
Where is he?

219
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,440
Where is he? Where?

220
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,160
Where? Where?

221
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,360
Where?

222
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
That's enough.

223
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,440
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago

224
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,760
and went away with his unit. They all left.

225
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,880
Which company? Where did they go?

226
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,760
Hm?

227
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,560
3rd Cavalry. General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

228
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,680
That's all I know. I swear.

229
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
But... but...

230
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

231
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,840
Mm-hm.

232
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,480
- Revolvers!
- Yeah, revolvers.

233
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,760
Revolvers.

234
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,960
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.

235
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,040
Here, Remington, Colt,

236
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,840
a Root, Smith-Wesson,

237
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,080
Colt - navy, Joslyn,

238
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,240
another Remington, and this one...

239
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,760
That's enough.

240
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,440
Cartridges.

241
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,040
- You wanna try the pistol, step out back.
- Let's go.

242
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,840
Move, move.

243
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Cartridge.

244
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,280
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

245
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,200
No.

246
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,720
Fifty dollars.

247
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,120
- How much?
- A hundred dollars.

248
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,000
Two hundred dollars. It's all I've got.

249
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
Here.

250
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,720
Come here.

251
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,120
- Aaah..
- Ahh...

252
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,720
- Heh?
- Mm-hm.

253
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This morning I heard the whole thing.

254
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,000
Canby's closing in with his northerners
and tomorrow they'll be in the city.

255
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,720
That's why these southerners
are getting out.

256
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,120
As soon as these cowards
hear of blue-shirts around, they run.

257
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,880
- These rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

258
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,120
They'll soon be finished. Then we begin
making money on those Yankees.

259
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,400
They carry gold, not paper dollars.

260
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,320
And they're going to beat the South.

261
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Look. See that one with the white beard,
General Sibley? He looks dead.

262
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,280
He's finally getting out of our hair.

263
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,120
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

264
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,600
Where's the owner of that horse?

265
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,760
- Please, mister... A bad heart...
- Where?

266
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,600
- The war's frightened me already.
- I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

267
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,600
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

268
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,400
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

269
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,960
You stay quiet, old hen.

270
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Upstairs in room four, senor.

271
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,120
Hear that?

272
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,400
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

273
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,640
Your spurs.

274
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,960
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend:

275
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,240
those that come in by the door,
and those that come in by the window.

276
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,360
Take off that pistol belt.

277
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,960
It's empty.

278
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,640
Mine isn't.

279
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,040
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

280
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,560
That could be cannon fire.

281
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,960
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

282
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,160
You ever see this before, my friend?

283
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,360
Throw it over the roof beam.

284
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,360
That's it.

285
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Now get on that.

286
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,800
That's right.

287
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,240
Now make sure the rope is tight.

288
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,360
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

289
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,720
Now put the rope around your neck.

290
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,040
That's very good.

291
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,840
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.

292
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,040
I have another system.
A little different than yours.

293
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,920
I don't shoot the rope,
I shoot the legs off the stool.

294
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,240
Adios.

295
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,680
We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,

296
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,200
guilty of the following crimes:

297
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,680
horse-theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union army...

298
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,280
And Shorty?

299
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,960
No.

300
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,680
No?

301
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,560
.. alias Shorty Larson,
to hang by the neck until dead.

302
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,760
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

303
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,600
Sorry, Shorty.

304
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,600
Move. Come on, let's go.

305
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,080
I don't know...
As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

306
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,760
It burns, huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

307
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,880
Like that,
you won't have to carry so much.

308
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,200
Where are we going?

309
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,680
Where?

310
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,080
Where I'm going, amigo.

311
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,880
Over that way.

312
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,680
Another 100 miles
of beautiful sun-baked sand.

313
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,280
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

314
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,880
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

315
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,960
Canby's men are coming here.

316
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,880
But no-one will set foot in this hell.

317
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,600
Except you and me.

318
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,880
100 miles. That's a nice walk.

319
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,680
What was it you told me the last time?

320
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,480
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

321
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,880
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die - only slowly.

322
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,360
Very slowly, old friend.

323
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,960
After you, please.

324
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,080
Start walking.

325
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,160
Taking a rest?

326
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,800
Come on, Blondie. We don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

327
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,600
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

328
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,160
That's not too bad.

329
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,480
Come on.

330
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,520
Whoa...

331
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,500
And so, Blondie...

332
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,420
it's goodbye.

333
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,100
Whoa, whoa...

334
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,340
Easy, easy.

335
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,020
Easy. Attaboy.

336
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,940
Water...

337
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:15,700
200,000 in gold.
It's yours, just get me water.

338
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,420
What's that you say?

339
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,140
- Who the hell are you?
- Carson.

340
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,460
My name is Bill Carson now.

341
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,180
Surprise attack...

342
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,660
All dead...
My name is Jackson, not Carson...

343
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,140
Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.

344
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,540
- What's that you said about the dollars?
- 200,000, all mine.

345
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,580
It was the 3rd Cavalry's.

346
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,380
Baker has nothing.

347
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,060
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

348
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,060
Where? Here?

349
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,060
- Talk.
- In... the... cemetery.

350
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,740
Which cemetery?

351
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,340
The one on Sad Hill.

352
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,580
There's a grave...

353
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,540
Which grave? Have a name?

354
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,260
Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.

355
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,260
There's... no number.

356
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,820
There's a name.

357
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,260
It's written...

358
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,260
Water...

359
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,940
You talk first. I'll give you water later.

360
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,060
Sad Hill cemetery. OK.
In the grave. OK.

361
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:46,940
But it must have a name or a number.
There must be 1,000... 5,000...

362
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:54,100
Don't die, uh? Don't die.
I'll get you water.

363
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,860
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

364
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,780
Don't die until later, you son of a...

365
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,740
Get away from there.

366
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,260
He's dead.

367
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,740
I'll kill you.

368
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,460
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

369
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,540
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

370
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:53,180
If I were you, I'd... keep me alive.

371
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,140
What did he tell you?

372
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,540
A name.

373
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:02,780
- The name on a grave.
- What name?

374
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,580
Blondie... Don't die.

375
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,660
Blondie, don't die.

376
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,380
I'm your friend. Please don't die.

377
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,140
Whoa!

378
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,140
- Got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds.

379
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,660
Let him have yours.

380
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,380
- Where's Padre Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez is away at the moment.

381
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,740
He should be back any day now.

382
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,860
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we take very good care of my friend.

383
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,660
And may God be praised.

384
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:41,060
God is on our side too, because
he hates the Yankees. Huh, Blondie?

385
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,140
- Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.

386
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,260
You're heavy.

387
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,660
There.

388
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,180
All right. Put a fresh bandage on him.

389
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,860
Put him in my cell.

390
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,860
Easy.

391
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,380
Out, soldier. Out you go.

392
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,180
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

393
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,580
Hey, Father, I...

394
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,380
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

395
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,940
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

396
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,660
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.

397
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,780
But don't worry, he's young and strong -
that's what's kept him going.

398
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,060
He should regain his strength
in a short time.

399
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,740
Thank you. You don't know
what this boy's life means to me.

400
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,380
Thanks be to Jesus.

401
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,420
Blondie?

402
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,820
Hey, Blondie?

403
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,420
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

404
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,180
You were very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

405
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,700
Think if you'd been on your own.

406
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:22,900
Look, I mean when one is... ill,

407
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:27,980
it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

408
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:33,500
Do you... you have parents, Blondie?
A mother?

409
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,420
Not even a mother.

410
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,900
No-one?

411
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:42,300
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

412
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,100
We're all alone in the world.

413
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,100
I have you, you have me.

414
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,180
Only for a little while, I mean.

415
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:57,300
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

416
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:01,300
We could have all that money
in our hands.

417
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:11,420
I... I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would do the same thing.

418
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:16,100
It's all over for you now.

419
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,900
There's nothing anyone can do any more.

420
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,100
Oh, God, forgive me.

421
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:26,180
It's my fault, mine, mine, mine, mine!

422
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,820
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

423
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,420
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear,

424
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,500
in my place...
in your place I would do the same thing.

425
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:49,980
I would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes, I would.

426
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,300
I would tell the name on the grave.

427
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,820
What good is the money if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery.

428
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,980
But you know how many graves
there are there?

429
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:05,700
Please. Blondie, please.
Have a little...

430
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,780
Coffee?
Please, tell me the name.

431
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,300
On... on the grave.

432
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,900
If I get my hands on the 200,000 dollars,

433
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,900
I'll always honour your memory.

434
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:27,100
I swear, I'll always honour your memory.

435
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,900
Come closer.

436
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Tell me.

437
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,220
You dirty...

438
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,300
I'll sleep better...

439
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:49,700
knowing my good friend is by my side...

440
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,100
to protect me.

441
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,700
"Tuco, water. " Well, here's water.

442
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:09,220
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water! I'll give you...

443
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,780
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

444
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,500
Come on. The party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.

445
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:26,700
We'd better get the hell out of here,
before we get caught up in the war.

446
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,700
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

447
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:34,500
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

448
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,980
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

449
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,220
Hey, Pablo?

450
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,100
Don't you recognise me?

451
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,980
It's me. Tuco.

452
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,980
Let me embrace you...

453
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,980
I don't know the right thing.

454
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:26,100
I was passing by and said to myself
"I wonder if my brother remembers me?"

455
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,700
Did I do wrong?

456
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,620
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

457
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,780
You have seen me, Tuco.

458
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,500
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

459
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,900
Ah, my uniform.

460
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,980
It's a long story.

461
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,300
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

462
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:57,900
You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

463
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,100
You were always thin, eh, Pablito?

464
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,900
Wh... What about our parents?

465
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:13,980
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

466
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,580
Nine years?

467
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,300
So it's nine years.

468
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,900
Nine years.

469
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,180
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

470
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,900
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.

471
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,820
He asked for you to be there.

472
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,780
But there was only me.

473
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,620
And you?

474
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:51,700
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

475
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:56,420
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

476
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,620
Not one. Lots of them.

477
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,300
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

478
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,620
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

479
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,900
What good would that be?

480
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,620
Just keep on the way you're going.

481
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,980
Go away.

482
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,500
- The Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go.

483
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:21,300
While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me!

484
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:26,500
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother
Ramirez, will tell you something.

485
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,820
You think you're better than I am.

486
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:33,620
Where we came from,
one became a priest or a bandit.

487
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,900
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder.

488
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,180
You talk of our mother and father -

489
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,860
when you left to become a priest,
I stayed behind.

490
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,900
I must have been 10, 12,
I don't remember. But I stayed.

491
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,900
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I'll tell you something.

492
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:56,820
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

493
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,140
Tuco.

494
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,340
Please forgive me, brother.

495
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,020
Haa!

496
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,940
Ah, my belly's full.

497
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,260
Nice guy, my brother.

498
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,740
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

499
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:08,020
Everything. Like the Pope, almost.
He's in charge in Rome.

500
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:13,140
My brother, he say to me
"Stay, brother, we never see each other. "

501
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,940
"There's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too. "

502
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,020
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

503
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,020
My brother, he's crazy about me.

504
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:33,260
That's so. Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens,

505
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:38,220
I know there's a brother somewhere
who'll never refuse me a bowl of soup.

506
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,300
Sure.

507
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:46,940
Well, after a meal
there's nothing like a good cigar.

508
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,340
Whoa.

509
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,220
Wake up, you.

510
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,660
- There are troops coming.
- Blue or grey?

511
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:06,340
They're grey, like us.
Let's say hello to them, then get going.

512
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,140
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Confederacy!

513
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,460
Hurrah! Down with General Grant!

514
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,340
Hurrah for General...

515
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,020
- What's his name?
- Lee.

516
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,540
.. Lee!

517
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:23,860
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too! Hurrah!

518
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:27,540
God's not on our side,
cos he hates idiots also.

519
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:43,140
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

520
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:46,820
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three four...

521
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:50,020
Prisoners of war, forward...

522
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,740
march.

523
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:55,940
Hup, two, three, four...

524
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,460
Left face.

525
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:56,540
Form a single file. Move.

526
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:38,940
- Jonathan Broad.
- Present.

527
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,460
- Richard Mobiley.
- Present.

528
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:51,220
- Nathaniel Sullivan.
- Present.

529
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,660
- Robert Clark.
- Present.

530
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,020
- Sam Richmond.
- Present.

531
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,060
Bill Carson.

532
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:08,020
Bill Carson?

533
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,900
I said Bill Carson.

534
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:13,620
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

535
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:20,260
All right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Bill Carson!

536
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,140
Yeah. You better be Bill Carson.

537
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,740
Bill Carson!

538
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,860
Yeah, yeah... That's me.

539
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,620
Please, Carson...

540
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,660
answer "present".

541
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,660
What, are you deaf?

542
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,740
Now suppose you say "present", Carson.

543
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:58,540
I like big fat men like you -
when they fall, they make more noise.

544
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:01,620
And sometimes they never get up.

545
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,740
Wallace.

546
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:06,820
That's enough.

547
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,820
Sergeant.

548
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:16,980
The captain wants to see you right away.

549
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,940
Be sure these two get good treatment.

550
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,460
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

551
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,700
Yeah.

552
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,380
For the last time, Sergeant,
I'm telling you,

553
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:48,300
I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.

554
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,180
No more brutality.

555
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:54,780
There's hundreds of prisoners
and only a few men to guard 'em.

556
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,860
I have to have respect.

557
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:01,780
I think you'll manage to gain their respect
by treating them better.

558
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:05,500
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

559
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,340
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

560
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:14,780
While I'm in charge, the prisoners are not
to be tortured or cheated... or murdered.

561
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,180
That an accusation?

562
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:22,300
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

563
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:26,060
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

564
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,140
I know there's scum around,
bivouacked near the camp,

565
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,260
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

566
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:37,140
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

567
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,860
Yes, sir.

568
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,260
Just as long as you're the commandant.

569
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:46,740
Yes, Sergeant.

570
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:52,460
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

571
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:58,980
but I pray I have enough time to amass
evidence and bring to a court martial

572
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:04,740
all those who discredit and dishonour
the uniform of the Union.

573
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:11,460
I wish you luck.

574
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:47,580
You and the others
better lay low for a few days.

575
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,780
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

576
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:05,580
- Wallace, bring me Carson.
- Right.

577
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,380
Angel Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

578
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,580
We'll keep close enough to keep
an eye on things. Saddle your horses.

579
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,980
Get in.

580
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,780
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.

581
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:45,060
There's no formalities here.

582
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,580
It's been a long time.

583
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,580
You're hungry.

584
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:05,300
Sit down. Eat.

585
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,260
I knew it, I knew it!

586
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:32,220
The minute I saw you, I said to myself
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes. "

587
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:36,540
"I bet he got himself an easy job. "

588
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:41,740
"And he never forgets a friend. "

589
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,540
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

590
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,420
Right.

591
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,700
It's good to see old friends again.

592
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,300
Good.

593
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,620
Especially when they've come
from so far away.

594
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,100
And have so much to talk about.

595
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:02,420
And you do have a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

596
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:08,220
You were captured near Fort Craig?

597
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:18,540
If you were with Sibley, that means
you were coming from Santa Fe.

598
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:34,700
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Mm-hm. Very hard.

599
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,900
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

600
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:45,540
Why are you going under
the name of Bill Carson now?

601
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,700
One name is as good as another.

602
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,620
Not wise to use your own name.

603
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:57,900
Like you.
I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.

604
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:00,820
Sergeant Angel Eyes!

605
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:11,420
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

606
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:17,340
Music? Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.

607
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,700
So...

608
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:34,700
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

609
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:41,740
That fake, too?

610
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:45,820
Bill Carson's name's written on it.

611
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:50,540
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

612
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,700
Aarh!

613
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,220
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

614
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:21,220
What did he tell you about the money?

615
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,820
I don't...

616
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,540
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

617
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,900
More feeling.

618
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:07,100
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

619
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:10,140
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

620
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:13,500
So many of us
have had a session in there.

621
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:36,620
How's your digestion now?

622
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:44,300
- You'd better talk.
- I have nothing to tell you.

623
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:12,220
Play that fiddle, you.

624
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,140
I'll talk... I'll talk...

625
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,900
What did he say about the money?

626
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:11,340
It's bu...

627
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:14,740
It's buried in a grave.

628
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,500
Where?

629
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:17,900
Sad Hill...

630
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,420
Sad Hill cemetery.

631
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,900
Which grave?

632
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,740
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

633
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,140
Blondie...

634
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:36,820
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name of the grave.

635
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:55,820
The war's over for you.

636
01:30:57,740 --> 01:31:00,740
Put those clothes on.

637
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,420
Why?

638
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,420
We're going for a ride.

639
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:12,300
- Where?
- To find 200,000 dollars.

640
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:15,420
I know the name of the cemetery now.

641
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,940
And you know the name of the grave.

642
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:40,260
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?

643
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,380
Would you talk?

644
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:47,860
No. Probably not.

645
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,060
That's what I thought.

646
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:54,340
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco,

647
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,660
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

648
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:04,340
And Tuco? Is he...

649
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:09,340
No. Not yet.

650
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,860
But he's in very good hands.

651
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:15,940
You've changed partners,
but you've still got the same deal.

652
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,460
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

653
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:23,460
There's two of us.
Should make it easier than just one.

654
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:30,180
Yeah.

655
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,060
Hold it.

656
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:52,740
That's it. Don't move.

657
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:58,180
Now, don't breathe. Still... that's it.

658
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:01,460
Got it. Thank you.

659
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:19,060
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

660
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,580
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

661
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:27,540
3,000 dollars, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.

662
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:31,260
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

663
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:37,860
I told you once, friend.

664
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:42,580
If I ever get you down, you're gonna
need a lot of help to get up again.

665
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,860
You're a lot luckier than that one.

666
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,340
You get some grub, a rope,
and you're finished.

667
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:10,180
And there isn't any partner this time
to shoot you down.

668
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:01,560
Sure would like to
put your paw on it, huh?

669
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:06,160
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been on this train nearly ten hours.

670
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,960
You smell like a pig already.

671
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,760
Let's try not to make things any worse.

672
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,960
Get going.

673
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,360
I can't while you're watching me.

674
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,760
Aaaarh!

675
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,440
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?

676
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,760
You don't want to break our friendship?
Well, I'll break it.

677
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,400
Squad, halt.

678
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:01,200
Take your places.

679
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,800
Ready.

680
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,320
Aim.

681
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,400
Fire.

682
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,600
Clem, take care of the horses.

683
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:43,080
I've been looking for you for eight months.

684
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:47,520
Whenever I should have had a gun
in my right hand, I thought of you.

685
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:51,400
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

686
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:57,120
And I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

687
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:14,880
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

688
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,640
Every gun makes its own tune.

689
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,800
It's perfect timing, large one.

690
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,520
Clem, follow him.

691
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,080
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

692
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:42,720
Just give me time to get dressed
and I'll open up.

693
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:05,560
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

694
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:15,320
Hey...

695
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:19,840
Hey, Blondie, how the hell
did you get out of that pigsty?

696
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,560
My own way.
I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.

697
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:29,320
You talked, you traitor. You talked.

698
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:34,440
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.

699
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:38,240
You... me...

700
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:41,040
So only you know your half of the secret?

701
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:43,240
Mm-hm.

702
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,840
Ah, Blondie...

703
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:52,120
I'm very happy you're working with me,
and we're together again.

704
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:55,640
- I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.
- Oh, listen...

705
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:59,560
I forgot to mention.

706
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:04,240
He's not alone.
There's five of them.

707
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:07,560
- Five?
- Yeah. Five of them.

708
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,320
So that's why you came to Tuco.

709
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,960
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

710
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:32,120
They shot him at close range.

711
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:54,640
- Well, look who's here.
- The other one will be along.

712
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,040
They'll come looking for us.

713
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,240
Watch out.

714
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:05,240
There's two of them.

715
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:07,440
I want that blond alive.

716
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,440
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.

717
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,040
Were you going to die alone?

718
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,040
Ho!

719
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:08,120
Hey, Blondie. Angel Eyes is mine.

720
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,720
All right.

721
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:52,040
"See you soon, i... idi.. "

722
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,520
"Idiots. "

723
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,840
It's for you.

724
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:22,920
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

725
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:26,520
Like a cemetery, for instance?

726
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:29,440
There should be a bridge
across that river.

727
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:34,920
- We better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.

728
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,640
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

729
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:41,560
Tuco has taken you this far,
I will take you all the way to...

730
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:49,320
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

731
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,640
Come along, now. Follow me.

732
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,840
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

733
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,960
Where do you hail from?

734
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,400
lllinois.

735
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:00,480
And you?

736
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,400
I'm with him.

737
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:11,280
Any reason for being around here?

738
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,280
We want to enlist, General.

739
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,880
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

740
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,960
I'm a captain.

741
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:24,960
Get the hell out.

742
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,960
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

743
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,960
Yes, sir.

744
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,800
So you want to enlist?

745
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:41,280
You've got to take a test to prove it.

746
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,280
Well, show me.

747
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:11,480
Hey...

748
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:17,360
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel.

749
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:20,160
- Really?
- Sure.

750
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,280
Like it says in the manual,

751
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:27,480
you've got every qualification to become
an expert in the use of weapons.

752
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:32,480
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war.

753
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:37,680
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

754
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,680
Volunteers.

755
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:46,400
You want to enlist, hm? Let's go.

756
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,480
Come on, gentlemen, come on.

757
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,200
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're in time.

758
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:59,780
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

759
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:02,060
We have two attacks a day.

760
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:04,700
- Two attacks a day?
- Sure.

761
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:09,780
The rebs have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

762
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:12,780
Stupid, useless bridge.

763
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:16,060
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

764
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:22,260
Headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck.

765
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:25,380
Even if all of us are killed.

766
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:30,860
Otherwise the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

767
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:35,460
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.

768
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:40,580
Intact is how the South wants it,
and we want it intact, too.

769
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:46,500
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys:

770
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:50,780
Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

771
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:55,900
Is it bad
to speak the way I do to volunteers?

772
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:59,100
I've done a lot worse.

773
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:06,380
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

774
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:09,580
In here, I've destroyed it all.

775
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:15,500
It's a court-martial offence to dream
of blowing it up. A serious crime.

776
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:20,980
Even to think of
destroying that bridge is just...

777
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:24,580
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

778
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:29,380
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

779
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:35,660
I've been dreaming about it.

780
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:41,380
I've even worked out a plan.

781
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,380
I sure have.

782
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:47,380
The best time is after the attack,

783
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:51,180
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

784
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:56,060
If I could do it,
I could save many thousands of men.

785
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:03,900
But what I lack is the guts.

786
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:11,980
They're beginning
the daily slaughter right on time.

787
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:15,260
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

788
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,980
Be right there.

789
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:32,060
Let's go.

790
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:33,980
All right, friends.

791
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:37,180
Come along and enjoy the spectacle.

792
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:08,580
Companies, report.

793
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:11,380
Company B ready.

794
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:14,180
Company E ready.

795
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:17,180
Company D ready.

796
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:25,500
Companies, forward!

797
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:49,380
Hey, Blondie. Looks like the captain
is asking for a bullet in his guts.

798
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:51,500
Yeah.

799
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:45,780
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

800
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:08,820
I have a feeling it's really
going to be a good, long battle.

801
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:14,100
Blondie...

802
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:16,740
The money's on the other side of the river.

803
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:19,620
Oh? Where?

804
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:25,620
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

805
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:30,020
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

806
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:35,020
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

807
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:40,900
Yeah. Then these idiots
would go somewhere else to fight.

808
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:42,900
Maybe.

809
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:22,420
Get a doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded!

810
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:26,420
Hurry, a stretcher.

811
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:30,220
Easy. Easy now.

812
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:35,300
Arh!

813
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:42,340
Get things ready.

814
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:04,100
A little of this will help.

815
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:11,820
Take a slug of this, Captain.

816
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:13,820
And keep your ears open.

817
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:04,100
What are you doing?
No... Leave me alone...

818
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:42,420
Blondie, hey.
You realise we might be risking our lives?

819
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:48,500
Yeah. And if I get killed, you'll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money.

820
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:50,340
Yeah, Tuco.

821
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:53,420
Sure would be a pity.

822
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:23,220
Doc...

823
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:30,020
Doctor... Can you help me
live a little longer?

824
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,900
I expect good news.

825
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:43,140
Eh... Eh...

826
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:47,420
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

827
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:49,940
Why don't we?

828
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:52,900
You go first.

829
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:59,220
No, I think it's better that...

830
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:01,620
you start.

831
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:07,220
All right.

832
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:12,420
The name of the cemetery is...

833
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:29,820
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

834
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:40,420
The name on the grave is...

835
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:45,700
Arch Stanton.

836
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:49,140
Ar... Arch Stanton?

837
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:51,300
Are you sure?

838
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:53,540
Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

839
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:54,580
Haa! Haa!

840
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:13,300
It'll be a lot easier with that.

841
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:52,900
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

842
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:55,500
Dig.

843
02:19:57,420 --> 02:19:59,020
You're not digging.

844
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:15,180
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

845
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:17,300
Why?

846
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:22,620
I'll tell you why.

847
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:25,100
Cos there's nothing in there.

848
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:35,980
- Why, you son of a...
- You thought I'd trust you?

849
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:42,700
200,000 dollars is a lot of money.

850
02:20:42,780 --> 02:20:45,820
We're gonna have to earn it.

851
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:50,500
How?

852
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:02,780
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

853
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:08,380
The gun?

854
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:03,340
You pig! You wanted to get me killed!
When did you unload it?

855
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:07,420
Last night.

856
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:12,020
You see, in this world,
there's two kinds of people, my friend:

857
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:16,540
those with loaded guns
and those who dig.

858
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:18,540
You dig.

859
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:20,660
Where?

860
02:27:30,020 --> 02:27:32,340
Here.

861
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:35,020
Unk... Un...

862
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:37,860
There's no name on it.

863
02:27:37,940 --> 02:27:40,540
And there's no name here, either.

864
02:27:41,860 --> 02:27:44,660
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

865
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:49,340
It was the grave marked "unknown",
right beside Arch Stanton.

866
02:27:55,860 --> 02:27:58,260
Go ahead.

867
02:28:52,740 --> 02:28:56,340
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!

868
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:16,540
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

869
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:19,860
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

870
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:23,140
I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

871
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:31,420
Well, now... Seems just like old times.

872
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:38,420
Four for you.

873
02:30:39,620 --> 02:30:42,660
And four...

874
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:46,140
Four for me.

875
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:12,420
Hey, Blon...

876
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:13,860
Blon...

877
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:24,860
Hey, Blondie...

878
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:28,660
Sorry, Tuco.

879
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:32,860
Blondie...

880
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:43,860
Blondie!

881
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:53,420
Blondie!

882
02:32:02,860 --> 02:32:03,860
Blondie...

883
02:32:14,060 --> 02:32:15,900
Blondie...

884
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:33,100
Blondie!

885
02:32:53,380 --> 02:32:56,060
You son of a bitch...

886
02:32:58,380 --> 02:33:00,700
Blondie...

887
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:22,980
Aaaarhh!

888
02:33:57,460 --> 02:34:00,460
Hey, Blondie!

889
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:04,460
You know what you are?

890
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:09,380
Just a dirty son of a...

891
02:35:14,381 --> 02:36:03,381
