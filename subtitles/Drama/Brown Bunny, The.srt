1
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,042
It all started 27 years ago.

2
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,810
That's an orphanage.

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,546
That's me in the basket.
I guess somebody didn't want me.

4
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,111
I hear they did want
the basket back, though.

5
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,157
But it was fine in the orphanage.

6
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,352
That's me in the third row.

7
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,156
I wasn't very popular.

8
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,823
Of course, everybody wanted to be adopted.

9
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,991
Luckily, lots of families came.

10
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,865
And everybody got to go live with a family.

11
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,836
Oh, except me.

12
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,305
But I tried not to give up hope.

13
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,342
Then, one day,

14
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,607
something magical happened,
just like out of a fairy tale.

15
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,712
Do you remember the one
where the wolf huffed and puffed

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,443
and blew the piggies' house down?

17
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,509
And he was wearing a glass slipper,
I think, and he had a pumpkin?

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,452
Plus there was that other thing?

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,854
Well, the same thing happened to me,

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,290
only vastly different.

21
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,793
I changed.

22
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,353
And the next thing you know,
people seemed to like me for once.

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,832
And then pictures were taken,
and suddenly I found the family

24
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,493
I always wanted.

25
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,469
Oh, I forgot to tell you, my name is Shelley.

26
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,735
Now I live in the Playboy Mansion.

27
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:40,973
<i>And this is where I want to live
happily ever after.</i>

28
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,663
- Throw the ball to me, Kim.
- Oh, nice catch. Awesome throw.

29
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,361
- Hey, Lauren.
- Hi, Shelley!

30
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,995
Hi, Hef! Hi, girls!

31
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,268
Hi, Shelley. Looking good.

32
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,443
- Marvin!
- Oh, hey, Shelley.

33
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,878
Thank you.

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,577
You guys have to try one of these.
Marvin makes the best margaritas.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,315
That's 'cause they're mangoritas.
I invented them myself.

36
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,721
I added my own little Marvin twist to them.

37
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:29,090
Well, you're the best twister I know.

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,186
No, Shelley, you're the best twister.

39
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,390
- Shelley.
- Hi!

40
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,696
Why are you keeping the rich,
good-looking, famous guys all to yourself?

41
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,930
- You should introduce me.
- Oh, of course.

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,030
Guys, this is Cassandra.
She's only been here for a few months,

43
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,541
but everybody loves her,
because she's super-beautiful

44
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,977
and she never throws up on anybody
when she's drunk.

45
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,316
So, Shelley, are you a centerfold?

46
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,580
She wishes.

47
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,215
Yeah, I do. So keep all your fingers crossed.

48
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,556
Hopefully Hef'll give me the good news
this weekend at my birthday party.

49
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,688
I've got my "turn ons" all ready
and everything.

50
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:10,394
Being a centerfold is the highest,
most prestigious honor there is.

51
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,471
It says,
"I'm naked in the middle of a magazine.

52
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,238
"Unfold me."

53
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,073
I gotta tell you,
it seems you've got a pretty good life here.

54
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,170
Oh, it's paradise.

55
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,409
We are just one big family. I am so happy.

56
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,848
Why would I wanna live anywhere else?

57
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,836
I love this one. Don't you guys?

58
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,703
We'll put this on the Mansion tab
and have it all sent over this afternoon.

59
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,936
Aren't we just the luckiest girls
in the whole world?

60
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,773
Yes, you are.

61
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,980
Your birthday party on Friday's
gonna be so much fun!

62
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,037
Shelley!

63
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,347
Oh, my God.
I bet you're gonna get Miss November.

64
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,218
Good morning, Shelley.

65
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,416
Rise and shine, sweetheart.

66
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,795
Good morning, Marvin.

67
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,163
Good morning, Pooter.
You're looking dapper.

68
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,226
Your blueberry French toast is ready.

69
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,635
Ooh-Ia-Ia.

70
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,934
That's French, right?

71
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,770
Yeah, but more important than the food,

72
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,174
I actually added something
to your orange juice.

73
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,578
Oh, Marvin,
thank you so much for telling me.

74
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,877
Usually I don't find out until much later.

75
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,442
Oh, no. To add zest to the drink,
first I put in some vanilla extract,

76
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,547
then, of course, some egg yolks,
and then, I have a secret ingredient.

77
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,184
All right, you twisted my arm,
it's chili powder.

78
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:27,255
Yeah. It just explodes your taste buds,
so the drink just envelops your mouth.

79
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,960
Oh, I love having my mouth enveloped.

80
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,002
What's that?

81
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,140
Is this from Hef? ls this my birthday gift?

82
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,177
Oh, Pooter, is it finally happening?
Am I Miss November?

83
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,735
That's what I wished for
when I blew out my candle.

84
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,338
Oh, my gosh, I just told you my wish.
Now it won't come true.

85
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,214
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to tell, it just came out.

86
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,345
My teeth couldn't stop it.

87
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,618
I take it all back, I take it all back.

88
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,418
Okay, I'm ready.

89
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,356
"Dear Shelley..." Oh, my gosh, that's me.

90
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,162
Wait, there's more.

91
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,894
"Please move out
of the Mansion immediately."

92
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,042
Move out?

93
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,850
"You have two hours to collect
your belongings and leave the premises.

94
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,712
"All my love, Hef."

95
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,723
Hef's kicking me out?

96
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,721
Why would he do that?

97
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,460
This is my home. This is my family.

98
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:40,869
I hate to say this, Shelley,
but maybe it's because of your age.

99
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,100
But I'm 27.

100
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,303
Yeah, but that's 59 in Bunny years.

101
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,775
But I just turned 27 last night.

102
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,512
It's almost like I'm still 26.

103
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,746
Or 58.

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,753
I've gotta talk to Hef,
maybe he'll let me stay.

105
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,619
Hen

106
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,288
Hen

107
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,920
Hen

108
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,655
Hen

109
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,424
Where is he?

110
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,939
He left for Vegas, Shelley.
I don't think he's that good with goodbyes.

111
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,836
Why is this all happening?

112
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,544
Where's my pink Prius?

113
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:28,150
The Prius actually belongs to the company.
This is the car you came here with.

114
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,483
But...

115
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,052
Come on, Pooter.

116
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,530
We have to go find a new place to live.

117
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,066
Come on, now.

118
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,159
Come here, Pooter.

119
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,296
Here, let me help, Shelley. Hey, Pooter.
Shelley's calling you now.

120
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,204
Come on, Pooter.
Go with Shelley, buddy. Pooter!

121
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,107
That hurts! Go with Shelley, Pooter!

122
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,943
Damn it!

123
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,619
Why don't I just keep him here
for a little while, until he calms down?

124
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,215
Okay.

125
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,022
Well, don't worry, Pooter.

126
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,962
I'm gonna find us a really
nice place to live,

127
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,192
and then maybe you'll wanna
come live with me.

128
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,666
I'm sure he will.

129
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,294
Well, you take care, Shelley.

130
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,974
Bye.

131
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,151
I know it's an embarrassment
to live in a beat-up car,

132
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,924
but don't lose faith, Pooter.

133
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,521
I'm gonna get a great job soon,

134
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,228
and find us a super place to live,
with a new family.

135
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,293
I pinkie promise, Pooter.

136
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,845
Good evening, ma'am.

137
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,085
You violated Code 753.
That's unlawful spitting.

138
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,685
I was just brushing my teeth.

139
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,157
You currently residing in this car, ma'am?

140
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,491
I'm gonna have to issue another ticket.

141
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,225
Would you maybe stop giving me tickets
if I told you I was having a really bad week

142
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,933
because I used to be a Playboy Bunny,
but I got kicked out of the Mansion

143
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,267
because I'm 59 years old?

144
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:32,172
I'm gonna have to ask you to step out
of the car and take a Breathalyzer.

145
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,336
Okay.

146
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,872
Noises.

147
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,680
I'm gonna need you to blow on this.

148
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,913
Really?

149
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,515
I guess.

150
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,060
You tried to do what?

151
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,394
To a cop?

152
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,603
Stupid!

153
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,764
I was just doing what he said.

154
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,603
He was in a uniform and everything.

155
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,507
Don't worry, sweetie.
First-timers only get one night.

156
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,876
You'll be back on the street selling
in no time.

157
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,473
But I'm not a prostitute.
I was just brushing my teeth.

158
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,252
I like your tights.

159
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,421
And, you know,
you should really go for a more natural look.

160
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,466
All that heavy makeup
just hides your beauty.

161
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,299
I'm a dude.

162
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,698
Oh, well, you're good like that.

163
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,006
So, did you hear
about the pool party at Jordan's?

164
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,711
It was unbelievable.

165
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,117
- Oh, last Saturday?
- Yes.

166
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:26,350
- Oh, my God. He makes the best margaritas.
- Yep. It's because he uses mangos.

167
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,653
- No. Really?
- He read about them somewhere.

168
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,785
Yeah, mangoritas.

169
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,726
- Jordan's just so hot.
- I know.

170
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,854
So are all his friends.

171
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,456
Yeah, seriously,
I've tried to hook up with all of them.

172
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,161
- No, you have not.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

173
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,828
Two of them, I succeeded.

174
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,895
- Really?
- It was amazing.

175
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,407
Who knew?

176
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,535
I was so excited.

177
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,976
Looks like a mini-Playboy Mansion.

178
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,029
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,929
Hi.

180
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,499
Can I help you?

181
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,578
Yes. I would like to live here, please.

182
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,548
Oh, I know, right?
But you have to be asked to live here.

183
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,950
- Do you go to this school?
- This is a school?

184
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,685
Where are the desks?

185
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:36,255
No. This is a sorority house at a school.

186
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,388
And you do look like an older,

187
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,365
sluttier version of the type of girl
we would want.

188
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:46,268
But, I'm sorry, you're not a student.
It was so nice talking to you.

189
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,863
- But I really think it's...
- So nice.

190
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:56,106
And our piano is from Tuscany.
Very high-end.

191
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,116
I believe that every detail of the house

192
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,914
should be a reflection
of the girls who live here.

193
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,251
Hi. Do you ladies go to school here, too?

194
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,949
Not anymore.

195
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,651
We're the housemothers
of the sororities on campus.

196
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,196
That's so dope.

197
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,822
Do you live in the houses with the girls?

198
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,195
Yes.

199
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,235
That's even dopier.

200
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,665
So, what do housemothers do?

201
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,297
We oversee the meal plans,

202
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,832
chaperone the social events,
make sure the girls stay out of trouble.

203
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,505
Oh, my gosh. That's exactly
what I used to do back at the Mansion.

204
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,980
Can I be one, too?

205
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,144
I'm sorry. This is a sorority, not a brothel.

206
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,052
A brothel?
Oh, I'm not looking to make soup.

207
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,988
I'm looking to be like you.

208
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,083
I wanna be a housemother.

209
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,358
We have standards.

210
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:48,832
Standards that you clearly do not meet.
But it was nice to meet you.

211
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,357
But I just want to...

212
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,561
- So nice.
- So nice.

213
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:05,040
Try Zeta. Their last housemother was
hospitalized with hallucinations.

214
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,412
Awesome.

215
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,417
Awesome.

216
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,429
Hello?

217
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:36,474
Dean Simmons. Please, please.
We are trying so hard. I promise you.

218
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,209
This seems really unfair.
And I'm not gonna attack you.

219
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,084
I don't want you to feel attacked by
all of us, so I'm just gonna say "me."

220
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,816
To me, this feels really unfair.

221
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,347
Natalie. Look, I feel the same way you do.

222
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,552
But the fact remains,

223
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,256
you guys have not met your requirements
for three years running now.

224
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,391
And I'm under a lot of pressure
from other sororities

225
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,662
complaining that we're bending
the rules for you.

226
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,103
By "other sororities,"
do you happen to mean Phi Iota Mu?

227
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,335
I really don't think
it matters who complained.

228
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,277
Natalie, rules are rules.

229
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,674
Drama queen.

230
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,379
Oh, I'm sorry I scared you.

231
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,855
Do you think you could help me
out of here, though?

232
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,448
What? Yeah.

233
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,416
Thanks.

234
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,690
I'm so sorry, I think I broke your Z.

235
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,563
Oh. No, it's okay. It falls off,
like, every time we open the door.

236
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,296
Well, at least you still have T and A.

237
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,931
T and an A. Who are you?

238
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,868
My name is Shelley,
and I'm here to be your housemother.

239
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,950
Well, it's nice to meet you, Shelley.

240
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,953
But, unfortunately, he...

241
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,787
It's a little too late.

242
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,521
We're about to lose our charter,
so if we don't have a house,

243
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,756
we won't really be needing a housemother.

244
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,691
Well, why are they gonna
take your house away?

245
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:10,000
Because we get no pledges,
and everyone kind of thinks we're losers.

246
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:14,502
That's so sad.
Why does everyone else get all the pledges?

247
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,309
Well, they have great parties, and

248
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,545
boys actually like them.

249
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,787
I'm an expert at parties and boys.
I'm a Bunny.

250
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,324
Men write to me from prison,
sometimes in their own blood.

251
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,291
I mean, I assume it's theirs, who knows?
I don't.

252
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,492
I'm sorry, I'm nervous right now,

253
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,292
because I really wanna help you guys,
because I know I can do it.

254
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,457
Wow, a Bunny?

255
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,698
Like a centerfold?

256
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:42,831
Oh, bless your heart, no.
Just a couple of small pictorials,

257
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,173
"Girls of the Midwest," "Girls with GEDs,"
"Girls of Charlie Sheen."

258
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,310
But now I'm a homeless person.

259
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,213
God, I'm so sorry.

260
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,045
Good luck.

261
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,747
Wait, but I can really help you guys.

262
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,692
So if we don't get pledges,
we lose our charter?

263
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,853
- We need 30.
- Thirty pledges? There's seven of us, dude.

264
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,329
Technically, 7 1/2 now.

265
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,524
Hey!

266
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,933
Oh, nothing a little fertilizer can't help.

267
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,637
Not you, Tanya.
I was talking about Harmony.

268
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,802
Actually, 7 3/4 as of Tuesday last week.

269
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,638
Guys, we're never gonna get
that many pledges.

270
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,876
This is just their way of shutting us down.

271
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,418
This is awful.

272
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,511
Hey, Joanne, just FYI,

273
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,750
you've got refrigerator magnets
stuck to your brace again.

274
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,190
Actually, we need that.
That's our grocery list.

275
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,353
I knew that. I knew that.

276
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,726
- No, you didn't.
- Did so.

277
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,994
- Why do we need knee-highs?
- Oh, my God.

278
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,331
Oh, my God. There's boys on our lawn.

279
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,333
Are they lost?

280
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,501
Nice.

281
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,577
The Leaning Panther. I like that. Yoga's hot.

282
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,711
So, are you a Zeta?

283
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,252
Oh, I wish.

284
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:08,149
Yeah, I do, too, because
Zeta would be my new favorite hizzety-hang.

285
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,122
Well, she is not a Zeta,

286
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,830
because she's our new
hizzety-housemother.

287
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,133
She'll be hizzy-tizzies...

288
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,397
She'll be here all the time.

289
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,967
You're hiring me?

290
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,464
Oh, give me some of that.

291
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,207
Oh, God bless her.

292
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,574
- Why are they acting like that?
- Yes.

293
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,247
Oh, that's boys just being boys.

294
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,512
Thank goodness.

295
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:48,398
Oh, my gosh! I am just so happy
that you guys want me here.

296
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,456
You are not gonna be sorry.

297
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,935
So this is how we're gonna get pledges?

298
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:57,202
Hiring an archaically superficial reflection
of the male fantasy?

299
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,504
Well, guys like her.

300
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:04,547
And since guys don't like us,
I figured she could help.

301
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:09,643
So, in order to be in a sisterhood,
now we have to be popular?

302
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,351
No, no. In order to keep our house,
though, we do have to be popular. Yes.

303
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,621
So, I figured Shelley here could
teach us how.

304
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,721
Okay, look, don't get me wrong. I love guys.

305
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,664
But I lived in a house filled with girls
for nine years,

306
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,638
and I know that there's nothing better
than just being with your sisters,

307
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:33,074
sharing, talking all night,
painting each other's bodies,

308
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:37,336
baking penis cookies,
playing with monkeys...

309
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,948
- Where'd you live?
- The Playboy Mansion.

310
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,784
No, that doesn't make her a hooker. Sorry.

311
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,225
She's shy. She's just...

312
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:02,270
She's so shy. That's Lilly, also, by the way.

313
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,500
Lilly.

314
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,977
And this here is Harmony.

315
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,341
Harmony.

316
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,444
And Carrie Mae.

317
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,986
Carrie Mae.

318
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,817
And then Joanne, over there.

319
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,221
Joanne.

320
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,984
Wow, you hired the Exorcist. That's great.

321
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,654
What is that?

322
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,199
Is that like a Yoda thing, or what?

323
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,826
It's fun, but, what...

324
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:36,362
Oh, no, no. It's just this thing I do
to remember people's names.

325
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,463
Natalie.

326
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,569
So, thank you guys so much
for letting me be your housemother.

327
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,244
No, it's no problem.

328
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,813
Because you just...

329
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,383
This is just gonna be great.

330
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,586
But I have to go take a shower,

331
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,887
because I haven't had one since I slept
in my car and spent the night in jail.

332
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,119
Sweet.

333
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,761
- Hi, girls.
- Oh, my God!

334
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,061
Shelley! Hi. Where's your robe?

335
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,795
Oh, I just like to air dry.

336
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,030
Oh, she just likes to air dry.

337
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,038
My God, you're so vapid.

338
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,903
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

339
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,876
You're like the hundredth person
who's told me that.

340
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:18,177
Shell? Just a quick little side note,

341
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,714
I don't think that some
of the girls in this house

342
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,649
have even seen their own bodies naked,

343
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:26,087
so they probably don't really want
to see your perfectly engineered boobs.

344
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:30,855
Well, I'm just walking around
in the body God and Dr. Borkman gave me.

345
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,991
Hey, Shelley, why don't you throw
some clothes on?

346
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,400
We've got a lot of work to do.

347
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,265
This year, we are gonna get
lots and lots of pledges.

348
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,603
Okay.

349
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,076
Oh, we also need to raise money
for our philanthropy.

350
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,044
What's a phila-canopee?

351
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,809
Oh, no. It's a philanthropy.

352
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,610
It's like a charity.

353
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,314
Oh, I love charity.

354
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,378
One time, at the Mansion,

355
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:03,018
I even let Bob Saget grind on me
during a slow dance.

356
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,654
And here's a list of ideas
I came up with for fundraisers

357
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,997
that might make us a little more popular.

358
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,266
So, please take a read.

359
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,568
"Start a beekeeping club."

360
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,871
We could have the masks, even.

361
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,278
"Paleolithic bake sale."

362
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,817
Hi! Dinosaurs!
Like, everyone saw Jurassic Park.

363
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,250
"B.Y.O.M."

364
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,550
Bring your own man?

365
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,148
No. Bring your own mouse!

366
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,254
Which is better.

367
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,819
Because they're cute and they're little
and you can hold them.

368
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:44,561
And also, another thing that
I thought of was, you could dress them up.

369
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,536
It's the whole fun part of it,
is you can put them in little outfits.

370
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,039
You can make, like,
an Abraham Lincoln mouse.

371
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,302
And you could do like Joan of...

372
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,641
Why do everyone's eyes glaze over
when I talk about this?

373
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,339
Whoa. No.

374
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:00,941
No, they weren't glazing.
They were just taking a break.

375
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:04,746
Natalie, these are super, super-great ideas.

376
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,290
Thank you. I worked really hard.

377
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,759
But we might wanna try
something a little more

378
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,320
sexy.

379
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,459
Car wash. Come get your car washed.

380
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,163
Here we are at the Zeta House Car Wash.

381
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,207
I have a car, and I'm great at washing it.

382
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,803
I am so offended right now.

383
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,402
Come on, guys, let's give her a chance.

384
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,847
- Car wash.
- Car wash!

385
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,010
You said you needed to raise money.

386
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:40,353
Well, washing cars is a fun and sexy way
to make all the money that we need.

387
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,822
So, car wash!

388
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,094
Car wash.

389
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,191
We're having a car wash.

390
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,528
Car wash.

391
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,832
No, I can't bend that way.

392
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,803
Hey, watch this, guys.

393
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,839
Hi, guys.

394
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,107
Dude, that's wild.

395
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,445
Oh, my God. Shelley, that's Colby.
I'm in love with him.

396
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,282
Oh, that's so sweet.
How long have you guys been going out?

397
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:14,889
No. We are not going out.
I've never even talked to him.

398
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,557
And he's coming this way. What do I do?

399
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,890
Do sexy.

400
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:24,064
Wash these cars, you sexy bitches!

401
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,865
They are filthy. And so are you!

402
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,661
Did she just call us bitches?

403
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,537
Did she just call us sexy?

404
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,907
Wash! Wash! Wash!

405
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:37,072
Wash! Wash! Wash! Wash!

406
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,376
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

407
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,347
Okay, that's the first time
we've ever spoken, so... First time.

408
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,515
Hi!

409
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:51,094
We're just washing cars and being sexy.

410
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,151
Mostly sexy.

411
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,221
So, does anybody want a wet T-shirt?

412
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,728
- Yeah.
- Or, you know, maybe some wet pants.

413
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,636
Someone went accident in her sexy pants.

414
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:11,306
So, anyway, we're having some drinks
over at Theta later.

415
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,281
- Theta.
- Totally.

416
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,409
You wanna come over?

417
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,646
Yes.

418
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,419
Well, we are a little thirsty.

419
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,823
Maybe you guys are, too.

420
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,987
Why don't you have a drink right now?

421
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,156
I'll take a little sip.

422
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,427
I am so sorry.

423
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:39,134
Thought I'd help you wash the testosterone
off your face, Colby.

424
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,734
Well, cool.

425
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,679
So, what time can we drop by for drinks?

426
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,051
Now that you mention it,

427
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,447
the guest list is looking pretty full.

428
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,955
So, maybe next time, all right?

429
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,581
Hey, Super-brace!

430
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,456
Oil can. Oil can.

431
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,895
Not cool, man. Let's go.
Come on, come on, let's go.

432
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,834
Well, I think we're done here, sexy bitches.

433
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,961
Thanks a lot, Mona.

434
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,665
The one chance I get to talk to Colby,
and you completely ruin it.

435
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,439
Yeah, because the whole
peeing-in-your-pants thing

436
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,136
was really working out well for you.

437
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,643
Thank you.

438
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,307
My car's still dirty,
so I'll be out here if you need me.

439
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,411
Do you want a car wash?

440
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,485
Me?

441
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,151
Oh, no. No. I have a bike.

442
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,421
Besides, I gotta get back to work.

443
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,861
Oh, yeah. I know all about work.

444
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,798
I'm at work right now, actually.

445
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,028
Oh, do you wash cars?

446
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,764
No. I'm the Zeta Sorority Housemother.

447
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,068
You seem a little young
to be a housemother.

448
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,370
Really?

449
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,439
You think I'm young?

450
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,606
Oh, thank you.

451
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,206
Thank you.

452
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,981
I'm sorry to invade your space,
but I needed that.

453
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,917
So, what's your job?

454
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,016
Oh... Job.

455
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,887
I manage a nursing home.

456
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,960
It's so great you give
nurses a place to live.

457
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,898
Actually, it's a nursing home
for senior citizens.

458
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,139
An old folks'... Old people. Old people.

459
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,574
I know lots of old men.

460
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,638
Hairy and not hairy.
But I don't mean to brag.

461
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,114
So, they live there?

462
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,176
Like an orphanage for old people?

463
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:35,089
Well, yeah. I mean, that's one way
you could look at it. Yeah.

464
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,589
Their parents are gone,
and they live in a big building

465
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,891
all by themselves,
wondering where everybody went,

466
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,092
and I think I'm gonna cry.

467
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:49,463
Listen, if you want, you know,
you could stop by the nursing home,

468
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,475
because we always need
volunteers to help out

469
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,602
and visit with the old people,

470
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,236
if you're interested.

471
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,214
Yeah. I'd love to.

472
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,188
My name is Shelley.
And I like long walks and hate rude people.

473
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,116
Oh, that's good to know. I'm Oliver.

474
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,491
- Oliver.
- Yes.

475
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,930
I like taking long walks with rude people.
Only on short piers, though.

476
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,230
That's funny.

477
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,205
- You're funny.
- Thank you.

478
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,708
- Bye.
- Bye.

479
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,539
Guys.

480
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,674
Okay, this isn't my fault. Don't like...

481
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,685
I know it was a disaster, but she's...

482
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:39,018
You guys, I just had the best idea
for our phila-tropy.

483
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,420
Philanthropy.

484
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,619
We are gonna volunteer
at Oliver's nursing home.

485
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,355
Who is Oliver?

486
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,489
He's this guy I just met. He's really sweet.

487
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,930
And he's kind of cute, too.

488
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,500
Well...

489
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:57,370
I don't know if you guys can recognize this,
but Shelley is meeting guys.

490
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,229
And if she knows how to meet guys,
then we will learn how to meet guys.

491
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:04,270
Then more girls'll wanna hang out with us.
Hence, more pledges.

492
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,440
Yeah. Hence!

493
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,246
Okay, here's what we need to do.

494
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,754
We need to get all dressed up,
and then we need to go to a club

495
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,348
and drink fruity drinks
and dirty-dance with each other.

496
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:19,123
- Why?
- To bond, y'old grumpy.

497
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,122
Yeah, y'old grumpy. To bond.

498
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,396
The music's playing.
Our bodies are swaying.

499
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:26,868
You know what I'm saying?

500
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,805
You know? We could like play
some form of dodge ball, maybe.

501
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,379
We could tie our shoes together,
our tennis shoes,

502
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,075
and we could throw them
over telephone wires.

503
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,248
Because I see that everywhere,

504
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,843
and it seems like people would
have fun doing that.

505
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,945
Like, "How hard can you throw?"

506
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,253
You know what I mean? Like how...
What are you...

507
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,622
Or we could go to a club.

508
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,178
Six Virgin Marys and one Kamikaze.

509
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,979
Here's to Zetas,
to making you guys the best sorority ever.

510
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:20,656
Oh, Mona, that guy is totally
checking you out.

511
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,625
- Go flirt with him.
- Right.

512
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,356
Think of it as research, Mona. Research.

513
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,420
Get over there. Get on that horse!

514
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,626
Go, go. Go!

515
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,303
You like what you see, stud?

516
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,137
I'm not really sure
what I'm looking at, metalface.

517
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,700
Let me guess, is it a Hannibal Lecter thing?

518
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,212
Yeah, it is.

519
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,080
There's a big box of cutesicles.

520
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,851
Carrie Mae, go work your magic.

521
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,090
The only magic I've ever done
was try to figure out a way

522
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:00,256
to stay in college for nine years
and not go back to my trailer park in Idaho.

523
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,231
So, figure out a way into his heart.

524
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:07,134
Just go over there
and talk to him about any old thing.

525
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,876
Excuse me, you know where the crapper is?

526
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,538
I have to drop off some timber.

527
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,849
Go away.

528
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,050
What'd I do?

529
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,554
It's okay. It's just, Carrie Mae, sometimes

530
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,456
men like their women
with a little bit of mystery.

531
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,495
So, get back over there and try it again.

532
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,834
Excuse me.

533
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,037
You know where the crapper is?

534
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,130
I have to do a very mysterious thing
in there.

535
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,643
Drop off some timber.

536
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,877
I'm definitely not drunk enough for that.

537
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,985
Well, this is good, though.

538
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,250
This is really good practice.

539
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,325
Hey, it's the Zetas.

540
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,654
- Hi.
- Hi.

541
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,388
I feel like we never see you guys out.

542
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,953
We never see them out, either.

543
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,761
I met you yesterday.
I was that homeless girl.

544
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,301
Now I'm their house mom.

545
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,031
Congratulations. That's awesome.

546
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,869
So, hey, you guys got here just in time.

547
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:22,173
We're doing a little karaoke contest.
Sororities versus fraternities.

548
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,737
Yeah, you guys can go next if you want.

549
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,305
Yeah! Come on!

550
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:30,148
Oh, girls! Always say "yes" to karaoke.

551
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,652
Yeah, we'll pick a great song for you.

552
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,884
Don't worry,
you can't be any worse than we were.

553
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,119
- Seriously, we were wretched.
- Awful.

554
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,093
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay. Okay, listen.

555
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,098
Just give me a second.
I promise the Zetas are going up on stage.

556
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,724
Awesome. Great.

557
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,063
You guys, karaoke is so fun!

558
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,539
You gotta get up there and do karaoke.
Boys like singing. It's sexy.

559
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:55,339
Go! Go! Get up there! Go! Go!

560
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,072
I think we can do it.

561
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,417
We can do anything better
than those mannequins, you guys.

562
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,452
I might puke, but let's do it!

563
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,282
That's the spirit!

564
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:09,020
All right! Get up there, you Bravehearts!

565
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,590
All right, that was Kappa Eta Sigma!

566
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,034
Next up, the Zetas?

567
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,740
Singing Like A Virgin.

568
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,543
I made it through the wilderness

569
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,453
Somehow I made it through

570
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:48,558
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

571
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,998
I was beat, incomplete

572
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:58,599
I'm a hag and I'm fat and rude

573
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,439
But you made me feel

574
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,247
Yeah, you made me feel

575
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:09,945
Like a big bag of poop

576
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,355
Like a loser

577
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,285
We're rejected all the time

578
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,193
Like a loser

579
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:26,201
Who's so retarded, it's a crime

580
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,066
Like a...

581
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,913
That was not nice.

582
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,113
Awesome.

583
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,175
You wanna get cut, bitch?

584
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,189
Oh, classy. Very classy.

585
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:51,352
No, no, no, no, she's right, Courtney.
I mean, we should apologize.

586
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,336
Especially since we're
about to take their house.

587
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,956
- Oh, right.
- Where are you taking it?

588
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,695
Well, we heard that you were
losing your charter,

589
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:03,035
so Phi Iota Mu is gonna buy your crappy
house when it goes on sale after rush.

590
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,509
Yes, we are going to have so many pledges,
we'll need all of the extra space.

591
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,976
Oh, but don't worry.

592
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:12,174
I mean, we'll still let you guys stay on
and be the maids.

593
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,980
You can sweep the chimney.
Won't that be nice?

594
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,918
Does the little one understand human talk?

595
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,855
Oh, and I guess
that when we buy your house,

596
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,823
you'll go back to being homeless.

597
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,087
I'm a housemother.

598
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,653
A Zeta housemother, and I don't like
some of the things you were saying.

599
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,166
Because they do understand human talk,
and you hurt their feelings.

600
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,224
Oh, Shelley, come on.
It's not worth it, let's go.

601
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,770
Yeah, you should go.

602
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,169
It was so nice to see you.

603
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,267
But I really think that...

604
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,467
- So nice.
- So nice.

605
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,702
That was so humiliating, you guys.

606
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,973
I know it was awful.

607
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,641
And I am so mad
that they did that to you guys,

608
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,118
but we can't listen to those girls.

609
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:53,088
Why? They're right. We are losers.

610
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,146
Oh, we're not losers.

611
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:58,125
You just ignore that dumb old wall.

612
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,323
Well, you're not a loser, Shelley.
People like you. You're pretty.

613
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,392
I just don't understand
that kind of behavior.

614
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,503
Trust me.

615
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,009
You guys, I can make you way hotter
than any old Phi Iota Mu.

616
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:18,245
By the time I'm done,
every girl on campus'll want to pledge Zeta.

617
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:21,216
No, really, we are just a bunch of misfits.

618
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:26,678
Lilly just texted me from the closet.
She says we're not misfits.

619
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,349
Well, I hope she was being ironic.

620
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,260
Go, go, go, go, go!

621
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,488
- Are we doing this?
- Do it!

622
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,188
- All right.
- Here.

623
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,129
You can do this.

624
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:40,192
If I thought you all were quitting...
My heart would just fall out of my head.

625
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,602
Shelley, your heart is not in your head.

626
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,267
Your heart has its own cavity.
Right under your fake boobs.

627
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,969
Do you understand how moronic you sound

628
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,036
when you say
your heart is gonna fall out of your head?

629
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,604
Well, Mona,

630
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:57,244
I totally understand
why that saying sounds mixed-up,

631
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,584
but I don't mean it for real.

632
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,023
I don't think that my heart is in my skull.

633
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:08,087
What I mean is that sometimes
logic tells you to do something,

634
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,623
but you have to have part
of your heart in it as well.

635
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:17,199
My head and my heart tell me
that we can save Zeta.

636
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:23,244
We need 30 pledges,
and I know just how to do it.

637
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,605
By making you guys
the hottest girls on campus.

638
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,823
I'll get it.

639
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,157
- Does that say "Zeta"?
- Yeah.

640
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,500
This is war.

641
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,162
Enough is enough.

642
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:51,435
Let's do this. There's no way
those bitches are getting our house.

643
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,680
Okay, ladies,
dressing sexy is all about skimplifying.

644
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,057
I want you to show skin
in the four major regions.

645
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,290
Arms, legs, belly and cleavage.

646
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,730
Is this how you skimplify?

647
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,497
Oh, okay. Well, maybe we could let
someone who doesn't have a giant baby

648
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,299
in their belly give it a try.

649
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,934
Okay, this is your most important
secret weapon, the water bra.

650
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,069
Just stay away from sharp corners.

651
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,079
This is going too far.

652
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,412
No. No way. No.

653
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,513
Just consider it like another thesis topic,
you know?

654
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:41,022
"Conventional Archetypes of Beauty
and Their Effect on the Opposite Sex."

655
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,192
Are you sure that's everything?

656
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:53,964
Because feeling good on the inside
is all about looking good on the outside.

657
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,538
Go ahead and keep that one.

658
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,705
There are three rules to
successful flirtation.

659
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,182
Eye contact, flattery and lots of touching.

660
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,482
For example,
let's pretend that Natalie here is a man.

661
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,422
I'm touching his arm,
I'm looking deep into his eyes

662
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,017
and I'm wearing deodorant. Carrie Mae?

663
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,356
I know.

664
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,920
And I might say something like this.

665
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:26,059
"Oh, my gosh.
Your biceps are huge. Kiss me."

666
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,299
And then he would kiss me.
So, any questions?

667
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,739
What do I do with my chew?

668
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,197
How long would the kiss usually be?

669
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,475
And, also, why would he kiss you,
because you...

670
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,777
Okay, ladies, today's lesson is makeup.

671
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,550
First, we must highlight your eyes.

672
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,491
The eyes are the nipples of the face.

673
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,174
Whoa.

674
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,943
Wow.

675
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:52,054
So this is what it feels like
to not be invisible.

676
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,751
We weren't exactly invisible before,
just the anti-hot.

677
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,489
Check out Joanne.

678
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,394
I really like what you've done
with the Bedazzler.

679
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,364
- Thank you.
- It's nice.

680
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,524
So what's next, Shelley?

681
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,967
I want all the fraternities to see
how hot you guys are.

682
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,837
Kind of like a coming-out party.
So we are gonna take some pictures.

683
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,239
Oh, we are not posing for Playboy.

684
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:17,006
No, in a calendar. "The Girls of Zeta."

685
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,775
Everyone will see the new you,

686
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,545
and selling the calendars will help us
raise money for our phil-an-coppopopy.

687
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,746
Hey, you guys, Lilly just texted me.

688
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,517
She says we look hot and this is fun.

689
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,892
Keep doing that, keep doing that.
Make love to the camera.

690
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,159
I saw that in Austin Powers.

691
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:45,071
Yeah, work it. Think really sexy witch.

692
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,667
- Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
- A good witch.

693
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,770
I think you're a bad witch.

694
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:55,375
I bet the house that falls on you is gonna
be a sexy house.

695
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,386
Work it. Work it.

696
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:02,220
You're like a supermodel,
except more pregnant. Keep going.

697
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:25,473
Okay, Henry, very glad you finally learned
how to use the suggestion box.

698
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,914
And I want to let you know
that I got your message,

699
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,077
you want less Boggle and more bingo.

700
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,246
So I'm gonna work on it, okay?

701
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,257
Whoa.
Okay, what's going on with your heart?

702
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,722
Shelley, you're here.

703
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,493
- Move out of the way, man.
- Move it, Junior.

704
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,963
- Sideways.
- Sorry, sorry.

705
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,797
- Hi.
- Hi.

706
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,162
We brought a donation
as part of our philtrophy.

707
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,572
Oh, great. Thank you.

708
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,708
We're making calendars,

709
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,870
and before we could even get them all out,

710
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,574
the printing-press guys bought up
the first batch.

711
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,674
Wow. Great, thank you very much.

712
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,277
This is, "Pay to the Order of Old People."

713
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,557
Yes, and it doesn't stop there.

714
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:13,460
I hope you don't mind, but I brought a few
extra volunteers to help out today.

715
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:17,857
Henry, Henry, look away. Look away, okay?

716
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:22,598
Look at the wall.
Think of broccoli and bad bingo cards.

717
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,833
You know, actually, your timing is perfect,

718
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:28,605
because I was about to try
and organize a dance class.

719
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,202
Nobody signed up.

720
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:33,306
And I was at the top of the list
not signing up.

721
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,944
There ain't no way I'm dancing.
You can forget that.

722
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,318
Oh, I love to dance.

723
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,651
Well, let's do it.

724
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,895
Okay, ladies, fan out and find a partner.

725
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,961
And maybe we should talk
about this music.

726
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:57,596
Wow, this music is super, super-great,

727
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:02,008
but we might want to try
something a little sexier.

728
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,022
Great job, ladies.

729
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:36,207
Shelley, I just want to thank you so much
for doing this.

730
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:37,371
It's just so kind.

731
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:41,975
Oh, well, kindness is just love
with its work boots on.

732
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,477
Hey, Oliver, ask the girl to dance.

733
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,857
- I'd love to.
- Really?

734
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,156
Looking good, Jean.

735
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:59,192
So, listen, Shelley, I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to have dinner sometime.

736
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,669
Really? Yes. Yeah.

737
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,366
Great.

738
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,441
- Bitchsuck!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

739
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,239
Oh, it's all good.

740
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,878
I'm so glad to be back.

741
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,909
Marvin, tell Shelley we're back
and we're gonna be watching a movie.

742
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,613
How about something spooky? No, funny.

743
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:21,884
No. How about Scarface?

744
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,224
No, you guys,
I think it should be Shelley's pick tonight.

745
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:28,958
Mr. Hefner, Shelley's actually gone.
She told me to give you this letter.

746
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:41,408
Shelley moved to Africa
to work with the orphans.

747
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,671
She left while we were gone

748
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,771
because she says
she can't deal with goodbyes.

749
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,446
I'm going to bed. No movies tonight.

750
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,153
You look nervous.

751
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,625
I don't like when you look nervous.
You will not blow this!

752
00:46:58,683 --> 00:46:59,889
But I just wanna mix drinks.

753
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,229
You know, my whole life,
that's all I've ever wanted to do,

754
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,960
is just blend.

755
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,797
And then you come along
with your weird kryptonite death grip, and...

756
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,269
- That's right, it's like this.
- Oh, good God!

757
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,897
Oh, sweet bastard, that's good.

758
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,306
That's right, and I'm the only woman
that can make you feel like that.

759
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:17,903
You will not tell Hef
that we wrote that letter to Shelley.

760
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,208
- Just do it again.
- Got it?

761
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,149
- Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it. So I got it.
- Good.

762
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,086
Hi. I'll take two calendars.

763
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,792
Wow. That's so generous.
Everyone's been buying two.

764
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,665
Actually, it's in case one gets ruined.

765
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,865
Hot dogs, Zeta hot dogs. Who wants one?

766
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:46,431
You. You. You got one.

767
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,846
Sweet setup here.

768
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,908
We should totally have a mixer
with you guys sometime.

769
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,180
Yeah.

770
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,486
We could have one with Battle...

771
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,050
What? One more time.

772
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,654
We could have a Battlestar Galactica night.
With pudding!

773
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,757
Definitely! What?

774
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,699
Battlestar Galactica. Okay.

775
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:17,865
She said that you guys should get together
some night, with pudding.

776
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:19,701
Whoa.

777
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,538
You betcha. You betcha.

778
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,810
At Phi Iota Mu we are very exclusive,
because we can be.

779
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:30,080
Many of our sisters are leaders on campus.

780
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:35,386
We have a rocking GPA
and our very own Korean manicurist.

781
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,658
Hey, where are you guys going?

782
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,702
- Whose booth is that?
- That's Zeta's booth.

783
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,101
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they have a booth?

784
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:51,265
And who would go to it?

785
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,399
- Do you want some ketchup?
- That'd be great.

786
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:55,809
I can totally hose you some right there.
Go ahead, lean back.

787
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,676
No, I'm just...

788
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:03,782
- Excuse me.
- Why, did you fart?

789
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,814
- Did I do what?
- Fart.

790
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,424
Where are the Zetas?

791
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,825
We are the Zetas, 2008 edition.

792
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,658
And I'm in love!

793
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,071
Why'd you do that?

794
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,238
I needed to hurt someone.

795
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,781
This is so awesome, you guys.
That was so much fun!

796
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:39,446
It was, it was.

797
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,514
Harmony, Brian Stone was all over you, girl.

798
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,687
- And how about Mona?
- What?

799
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,627
I got numbers from four boys.
It was all for research.

800
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,755
Liar.

801
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,095
- Careful what you research.
- But I really had fun.

802
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:56,264
Well, Natalie, Colby was
following you around like a puppy dog.

803
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,869
Do you guys think you'll, you know...

804
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,302
No.

805
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,314
I do not think, you know, that.

806
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,978
"That"?

807
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,521
Natalie, are you a virgin?

808
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,089
No.

809
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:19,087
Am I a virgin? No.

810
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,089
You're a virgin!

811
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:24,394
Shelley! It's like an amphitheater in here!

812
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,025
That's it.

813
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,331
Oh, my gosh.
We have to have an Aztec party.

814
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,803
We always wanted
to have one at the Mansion,

815
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,967
but we could never find
a virgin to sacrifice.

816
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,011
Natalie, it is gonna be the best time ever.

817
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:40,879
We are gonna have the most rockingest
party, and then we'll get our 30 pledges.

818
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,187
Okay, quick trick, watch this.

819
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:00,360
We are gonna put little trails of Vaseline
on the contours of our abs,

820
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:04,270
mist it a little,
and that way the light will catch our tans.

821
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,537
Oh, she says
you're completely ingenious, Shelley.

822
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,341
Thank you, Lilly.

823
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,904
That's the same as vapid, right?

824
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,280
Oh, it's better than vapid.

825
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:18,513
- Is that Juicy?
- Yeah, I love their stuff.

826
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,955
It's a shame nobody'd be able to see it,
you know, under my brace.

827
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,219
Well, when can you take the brace off?

828
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,921
2004, actually.

829
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,096
Well, it's a good thing I asked.

830
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:35,570
No, I'm so fine.
I mean, you know, it's all indented into me

831
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:38,672
and, you know, if I took it off, I wouldn't
even know what would possibly happen,

832
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:41,302
and my spine could be like a noodle. And...

833
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,811
I'm really good. I'm good. Thanks.

834
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,315
Come with me.

835
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:50,713
Joanne, when I was little,
I wore a Scooby-Doo mask to school

836
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,186
for a whole month
because I thought I was ugly.

837
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,521
- Thanks, guys.
- You're welcome.

838
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,786
And then one day
a boy, Howard Rubenstock,

839
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,350
snuck up behind me and tore it off my face.

840
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,420
- Do you know what I realized?
- That you were pretty?

841
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:05,160
No, that I was wearing it upside down.

842
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,076
I'm not really sure
what you're trying to tell me, Shelley.

843
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,540
I'm not either. But the point is,
you're a butterfly now, not an earthworm.

844
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,633
You don't need to hide anymore.

845
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,235
So, okay, here he comes.

846
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,180
He runs past here every day,
and I've seen you staring at him.

847
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,248
I can tell that you like him
and that you want to talk to him.

848
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,878
Today's the day. Go invite him to our party.

849
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,387
Go. Go.

850
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,257
Run, Joanne, run!

851
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,782
Hi, Steve.

852
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,917
Oh, hey, Joanne. How are you?
I didn't know you ran.

853
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:07,155
Sure, I mean, I do now.

854
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,594
Where's your brace?

855
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,529
- It's gone.
- Really?

856
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,264
Well.

857
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,501
You're pretty pleased with yourself,
aren't you?

858
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:24,171
Oh, you scared me.
My heart's pounding like a nail.

859
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:28,215
I guess I am a little proud.

860
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:30,650
Well, don't get too used to that feeling.

861
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,814
Because there's no way that I'm going
to let a whorey little tart like you

862
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,585
stand in the way of the Phi Iota Mu.

863
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,284
Don't mess with me.

864
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,625
Don't mess with Phi Iota Mu.

865
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:51,404
Man! Someone needs a mani-pedi
massage combo, pronto.

866
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:52,566
- Shelley!
- Oh. my...

867
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,007
Steve said he's gonna come
to the Aztec party.

868
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,601
Steve, he's gonna come.

869
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,307
Yay! This is gonna be so much fun!

870
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,890
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- God! Oh, my God!

871
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,164
- Yes!
- Hey, you guys! Look.

872
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,137
Oh, Joanne.

873
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,943
I can bend! You guys, I did it, I can bend!

874
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:34,311
"Do you find yourself
more attracted to me when I'm like this,

875
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,044
"or like this?"

876
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,018
- The second one.
- Great.

877
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,819
So, "Because you like my boobs,

878
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:45,122
"would you stand there
and let me go like this

879
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:49,190
"for five minutes,
just in the hope that we might hook up?"

880
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,597
Yes. Yes, I would.

881
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:58,031
Guys! Anybody want some chips?

882
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,500
Yeah, have chips while you party.

883
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:03,477
Badass party. Badass.

884
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:07,983
So, Miss December,
you got your bikini on under there? Huh?

885
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,848
No, actually, just my fake water...

886
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:12,546
Natalie, there you are.

887
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:16,580
Oh, Bobby and Zach from Kappa are just
dying to meet you.

888
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,117
I'm sorry, Colby,
but Natalie is a very hot commodity.

889
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,190
- Excuse us.
- Wait.

890
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,095
Wait a second.

891
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,930
- Are we leaving?
- Yes.

892
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,094
Why?

893
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,638
I have, like,
the world's hugest crush on him.

894
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:31,695
So I don't really...

895
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,538
I know. Then we need to let him see
how in demand you are.

896
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:37,477
Always remember,
boys want what other boys want.

897
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:38,842
Right.

898
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,908
Are you Lilly?

899
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:46,752
That's a cute costume, Lil.

900
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,189
I was gonna ask you this,
because I've been seeing these all over.

901
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,056
I mean, this is an Aztec party,

902
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,294
you know, so those statues don't really fit,
because those are from Easter Island,

903
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,265
which is like 2000 miles away,
as you probably know, in Polynesia.

904
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:01,599
Wait, Natalie. You're too smart.
Boys don't like girls that are too smart.

905
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:02,864
Right.

906
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,237
Right.
God, I hope Colby didn't hear me say that.

907
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,770
Shelley, you really know all the tricks.

908
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,437
How do you do it, you know?

909
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,107
I mean, with Colby here
and with Oliver asking you out,

910
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,584
it's like we might both
lose our virginity this year.

911
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,117
Yeah.

912
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,486
It's supposed to be a mixer.
There's no one here to mix.

913
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,223
They're over there, aren't they? The Kappas.

914
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:34,929
Well, they're definitely not here.

915
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,700
I know that, dipswitch. I can see that.

916
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:44,102
And now, let the sacrificial rites begin!

917
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:52,250
It's time for this virgin
to get sacrificed in the boiling Jell-O lava!

918
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,785
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

919
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,951
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

920
00:56:58,015 --> 00:57:02,964
This is Aztec Night, the first of many
awesome Zeta parties to come.

921
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,000
And for those of you girls
going through rush,

922
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:08,195
remember to make Zeta
your number-one choice!

923
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,765
The time is now.

924
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,738
Yeah.

925
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,371
I've never seen anybody
get sacrificed before.

926
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,011
That was so hot.

927
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:58,246
I mean, I don't know anything about Aztecs,
you know? Or their culture.

928
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,380
But, I mean, I do know that I had fun.

929
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:05,655
Yeah. I don't know anything
about them either, so that's awesome.

930
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,727
What have the Zetas become?

931
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,601
Oh, my God.

932
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,901
Popular.

933
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,588
Remember, be sexy.

934
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,426
- He's gonna love your shoes.
- Deep breath, take a deep breath.

935
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,434
Okay, okay, he's here. Okay.

936
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,531
- Hello.
- Hello.

937
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:54,405
Wow, you look great.

938
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,011
- Thank you.
- You ready?

939
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,687
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

940
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:09,280
- Would you mind if we walked?
- Oh, yes, I like to walk.

941
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,618
And that's not the only thing I like.

942
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:17,028
No? You have a wide range of interests?

943
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:21,264
Oh, yes. A big range.

944
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:25,971
Oh, wait here for a second.

945
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,067
I think I dropped some money
over here the other day.

946
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,738
I just don't know wherever could it be.

947
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:34,646
Maybe it's over here by this manhole.

948
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:39,621
That's fucking hot!

949
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,791
I just went over there to look for my money

950
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,693
which I had dropped the other day.

951
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:52,495
I think it was a dollar coin,
because I heard a clanging.

952
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,897
But anyway, wow.

953
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,864
Who knew steam can be hot?

954
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,832
Yeah, that's...

955
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,400
I wonder what they did
when Marilyn Monroe did it.

956
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:08,473
They probably added soothing botanicals
to the steam rising from the manhole.

957
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,211
I like that word.

958
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,752
"Manhole."

959
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,879
All right. What can I get you guys?

960
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:22,162
Instead of the mahi-mahi,
may I just get the one mahi,

961
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,495
because I'm not that hungry?

962
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:26,565
I'll ask.

963
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:32,200
The chicken piccata for me.
Yeah, that'd be fine.

964
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:33,900
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

965
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,002
"Piccata." That's another word I like.

966
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,173
Piccata.

967
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:43,514
- Yeah, it just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
- Sounds like "Hotta."

968
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:44,711
Yeah.

969
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:47,453
Or "the Spanish Armada."

970
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:51,117
- I like to rhyme.
- Yeah?

971
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:56,829
...and StairMaster to tone the buttock area.

972
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,864
I'd show you,
but who really wants to see my butt?

973
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:07,369
I mean, it's just a silly old butt
with no tan lines.

974
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,477
Yep.

975
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:15,108
Wow, this was really good food.
I hope it doesn't go straight to my butt.

976
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:20,451
I mean, I think my butt would still
be a pretty good one, though.

977
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,346
Yep. My ass.

978
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:26,186
Oh, well, this has been fun,

979
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:30,720
but we should probably wrap it up,
because I've got another date at 11.

980
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,424
Are you serious?

981
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:35,663
Well, what's a girl in demand going to do?

982
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,768
Wow. Okay.

983
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,673
Yeah, well, dinner's on me.

984
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:47,181
I'm gonna get going. I wouldn't want you
to keep the other guy waiting.

985
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,012
Wait!

986
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,553
Your biceps are huge! Kiss me.

987
01:01:58,515 --> 01:01:59,516
Oh, my God.

988
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,525
Yeah, right.

989
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,398
Shelley's back.

990
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,028
- How'd it go?
- How'd it go, Shelley?

991
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,602
Not good.

992
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,505
- What?
- Why?

993
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,544
I don't think he likes me.

994
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,240
He didn't fall for any of my tricks.

995
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,573
That's impossible, your tricks always work.

996
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:27,145
I did sexy, I did "other guys want me."

997
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,157
You know, I worked every angle in the book.

998
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,853
But I don't know, he just stared.

999
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:36,220
What if Oliver is one of those guys

1000
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:39,460
who wants to have, like, a conversation
with a girl before he hooks up with her?

1001
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,830
He's gay?

1002
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,265
No, he's not gay.

1003
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,974
Oh, I don't know.

1004
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,843
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe he wants to talk first.

1005
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,907
What if Oliver doesn't mind a smart girl?

1006
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,644
- I know.
- Wait.

1007
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,554
So I have to learn things
about things and stuff?

1008
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,018
About topics?

1009
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,228
- Can I even do that?
- Yeah. You can do that.

1010
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,495
You can do anything
you set your mind to, Shelley.

1011
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:34,310
But you can't even tell I have boobs.

1012
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,783
Well, don't you think I should show him
a little something?

1013
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,218
Give him a little philanthropy?

1014
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:42,279
Shelley, good job.
You used "philanthropy." That was fun.

1015
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,258
You know what? You're still too sexy.

1016
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:47,295
Nat, what if she wears your glasses?

1017
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,694
Good idea. Okay, here.

1018
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,722
Try these.

1019
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:57,395
Oh, my God. Natalie, you should really
go to an eye doctor.

1020
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,270
That's actually how I got those glasses.

1021
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,105
So have you called Oliver yet?

1022
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:05,408
Yes. He didn't seem too excited
to be going out on a second date,

1023
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,540
but he said yes, so here goes.

1024
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:12,052
All right. Now remember,
just be yourself, only different.

1025
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,487
- Don't use the word "elucidate."
- Pretty much entirely different.

1026
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,355
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Tone down the sexuality.

1027
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,225
Talk about politics and religion.
That's always a really good first-date topic.

1028
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,695
- Don't stare at him too much.
- Don't brush your teeth.

1029
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,094
- Bye, Shell.
- Bye.

1030
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:26,623
- Don't forget to call, Shelley.
- Say you're nauseous.

1031
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:31,869
A nuclear nonproliferation treaty
should ease tension in Asia.

1032
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,374
Well, that's my thought.

1033
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,877
- Are you okay? With your...
- Oh, yes.

1034
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,073
These glasses don't make me dizzy
or anything.

1035
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,715
Elucidate on that.

1036
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:48,186
Well, you seem to know a lot
about North Korea and the Middle East.

1037
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,121
It sounds like you really read the paper.

1038
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:54,458
Oh, all the time.
I am just nuts about the paper.

1039
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:58,556
So, have you given any thought
to who you might be voting for?

1040
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,396
I'm not sure yet.

1041
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:05,203
I definitely won't listen to what Simon says.

1042
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,070
He is just so mean.

1043
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,270
I usually always agree
with Paula and Randy.

1044
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:16,207
Oh, you meant
the President of the United States.

1045
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,784
The United States of America.

1046
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,651
U.S.A. for short.

1047
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:27,127
Fifty states, if you include Hawaii.
Most people do. I'm definitely pro-Hawaii.

1048
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,890
- Excuse me.
- Oh, thank God.

1049
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:30,659
Can I get you anything else?

1050
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,722
No, I think we're good, thanks.

1051
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:36,498
Hey, I know where I know you from.

1052
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,699
You were in Playboy.
"Girls with GEDs," right?

1053
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,332
Oh, heck, no!

1054
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,369
No!

1055
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:47,415
Those girls are all boobs and no brains.

1056
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:52,112
I'm too busy in a library,
reading books with dust on them.

1057
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,279
How...

1058
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,550
Sorry. My mistake, then. Sorry.

1059
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:56,818
No.

1060
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,787
Playboy. God. Can you believe it?

1061
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:04,856
I'm still hungry, even though we just ate.

1062
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:07,902
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I did that.

1063
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,834
- Sorry, let me take care of that.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1064
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,705
Are those index cards?

1065
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,608
No. Index... They're napkins.

1066
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,739
They're not index cards
with writing on them.

1067
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,075
Let me get some more napkins.

1068
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,643
That's okay, really. I think...

1069
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,394
Sweet balls!

1070
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,658
I can't believe that happened.

1071
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,065
I'm sorry about all the gravity.

1072
01:07:41,124 --> 01:07:42,865
Are you all right?

1073
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,739
I'm sorry, Oliver.

1074
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,513
I'm sorry.

1075
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,014
I need to go.

1076
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:17,561
Come on, Puffin,
you've been in here for days.

1077
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:20,836
Let's watch a movie,
it'll make you feel better.

1078
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,172
I don't get it.

1079
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,712
Why would Shelley just leave?

1080
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,112
It's for the best. She wasn't happy.

1081
01:08:28,171 --> 01:08:31,618
I used to hear her crying
in her room late at night.

1082
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:35,386
I think I'd like to be alone for a bit.

1083
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,618
I could stay with you.

1084
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,621
No, just bring me more ice cream.

1085
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:47,430
Egg! Paprika!

1086
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,731
Nutmeg! Who cares? Who cares?

1087
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:55,166
What have I done to poor Shelley?

1088
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:59,171
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

1089
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,078
No. You can't.

1090
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:05,108
I'm gonna be the next Miss November,
not that little blonde bitch.

1091
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:09,247
You found my weakness,
used it against me like kryptonite,

1092
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,918
but that's never gonna happen again.

1093
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,725
"Oh, Mr. Hefner..."

1094
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,162
Guys, remember, we only need 30, okay?

1095
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,035
First up,

1096
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:23,831
Kristen Withers.

1097
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,998
Pre-med, family in Greenwich.

1098
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,541
- Yeah, so cute.
- I like.

1099
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,201
Cute, cute. Totally.

1100
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,335
- No doubt.
- Very cute.

1101
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,936
- In.
- Guys...

1102
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,880
We just made our first pledge acceptance.

1103
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,845
Okay, cool. All right. Next up, Jill Palmer.

1104
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:45,256
Colorado, theater major...
Her father owns, like, half of Aspen.

1105
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,588
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1106
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,169
Why am I such a yummy dummy?

1107
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:58,603
Next one.

1108
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:04,175
Nancy Nagle. English major from Florida.

1109
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,173
But she does drive a Porsche.

1110
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,546
I just don't know about this one.
I kind of feel like we've created this image.

1111
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,516
I just don't feel like she's gonna fit in.

1112
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,426
I'm just saying, she should have spent
the Porsche money on a nose job.

1113
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:24,063
She said she broke it in a skiing accident
last year, and I'm like,

1114
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:27,728
"Okay, I'm sure the nose surgeon would
take the Porsche as a trade-in."

1115
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,326
Booya! Snap!

1116
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,366
Hello?

1117
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,343
Hey, Shelley, it's me.

1118
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,312
- Hef?
- Yeah.

1119
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,509
Hef? Oh, is this you? Oh, my gosh.

1120
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,452
How are you?
Like, I can't believe you're calling me.

1121
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:49,683
How is everybody at the Mansion?
How are things?

1122
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:53,159
Good news. I'm gonna make you
next month's centerfold.

1123
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:55,025
You're making me Miss November?

1124
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,257
- That's right.
- Oh, my gosh.

1125
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,028
Are you totally serious, or is this not Hef?

1126
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,797
If this is Hef, blink once.
If it isn't Hef, blink twice.

1127
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:04,361
Did you blink?

1128
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,374
I'm so glad you haven't changed, Shelley.

1129
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,604
And I want you to move
back to the Mansion.

1130
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,442
It's just not the same without you here.

1131
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,941
Hef, I just can't believe it.

1132
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,076
Believe it, baby.

1133
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:20,052
Okay, here's what happens.

1134
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,556
We shoot the pictorial, we'll have you do
a 25-city tour of the United States.

1135
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,820
And then from there
we're gonna travel Europe,

1136
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,759
ending with a one-week stay in Monaco.

1137
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,387
We're gonna coordinate your pictorial

1138
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,524
with a Playboy Channel documentary
on the life of a centerfold.

1139
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:35,432
The exposure's going to be wonderful,
but it doesn't stop there.

1140
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,903
We're going to pull out all the stops
for this one, Shelley.

1141
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,405
It's going to be huge.

1142
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,907
Hef?

1143
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,465
Yeah, baby?

1144
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,410
Hef, I'm so sorry.

1145
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,949
I'm so happy that you called me.

1146
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:52,077
And I love you, but I
don't think I can do it.

1147
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,212
I can't leave my Zeta girls.

1148
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:55,551
What?

1149
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,292
I'm not going anywhere.

1150
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,760
I'm home.

1151
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:07,829
Katootoo Jihiman.

1152
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:11,595
Sociology major from India. Everyone?

1153
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,902
I remember this one.
She seems kind of weird.

1154
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:15,101
I actually got that, too.

1155
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,872
Not like an "I live in the wall
and eat crickets" kind of weird,

1156
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,436
but just like a little off.

1157
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:21,914
- Boo to Katootoo.
- Next.

1158
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,710
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1159
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:27,677
Lilly?

1160
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,518
Look at you people!

1161
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,458
Honestly, is this really what you've become?

1162
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:36,088
Judging other girls on their appearance?
Calling them weird?

1163
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:38,689
I'm sure glad I joined when I did,
because honestly,

1164
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,859
I don't think
I would make the cut these days.

1165
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:42,903
And neither would a lot of you.

1166
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:46,930
I can't believe that Zeta's become
just like Phi Iota Mu.

1167
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:49,237
A bunch of snooty bitches!

1168
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,574
Lilly, you talked.

1169
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,876
And you're British?

1170
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,156
Hi, everybody. I'm home.

1171
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,295
This is all your fault.

1172
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:16,394
Yeah. You know what, Mona? You're right.

1173
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:19,770
It all started with this fake hair
and your stupid water bras.

1174
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:22,332
You know what?
Before you got here, we were individuals.

1175
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,537
You've turned us all into stupid bimbos.

1176
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,612
- We were fine the way we were.
- We look ridiculous.

1177
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:28,714
- I'm getting Cs in all my classes.
- Why am I looking like this?

1178
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,016
- This isn't who I am.
- I can't believe you let me do this to myself.

1179
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,520
Guys, stop. Come on, stop, stop.

1180
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:34,680
Guys.

1181
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,089
I understand, and I'm sorry.

1182
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,454
Sol...

1183
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,555
Thank you guys for everything.

1184
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:50,593
I'm gonna go, and I really hope
to see you guys in the future.

1185
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:53,268
Shelley.

1186
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,547
Hi, Hef, it's Shelley.

1187
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,884
I was just kidding, silly.

1188
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:11,687
I can't wait to be back at the Mansion
and be a centerfold.

1189
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:14,854
This is the happiest day of my life.

1190
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:17,559
Dear Oliver,

1191
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,294
I'm so sorry I couldn't tell you
this in person.

1192
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:23,667
It was way too embarrassing
to face you after everything.

1193
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:27,367
I am leaving the Zeta house
to fulfill my lifelong dream.

1194
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:32,945
And I know that what I've decided to do
won't make any sense to you at all,

1195
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:34,811
but I have joined the Peace Corps,

1196
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:39,080
and I'm going off to work in the mountains
of a country called Peru.

1197
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:43,251
I'm going to meet lots of interesting people.

1198
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,656
I'm sure it'll be very hot where I'm going.

1199
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,426
And even though it's going to be super-hot,

1200
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:51,421
I will be bundled up in clothes,
barely showing any flesh.

1201
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,598
I only tell you that because
I don't want you to worry

1202
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,761
about me getting sunburned.

1203
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,069
Hef told me what you did, and I don't
think it was very sisterly of you.

1204
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:03,041
You are so vapid.

1205
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:08,708
Actually, I'm ingenious and philanthropic,
and you're a backstabbing bitch.

1206
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:12,809
- Nice, Shelley. That was awesome.
- Shelley!

1207
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,015
I hope everybody at the old folks' home
is doing great.

1208
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,457
And as for the Zeta girls,
I'm sure they're doing fine.

1209
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,486
Oliver, I hope you think of me
every once in a while, and when you do,

1210
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:25,498
I hope they are good thoughts.

1211
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:26,624
Pooter!

1212
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,362
Love, Shelley.

1213
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,266
There you are.

1214
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,904
So we'll be half Shelley
and half who we really are.

1215
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,905
Can we be 60% Shelley?

1216
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:43,143
I mean, say what you want about her,
but the girl had style.

1217
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:46,015
- What?
- "She had style"?

1218
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:49,913
She still does. I mean, she just wants
to be back at the Playboy Mansion.

1219
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:52,457
Well, whatever we're gonna be,
we need to figure out, you guys.

1220
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:57,396
We still need 30 pledges by October 15th,
or we can just kiss it all goodbye.

1221
01:15:57,453 --> 01:16:00,457
Who wants to be a part of something real?
Zeta.

1222
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:02,662
Hi. Zeta. Tell 29 of your friends.

1223
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:06,935
Listen up, ladies! Zeta was founded
on the tenets of sisterhood,

1224
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,839
friendship and philanthropy.

1225
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,002
Here you go.

1226
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,309
Yeah, and since then, we've added some
pretty kick-ass parties to the list.

1227
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:15,246
Yeah, but instead of judging and rejecting,

1228
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:18,342
we'll put all the pledges we get into a bowl,
and we'll draw 30 names out.

1229
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,910
Natalie? What'd you do to your hair?

1230
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,422
- I could change it back.
- Why?

1231
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,015
Everyone gets haircuts.

1232
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,618
People have lots of different styles
all over the world.

1233
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:31,722
In China,
they usually tend to layer it, I've noticed.

1234
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,933
This isn't China, though. So, I just...
You know, I could put it back to how it was.

1235
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,597
Oh, no, no. Why, why, why? You look great.

1236
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,737
- I do?
- Yeah.

1237
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,174
Well, I mean, you looked great before,
with the hair.

1238
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:46,645
But, I mean, this feels more you.

1239
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,546
I mean, besides,
it's not like I want you to be my girlfriend

1240
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,518
just because of your hairstyle. So...

1241
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:54,384
Your girlfriend?

1242
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,549
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

1243
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:58,717
It's kind of presumptuous.

1244
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,762
It's like, "Hey, you wanna be my girlfriend?
Sit next to me."

1245
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,819
No, no.
I mean, you don't want to be my girlfriend.

1246
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:07,129
You got guys falling from trees for you,
and it's like...

1247
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,965
Here I am, just a goofy dude.

1248
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,795
"Goofy dude"?

1249
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:20,312
Colby, I want to be your girlfriend more
than an electron wants to attach to a proton.

1250
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,049
- That much?
- Yeah.

1251
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:29,649
Yeah?

1252
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,657
What? What?

1253
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:41,895
Did I mess that up?
Because I can do that so much better.

1254
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:45,831
No, I was just thanking Shelley.

1255
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,139
Oh. Thank you, Shelley.

1256
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:59,185
Okay, guys. Close your eyes.

1257
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:07,289
This is it. We're gonna keep the Zeta house.

1258
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:10,694
- Oh, my gosh.
- Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta!

1259
01:18:10,753 --> 01:18:11,993
Lilly, go mail the bids.

1260
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:21,399
Hi.

1261
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,667
Are you new on campus?

1262
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:25,541
I don't think we've ever met.

1263
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:27,706
I'm Cole. Cole Trickle.

1264
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:33,148
Yes. Yes, I just transferred.

1265
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,119
My name is Lilly.

1266
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,889
- Hi.
- Hi.

1267
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,921
That girl over there just
dropped these on the floor,

1268
01:18:41,984 --> 01:18:44,328
and she's really into that guy.

1269
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,730
- And I don't want to interrupt her.
- Okay.

1270
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,962
- Can you mail these out for her?
- Sure thing.

1271
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,560
Thank you.

1272
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:53,835
You should totally
mail me your number sometime.

1273
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,432
Okay.

1274
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:58,410
Just give it to me. I have a great memory.

1275
01:18:58,968 --> 01:19:00,538
Where are my envelopes?

1276
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:04,415
Oh, you dropped them, but I got it,
and they're gonna be mailed right out.

1277
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,714
Oh, thank you so much.

1278
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:10,951
- Okay, my number's 7-6...
- Anyways, it was great meeting you, Nelly.

1279
01:19:11,647 --> 01:19:13,991
Oh, but my name is Lilly, actually.

1280
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,653
Yeah, whatever.

1281
01:19:16,652 --> 01:19:17,892
Bye.

1282
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,932
Now can I see your pizzanties?

1283
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:23,095
No.

1284
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:35,778
I don't get it.

1285
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:38,114
Why didn't anyone show up?

1286
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,248
You guys, come here and look at this.

1287
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:50,289
I'm Ashley. Come on in.
Nice to meet you guys.

1288
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,799
You did send out the invitations,
didn't you?

1289
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:58,133
Yes.

1290
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,698
But there was this boy there.

1291
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:03,243
And I never talked to a boy before.
You know?

1292
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,870
And he distracted me. Just for a minute.

1293
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,278
And then I saw him talking to Ashley.

1294
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:11,318
And they knew each other. I could tell
by the way that they talked, and...

1295
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:12,613
And...

1296
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,121
I'm sorry.

1297
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,070
People, all right. That's enough. Let's go.

1298
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,106
We're done. We're shooting Miss November,
not Miss December. Let's do this.

1299
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,802
Give me the fog. Wind, let's go.
Music, let's go.

1300
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:39,471
Let's shoot this. Miss November.
Immortality! Let's go!

1301
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:43,048
All right, here we go. It's Shelley time.
Come on, Shelley, it's so hot.

1302
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:45,712
Oh, yeah. Sexy.
Sell it, Shelley. Oh, my gosh.

1303
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,583
You're gorgeous, Shelley. So hot!

1304
01:20:47,643 --> 01:20:50,146
Come on, work it, Shelley!
Come on, let's see some...

1305
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,247
Shelley?

1306
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:54,089
Stop. Stop the fog, Dave.
Barry, hold the wind, please.

1307
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,959
What's wrong, babe?
You okay? You sad? Sad monkey?

1308
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,828
I don't think I'm your Miss November.

1309
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,230
What?

1310
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,135
I'm sorry.

1311
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:08,033
Shelley, wait. Shelley.
Shelley, come on. Shelley...

1312
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:10,008
Is she serious?

1313
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,067
Shelley! Shell-monkey!

1314
01:21:12,134 --> 01:21:14,671
Should we take a shower
and talk about it? Shelley!

1315
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:23,323
Natalie?

1316
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,485
Oh, my gosh. How did you find me?

1317
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,757
Oh, just... A little bird told me.

1318
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,388
What bird?

1319
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:33,956
Marvin called us. I thought...

1320
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:35,660
We didn't think you liked us anymore.

1321
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:39,171
Oh, my gosh, no. I've missed you so much.

1322
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,708
Oh, hi, girls. Oh, my gosh.

1323
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:43,675
You guys look beautiful!

1324
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,110
Oh, I've missed you guys so much.

1325
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:48,011
You're the best housemother
anyone's ever had.

1326
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,277
I'm really sorry for what I said to you.

1327
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:51,875
I know. We really miss you, Shelley.

1328
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,283
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1329
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:56,913
So, how'd the rest of rush go?
Did you guys get your pledges?

1330
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:00,358
Zeta had a ton of people interested,
don't get me wrong. Thanks to you.

1331
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:03,556
But nobody showed up
because Ashley stole all of our bids.

1332
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:06,293
No. So the house is gone?

1333
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,663
They'll make it official today

1334
01:22:07,723 --> 01:22:10,465
at the Panhellenic Council meeting
this afternoon.

1335
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:12,335
So there's still a chance.

1336
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:13,429
Shelley, it's too late.

1337
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,941
I mean, I don't think there's anything
that we can do.

1338
01:22:15,998 --> 01:22:19,138
Natalie! Together we can do anything!

1339
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,110
Today's meeting is tinged with sadness.

1340
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:28,247
Unfortunately, not all of us will be
returning next year.

1341
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:34,151
Yes, that's true. So with that said,
that brings us to our last order of business.

1342
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,494
Stop!

1343
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:38,725
Oh, dear.

1344
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,892
We're here to save our house.

1345
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:44,597
I don't know how this
big meeting stuff works, but I just...

1346
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,196
Enough with the freak show.

1347
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:50,175
What I was saying, before I was
so rudely interrupted, is that...

1348
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:52,234
Hold on! Wait.

1349
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,475
I have something to say.

1350
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:07,525
Shelley, say something.

1351
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,324
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

1352
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:13,457
Oh, for God's sake, Dean Simmons.
Enough is enough. Do something.

1353
01:23:13,522 --> 01:23:17,698
Shelley? The council has come here today
to really finalize this, so...

1354
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:22,265
No! No! This is germane to our predicament.

1355
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:26,746
Oh, well, as long as it's germane.
Please continue.

1356
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:28,804
Just give her a minute.

1357
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,585
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

1358
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:39,120
I took it once when I had a cold.
I was 16, and it gave me itching.

1359
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:44,058
I mean, everything itched.
My legs, my arms, my earlobes.

1360
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:47,293
And other stuff, too, but I can't say,
because I'm live on the air right now,

1361
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,768
and you can't say "ass cheeks," right?

1362
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:51,327
You just did.

1363
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,837
But I said it kind of quietly, I think.

1364
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:01,939
But besides the itching,
the erythromycin also made my skin glow.

1365
01:24:02,905 --> 01:24:05,681
It gave me, like, this glowing tan.

1366
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,585
And I suddenly felt like another person.

1367
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,656
Different.

1368
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,723
Better.

1369
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,758
Prettier, I guess.

1370
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:18,423
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

1371
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:20,325
Michelle.

1372
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:23,164
Michelle, do you know that feeling
that I'm talking about?

1373
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,431
Where you suddenly feel pretty

1374
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:27,133
and, next thing you know,
you feel better about yourself?

1375
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,607
Well, that was what was happening to me.

1376
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:32,942
My allergic reaction made me feel pretty,

1377
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:37,848
and so I ignored all the bad side effects,
because suddenly people were talking to me

1378
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,783
and they were noticing me.

1379
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,947
And even though I was itching like crazy,

1380
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:45,821
it was worth it to feel accepted.

1381
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:51,060
And so I couldn't wait to get a cold
so I could take my erythromycin.

1382
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:58,435
But underneath that beautiful, glowing skin,
I still had that cold.

1383
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:02,542
Well, that's a meteor.

1384
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:05,511
The word is "Metaphor."

1385
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:08,708
Can you really be that dumb?

1386
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,417
She's not dumb.

1387
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,915
Thank you, Natalie.

1388
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:19,053
And, Mrs. Hagstrom, I meant "Meteor."

1389
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:23,786
It flashes by and burns bright,
but then it disappears.

1390
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,733
And that was what was happening to me.

1391
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,235
The real me just disappeared.

1392
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,762
Is anyone buying this?

1393
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,174
I am not an expert speech-giver.

1394
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:42,242
But I do know that one day,
when your looks are gone,

1395
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:45,911
if everything you have is based on looks,
well, then you've got nothing.

1396
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,217
You need your friends
and your family by your side,

1397
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:53,089
to love you for who you are,
not what you look like.

1398
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,925
At the Zeta house, our new motto is,
"Be who you are."

1399
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,931
Because we're a family.

1400
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:03,366
We're a family that loves you on the inside.

1401
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:09,770
So we need you to stand forward
and be a part of that family.

1402
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:15,207
We need 30 people right now
to stand forward and pledge Zeta!

1403
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,683
Hey, honey!
You had me at "itchy ass cheeks." I'm in.

1404
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,720
Me too! Me too!

1405
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:22,084
Me too!

1406
01:26:23,078 --> 01:26:24,648
- I'll be a Zeta!
- Me, too!

1407
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,522
- Me, too.
- I'll pledge!

1408
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:30,154
- Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11!
- Me, too!

1409
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,097
- I'll pledge!
- Twelve! Thirteen! Come on, we need 30.

1410
01:26:33,155 --> 01:26:34,634
- I'll do it!
- Fourteen.

1411
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,931
- Get your hand down.
- Fifteen. Sixteen.

1412
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:39,973
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20.
Excellent! Twenty-one!

1413
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,907
- Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Come on!
- I'll be in Zeta!

1414
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:45,001
- Twenty-four, 25.
- Up here! Pick me!

1415
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:47,206
Twenty-six, on top.
Thank you. Twenty-seven.

1416
01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:49,647
New pledger, right there.
Come on, two more!

1417
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:51,309
Twenty-eight, 29!

1418
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,614
One more. Just need one more.
Come on, everybody.

1419
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:57,248
One more. One more. Get your hand up.
Come on! Be a Zeta.

1420
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,620
Come on!

1421
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,991
Come on! Come on, one more!
Just need one more Zeta.

1422
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,087
One more, one more. Come on!

1423
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:06,564
Pound the gavel!
Why are you dragging this out?

1424
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:08,032
There's nobody else! It's over.

1425
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,593
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha on you, Zetas.

1426
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:14,839
Wait!

1427
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:17,969
There's one more new Zeta!

1428
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:28,788
No. Sorry.

1429
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:32,957
Can't be a baby pledging a sorority.
You gotta be a student.

1430
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,322
That's right!

1431
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:37,488
Rules are rules. Oh, well. Bye-bye.

1432
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,691
Time to pound that gavel.
Meeting adjourned.

1433
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,599
Dunzo. Pound that gavel, Dean.

1434
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:46,195
I'm really very sorry, girls.
I know how hard you've worked for this.

1435
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,241
It hurts me to do this, but I...

1436
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,573
Stop! I would like to pledge Zeta.

1437
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,407
What?

1438
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:55,971
I like everything that Shelley said.

1439
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:58,108
Are you out of your mind?

1440
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:03,812
And, God, do you know
how sick to death I am of you?

1441
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:05,950
Of Phi Iota Mu?

1442
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,460
I've been in Phi Iota Mu hell!

1443
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:10,519
I want to be a Zeta.

1444
01:28:14,089 --> 01:28:15,329
No!

1445
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:23,706
Okay, so Zetas keep their house.

1446
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:25,472
Meeting adjourned.

1447
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:29,105
Now, go study something.

1448
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,254
What are we supposed to do now?

1449
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,119
Let's start with this.

1450
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,997
Oh, I love my weird home.

1451
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:49,296
Things that I like!

1452
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:52,065
Ottoman! Oh, I love you, ottoman.

1453
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:55,298
- This house is so nice!
- I know.

1454
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,400
I mean, so cool.

1455
01:28:57,465 --> 01:29:00,505
- Hey, do you want me to show you upstairs?
- Yes! Show me, show me, show me.

1456
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:02,242
This is so great.

1457
01:29:02,304 --> 01:29:04,910
Everything worked out so perfectly.

1458
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:08,512
Well, not perfectly.

1459
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:13,617
I mean, I messed up things with Oliver
because I moved to Peru and left him a note.

1460
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:16,492
Well, Shelley,
you didn't really move to Peru.

1461
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:18,792
I know that, but he doesn't.

1462
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:22,533
Oliver.

1463
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:29,002
I was literally just talking about you.
How did you know that I got back?

1464
01:29:29,998 --> 01:29:32,706
Let's just say a little bird told me.

1465
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:36,381
I gotta meet this frickin' bird!

1466
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:39,243
It's me, Shell.

1467
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,988
I'm the bird. I called Oliver.

1468
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:46,524
Thank you.

1469
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,994
It's so great to have such nice friends.

1470
01:29:52,254 --> 01:29:56,225
And, Oliver, I have to admit,
I never went to Peru.

1471
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:58,567
- I know.
- Thank you.

1472
01:29:58,627 --> 01:30:00,231
You're welcome.

1473
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:02,842
And I was in Playboy.

1474
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,811
I know that, too. And I don't care.

1475
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,712
I would like to try this again.

1476
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:14,242
Except this time,
no manhole covers or bubble gum.

1477
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:18,286
You know, just see where this goes.

1478
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:20,019
Yes.

1479
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:23,226
- I'd like that.
- Great.

1480
01:30:26,054 --> 01:30:27,533
Oliver.

1481
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:28,897
Oliver.

1482
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:32,933
- I'm Shelley.
- Nice to meet you again, Shelley.

1483
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:37,334
Dear Hef, everything worked out!

1484
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:40,846
We got 30 new Zeta sisters,
and the house was saved.

1485
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,917
And Oliver and I started dating again.

1486
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:47,886
Oliver is kind and sweet and when we kiss,

1487
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,583
I see stars and he sees fireworks.

1488
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:52,926
And he says that means that we're in love,
and he's right!

1489
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:54,426
Because otherwise, when we kiss

1490
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:57,463
we'd see stuff like pencils
and empty ketchup bottles.

1491
01:30:57,519 --> 01:31:00,989
Oh, and the Zetas decided to throw
a big party in my honor,

1492
01:31:01,056 --> 01:31:03,195
and I felt just like that girl
from the storybook.

1493
01:31:03,258 --> 01:31:05,101
You know the one. What's her name?

1494
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,333
Oh, yeah. Cinderella.

1495
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:21,114
Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at?

1496
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:23,486
Where my, where my...
Where my Zetas at?

1497
01:31:23,545 --> 01:31:25,786
Hands up now

1498
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:27,485
Push it up now

1499
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,959
I know what boys like

1500
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:33,226
Cute smiles and heels high

1501
01:31:33,288 --> 01:31:35,564
I tempt the hello

1502
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:37,796
While I say bye-bye

1503
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,100
I know they want me

1504
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:42,436
They try to fake it

1505
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,773
But they just end up

1506
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,835
intimidated!

1507
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:52,281
It ain't that hard to see

1508
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,251
I know you're feelin' me

1509
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:56,050
I know what I want

1510
01:31:56,111 --> 01:31:58,387
If I think you'll give me

1511
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:00,585
I might let you

1512
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:03,026
Unconditionally, yeah

1513
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:05,291
I might let you

1514
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,560
If you're on my level

1515
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:09,431
I might let you

1516
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:12,199
And, baby, if I think you're special

1517
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,262
I might let you!

1518
01:32:14,329 --> 01:32:16,502
Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at?

1519
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:19,067
Where my, where my...
Where my Zetas at?

1520
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:21,341
That's what they want, want

1521
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:23,405
That's what they want, want

1522
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:27,977
Now every time I come up in the spot
I'm with my Zetas

1523
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:32,355
A peace sign to the fellas
And reverse it for the hatas

1524
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:34,655
Slickity-slick Bam-boom-wow

1525
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,060
Look at how hot my ladies are now

1526
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:39,325
We ain't messin' with you fools

1527
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,924
We ain't playin' with you clowns

1528
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:44,231
Now this blonde babe is the one to thank

1529
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:46,636
Helped us rise to the top of the social ranks

1530
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,799
The lost little bunny
changed us for the better

1531
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:51,343
Now she's part of the Zeta family forever

1532
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,675
Back, back...
Back it on up

1533
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:56,079
Back it a-back it a-back
Back it on up

1534
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,378
Back, back...
Back it on up

1535
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,886
Now I realize that

1536
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,252
I know what boys like

1537
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,552
I know what guys want

1538
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,854
I know what boys like

1539
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:10,225
I got what boys like

1540
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:12,424
I know what boys like

1541
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:14,797
I know what guys want

1542
01:33:14,856 --> 01:33:16,995
I know what boys like

1543
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:19,231
I know what I want
