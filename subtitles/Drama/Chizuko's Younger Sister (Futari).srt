1
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,137
This is the last time

2
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:09,224
I spend good money on a new mattress.

3
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:10,626
They weren't even in the apartment,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:11,454
just the building.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,314
Are you sure that you...

6
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,952
We shared a wall with bedbugs!

7
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:14,915
They're too small.

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,767
By the time you know you
have them, it's too late.

9
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:17,877
Did you hear about that guy?

10
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:19,965
He started with all the itching,
and then he got an infection...

11
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,633
Right, and then he had his hand cut off.

12
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:22,369
You heard that story?

13
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:23,469
Yes, but it's an urban myth.

14
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:24,493
But I agree. I agree.

15
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:25,619
Don't take any chances.

16
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:27,541
The exterminator comes in one hour.

17
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,648
I am going to stay at
my cousin's in Riverdale.

18
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:30,954
When she steals her kids' Ritalin,

19
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:32,040
she's really fun.

20
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,648
So I'll see you kids in two days.

21
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:35,064
Good luck.

22
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,681
Ugh!

23
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:39,381
Oh, you're looking at
me like I have cooties.

24
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,697
You don't, do you?

25
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:42,639
No, the bedbugs were most definitely

26
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:43,796
not in our apartment.

27
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:45,265
I am completely bedbug free.

28
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,691
Well, we'll see about that.

29
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:49,344
I'm gonna have to do a
thorough physical examination.

30
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:51,525
Are you sure your roommates
won't mind if I stay?

31
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,494
No, of course not. They love you.

32
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,259
But you should probably
take a really hot shower

33
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:58,794
and shave off all your body
hair before you come over.

34
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:00,858
All of it.

35
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:02,094
You wish.

36
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:04,794
- I'm serious.
- Come on, dude.

37

_

39
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,286
How did this happen?

40
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,611
Joanne from my book clu... uh, the...

41
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:39,110
I mean, that suburban book club

42
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:40,635
must have started a campaign.

43
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,110
There's, like, over 100 of these.

44
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,211
Liza, do you realize what you've done?

45
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,019
This is real.

46
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,760
We have to tell Charles.

47
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:51,282
So I need those PPBs on my desk

48
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:52,506
by the end of the week.

49
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,114
That's all I have. Any other business?

50
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:58,024
As a matter of fact,
our very own Liza Miller

51
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,558
found a book in the slush pile,

52
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,917
and it's suddenly getting
a lot of attention.

53
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:02,858
Really?

54
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:04,058
How's that?

55
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:07,531
Well...

56
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:09,056
this book is incredible.

57
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,748
It's an epic, multigenerational tale

58
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:12,759
of this Southern family.

59
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,055
I had an inkling it might play well

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,665
in the suburban book club crowd,

61
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,057
so I sent it to one.

62
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:20,266
After we agreed upon that strategy.

63
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,766
E-exactly.

64
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,741
I feel it's always good to keep a finger

65
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,065
on the suburban pulse.

66
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,565
Yes, she does.

67
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,889
Anyway,

68
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,864
as it turns out, they loved it.

69
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,298
They raved about it on Goodreads,

70
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:33,137
and then other suburban book
clubs started to read it,

71
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:35,246
and now there's actually a campaign

72
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,446
to get us to publish it.

73
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:37,946
The book is called <i>The Scarf,</i>

74
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,098
and people have been
sending in their scarves

75
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:41,422
all morning.

76
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:45,146
I, uh... I'm impressed.

77
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,203
Get me a copy.

78
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,644
I'll read it tonight.

79
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,946
And we will talk in the morning.

80
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,284
Nice job, Liza.

81
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,946
And me.

82
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,829
Since when do you read
books from the slush pile?

83
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,545
Um, I told you I was.

84
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,045
I thought you were joking.

85
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:05,524
And what on Earth made you think

86
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,454
it was appropriate to
go to Charles directly?

87
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,915
You girls in your 20s have
absolutely no boundaries.

88
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,015
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,673
"I'm sorry" doesn't fix anything.

90
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:14,071
Get me a copy ASAP.

91
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,571
And clean up those damn scarves.

92
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,272
Cubicle looks like a
Stevie Nicks estate sale.

93
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:22,766
Well, that can't be good.

94
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,257
No, no, no, no.

95
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:26,449
We are not gonna let her kill this buzz.

96
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:28,714
We're gonna go out and celebrate tonight.

97
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:30,815
Thad and I will take Josh
and you out to dinner.

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,206
Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.

99
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,647
Yeah, we do.

100
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,225
It's about time we have a
proper double date anyway.

101
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,189
A toast to my friend and mentee

102
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:48,294
Liza Miller.

103
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,094
- Mentee?
- Yeah, that's not a word.

104
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,894
Absolutely not a word.

105
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,894
To a long and successful editorial career.

106
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,951
You know what?

107
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,156
It's only a matter of time

108
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:59,181
before she and I are
running Empirical together.

109
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,206
Oh, guys, look!

110
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:03,981
The placemats list the
relationship compatibility

111
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,006
of all the signs on the Chinese zodiac.

112
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:07,113
Uh-oh.

113
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,407
Let's see if we're compatible, huh?

114
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,267
I am the Year of the Horse.

115
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,524
Yeah, that's what I heard.

116
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,643
And you're the Year of the Dragon.

117
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:17,455
Oh, no, it's not a good match.

118
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,861
No, no, no, we are a good match.

119
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,461
I'm the Year of the Ti...

120
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:24,361
phoid scare of 1988, which also

121
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:26,102
happens to be the Year of the Dragon.

122
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:26,993
So yup.

123
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,684
Oh, wow, look. Yup, it's true.

124
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:29,989
We're horrible, terrible.

125
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:32,164
Oh, we're the worst match. Oh, wow.

126
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,025
What you gonna do?

127
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,344
I don't care about what this placemat says.

128
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:36,868
I've always had a thing for dragons.

129
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,197
By the way, just for the record,

130
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:41,474
the snake really goes with the rabbit.

131
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,997
Hey, just like that thing
you keep by your bed.

132
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:47,585
What? You were talking about his dong.

133
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,587
Why can't I talk about your vibrator?

134
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:50,978
To Kelsey's vibrator.

135
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:53,024
To Kelsey's vibrator.

136
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:54,207
Yay! Oh, come on, Kelsey.

137
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:55,931
You got to give it up for that.

138
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:58,900
Okay, guys, night-night.

139
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,853
Don't you let the bedbugs...

140
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:02,448
Stop. Don't remind me.

141
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:04,157
Yo, thanks for coming to Brooklyn.

142
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:05,656
- Good night, you guys.
- See you next time.

143
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,861
Hey, can we not mention

144
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:10,970
the whole bedbug thing to my roommates?

145
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:12,867
They may not know how to clean a toilet,

146
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,675
but they will freak out
about those little suckers.

147
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,200
Of course.

148
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,276
Hey, did you get your
bedroom door fixed yet?

149
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,675
Yes, I fixed it yesterday.

150
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,165
Oh, thank God.

151
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,606
I was afraid I wasn't
going to get any sleep.

152
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,665
You still may not get any sleep.

153
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,665
Mm.

154
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:29,870
Dude, no, no, no.

155
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,228
No, no, behind your back.

156
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,552
The guy with the machete. Come on, man!

157
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:33,660
- Oh!
- Ooh!

158
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:38,160
- Wow.
- Jesus.

159
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:41,068
Yo, what are you guys doing?

160
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:42,651
- Hey!
- Hey!

161
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,704
What's up, man?

162
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,209
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

163
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:48,209
- What's up?
- It's good to see you, bro.

164
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,925
Yeah, we got bored with Philly,

165
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,165
so we decided to drive up
here the last minute and...

166
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,134
- Crash.
- Just crash.

167
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,333
Nice. That's great.

168
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:56,681
Oh, and who do we have here?

169
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,072
This is Liza.

170
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:01,216
This is Jimmy Z. This is Ryan.

171
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,490
They used to live in the neighborhood.

172
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,564
Nice to meet you, girl.

173
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:05,620
Yo, that's good.

174
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,362
So is this your new girlfriend?

175
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:09,664
Uh...

176
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,664
I... we're... hanging out?

177
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,105
Right?

178
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:15,930
- Hanging out?
- Yeah.

179
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,464
Yeah, okay.

180
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:20,623
Uh, even though, according
to the Chinese zodiac,

181
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,677
we're not even compatible.

182
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:23,219
I know, right?

183
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:25,276
What you gonna do?

184
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,976
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

185
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,677
I'm just gonna...

186
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,939
Okay, there's a situation in that toilet.

187
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:37,739
Serious... seriously?

188
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,838
Come on, Du... whose is it?

189
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:41,915
Gabe was there last.

190
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,635
No, Roman went in after me.

191
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,962
I did not! What?

192
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, it was me.

193
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,837
I tried flushing three
times. It wouldn't go down.

194
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:50,937
I'm not a toilet wizard!

195
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:53,179
You plunge, bro, all right?

196
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,537
You plunge.

197
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:55,737
I'm gonna go use

198
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:56,937
the restaurant bathroom downstairs.

199
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:58,078
That is a great idea.

200
00:06:58,103 --> 00:06:59,569
Oh, hey, hey, will you pick up

201
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:02,044
a roll of toilet paper
while you're down there?

202
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:03,619
Yeah, and Imodium for my diarrhea, please.

203
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:04,843
I'll do the best I can.

204
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,537
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

205
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,346
Yo, that... that wasn't that weird, right?

206
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,920
The whole girlfriend thing?

207
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,136
No, that was totally weird, dude.

208
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,336
Yeah, it was...

209
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,126
- You could not be more screwed, bro.
- Really?

210
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,479
Yeah.

211
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,430
_

212
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,797
Coffee.

213
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,716
Oh, my God.

214
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,118
You look so tired.

215
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:45,076
Ugh. I know.

216
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,567
Late night with Josh?

217
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,646
Not in a good way.

218
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,220
His friends drove up from Philly

219
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:52,286
to vape weed and play
videogames very loudly.

220
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,115
I don't know I'm gonna
stay there another night.

221
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,615
Stay with Lauren and me.

222
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,415
- Really?
- Yeah.

223
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,522
I'm sure it'll be all right.

224
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:00,247
Oh, my God, that would be amazing.

225
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,321
Thank you so much.

226
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:02,478
Liza.

227
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:04,252
I took a look at<i> The Scarf,</i>

228
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:07,445
and I found it very readable.

229
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,166
Really? Oh, I'm so glad.

230
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,057
Good eye.

231
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,948
Kelsey, you have my permission

232
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:13,824
to contact the author and make an offer.

233
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,023
Excellent.

234
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,482
So the question becomes,

235
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:23,723
when did Lear's madness actually begin?

236
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:26,824
Was it after the entrance of Edgar?

237
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,025
Put your cell phones away,

238
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,434
or I will cut your thumbs off.

239
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,230
Hello?

240
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,209
Meredith?

241
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:42,206
Yes.

242
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,137
- This is Liza Miller.
- And Kelsey Peters.

243
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,731
We're calling from Empirical Press,

244
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:48,302
and we have some very good news for you.

245
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,879
We have read your copy of<i> The Scarf</i>

246
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,933
that you submitted,

247
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,521
and we would like to make you an offer.

248
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,379
If you pull another stunt like this, Cece,

249
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:56,016
I will see you in hell.

250
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,834
No, wait, this isn't Cece.

251
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,233
This really is Liza Miller
from Empirical Press,

252
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:02,334
and we really do want to publish your book.

253
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,559
Seriously? Yes, seriously.

254
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:07,271
We would love to meet with you in person.

255
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,545
How soon can you come in?

256
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,560
Uh... where are you?

257
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:11,560
We're Midtown.

258
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,193
Uh, I'm in Yonkers.

259
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,521
How about an hour?

260
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,221
That's great. See you then.

261
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:19,874
Whoo!

262
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,221
Somebody wants to publish my novel.

263
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,221
Roll that in your Shakespeare and smoke it.

264
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,326
These stories were passed down in my family

265
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,301
from generation to generation.

266
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,625
I always wanted to write it,

267
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,888
but then I got married.

268
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:37,302
I got a job as a teacher.

269
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,361
And between grading papers
and raising four kids,

270
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:41,852
there was no time to write.

271
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:45,396
Yet I was determined
this story must be told,

272
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,612
so I set aside one hour a day

273
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:50,785
between midnight and 1:00 A.M.

274
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,860
That was all I could do, but I did it!

275
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,596
Every day.

276
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:58,623
It took 12 long years,
but, by God, I finished it.

277
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:02,066
Can I just say you are my new hero?

278
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,599
In my humble opinion,

279
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:06,568
you could be the next Kathryn Stockett.

280
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,545
I mean, this could be another sleeper hit,

281
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,686
just like<i> The Help.</i>

282
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:13,047
Well, that all works for me.

283
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:20,131
That is the best feeling in the world.

284
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,147
Every once in a while, we get reminded

285
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:24,838
that what we do is pretty magical.

286
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:27,216
I don't know what I'm more
excited about at this point:

287
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,521
making that woman's life or
getting a good night's sleep.

288
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,621
Are you sure it's okay

289
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:31,612
that I stay the night with you guys?

290
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:32,865
It's okay. I checked.

291
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,373
And you are going to love Todd and Denise.

292
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:36,537
Who are Todd and Denise?

293
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:37,787
- Hey!
- Hi, sweetheart.

294
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:39,487
- Hello.
- Hi, welcome.

295
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:41,302
- Come on up, honey.
- Come on up.

296
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:42,443
Get up here.

297
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:45,267
Wow, you live with Lauren's parents?

298
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:46,767
Did I not mention that?

299
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,466
Come on.

300
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,425
Get on up here. Come on.

301
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,367
It's my second daughter. Look at her.

302
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:54,058
- Hi, honey.
- You need a better coat.

303
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,557
- Get up here!
- Come on.

304
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:57,083
It's so great to finally meet you.

305
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,357
This is where we live. I design jewelry.

306
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,225
Todd has a small hedge fund.

307
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,292
Small? It's not that small.

308
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:05,592
It is not small, and I can attest to that.

309
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:06,866
So happy you're here.

310
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:07,992
I feel like

311
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,792
I'm running some cool sorority house.

312
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,100
You can stay as long as you want.

313
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,124
I mean, ask her.

314
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,615
No, it's good. I don't mind.

315
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,672
I love being a den mother.

316
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:15,792
We'll get her towels.

317
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:17,807
All right, yours are the
pink towels, all right?

318
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:19,007
Don't use the wrong color.

319
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:20,565
Rosa gets furious.

320
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,307
Rosa.

321
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,776
How long have you been
living with Lauren's parents?

322
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,475
Um, two years?

323
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,975
Two years?

324
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,825
Well, it started out
we were just gonna stay

325
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,316
until we found a place.

326
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,323
But then we realized
we're never gonna be able

327
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,182
to live in Manhattan with our salaries.

328
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:38,507
Rosa does all of our laundry.

329
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,399
Denise is like the Jewish
mother that I never had.

330
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:45,854
And the alternative is, well, bedbugs.

331
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,162
Don't make me unleash them on you.

332
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,253
I am their queen now.

333
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,511
Oh,<i> The Scarf!</i>

334
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:52,691
I can't wait to read this.

335
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,388
I'm gonna give it to my friend

336
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,089
on the<i> Real Housewives</i>
<i>of New York.</i>

337
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,546
She won't read it.

338
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,620
I mean, she doesn't really
read or see peripheral

339
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:00,721
since her last eye tuck.

340
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:03,026
But she can hold it up on camera.

341
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:03,846
Oh, my God.

342
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,300
That would be amazing.

343
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,328
Right?

344
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,762
What?

345
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:09,003
Josh.

346
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:09,872
Junk shot?

347
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,397
Well, I want to see.

348
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,192
Oh, that is his idea of sexting?

349
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:15,981
- Not usually.
- Well, what is it?

350
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,005
Piece of poop.

351
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,581
Ew.

352
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:20,426
Wait, wait, are you into that? No judgment.

353
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:21,544
No.

354
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:23,778
No, it was an inside joke thing.

355
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:24,977
There was, like, a...

356
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,477
Ah, never mind.

357
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,977
Okay, you're all red.

358
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:29,477
Is Josh your boyfriend?

359
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:30,368
Uh...

360
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,776
we're hanging out.

361
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,576
Hanging out? Oh, God.

362
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:35,776
What is it with...

363
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,177
hanging out is not a thing, okay?

364
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,668
What is it with you girls?

365
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,076
It's like Tinder this, Snapchat that.

366
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,177
The world is not one big booty call.

367
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,535
And they're great together.

368
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,629
I keep telling her she
needs to lock it down.

369
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,320
And I keep telling her she doesn't.

370
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:50,887
Yeah, and don't listen to her.

371
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:53,194
She will sleep with
anything that moves, right?

372
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,518
Male, female,

373
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,729
trans, amphibian...

374
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,037
That's what we should all be doing.

375
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,645
The world would be a far better place

376
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,596
if everyone was polyamorous,

377
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:02,684
you and dad included.

378
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,383
Oh, please don't put
that vision in my head,

379
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:04,966
all right?

380
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,387
It's bad enough I have to picture him

381
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:07,614
having sex with me.

382
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,786
Look, I'm in no rush.

383
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:10,411
And I have absolutely no interest

384
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:11,384
in pressuring Josh.

385
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:13,783
Okay, then. Don't answer that text.

386
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:14,684
Right?

387
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:15,841
Let him chase you.

388
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,232
Men love the chase.

389
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:20,137
Promise me you're not
gonna answer that text

390
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:20,984
till tomorrow morning.

391
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,184
You're right. I won't.

392
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,583
I am absolutely not answering that text.

393
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:25,783
- Promise?
- Of course.

394
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:26,684
I don't believe you.

395
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,733
_

396
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:38,292
_

397
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:47,169
_

398
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,283
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry.

399
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:55,004
She has you in here?

400
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,077
Uh, yeah.

401
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,577
Okay.

402
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:00,276
- You warm enough?
- Yup.

403
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:01,434
Not too warm?

404
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,121
I will... I can open the window.

405
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:04,594
- You want met to...
- No, just fine.

406
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:05,585
Okay.

407
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,612
Do you need any water or anything?

408
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:10,669
Water...

409
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:11,794
No, I'm good.

410
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:14,193
Almond milk, soy milk, something like that?

411
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:16,594
No, thank you.

412
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,393
Well, I'll be right next
door if you need anything,

413
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:22,417
anything at all.

414
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,494
Okey-dokey.

415
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,884
Well, text from Lauren.

416
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:35,957
Denise loved you,

417
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:37,732
and Todd says come back any time.

418
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:39,965
That's... that's so nice.

419
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,579
Oh, how cute.

420
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:43,134
Did you two walk to work together?

421
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,611
Actually, we had a slumber party.

422
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,095
- Funny story...
- No time.

423
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,462
We have a meeting scheduled
with Meredith Montgomery.

424
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,165
Oh, wait. When?

425
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,938
Now. I set it up.

426
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:54,805
Maybe you forgot.

427
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,539
I still run the marketing department.

428
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,228
Oh, you must be Meredith.

429
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,302
Diana Trout.

430
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:07,314
You wanted me in on this?

431
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,626
Oh, yes, this is our publisher,

432
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:09,650
Charles Brooks.

433
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,524
I loved your book.

434
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,572
I think we're going to have
a big success on our hands.

435
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:13,545
Thank you.

436
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:16,462
Yes,<i> The Scarf</i> is a compelling read.

437
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,767
But it was more compelling

438
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,479
the first time it was published,

439
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,859
as<i> The Babushka.</i>

440
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:26,516
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

441
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,559
What are you talking about?

442
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:31,669
<i>The Babushka</i> by
Anna Cleveman Daniels,

443
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:34,111
a little-read book
written back in the '80s

444
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,103
about a Jewish family

445
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,751
chronicling their five generations

446
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:39,410
and the babushka they passed down.

447
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:41,524
I haven't heard of that book, so...

448
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:43,923
Oh, really?

449
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,730
Perhaps I can refresh your memory.

450
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,515
"The severity often differs,

451
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:51,069
"even the location of the wound.

452
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:53,462
"But what's never changed is the fact

453
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,923
"that he was a Russian Cossack.

454
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:58,324
"And my grandfather, the
boy who saved his life,

455
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:01,324
was the shtetl bugler."

456
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,123
Oh, my God.

457
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:05,542
That's the same first line,

458
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:06,950
only more ethnic.

459
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:08,572
Shall I continue?

460
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,010
Do you mean the whole thing is...

461
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:13,482
A total rip-off. The
story's exactly the same.

462
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:15,469
Is this true?

463
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:17,381
Uh, well, I, um...

464
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,881
uh...

465
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,619
Oh, all right, you know what?

466
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:23,491
I'm sorry.

467
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,814
I was desperate.

468
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,873
I have written 13 novels.

469
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:30,732
I have tried every genre under the Sun:

470
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,641
fairy tales, romance, vampire porn.

471
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,470
And then I just happened
upon a box with some old books

472
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,798
in a storage closet in the school library,

473
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,906
and there it was.

474
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,416
<i>The Babushka.</i>

475
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:46,170
It has been out of print for years.

476
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:49,379
So I thought if I put my
own family history in it,

477
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:51,268
doesn't that count for something?

478
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,279
We can't make a deal

479
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,021
on a book that's been plagiarized.

480
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:58,497
Liza? Kelsey? How'd this happen?

481
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:01,079
We used all the normal search protocols.

482
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,478
Well, thankfully, I dug deeper.

483
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,264
This could have been a problem.

484
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,779
So, Diana, I am thankful.

485
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,309
Well, you're welcome, Charles.

486
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:17,714
I apologize for letting my assistant

487
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:18,752
get off her leash like that.

488
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:20,714
- I am so...
- Shh! Quiet.

489
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,453
Better luck next time.

490
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:26,154
Well, I think we're done here.

491
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,461
Cancel her car service.

492
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:32,753
I'll be in my office if you need me.

493
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm sorry.

494
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:38,154
It's just, you start to lie,

495
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,590
and then slowly but surely,

496
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:40,999
it takes on a life of its own.

497
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:44,460
It's like you almost begin to believe it.

498
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:48,234
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

499
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:51,834
I understand more than you could know.

500
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,654
Was she serious about the car service?

501
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,133
I'm afraid so.

502
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,124
Oh, shit.

503
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,843
- Hey.
- Hey.

504
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,261
Welcome home, roomie.

505
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:07,462
Aw.

506
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:09,190
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

507
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,797
No, I really missed you.

508
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,312
My cousin, she has sleep apnea,

509
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,632
and she snores like a dying bear.

510
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:15,427
Please, Josh had clogged toilets

511
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,140
in that frat house he calls an apartment,

512
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:19,839
and Lauren's dad totally creeped me out.

513
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:21,640
Okay, you win. All right.

514
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:24,804
Here, let's make a toast
to a bedbug-less existence.

515
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:26,829
Aw, at least I have that.

516
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:27,722
What happened?

517
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,522
It was a tough day at work.

518
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,657
That author I thought I discovered?

519
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,649
Turns out she's a total fraud.

520
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:34,530
Are you kidding me?

521
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,930
Nope, plagiarized the entire book.

522
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:38,622
<i>The Scarf</i> totally unraveled.

523
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:39,629
Bad pun intended.

524
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:41,728
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, sweetie.

525
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:44,438
Yeah, well, as disappointing as it is

526
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:46,124
to realize you've been championing a fraud,

527
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,982
it's even tougher to realize you are one.

528
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,064
Oh, come on, now. Don't
be so hard on yourself.

529
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,899
It's not like your lie is hurting anybody.

530
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:55,086
I'm not so sure about that.

531
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,313
What?

532
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:03,852
Hey, come down here!

533
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,188
We're at the bar next door.

534
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:07,074
We're gonna help you liquor your wounds.

535
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,774
Okay.

536
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:18,226
- Ugh!
- Hey.

537
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:20,830
I am so sorry. Come here.

538
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:24,130
Hey, your eye was good.

539
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:26,531
And you're gonna get another book.

540
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:30,323
I ordered 14 different kinds of tequila.

541
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:31,741
So nice knowing you guys.

542
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:34,428
I'm sorry you got lied to.

543
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:35,628
Totally sucks.

544
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:39,238
Hey, um...

545
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,149
I have to tell you something.

546
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,076
That's funny, because I have
something to tell you too.

547
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:45,100
- I need to go first.
- No, just let me go first.

548
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,767
Josh... Just listen to me, all right?

549
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,170
It's been bugging me for two days.

550
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:52,230
The truth is, is I think that we're doing

551
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,858
a little bit more than just hanging out,

552
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,569
all right?

553
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:00,379
I... I've never really been much for words.

554
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,963
I'm more of a man of symbols.

555
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,420
Oh.

556
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:07,152
That's nice.

557
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:08,593
It's you.

558
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,881
It's me?

559
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:11,756
Yeah, it's a dragon.

560
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,155
Oh, my God, it's for your birth year.

561
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,446
Oh, my God.

562
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:16,720
What do you think?

563
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:18,677
I'm...

564
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:20,631
Sp-speechless.
