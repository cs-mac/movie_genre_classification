2
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,235
Hi, Felix, where is your mom?

3
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,710
They have grown.

4
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,951
lt's heavy.

5
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,993
-You got any presents for us?
-Did you have a good trip?

6
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,757
-Hi, mom.
-Hi, son. Did you have a nice trip?

7
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,866
-The presents!
-Don't you say hi to your son?

8
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,971
-Hi, dad.
-Hi, son.

9
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,112
Cheer up, dad, your son's here.

10
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,846
He thought you had missed the train.

11
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,647
Times goes by, he remains the same.

12
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,782
He's been talking about your job
for a month...

13
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,862
and it's been a week
since he's saying you'll be late.

14
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,289
lf he had missed the train,
you would go and talk to the boss?

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,961
l go to the plant every day,
it's quite an ordinary thing.

16
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,505
And l wouldn't hesitate
to talk to the boss.

17
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,236
All right, l'm home.

18
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,231
Charge!

19
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,503
Felix, Marie, be careful.

20
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,918
-l'm hungry!
-The meal is almost ready, boys.

21
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,328
What are you doing?
Give it to me. lt's heavy.

22
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,171
l feel guilty, but
since you don't come often.

23
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,768
And since l look after the children,
l had to buy a double bed.

24
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,944
-But this is your room.
-lt used to be.

25
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,785
The green one goes in here.

26
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,348
-Have your husband try it.
-Thank you.

27
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,294
-So you also drink now?
-lt's a family thing.

28
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,834
Don't play the wiseboy with the boss
tomorrow. Just see what he wants.

29
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,068
You could easily be the wiseboy there.

30
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,374
-There's nothing l can do, if people
don't understand what l say. -Please!

31
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:13,180
l do mean it.
He's no professor of yours.

32
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:18,087
Working and studying are not the same.
You have to be formal.

33
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,557
l know. l've done an internship already.

34
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,427
The interview at the headquarters
was alright. No problem.

35
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:29,900
He's been trained for interviews
that are harder than this.

36
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,939
The boss is just a small company,
he won't intimidate you.

37
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,670
He could be a boss, or whatever.
But we need him.

38
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,369
l'm just a temporary employee.

39
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,041
A good reason to be prepared.

40
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,913
l am prepared.

41
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,923
Good job! l was nervous.
Are you happy?

42
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:56,189
-Being a bit nervous is quite normal.
-l don't know-- May be.

43
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,730
You look fine.
Let me see-- This is really becoming.

44
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,036
Quality stuff. You look handsome.

45
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,079
-You look fine in a suit.
-You say so, mom.

46
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,410
Really, l swear it.

47
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,113
-Do l look adequate?
-You look just fine.

48
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,883
-Your a handsome boy.
-Thank you, mom.

49
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,130
So long, son. Good luck.

50
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,705
-Good morning, Alain.
-How are you?

51
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,412
-Ready?
-Yes.

52
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,573
Ready for a well-off job.
Congratulations.

53
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,775
Patrick, this is my son.

54
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:21,108
-He'll work at the offices.
-Great.

55
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,891
-How much is your bike?
-3.000 francs.

56
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,894
That's not cheap.

57
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,730
-lt's cheaper than a car.
-You're right.

58
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,632
We arrive 15 minutes earlier
every morning.

59
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:50,266
We take coffee,
we do some jokes.

60
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,435
A better way to start your day.

61
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,013
-lt's quite pleasant.
-You say so.

62
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,417
Also, there's a bonus for punctuality.

63
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,189
And l wouldn't reject a rise.

64
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,650
-lf we keep talking, we'll be late.
-Right. Let's go.

65
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,856
-Let's go to work!
-We got five minutes more.

66
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,598
lf we listened to him, we'll be there
10 minutes before, always.

67
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,292
-Good morning. Who are you?
-lt's my son.

68
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,459
The boss will see him at 9.
l'm showing him around.

69
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,970
This is no zoo.
l don't care if he's your son.

70
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,439
Stop playing the cop. You have no right
to forbid him coming in.

71
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,737
No one asked you. Shove off.

72
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,575
l just wanted him to see my machine.

73
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,276
When he gets a permit,
you'll show it to him.

74
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,886
This is no circus.

75
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,683
l'll see the machine later, dad.

76
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,020
Go and wait in the room.

77
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,744
Don't be sore, l meant no offence.
These are the rules.

78
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,045
We mean to protect the workers.
Machines are dangerous.

79
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,985
lf they distracted, there could
be a serious accident.

80
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,217
l see, l just wanted
to be kind to my father.

81
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:51,024
lf you feel so, go over,
under my responsibility.

82
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,463
-Careful, presses are dangerous.
-All right. l appreciate.

83
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:16,400
Did they let you in?
This is my machine.

84
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,735
You place the part in here.

85
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,712
The welder is over there.

86
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:29,220
The pin is placed automatically.
You place the top part.

87
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,092
With practice, you can do
700 pieces per hour.

88
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,731
Did you stay up late?
Your rhythm is lower.

89
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,609
What do you care!
You do some work for a change.

90
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,912
Don't worry. l've already done
my part.

91
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,988
That's better. l've got
to shake you more often.

92
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,872
l'm leaving.

93
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,645
A very impressive resume.
Notable.

94
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:43,286
l'm honored that you chose Human
Resources. l'll be your boss.

95
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,929
-Welcome on board. Really.
-l appreciate.

96
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:54,233
However, you picked a most
delicate matter.

97
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,471
-The 35 hours stuff won't be easy.
-l'm not afraid of that.

98
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,979
You know the company.
From the outside, maybe.

99
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:12,354
That's why l've chosen it.
lt means too much for me.

100
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,189
l grew up at the shadow of the company.

101
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,264
My father's been working
here for more than 30 years.

102
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,060
My sister works here.

103
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,002
l used to spend my holidays
at the company's kid club.

104
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,970
ln Christmas...

105
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:32,032
From the inside, things don't
look that perfect.

106
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,339
Surely you've heard that.

107
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,882
Last year, we had to dismiss
22 workers.

108
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:42,716
lt was hard.
lt was not an easy thing to do.

109
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:47,259
Today, business are doing good,
things have improved.

110
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,424
And they want the 35 hours.

111
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,795
They say it's good for employment
and competitiveness.

112
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,266
How? No one knows.

113
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,066
There will be no new jobs here.

114
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,506
-Our balance, is very uncertain.
-Stop it, Chambon.

115
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,478
Don't get him be scared
about that uncertain balance.

116
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,244
-This is Frank Verdeau, our new
intern employee. -Don't stand up.

117
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,717
Did l disturbed you?

118
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,380
We were talking about
the 35 hours a week.

119
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,925
-Very interesting. What's your opinion?
-What do l think?

120
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,553
l like to see my collaborators
have convictions.

121
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,291
This is a broad subject.

122
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,835
You can expose it from various angles--

123
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:36,203
From an economic point of view,
or in terms of social perspectives.

124
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,641
Forget about books.
l'm sure that you know the lesson.

125
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,837
Personally, what do you make of it?

126
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:46,652
l don't want to scare you, l know
that some businessmen oppose to it.

127
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,143
Now, there's hardly a thing
that could scare me.

128
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,855
l'm persuaded that the 35 hours a
week are an important challenge...

129
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:00,458
because they will change our
perspective on certain concepts...

130
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,830
that had never been questioned.

131
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,460
-ls this a message?
-No way.

132
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,301
l hope that negotiations
on work hours...

133
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,003
will respond to the worker's
opinion about the company.

134
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,484
lt would be interesting
if they had some of the responsibility.

135
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,488
That's not an easy thing to do.
lt would be a real mess

136
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,559
l never said it would be easy.

137
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,256
Work hours have to be
organized globally.

138
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,355
Less but better work will be done.

139
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,798
l find it a real challenge.

140
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,133
lt's exciting, because nothing
has been said.

141
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,140
Perfect. We play and we win together.

142
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,489
Look. My brother is real handsome.

143
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,928
How is it going?

144
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,639
Anyway, have a nice day.

145
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,280
You never said you had
a brilliant son.

146
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,151
-l didn't have the chance to talk to you.
-Don't be so humble.

147
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,919
lt's got merits, because you studied
quite a lot. But this is not usual.

148
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:13,120
Don't be humble. Congratulations!
Really.

149
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,496
-Thank you, Mr. Rouet.
-Good job.

150
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,126
Go on working.
We are busy, as well.

151
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,764
Have a good day. Bye.
Come on.

152
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,075
-What did you do today?
-Not much. lt was the first day.

153
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,277
-Did you work?
-l didn't have time.

154
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,085
l put my things on my desk,
l organized it.

155
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,353
-You got a desk for you?
-Sure.

156
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,588
That's not fancy.

157
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:48,792
Also, l had lunch at the canteen.
Not bad, uh, dad?

158
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:53,864
l was supposed to go with the boss,
but he had lunch with a supplier.

159
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,533
With that much eating,
he's overweight.

160
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,703
He also eats at the canteen.

161
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,714
-l bet you he doesn't do it often.
-Sometimes.

162
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,512
One day, you will have to eat
with suppliers, also.

163
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,145
And you'll be overweight, also.

164
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:15,716
-Who did you eat with?
-Businessmen. Most boring.

165
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,353
They look sinister.
They aren't bright, either.

166
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,193
Who do you think you are?

167
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,633
No one. l'll eat with you tomorrow.
That's funnier.

168
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,433
Don't do that.
You have to win their respect.

169
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,374
lf you eat with us,
you mean we're comrades.

170
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,709
Then, at the workshop, they'll say--

171
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,250
''We had fun at noon.''
They won't respect you.

172
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,981
What do you mean?
Can't l eat with my friends?

173
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,354
No. At work, they are your employees.

174
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,121
l'm not an employee.
l'm just doing an internship.

175
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,288
Yes. You have to give orders.

176
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,299
Being comrades is not good
when you mean being respected.

177
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,427
Leave him alone,
you're always teaching him lessons.

178
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,971
-How are you, Francois?
-Hi, Frank. lt's been so long!

179
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,949
This is Christian.

180
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,717
-You didn't call.
-l've been to the plant.

181
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:22,260
Christian works there.
They say you got a nice suit.

182
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,159
-Yes, l do.
-Are you coming to the café?

183
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:29,860
Sure, of course.
Mom, l'm going out with Francois.

184
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,596
You may say hi to me.
How are you?

185
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:44,549
-You want something to drink?
-We're leaving now. Next time.

186
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:53,381
-How long it's been since we last saw?
-l came here for Christmas.

187
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,892
Long ago.
Where do you work?

188
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,588
-Personnel Bureau.
-? With the ''cop''?

189
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,097
No, with Chambon.

190
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,864
-Advise about the 35 hours?
-l don't give advise. l'm being trained.

191
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,667
l don't believe it could work.
We'll have to work faster.

192
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,871
l'd rather work more
and have a bigger salary.

193
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,380
What is your internship about?

194
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:22,286
Assessment of the economic needs,
for the 35 hours a week.

195
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,784
l don't believe you're interested.

196
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,588
Because we're too ignorant
to understand it.

197
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,529
-l didn't say that.
-You didn't, but you thought it.

198
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,205
Before l begin, l want to
introduce you to Frank.

199
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,711
For those you don't know him,
he's a brilliant student...

200
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:26,717
doing his summer training.
He's Jean-Claude's son, also.

201
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:30,276
l'm proud to have him among us.

202
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,448
That's no merit of yours.

203
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,025
-Not yours, either.
-We'll see.

204
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,790
Let's have a good start to the meeting.

205
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:43,334
Does anyone objects to Frank
being here?

206
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,428
No? Everyone agrees.
Let's start.

207
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:54,201
As you read in the memo,
this month we had...

208
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,340
profit. This looks encouraging.

209
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:05,215
However, we are still uncertain.
We can't say victory, yet.

210
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,588
The same old song.

211
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,390
We make sacrifices on bad times
and on good times.

212
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,657
There's no change.

213
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,895
We are here to discuss about the 35
hours and a quick execution.

214
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:22,770
Don't make me laugh. You've been
interfering for month.

215
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,273
You lie.

216
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:29,404
Listen. As l said,
our situation is uncertain.

217
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:34,110
The 35 hours will be expensive.
Subsidies won't be enough.

218
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,313
lt's clear that we'll make an effort.

219
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,755
You too.

220
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,796
You decided to ask and reply by yourself,
but we know your point.

221
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:51,893
You use the 35 to deprive the workers
of their rights.

222
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,837
-We won't let you.
-We know your position.

223
00:22:55,941 --> 00:23:01,311
''Less work, more money.''
Let's follow the order of the day.

224
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:06,214
-There might be other opinions.
-Don't try to split us. We are together.

225
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:12,086
There'll be no more sacrifices,
after last year's dismissals.

226
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,853
-We were lucky to do those.
-Lucky?

227
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,192
Or else, we would have to close-down.

228
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,995
l was waiting for that.
''Close-down''. The same old song.

229
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,627
l'm going to sing it again. Really.

230
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:31,937
The group that owns the plant
had enormous benefits.

231
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,978
With children working in Korea.

232
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,540
That's madness! See your doctor.
Lady, take your pills.

233
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,915
You just want to piss me off.

234
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,081
That's it! You start the meeting
with my dear lady.

235
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:51,254
And, now, vulgarity.
l'd rather listen to your real nature.

236
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:56,529
What she's saying, in her own way, is--
the union representatives...

237
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,297
are happy about these negotiations.

238
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,536
We are for the 35 hours a week...

239
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,874
providing there will be
new jobs...

240
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,345
and work conditions will improve.

241
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,852
At least, my opinion is more
reasonable than yours.

242
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,946
That's what l feel. The 35 hours
must create new jobs.

243
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,993
We can't lose those things
we worked so hard to achieve.

244
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:27,554
Once again, this shows how
retrograde French unions are.

245
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,568
You can't get to see
that the worker...

246
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,002
wants the company to be successful.

247
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,438
-You want us to become capitalists?
-Not in my dreams. That'd be great.

248
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:41,569
Let's see the order of the day.

249
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:01,955
Frank, come and sit with us.

250
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:18,275
No offence, but your reports
are confuse.

251
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,476
Don't play the know-nothing guy.

252
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,521
We fall sleep at the second paragraph.

253
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:29,720
Those 35 hours would be great. Or 39.
l worked for a whole weekend.

254
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:34,765
-You want a medal?
-No, but this is real. lt's hard.

255
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,427
This won't ruin my ski week.

256
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:43,804
Will you rent the same appartment?

257
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,935
-No. Very small and expensive. Not good.
-You got snow?

258
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,674
l hope so, after the avalanches.

259
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,977
You ski?

260
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:01,618
Who would believe that?
There'll be no new jobs.

261
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,924
They'll use the 35 hours
to put down rises.

262
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,865
l'm not for that, but in order to
globalize you got to make sacrifices.

263
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,062
lf we don't get together,
we'll be lost.

264
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,836
You know my son,
he's doing an internship.

265
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:23,404
You say hi to me, now? During
the meeting, l seemed to be invisible.

266
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:27,508
l'm sorry, l didn't mean that.

267
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,645
lt seemed to me you chose
the side you'll be on.

268
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,747
Your studies make you feel important.

269
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,593
-What did l do?
-Nothing.

270
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:41,257
During the meeting, you wrote down
everything the boss was saying...

271
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,894
as a good assistant. Whenever l
said something, you wrote nothing.

272
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:50,907
-You are wrong, you can see my notes.
-Don't be condescending to me.

273
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:56,777
l'm not condescending. l tried
to introduce myself and you were rude.

274
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:02,080
-Leave it alone.
-A chip off the old bloke.

275
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:07,056
Tell them about Rouet.
You have to make sacrifices.

276
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:11,458
-There it goes once again.
-Be brave and tell them.

277
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:17,991
The law calls for negotiations.
You will defend your interests.

278
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,062
These are no negotiations,
these are fights.

279
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:27,236
You know where they are now?
They are seeing how to piss us.

280
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,939
You knew that? Tell them.

281
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:36,317
l wear a suit, l work at the offices,
so l'm the enemy for you.

282
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:41,654
l believe that 35 hours a week
are good for all.

283
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:50,967
This is all bullshit,
l know it by heart.

284
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,165
But let me tell you who you are,
because maybe you don't know.

285
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:59,767
You're a social climber.
You'll be a boss, like them.

286
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,575
You're doing good.
Great. Congratulations.

287
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,879
But l'm leaving because
l can't stand it.

288
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,612
You don't have to pay attention.
Just beware of her.

289
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,191
-l know what l've got to do.
-She's fussy.

290
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:18,228
-What are you laughing at?
-Nothing.

291
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,072
-Can l pick you up?
-Yes, please.

292
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,942
-Where to?
-After the crossing.

293
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,283
You had your baptism of fire
with the union representative.

294
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,252
-She's a real character!
-Dangerous.

295
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:54,917
Communists play the clowns,
but they are mean.

296
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,223
Now, she is a pain in my ass.

297
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:04,728
l believe she's isolated,
they don't listen to her.

298
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:09,796
lt's easy for her. She knows
that we have to reach an agreement soon.

299
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:17,305
That reminds me of a case
we studied this year.

300
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,976
The company was similar to yours.

301
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:26,456
The unions were interfering
with the negotiations...

302
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,425
on the 35 hours a week.

303
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,520
Then, the director
had an interesting idea.

304
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:38,000
He called an employees' referendum
about the subject.

305
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,662
That's very good.

306
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:44,105
The union didn't take part
in the referendum.

307
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,006
-Risky.
-Results showed...

308
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,638
that what the unions were asking
was not representative...

309
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,444
of the worker's expectations.

310
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,715
Above all, the union's point
of view...

311
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,916
was more political than pragmatic.

312
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:05,018
Their point was so indefensible...

313
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,927
that they had to sit down
and negotiate.

314
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,235
Very interesting.

315
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,005
On the other side.

316
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,583
l see you tomorrow.

317
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,512
-What size are you?
-Why?

318
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:36,993
For you safe jacket. Mrs. Arnoux
will never forgive you.

319
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,195
-l'll avoid a direct hit.
-Be much careful.

320
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,828
-Then, you're not convinced.
-That's not what l said.

321
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,196
You mentioned it very fast.

322
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,759
ln general terms, l agree
with the referendum.

323
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,739
-But then--
-Lst's not risk too much.

324
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:29,245
-l'd like to believe that.
-lt will take a long time.

325
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,316
lt's my time.

326
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:36,353
l'm with you, but l don't
find it an effective move.

327
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,153
We've already talked too much.
We lost a lot of time.

328
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,922
When you have something to suggest,
come and see me.

329
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:50,331
-l didn't mean to go over your head.
-Sure.

330
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:54,462
We were just talking, l suggested it.
That's all.

331
00:32:54,572 --> 00:33:00,568
ln any company, you like it or not,
you have to follow the hierarchy.

332
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,875
Now, let's drop it.
We won't mention it any more.

333
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:08,612
You write down the questions
and we'll see what to do, right?

334
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,251
Show me.

335
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:34,840
-Speak up, l don't mind.
-We don't want to bother you.

336
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:38,436
l'm used to working
with some noise.

337
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:48,654
-l need a coffee break.
-l'll make some.

338
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:50,282
Thank you, mom.

339
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:55,255
Dad, can l ask you something?

340
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:07,908
l've got a questionnaire
to be responded by the personnel.

341
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,275
So as to know what you think
about the 35 hours a week.

342
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:16,443
-What do you make of globalization?
-What is globalization?

343
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:21,421
When you consider the hours worked
per year, on a whole.

344
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:27,328
According to different periods, some
weeks you'll work 5 to 6 days...

345
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:32,629
and, others, just 2 to 3 days,
according to demands and inventories.

346
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:38,867
We'll work 6 days per a week
and 3 days per another?

347
00:34:39,008 --> 00:34:43,877
-For instance.
-Without notice?

348
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:48,575
l believe so.
We didn't talk about details...

349
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:50,914
but that's the idea.

350
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:56,390
-lt's not periodic.
-lt's less monotonous.

351
00:34:58,194 --> 00:35:01,823
l don't find it monotonous now.

352
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:07,392
-lt's good when you don't do
the same always. -l don't know.

353
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:13,764
Anyway, tell me what do you think,
because that's the questionnaire for.

354
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:21,007
l don't have to answer. Besides,
l don't know what's best for me.

355
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:26,180
For you? For your life?
What would you have?

356
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,052
There is no difference.

357
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:32,287
Time at work will be reduced,
that's enough progress.

358
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:36,059
l won't trust them anyway.

359
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:53,105
Jean-Claude, there's a rumor
in the company.

360
00:35:53,215 --> 00:35:55,308
Didn't you hear?

361
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:59,445
lt seems that Frank is writing
down a questionnaire. ls it true?

362
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:02,922
He doesn't tell me everything.

363
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:04,889
He's got a job, a responsibility.

364
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:08,794
lf one day you don't
feel so proud about your son...

365
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:12,891
tell him that he doesn't have to
ask the workers. That's the union's job.

366
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:18,098
Tell him that a questionnaire
made up by the bureau...

367
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:20,437
has no value.

368
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:22,977
Did you hear me?

369
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:41,663
-What is this?
-Out of the way.

370
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:49,703
-You know why we are here.
-Let's talk.

371
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,297
About what? When everything is done?
You need support?

372
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:59,608
The man of the case.

373
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,045
Hi.

374
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:06,053
Let me remind you that you have
no right to organize...

375
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:09,352
negotiations without the union.

376
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:13,724
What negotiations? Let me tell you
this is just a questionnaire.

377
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:19,426
We won't take part.
The referendum is ilegal!

378
00:37:19,535 --> 00:37:22,834
Calm down, please.
lt's perfectly legal.

379
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:26,897
lt has nothing to do with negotiations.
lt's base work.

380
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:30,467
As part of my training, and under
the responsibility of the bureau...

381
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:34,879
l am organizing a questionnaire and
l would like your cooperation.

382
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,353
No way.
l wasn't born yesterday.

383
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:42,481
You know what's all this?
lt's a low trick.

384
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:47,392
Of course not. lt's an initiative
of the bureau, you take it or leave it.

385
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:50,522
lt means we are not isolated.

386
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:53,466
Don't use words you don't know.

387
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:57,835
You can't oppose to the bureau
wanting to hear the workers.

388
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,741
Don't use an innocent voice.
The referendum is illegal.

389
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:07,976
We won't take part,
l'll call for a boycott.

390
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:12,577
And that questionnaire
will have no meaning at all.

391
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:16,089
We've already lost a lot of time.
l lost my time.

392
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:18,716
l know what l have to do. Bye.

393
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:27,533
Let's talk more calmly.
Won't you sit down?

394
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:37,302
l believe we need to talk calmly.

395
00:38:37,913 --> 00:38:41,940
l want to make clear
that this questionnaire is legal.

396
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:46,183
lt doesn't stand against negotiations.

397
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:50,384
lt wasn't intended for that.
l promise.

398
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:53,621
-What do you warrantee?
-Nothing.

399
00:38:56,432 --> 00:39:01,267
l give you my word that it will
be organized with total transparency.

400
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:06,034
We will be watching.
We won't swallow anything.

401
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:10,168
l hope so. l won't let you
swallow anything.

402
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:14,340
l just wish to have the chance
to work with you.

403
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:23,986
Congratulations, Frank. You use
diplomacy, you got ideas, focus.

404
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:29,121
Good job. Arnoux is isolated.
She's gone.

405
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:33,667
The others stayed. They are cracked.
You did what we couldn't do.

406
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:37,899
l hope you don't believe this
was just an strategy.

407
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:42,910
My work is just beginning.
l hope l'll get much more...

408
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:48,211
than the elimination of Mrs. Arnoux.
We need to talk.

409
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:52,219
-That's what we need.
-Don't mock at me.

410
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:55,154
l'm not mocking at you.
You're moving on a tightrope.

411
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:59,920
We need a very balanced questionnaire.

412
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:04,728
And it has to look as
if your opinion were important...

413
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:09,167
without raising false expectations
that we won't be fulfilling.

414
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:13,638
-l'll keep that in mind.
-Alright. l let you work.

415
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:23,683
That girl, Julie.
You are dating her?

416
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:26,277
-Once in a while.
-What does it mean?

417
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:29,221
-lt's not something steady.
-What a pity. She's nice.

418
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,919
How about Paris? Do you go out?

419
00:40:34,897 --> 00:40:37,388
-Yes, of course.
-Where do you go?

420
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:41,799
Nowhere in particular.
l have to study a lot.

421
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:45,601
How can you live in Paris?
When you're on vacations, maybe--

422
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,769
The traffic, the people,
you can't live there.

423
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:53,746
-That's nothing new.
-Typical parisiene. You mock at the rest.

424
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:57,478
l'm not mocking at you,
but you're saying bullshit...

425
00:40:57,586 --> 00:41:00,612
-pretending to be an stupid countryman.
-Stop playing a bloody snob.

426
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:05,189
What is the matter?
Success did something to your head?

427
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:12,059
Go to hell! l'm losing my time
with you. l don't owe you anything.

428
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,828
!You're no boss here.

429
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:19,033
l have nothing to do with the boss
or the workers.

430
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:44,623
-He's not up already?
-He came back late. Let him rest.

431
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:47,201
Sure, he needs some sleep.

432
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:57,838
-Wake up, it's noon.
-Leave me alone.

433
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,546
Nice picture.

434
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:40,243
-What do you do when l'm not here?
-l do it alone.

435
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:07,575
All your questions are about leisure
time. How much time do you use...?

436
00:44:07,676 --> 00:44:12,340
What part of your budget...?
What do we care?

437
00:44:12,447 --> 00:44:16,645
lf you mean worktime reduction,
you have to mention that.

438
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:19,744
We need simple questions
with clear responses.

439
00:44:19,855 --> 00:44:23,985
We need results that can be
translated into statistics.

440
00:44:24,092 --> 00:44:28,688
You want a multiple choice?
You get nothing if you don't suggest it.

441
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:32,426
They won't have brilliant ideas.

442
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:37,834
You'll get common places
that have nothing to do. lt's natural.

443
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:43,139
l can imagine them. A white sheet
of paper will intimidate them.

444
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:49,079
With a little bit of work,
we can modify your questionnaire.

445
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:54,453
What do you expect to get
by labor hour reduction?

446
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:56,420
Make it simpler.

447
00:44:56,525 --> 00:45:01,224
The 35 hours a week... what for?

448
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,766
Then, you suggest three answers.

449
00:45:06,368 --> 00:45:12,102
Fighting against unemployment.
lt's unclear, but it sounds positive.

450
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:15,199
Then, we suggest education.

451
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:21,878
-May l come in?
-Of course.

452
00:45:21,984 --> 00:45:24,817
Could you leave us alone?

453
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:29,786
This is what we'll do.

454
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:08,558
'' Before implementing
the 35 hours a wee...

455
00:46:08,697 --> 00:46:13,430
the bureau wishes to consult
with the whole personnel.

456
00:46:13,535 --> 00:46:16,868
As part of his training,
Frank Verdeau will hand out...

457
00:46:16,972 --> 00:46:19,600
a questionnaire on Friday.''

458
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,608
The Bureau.

459
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:33,582
You got 15 minutes at the canteen...

460
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:47,062
Cut it out. Go to the canteen and
fill in the questionnaire. Quick.

461
00:46:56,278 --> 00:46:59,839
Here's the questionnaire.
Do you have a pen?

462
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:09,513
-What do we do now?
-Read it, and mark what you chose.

463
00:47:10,892 --> 00:47:14,419
Don't hesitate to comment on it.

464
00:47:15,831 --> 00:47:20,029
-Call me if you need me.
-lt's alright. Thank you.

465
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:28,907
Don't fill in the questionnaire.
lt means sure unemployment.

466
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:32,037
You'll see. Later, you'll be complaining.

467
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:47,120
Hi, Jean-Claude. Hi, Alain.

468
00:47:49,798 --> 00:47:52,096
Come and sit here. Alain,
in front of him.

469
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:59,265
lf you need any help, don't hesitate
to ask me.

470
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,771
Hi, Mr. Rouet.

471
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,747
-What do you make of it?
-lt's alright.

472
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,795
Good job, Frank.

473
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:05,063
The bureau and some members of the
union are glad.

474
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:07,368
lt's a real success.

475
00:49:07,476 --> 00:49:10,343
People understood the logic
of the process.

476
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:16,210
What are you planning to do when
you graduate, next year?

477
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,187
-l'm not sure.
-l don't want to make false promises...

478
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:25,783
...but l could refer you...

479
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:29,295
to one of the companies of the group.

480
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:32,491
-Unless you had other plans.
-Nothing sure.

481
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:37,163
Alright. We will have enough time
to talk, later on.

482
00:49:37,272 --> 00:49:40,571
For next Monday's meeting,
l'd like you to prepare...

483
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:44,975
-a briefing of the preliminary results.
-No problem.

484
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,447
Have a nice weekend
and don't work too much.

485
00:50:06,134 --> 00:50:10,195
-You need help?
-l don't want to answer your quest.

486
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:14,573
lt's important for you.

487
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:20,037
Since they ask your opinion.

488
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,949
-l don't believe in that.
-That's your lookout.

489
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:48,869
l buy your dinner. Everything
worked out fine.

490
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:53,641
l'm glad for you.
l don't need to go to a restaurant.

491
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:58,685
Don't argue with me. l'll take you out.
l'll call and tell mom.

492
00:50:58,787 --> 00:51:01,415
See you later.

493
00:51:15,604 --> 00:51:18,767
-Where are you going?
-Easy, Betty.

494
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:26,077
-You won't stay there.
-l desperately need a PC.

495
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:31,141
That's a private PC.
You'll get into trouble.

496
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:35,087
Me too.
He doesn't like you.

497
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,591
He'll say nothing,
l'm doing a job for the boss.

498
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:48,132
-You are scared, aren't you?
-Yes, l'm scared.

499
00:51:48,236 --> 00:51:52,172
And you have nothing to lose.

500
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,645
What are you doing?

501
00:52:13,094 --> 00:52:16,222
-You won't be sneaking around.
-Did you write this letter?

502
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:21,098
Not at all. Close that file,
turn off the PC.

503
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:26,834
Wait, this is serious.
They are dismissing 12 employees.

504
00:52:30,512 --> 00:52:33,447
lncluding your father?

505
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,582
Did they tell you?

506
00:52:54,769 --> 00:52:59,206
You know what? The chief of Personnel
wants me to change my task.

507
00:53:00,308 --> 00:53:04,005
-He's giving me a lighter job.
-When did he say that?

508
00:53:04,112 --> 00:53:10,381
This afternoon. He says that the
workshop is too hard for an old man.

509
00:53:12,153 --> 00:53:16,089
-l should do something lighter.
-What did you say?

510
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:22,562
You know me, l said no.
Can you imagine me doing Q.C.?

511
00:53:22,664 --> 00:53:26,566
Don't shout out.
Everybody is watching you.

512
00:53:26,668 --> 00:53:29,967
You are exaggerating. Relax.

513
00:53:31,406 --> 00:53:35,103
You're no example of a calm person.

514
00:53:36,144 --> 00:53:39,272
Alright, let's have a toast.

515
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,977
-For your success.
-For my son.

516
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:59,566
The boss is a good person.
He saw that you are valuable.

517
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:02,534
lf he trust in you,
he'll offer you a job.

518
00:54:02,637 --> 00:54:05,765
The boss is no social security agent.

519
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,773
He recognized your capacity,
what you can give to the company.

520
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:15,282
-He's no saint, you know.
-Are you here to dine or to argue?

521
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:21,112
-lt's good.
-Of course it's good.

522
00:54:24,025 --> 00:54:27,893
Did you grade my test?

523
00:54:29,764 --> 00:54:35,725
lt was no test. lt was a questionnaire,
there was nothing to grade.

524
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:40,570
About globalization-- The answer is
wrong. lt wasn't clear.

525
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:43,774
l didn't understand.

526
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:50,614
That's story about hours, you know,
scale hours.

527
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:55,781
-l wasn't sure.
-Could you change the subject?

528
00:54:56,357 --> 00:54:58,825
Stop talking about work.

529
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,324
Let him rest. He worked all day long.

530
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:14,603
The bill, please.

531
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:26,449
l pay. l invited you over.
All right?

532
00:55:26,554 --> 00:55:30,183
You didn't get your salary,
you got enough debts.

533
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:35,354
lt's a loan, it's no debt. lf l
need more money, the bank will give me.

534
00:55:35,463 --> 00:55:37,863
As l said, you got debts.

535
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:41,163
lf you can borrow 70,000 francs
from the bank, for your studies...

536
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:45,535
...it means that students
are a good investment.

537
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,905
lt's for your studies,
it's not for celebrations.

538
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:53,538
-He'll be glad to pay.
-But l invited you over.

539
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:13,659
-l'm going downtown.
-lt's late. Come home and sleep.

540
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:17,329
-Mom, please.
-Don't be late.

541
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:46,732
Will you let me?

542
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:52,495
-Anything to drink?
-Two beers, please.

543
00:56:54,475 --> 00:56:57,137
Henri, two beers, please.

544
00:56:57,979 --> 00:57:02,643
l won't bother you much. l'm sorry
about this morning. l was rude.

545
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,275
There was no need to respond.

546
00:57:05,386 --> 00:57:08,583
Don't think l'm not interested
in my job.

547
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,158
l care a lot.

548
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,055
l thought you didn't wanted
to know about it.

549
00:57:14,162 --> 00:57:19,031
What? l work there every day.
l spend half of my life there.

550
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:24,002
Here, we can talk all you want.
l can die talking.

551
00:57:24,105 --> 00:57:27,233
But filling in a questionnaire
for the boss-- No, thanks.

552
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:31,004
Let's not talk about that questionnaire.

553
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:35,742
l just wanted to talk to you.

554
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:45,253
You know, l like your father.
lt's been four years since l'm there.

555
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:48,226
We work with the same machine.

556
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:51,129
We don't talk much,
but l like him.

557
00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:57,096
lt may sound silly, but the plant
is no dream come true.

558
00:57:57,205 --> 00:58:02,233
You don't say, ''l do holes on
a plaque the whole day long.''

559
00:58:02,443 --> 00:58:06,004
''That's great.'' No one will say that.

560
00:58:06,347 --> 00:58:09,111
But life is so.

561
00:58:09,217 --> 00:58:12,880
lt's hard to go there every day.

562
00:58:12,987 --> 00:58:18,084
My first day in the plant, when
l saw everyone in blue...

563
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:21,389
with grease stains, the back leaning
onto the machines...

564
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:26,433
with all that noise, l said,
''This is hell''.

565
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:30,971
l just wanted to leave. Then, the boss
put me in front of a machine.

566
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:36,476
He said go on.
Really, l knew nothing.

567
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:40,675
Your father was on the other side.

568
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:44,149
He saw me. He saw l was lost.

569
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:47,688
He came to help me.

570
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:52,216
Sometimes, without noticing, l watch him.

571
00:58:52,326 --> 00:58:56,490
Not for the same reason, because
now l work with my eyes closed.

572
00:58:56,597 --> 00:59:00,089
lt's just to see him satisfied.

573
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:02,135
Her spirit helps me
overcome my job.

574
00:59:02,236 --> 00:59:06,570
lt's alright. He cheers you up
and you stand by him. Alright.

575
00:59:06,674 --> 00:59:10,633
-Say thank you to your boss.
-l thank no one.

576
00:59:10,745 --> 00:59:13,680
What l told you
is about most people's lives.

577
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:18,309
lf you can improve it, that's fine.
Meanwhile, you have to bear it.

578
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,875
-What's wrong?
-l don't want you in.

579
01:00:25,052 --> 01:00:27,782
l'm in from the beginning.
l'm part of it.

580
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:31,689
Don't push me. The bosses are here.

581
01:00:31,793 --> 01:00:35,889
-What if l push?
-You're not part of the company.

582
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:40,001
l saw your briefing on my desk.
lt's clear. Detailed.

583
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:43,562
l'll hand it.
You can go now.

584
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:58,308
-May l talk to Alain?
-Now? l'll go and find him.

585
01:01:24,979 --> 01:01:29,882
You got the authority. You can
get me out whenever you like.

586
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:36,619
Where are we going?

587
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:41,186
What's wrong?

588
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:46,097
l hid something from you.

589
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:50,269
Don't say a word.
l'm not supposed to know.

590
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:57,143
l read a confidential document.
Addressed to the Employment Bureau.

591
01:02:00,214 --> 01:02:02,910
They will dismiss 12 employees.

592
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:09,789
The boss is now happily
announcing...

593
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:13,884
that thanks to those 35 hours
a week, he can do as he likes.

594
01:02:13,995 --> 01:02:17,692
He wants to modernize with robots.

595
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:24,502
-Shit!
-Don't worry, you stay.

596
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:28,032
You won't be fired, you stay.

597
01:02:28,175 --> 01:02:31,975
You're too young and your salary
is not high.

598
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:36,844
You stay, then.

599
01:02:39,353 --> 01:02:41,651
But they'll fire my father.

600
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:53,094
l'm so glad to be here together
and celebrate your marriage.

601
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:58,935
As you can see, in this opportunity,
the directors are here.

602
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,500
We are lucky.
l'll just say a few words.

603
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:08,048
l'd like you to take this present
from us.

604
01:03:08,182 --> 01:03:13,643
l hope you'll send us a postcard
from Morocco.

605
01:03:13,754 --> 01:03:16,018
l promise.

606
01:03:24,398 --> 01:03:28,198
Congratulations-- Have a nice trip.

607
01:03:28,302 --> 01:03:31,931
-This is a surprise.
-You deserve it.

608
01:03:43,617 --> 01:03:44,845
My very best wishes.

609
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,451
Come and drink with us.

610
01:03:48,556 --> 01:03:50,114
This is Frank.

611
01:03:52,693 --> 01:03:56,390
He's mad, because l wouldn't let
him into the meeting room this morning.

612
01:03:56,497 --> 01:03:59,728
But here we got a brilliant young man.

613
01:03:59,834 --> 01:04:02,803
-Great potential.
-Totally.

614
01:04:03,904 --> 01:04:07,499
l'll be glad to refer him
for a job.

615
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:09,576
-We got to talk.
-Now?

616
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:15,305
This is kidnapping. lf l don't come
back right away, you call the police.

617
01:04:21,389 --> 01:04:23,380
What's up?

618
01:04:23,491 --> 01:04:26,426
You can keep that job offer of yours.

619
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:29,155
l hate the way you act.
There's always a double message.

620
01:04:29,296 --> 01:04:32,663
Smiling to all during the referendum.

621
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,931
Letting the union out was your idea.

622
01:04:37,038 --> 01:04:41,600
You had to push it to the end.
The referendum was a preparation...

623
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:45,338
for negotiations. You used that
information to lay a tramp.

624
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:49,780
Let me finish. My referendum
gave you the right excuse.

625
01:04:50,951 --> 01:04:55,718
lt takes courage for a negotiation.
You don't have it.

626
01:04:55,823 --> 01:04:59,418
Coward! When you have power
you have to take it...

627
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:03,987
instead of plotting.
-What are you talking about?

628
01:05:04,098 --> 01:05:09,502
Enough. l know about the dismissals,
the close-down of welds, all of it.

629
01:05:13,874 --> 01:05:15,739
Who told you?

630
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:20,236
l just know it. You don't have
an hermetic office.

631
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:24,579
Everything can be know.
l know who will be dismissed.

632
01:05:24,685 --> 01:05:28,985
Your father. That's why l didn't
let you into that room.

633
01:05:29,757 --> 01:05:33,318
l'm developing a retirement plan,
l will not fire him.

634
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:37,386
lt's not just about my father,
that would be easy.

635
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:41,366
Don't be an arrogant. You'll soon
run a company like this one.

636
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:46,202
You'll make the same decisions.
That's what bosses do.

637
01:05:46,373 --> 01:05:51,572
Now, you got vital information.

638
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:53,772
Be responsible.

639
01:05:53,881 --> 01:05:59,183
As a friend, l beg you
don't do anything.

640
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:30,476
What are you doing here?

641
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,719
We'll eat whatever, never mind.

642
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:39,919
We want to be together for a while.

643
01:06:42,196 --> 01:06:45,097
The kids will stay with the neighbors.

644
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,965
We want to go with you.

645
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:52,566
lt's OK.

646
01:06:54,408 --> 01:06:57,172
Alright. We are on our way.

647
01:07:02,483 --> 01:07:06,510
This is the hard one.
Should we tell dad?

648
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,987
Or should we first talk to mom?

649
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,360
What do you make of it?
-l don't know.

650
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:20,867
-What's up?
-Granny will quick job.

651
01:07:23,204 --> 01:07:26,503
Come on! You don't have to be
so depressed.

652
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:30,805
-That job was killing him.
-You don't know what you say.

653
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:33,846
-What if you lost your job?
-Better off!

654
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:38,017
l wonder how could he endure
30 years in that job.

655
01:07:38,118 --> 01:07:40,348
He will take a holiday.

656
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:43,388
Stop it, this is family business.

657
01:07:48,162 --> 01:07:49,891
lt's good to see you!

658
01:07:50,698 --> 01:07:54,862
Once a week is not enough.
l'd like to see more of you.

659
01:07:54,969 --> 01:07:57,563
What did you do for diner?

660
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:02,335
You called so late.
l couldn't make a ''couscous''.

661
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:05,444
l can't stand the word
couscous.

662
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,679
We'll have a roasted chicken.

663
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:11,410
lt's chicken or couscous in this house.

664
01:08:16,824 --> 01:08:18,655
Careful with that.

665
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:22,422
-This is your third.
-That's right.

666
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:26,556
-How did it go this morning?
-Quite well.

667
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:33,072
You had to brief them this morning.
What did the boss say?

668
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:38,076
He offered me a job.
-Formidable. Why didn't you tell me?

669
01:08:38,178 --> 01:08:40,806
-Let's have another bottle.
-No way.

670
01:08:40,914 --> 01:08:42,779
They hire me, they fire you.

671
01:08:48,222 --> 01:08:51,453
What do you mean?

672
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:56,252
They are taking out the machine, and you.

673
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:01,428
You're old. lt's over. They fire you.

674
01:09:05,539 --> 01:09:08,940
Look, dad. Nothing lasts for ever.

675
01:09:11,245 --> 01:09:16,478
lt had to end one day. You'll do some
gardening, you'll make your furniture.

676
01:09:17,718 --> 01:09:21,449
We could go out, do things together.

677
01:09:23,123 --> 01:09:30,188
You say you don't see your grandchildren.
You could pick them at school.

678
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:34,797
Frank, are you listening to yourself?

679
01:09:34,902 --> 01:09:39,635
He spent 30 years of his life there.
And now they fire him?

680
01:09:40,941 --> 01:09:43,603
lt's alright. Great.

681
01:09:43,711 --> 01:09:48,614
You could do this or that.
This is an outrage!

682
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:51,844
-Not now, Olivier.
-Then, when?

683
01:09:51,952 --> 01:09:54,750
This is what your idiotic
liberalism does.

684
01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:57,050
They didn't teach you that at school.

685
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:02,892
Look into my eyes.

686
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:06,830
You think your father will be happy?

687
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:10,501
No, it doesn't make him happy.

688
01:10:15,743 --> 01:10:17,734
l'll call Arnoux.

689
01:10:22,816 --> 01:10:26,582
l'm sorry about your father,
it's the same old song.

690
01:10:26,687 --> 01:10:29,178
They wake up when
it's their personal history.

691
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:30,722
l apologize.

692
01:10:30,824 --> 01:10:34,954
l'm glad that you have a more
realistic view now.

693
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:37,792
Now you know he's a moron.

694
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:42,796
Where did you learn that?
ls it a rumor?

695
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:47,169
-A document l read.
-A document proving that...

696
01:10:47,274 --> 01:10:49,265
Sure. lt's an official letter.

697
01:10:49,376 --> 01:10:54,336
What do you want from me?
The union's credibility is null.

698
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:59,613
You made me look like crazy.
How could l address the people?

699
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,123
What do you need? l'm ready
to compromise.

700
01:11:05,793 --> 01:11:07,727
Where is that letter?

701
01:11:07,828 --> 01:11:10,820
ln the Chief of Personnel's PC.

702
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:15,595
We could do something about the letter.
You know what you're risking?

703
01:11:16,703 --> 01:11:20,139
-l know.
-Your job and your future.

704
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:24,939
Because directors talk to each other.
Believe me.

705
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:28,372
Leave us alone.
Mind your own business.

706
01:11:28,482 --> 01:11:31,178
Get out of here. All of you.

707
01:11:31,285 --> 01:11:34,448
You won't use my home
for union meetings. Out.

708
01:11:54,007 --> 01:11:59,240
-Have a good night sleep.
-Won't you sleep at home?

709
01:11:59,346 --> 01:12:01,871
l'll have a walk, then l'll go
back home.

710
01:12:01,982 --> 01:12:05,918
-Don't argue with dad.
-He'll be asleep when l'm back.

711
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:10,317
Good night.

712
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:08,106
Wait!

713
01:14:38,505 --> 01:14:41,804
Here's your sheet.

714
01:14:45,512 --> 01:14:47,810
Come here.

715
01:14:47,914 --> 01:14:50,644
Give me the other one.

716
01:14:53,553 --> 01:14:56,852
-Did l wake you?
-No. Enzo isn't feeling well.

717
01:14:56,957 --> 01:14:58,788
l'll give him an aspirin.

718
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:01,290
You want to have this one?

719
01:15:10,637 --> 01:15:13,800
-l didn't know you had children.
-Twins.

720
01:15:19,546 --> 01:15:21,878
Theo and Enzo.

721
01:15:28,388 --> 01:15:31,357
-Three ears before retirement.
-Compillo too.

722
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:35,918
Mouloud had two years left
before retirement. Assholes.

723
01:15:45,405 --> 01:15:47,999
You always push it.

724
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:51,906
You have to wait. He doesn't
know what we can do.

725
01:15:53,613 --> 01:15:56,912
Push it now.
The two of us.

726
01:15:59,019 --> 01:16:00,816
He's coming.

727
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:09,653
The letter.
No more dismissals.

728
01:16:12,032 --> 01:16:14,523
You didn't open already?

729
01:16:15,235 --> 01:16:17,931
-What's wrong?
-lt's blocked.

730
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:22,233
l'll open it. l see what's going on.
l'll open the door.

731
01:16:22,342 --> 01:16:25,038
Get out of the way.

732
01:16:27,013 --> 01:16:29,277
You'll see! What does this mean

733
01:16:29,382 --> 01:16:31,680
l'll show you. You'll see.

734
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:46,691
Don't go in! You don't have to!

735
01:16:51,505 --> 01:16:54,531
Five minutes to start working.

736
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:13,491
-Criticize the boss in secret.
-Let's work!

737
01:17:24,237 --> 01:17:27,331
We have to meet tonight. Alright?

738
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,740
-We have to find a place.
-l can manage that.

739
01:17:33,413 --> 01:17:36,382
-The local press?
-l'll contact them.

740
01:17:39,452 --> 01:17:41,852
We have to hand out pamphlets today.

741
01:17:41,955 --> 01:17:45,083
-Could you write it down?
-No problem.

742
01:17:45,192 --> 01:17:48,855
You have to hand them to the
employees before noon.

743
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:52,830
-What are you doing here? Get out.
-We are on a meeting.

744
01:17:52,933 --> 01:17:55,697
-lt's my place.
-lt's ours.

745
01:17:55,802 --> 01:17:58,202
Wait. What is this?

746
01:17:58,305 --> 01:18:04,710
He knows what. We'll fire him.
l will fire him myself.

747
01:18:04,811 --> 01:18:06,802
Who do you think you are?

748
01:18:06,913 --> 01:18:09,438
Don't touch me. You understand?

749
01:18:42,415 --> 01:18:46,909
-Alright. l'm going.
-Go or l'll call the police.

750
01:18:48,121 --> 01:18:51,852
You won't have it your way.

751
01:18:55,128 --> 01:18:59,565
You wanted war and you'll have it.
l assure you.

752
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:04,503
-Go out.
-l'm going.

753
01:19:04,604 --> 01:19:06,299
You're a jerk.

754
01:19:07,207 --> 01:19:10,540
Open that door!

755
01:19:22,856 --> 01:19:24,881
Let's fight!

756
01:19:31,798 --> 01:19:34,665
You have to come today at 8.

757
01:19:35,869 --> 01:19:38,201
Tonight at the gym.

758
01:19:51,217 --> 01:19:53,685
At 8, today.

759
01:19:53,787 --> 01:19:55,755
Go home. He wants to talk to you.

760
01:19:57,190 --> 01:20:00,387
Tonight at 8. We need you.

761
01:20:00,493 --> 01:20:03,257
You have to come tonight.

762
01:20:03,363 --> 01:20:05,126
Tonight at 8.

763
01:21:00,754 --> 01:21:02,221
Leave me alone.

764
01:21:05,658 --> 01:21:10,186
What did you do to your father?
He was destroyed.

765
01:21:11,264 --> 01:21:14,358
He cried like a woman.

766
01:21:14,467 --> 01:21:17,027
l've never seen him like that.

767
01:21:18,772 --> 01:21:20,034
Mom, he has to go on strike.

768
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:23,702
You leave him alone. He won't fight.

769
01:21:24,244 --> 01:21:26,769
You now leave him alone.

770
01:21:27,547 --> 01:21:31,142
You fight for you. For your internship.

771
01:21:32,385 --> 01:21:35,946
lt took five years for him to retire.
lt's not much.

772
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,157
You think it's alright what's going on?

773
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:45,388
What did you get from this?
You were fired too.

774
01:21:45,498 --> 01:21:47,557
Now it's the two of you.

775
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:51,693
-l don't matter.
-Of course you do.

776
01:21:52,038 --> 01:21:57,032
lt's more serious. He can't stand it.

777
01:21:58,344 --> 01:22:03,281
l'll find an internship somewhere else.
l can't stay in this company.

778
01:22:04,951 --> 01:22:10,150
Think of your future. Think of
the sacrifices we did for you.

779
01:22:11,324 --> 01:22:13,884
Think of him.

780
01:22:15,695 --> 01:22:19,961
-You're selfish.
-No, you can't say that.

781
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:29,801
-No won't change him, he's stubborn.
-He has to change.

782
01:22:29,909 --> 01:22:32,639
He has to react, take care.

783
01:22:33,413 --> 01:22:36,644
-You don't have to be so arrogant.
-Yes, you have to be arrogant.

784
01:22:36,749 --> 01:22:41,345
You know it. Tell me that you know it.
That you agree with me.

785
01:22:41,454 --> 01:22:44,548
Help me out, mom.

786
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:52,354
Go and see him. He's in the garage.

787
01:23:38,745 --> 01:23:42,340
Dad, l'm going to the union meeting.
l want you to come.

788
01:24:00,967 --> 01:24:04,869
The plant's operation is
our real strength.

789
01:24:04,971 --> 01:24:08,702
We have to be together, more than ever.

790
01:24:08,808 --> 01:24:13,472
ln three days, we'll block
the whole operation.

791
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:16,515
Won't they close-down the plant, then?

792
01:24:16,616 --> 01:24:22,680
They can't. They have to respond
to their work orders. They need us.

793
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:29,055
lf we go on talking, we'll be in the
same situation as last year.

794
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:33,726
l believe we have to occupy the plant.

795
01:24:37,003 --> 01:24:39,437
Calm down.

796
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:43,270
We've been negotiating.

797
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:48,412
What should we do?
We stay quiet.

798
01:24:48,514 --> 01:24:52,109
We have to do something.
lt's over.

799
01:25:26,586 --> 01:25:28,986
Are you feeling bad?

800
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:34,149
What's wrong with you?

801
01:25:56,716 --> 01:26:00,982
-The right side?
-lt's alright.

802
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:11,193
Did you do some holes on the letters?
-Stretch it.

803
01:26:11,297 --> 01:26:14,289
The wind could turn it down.

804
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:20,236
-Maybe we should fasten it down here.
-lt's OK. l've got it.

805
01:26:52,605 --> 01:26:57,474
-You looking for someone?
-My son. Frank Verdeau.

806
01:26:57,577 --> 01:27:00,011
Frank, you've got visitors.

807
01:27:14,127 --> 01:27:16,960
-How are you, mom?
-l'm fine. And you?

808
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,299
-l brought you some clean clothes.
-Thank you.

809
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:42,517
-Where do you sleep?
-Don't worry.

810
01:27:43,823 --> 01:27:47,919
-You may come home.
-lt would be better if l didn't.

811
01:27:49,896 --> 01:27:55,835
-You're right. You know what you have
to do. -Don't worry about that.

812
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:38,905
Cowards, go on strike.

813
01:29:07,874 --> 01:29:12,038
The plant is closed. We occupied it.

814
01:29:22,388 --> 01:29:25,915
Twelve employees have been dismissed.
You could be on that list.

815
01:29:57,256 --> 01:30:00,384
Don't call me madam.
We are together in this.

816
01:30:00,493 --> 01:30:05,328
Aren't you mad at it? Do you need money?
You're young. She is young, also.

817
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:08,594
Being young is no excuse.

818
01:30:12,572 --> 01:30:18,340
-Look up at them.
-They think they're wise. Come down here!

819
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:29,988
We can do nothing.

820
01:30:36,262 --> 01:30:37,923
Put your tools down.

821
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:55,412
Why are you still working?
You're fired. You hear?

822
01:30:55,514 --> 01:30:59,211
Go on strike with us.

823
01:31:00,152 --> 01:31:05,249
Jean-Claude, stop it. Don't let they fire
you like that. We are here for you.

824
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:08,485
-l asked nothing to no one.
-You never asked anything.

825
01:31:08,594 --> 01:31:12,428
Your children are running risks for you
and you don't do anything.

826
01:31:12,531 --> 01:31:14,897
Go on strike!

827
01:31:35,688 --> 01:31:38,020
Pick it up, pick it up.

828
01:31:40,393 --> 01:31:45,353
You'll always be pathetic.
l'm ashamed of you, you know?

829
01:31:45,464 --> 01:31:49,025
The shame l've been feeling
since l was a kid.

830
01:31:49,135 --> 01:31:52,662
Shame of being the son of a worker.

831
01:31:52,772 --> 01:31:55,900
Shame of being a student,
the son of a worker.

832
01:31:56,008 --> 01:32:00,445
-There is nothing to be ashamed of.
-You tell him. He made me that way.

833
01:32:00,546 --> 01:32:03,709
Shame of his social class!

834
01:32:05,685 --> 01:32:09,416
l've given you a good news.
They won't fire you, you'll retire.

835
01:32:09,522 --> 01:32:12,457
lt's not because you've been
a good worker for 30 years.

836
01:32:12,558 --> 01:32:16,927
This is a favor the boss did to me.

837
01:32:17,029 --> 01:32:20,760
Because he likes me.
We talk as equals.

838
01:32:20,866 --> 01:32:25,496
l don't like that. That.
You know?

839
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:30,941
l know l'm being unfair.
l should be thankful.

840
01:32:31,043 --> 01:32:34,479
l should thank you and mom
for all your sacrifices.

841
01:32:36,882 --> 01:32:40,875
You did it. Your son's on
the capitalists' side.

842
01:32:40,986 --> 01:32:46,686
l'll never be a worker. l'll have
an interesting job. l'll make money.

843
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:50,552
l'll have responsibilities and power.

844
01:32:50,663 --> 01:32:52,597
The power of talking
the way l'm talking to you.

845
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:55,565
The power of dismissing people
the way they do now.

846
01:32:59,205 --> 01:33:03,301
You shame is very deep inside of me.

847
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:05,741
l'll carry it with me the rest
of my life.

848
01:34:06,806 --> 01:34:11,209
Rouet, the game is over!

849
01:34:18,617 --> 01:34:21,142
Testing- 1 , 2, 3...

850
01:34:24,623 --> 01:34:29,060
Please...

851
01:34:31,797 --> 01:34:35,893
Today is a celebration day.

852
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:39,368
A special celebration,
because we are starting a strike.

853
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:45,239
We stopped the machines.
Nothing will leave the plant.

854
01:34:45,344 --> 01:34:48,404
We'll have to be patients.

855
01:34:48,514 --> 01:34:52,416
We believe all of us should
keep our jobs.

856
01:34:52,518 --> 01:34:56,682
We should accept no dismissals.

857
01:34:56,789 --> 01:34:59,257
lt's very important.

858
01:34:59,358 --> 01:35:03,192
Those who were dismissed
last year...

859
01:35:03,295 --> 01:35:09,427
have joined us. Today,
some of them are smiling.

860
01:35:09,535 --> 01:35:14,302
But we are very excited.
The game is still open.

861
01:35:48,173 --> 01:35:50,437
Kiss me.

862
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:26,973
-You want something to drink?
-Thanks.

863
01:36:30,482 --> 01:36:33,246
What will you do now?

864
01:36:34,353 --> 01:36:38,255
l'm taking the train tomorrow.
l'm going back to Paris.

865
01:36:40,893 --> 01:36:46,388
lt's alright. You deserve better.

866
01:36:46,498 --> 01:36:50,366
This could kill you like hell.
Your place is not in this hole.

867
01:36:52,304 --> 01:36:54,568
And you, when are you going to leave?

868
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:07,775
Where is your place?
