since the beginning of mankind,

834
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,886
the only hope there ever was,

835
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:56,322
the children, Jake.

836
00:54:56,357 --> 00:54:59,459
The children.

837
00:54:59,493 --> 00:55:03,696
And they're gone now.

838
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:06,065
Maybe when we die,

839
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,267
we'll get a chance
to be with them again.

840
00:55:08,302 --> 00:55:10,069
Jerry,

841
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:12,071
you built something here.

842
00:55:12,106 --> 00:55:14,907
All this is in defiance of them,
right?

843
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:16,776
This is writing the book
ourselves,

844
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,412
so don't let them
decide the ending.

845
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:20,613
Jerry.

846
00:55:24,852 --> 00:55:26,652
You know, I was thinking.

847
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:28,755
We're energy, right?

848
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:32,492
<i>Human beings are energy.</i>

849
00:55:32,526 --> 00:55:33,693
<i>When our bodies are gone,</i>

850
00:55:33,727 --> 00:55:36,562
<i>that energy has to go somewhere.</i>

851
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,740
Hey.

852
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:52,445
You're fading.

853
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:53,646
What?

854
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,148
You're fading.

855
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,988
She gave me some more time
to say good-bye, Mom,

856
00:56:02,022 --> 00:56:03,322
but it's over now,

857
00:56:03,357 --> 00:56:05,091
and I'm going.

858
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:07,226
You know what human beings are?

859
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:10,129
Martin Luther King,
Nelson Mandela.

860
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:11,831
They keep fighting.

861
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:13,466
We'll fight
to find our children,

862
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,869
and we'll fight
to bring them back.

863
00:56:16,904 --> 00:56:18,571
Turn it off.
Turn it off.

864
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:20,506
- Don't be absurd!
- Turn it off!

865
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:21,507
You saw it.

866
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:23,309
You saw it in their eyes.

867
00:56:23,343 --> 00:56:24,610
They're beyond us now.

868
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:25,711
Turn it off.

869
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:29,082
Turn it off.

870
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:34,554
Ask Jennifer
if you can stay here with us.

871
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,095
You belong with us.

872
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:44,030
Mom, it's all right.

873
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:46,532
I'm joining the others.

874
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:48,835
I have to go now.

875
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:51,137
She's calling me.

876
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:52,572
I have to go.

877
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:00,613
[sobbing]

878
00:57:24,037 --> 00:57:25,805
You can't destroy this place.

879
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,540
What does it matter
what we want, Jake?

880
00:57:31,478 --> 00:57:32,845
We're little men.

881
00:57:33,914 --> 00:57:35,381
We're little men.

882
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:37,216
Just stop.

883
00:57:42,956 --> 00:57:44,690
I was a little girl,

884
00:57:44,725 --> 00:57:48,628
alone in a hospital bed,

885
00:57:48,662 --> 00:57:51,330
and I was scared.

886
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:52,365
Remember?

887
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:00,640
And then I looked
into your eyes,

888
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:02,909
and I wasn't scared anymore.

889
00:58:11,151 --> 00:58:13,085
Hey, hey.

890
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,455
At least we knew love.

891
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:25,765
At least we knew what it was
to be a family.

892
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:29,202
Okay, okay.

893
00:58:29,236 --> 00:58:31,837
Okay, okay, I'm here.

894
00:58:31,872 --> 00:58:32,838
I'm here.

895
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:35,875
[steady beeping continues]

896
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:39,078
I love you.

897
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:41,180
I love you.

I am is Vindarten.

This be--

914
01:01:07,045 --> 01:01:09,413
This can be--

915
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:12,016
No.

916
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,651
This language is--

917
01:01:13,685 --> 01:01:17,555
I'm new this language
but is fine and under control.

918
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:21,359
Is fine and good.

919
01:01:21,393 --> 01:01:24,231
You are not well.

920
01:01:26,565 --> 01:01:29,308
Hence the floor.

921
01:01:31,439 --> 01:01:35,208
We use your terms,
and so in your terms,

922
01:01:35,242 --> 01:01:39,045
we are 11 and 100 years
of light away from Earth.

923
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,582
We are orbit the sixth planet
in the Carina System.

924
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:47,954
This is our world.

925
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:51,124
You call home world.

926
01:01:51,158 --> 01:01:53,526
We can call it Jenjedda.

927
01:01:57,498 --> 01:01:59,799
I made it.

928
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:02,168
Indeed.

929
01:02:02,203 --> 01:02:04,370
How long has it been?

930
01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:07,173
It be 40 of your Earth years.

931
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:27,560
So you say it's been 40 years
on Earth, right?

932
01:02:27,595 --> 01:02:28,828
What's it like there now?

933
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,400
Interesting.

934
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:37,103
You come this all way
here to ask for back

935
01:02:37,138 --> 01:02:38,238
where you come out from.

936
01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:40,306
Look, I came here
because I saw it.

937
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:43,109
The Earth is in danger.

938
01:02:43,144 --> 01:02:47,080
Everything that is happen
on Earth was planned long ago.

939
01:02:47,114 --> 01:02:50,817
Is natural, is the cosmos,

940
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:53,019
is the Overmind.

941
01:02:53,053 --> 01:02:55,121
Overmind?

942
01:02:55,156 --> 01:02:59,526
Overmind of all Creation.

943
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,495
Are you talking about God?

944
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:07,634
We have talked to the Overmind
for 100,000 year.

945
01:03:07,668 --> 01:03:09,235
We go where it sends.

946
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:12,539
We change worlds.

947
01:03:12,573 --> 01:03:15,441
We change Earth.

948
01:03:15,476 --> 01:03:18,711
The Overmind,

949
01:03:18,746 --> 01:03:21,714
can you show it to me?

950
01:03:21,749 --> 01:03:24,951
You really want this?

951
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:26,786
I want to know everything.

952
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,062
It connects to the Overmind.

953
01:04:41,362 --> 01:04:42,795
Step in.

954
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:48,067
You're the Overmind.

955
01:04:48,102 --> 01:04:50,503
A faint reflection of it.

956
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:52,639
I am all,

957
01:04:52,673 --> 01:04:56,075
divisible

958
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:58,912
and indivisible.

959
01:04:58,946 --> 01:05:03,516
I am the collective
consciousness of this universe.

960
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:11,090
So we are God?

961
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,993
No, the children are God,

962
01:05:14,028 --> 01:05:16,863
and they have left you,
as children must,

963
01:05:16,897 --> 01:05:19,966
and you must let them go,
as parents must.

964
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,703
Only the children
can become a part of the whole.

965
01:05:23,737 --> 01:05:25,338
It's an evolution.

966
01:05:25,372 --> 01:05:27,307
Into one mind.

967
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:34,547
So we're finished?

968
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:35,548
We cease to exist?

969
01:05:35,582 --> 01:05:36,616
We--

970
01:05:45,426 --> 01:05:46,659
Oh, my God.

971
01:06:00,507 --> 01:06:03,676
I have to get back to Rachel.

972
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:06,179
I need to go back.

973
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,480
Take me back home.

974
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:18,530
Hello, Milo.

975
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,792
I trust you slept well.

976
01:06:46,826 --> 01:06:51,530
More comfortable than the squid,
I suspect.

977
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:54,600
I'm home.

978
01:06:54,634 --> 01:06:57,836
It is not home anymore.

979
01:06:57,871 --> 01:06:59,771
Right.

980
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:03,976
It's been 85 years.

981
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:06,511
While you've been asleep,

982
01:07:06,546 --> 01:07:08,814
I have been
learning your language.

983
01:07:08,848 --> 01:07:10,983
"Oh, for a muse of fire
that would ascend

What happened to the Orbital?

987
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:39,845
It happened long ago.

988
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:42,648
Rachel?

989
01:07:42,682 --> 01:07:45,584
We brought her here.

990
01:07:45,618 --> 01:07:49,288
Would you like to see her?

991
01:07:49,322 --> 01:07:51,123
Yes.

You know a lot,
so I'm just gonna ask it.

997
01:09:05,665 --> 01:09:09,401
Does anything of her
survive beyond death?

998
01:09:11,537 --> 01:09:14,339
Yes, you.

999
01:09:14,374 --> 01:09:16,908
It's not a consolation.

1000
01:09:16,943 --> 01:09:22,147
Consciousness, Milo,
is a community of minds.

1001
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:25,851
Each exists
in the other's thoughts.

1002
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:28,620
Rachel exists
in your consciousness
