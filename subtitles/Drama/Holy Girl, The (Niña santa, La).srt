[water dripping]

3
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,805
If the great Christmas icicle
continues to melt at this rate,

4
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:56,331
Christmas magic
stored in the ice crystal will vanish.

5
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,870
These days, children and their pups
just don't believe like they used to.

6
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:05,248
Their focus is on themselves, instead
of on giving to others less fortunate.

7
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,447
If they don't understand
the true meaning of Christmas,

8
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:10,820
the icicle has no chance.

9
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:14,486
And I'm afraid that's something
we just can't teach.

10
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:17,087
Soon it will be
Puppy Paws' responsibility

11
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:21,464
to show the next generation
the importance of Christmas spirit.

12
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,377
[laughs] Wa-hoo! Wa-hoo!

13
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:41,580
Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer!
Now, Prancer and Vixen!

14
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:45,022
On, Comet! On, Cupid!
On, Donner and Blitzen!

15
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:52,129
That was fun. Let's do it again.

16
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,158
I'm afraid
we're all too tired now, Puppy Paws.

17
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:58,364
Comet, please?

18
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,670
Look, we have a lot of work to do today.

19
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,767
- Like what?
- Well, for one thing,

20
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,744
we have to get ready for Christmas Eve.

21
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:08,873
You know,
the most important night of the year?

22
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:12,544
Fine. I'll go find some fun on my own.

23
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:19,115
Oh, that pup sure has a lot to learn

24
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:22,560
before he takes the reins
and is responsible for Christmas.

25
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:30,727
 Jingle bells ring 

26
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:34,304

Yippee! Yippee!

31
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,717
 La, la, la, la 

32
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:55,989
Perfect.

33
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:57,724
Three trucks done!

34
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,424
- [man] Here come more toys.
- [woman] I got another load.

35
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,299
All packed and ready to go!

36
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:05,800
[man] Wagon, coming through, people!

37
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:08,239
All right! This'll be good.

38
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:12,473
 There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish 

39
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,878
 Hurry up and fill the sleigh
With the best things on your list, hey! 

40
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:21,012
 There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish 

41
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:25,184
 We'll hurry up and fill the sleigh
with the best things on your list 

42
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,355
 Santa makes it fun
He's always on the go 

43
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,523
 You'll know it's him
When the sleigh bells ring 

44
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:33,327
 And you hear "ho, ho, ho" 

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,096
- Ho!
- [laughing]

46
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,035
 Jingle bells ring 

47
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:41,040
 Jingle bells ring 

48
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,668
 There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish 

49
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:45,336
 Hurry up and fill the sleigh
with the best things on your list 

50
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:47,209
Hey!

51
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:48,839
[all shouting]

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,045
- It's going fast.
- Grab those...

53
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,422
- [laughs]
- Stop this! Stop... Ah!

54
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:02,860
- Oh, no.
- What's going on? It's chaos!

55
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,693
Come on.

56
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,756
- [playing piano fast]
- Yippee!

57
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,998
- Grab that...
- Uh-oh. This is getting out of control.

58
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:13,403
- [all shouting]
- Oh!

59
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:18,903
- Watch out!
- [sighs]

60
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,448
- I checked it a couple minutes ago.
- What do you mean?

61
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:25,345
[all] Puppy Paws!

62
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:33,221
Son, I am very disappointed in you.

63
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:37,093
You disrupted the workshop
and wasted a whole day of work.

64
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:41,294
The elves are very upset.
They're now another day behind schedule.

65
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:43,962
You know how hard they work
getting ready.

66
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,802
I didn't realize
it would cause such havoc.

67
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:48,637
I just wanted to have some fun.

68
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,940
Maybe you should be thinking
about how important Christmas is

69
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,674
to children and puppies
all around the world.

70
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:57,911
It's our responsibility
to deliver good puppies the gift

71
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:00,215
they've wished for the entire year.

72
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,482
You mean it's your responsibility.

73
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,786
I just want to be an ordinary puppy.

74
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:07,156
You're grounded until further notice.

75
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:09,855
That means no playing fetch
with the elves

76
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,693
and no flying with the reindeer.

77
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:14,063
I wish Christmas would just go away.

78
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:17,103
Puppy Paws!
What a horrible thing to say!

79
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:24,233
Do you think I was too strict with him?

80
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:27,280
Maybe just a smidgen, but...

81
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:28,837
...I'm sure he'll get over it.

82
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,248
Puppy Paws has to understand,

83
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:33,411
he's the future of Christmas.

84
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:38,254
 Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree 

85
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:41,590
 How steadfast are your branches 

86
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:45,996
 Your boughs are green in summertime 

87
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:49,035
 And through the snows of wintertime 

88
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:53,005
 Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree... 

89
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:55,098
You pups want to sing along?

90
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:57,143
Yo, I don't sing. I rap.

91
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:58,872
Why do we even have to come here?

92
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:01,312
It's a Christmas tradition.

93
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:05,340
I've been watching the lighting of the
tree since I was a pup like you Buddies.

94
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,786
- [sighs]
- You're quiet this evening, Budderball.

95
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:11,518
I hadn't even
heard your stomach grumble. [laughs]

96
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:13,355
Anything the matter?

97
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:16,624
I'm still in the doghouse
for eating the Thanksgiving turkey.

98
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:19,689
Are you worried you might be
on Santa Paws' naughty list?

99
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:24,533
Pshaw! Santa Paws is just Dad
dressed up in a red and white suit.

100
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:28,234
That's all, dawg.
They just use it so we behave all year.

101
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,798
Is that right, B-Dawg?

102
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:32,243
Let's look at the evidence,
Deputy Sniffer.

103
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:36,271
If the jolly dude came down the chimney,
wouldn't there be a lot of soot?

104
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,717
I'm not really buying the whole
"Santa Paws" thing, either,

105
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:41,981
but I sure do love all the presents.

106
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,956
Your material desires
are those of the wanting mind.

107
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,583
Enough is never enough.

108
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,991
Buddha's right, Buddies.

109
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:51,292
Getting material things
isn't what Christmas is all about.

110
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:56,530
Christmas spirit is about the unselfish
spreading of love and kindness.

111
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,264
There are plenty of lonely puppies

112
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,398
without families
or children to love them.

113
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,876
 Your boughs can teach a lesson 

114
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:09,973
- [applause]
- [clears throat] Hello, everybody.

115
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,848
Thank you for coming down
to the annual lighting

116
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,514
of the Fernfield Christmas tree.

117
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,819
Not quite the turnout we expected.

118
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,454
Three...

119
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,329
...two... one!

120
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,892
[all cheering, clapping]

121
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,979
Buddies, it's Mr. Cruge,
the dog catcher.

122
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,675
[people screaming]

123
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:45,081
Oh, jiminy Christmas!

124
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,185
[man] It's probably just a faulty bulb.

125
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,462
[yelping]

126
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:13,310
Oh...

127
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,117
Phew!

128
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:23,019
[female] Oh, my!

129
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,082
Thank you, Lord,
for this blessing. Amen.

130
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,212
[yelping]

131
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:54,152
Thought you could
run wild in the streets?

132
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,648
Not on my watch you don't.

133
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:11,666
[Cruge muttering, laughing]

134
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,927
I don't wanna be
responsible for Christmas.

135
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:38,226
I just wanna be an ordinary puppy.

136
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:40,266
[cracking]

137
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:43,098
I wish Christmas would just disappear.

138
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,661
[cracking]

139
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:51,138
The naughty book
gets thicker every year.

140
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,576
We're just on the pups.

141
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:56,446
If Puppy Paws doesn't understand
the true meaning of Christmas,

142
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:59,383
- how could we expect other puppies to?
- Mm-hm.

143
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:04,155
"Bubba.
Offense: destruction of property.

144
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,624
Chewing shoes, 17 cases."

145
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,423
Oh, my. That is naughty, all right.

146
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:21,502
[Santa] "Budderball. Offense: gluttony.

147
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,305
Eating the Thanksgiving turkey."

148
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,372
[all gasping]

149
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,682
- Whoa!
- [belches]

150
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:33,981
Budderball!

151
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:36,885
Big appetite for a pup.

152
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,984
I have the feeling little Budderball's
tummy always leads to naughtiness.

153
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:45,293
Santa Paws, Claus, we got the mail truck
ready for a systems check.

154
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:48,493
Great, Eli.
We could use a break from this.

155
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,765
Haven't even checked the list twice
and we're already tired.

156
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,206
Hm.

157
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,009
Budderball. One of the five Air Buddies.

158
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,674
He has three brothers,

159
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,811
Mudbud, B-Dawg, Buddha,
and a little sis, Rosebud.

160
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:09,651
They live in Fernfield, Washington,

161
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:11,247
each with their own families.

162
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,849
Regular, ordinary, fun-loving pups.

163
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:15,121
They sound perfect!

164
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,962
[man] Hey, Eugene!

165
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:27,696
OK. The sooner you get going,
the better.

166
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:29,435
We've got
a lot of pickups scheduled.

167
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,500
Over 1,000 cities and towns.

168
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,239
Eli, sir, she's all yours.

169
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,874
Confirming. The route is programmed.

170
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,818
OK, let's run
the diagnostic tests. New Delhi.

171
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,351
Oh, I am liking this very, very much.

172
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:49,452
Florence.

173
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,399
[speaking ltalian]

174
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:55,902
All seems in the working order,
Santy Claus.

175
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,130
You give me the clearance,
I'm ready to roll.

176
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,264
That's an all-clear from the North Pole.

177
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,071
Well, here I go.

178
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,908
Time to hitch a ride to Fernfield.

179
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,244
Good work, team.
We're right on schedule.

180
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,914
Jingle all the way, Eli.

181
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,617
[engine starts]

182
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:22,895
[Santa chuckles]

183
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:25,497
[all] Bye!

184
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:27,055
[man] Have a safe trip.

185
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,837
[Santa] Holding up all right?
Good, good...

186
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,237
Ah, good work.

187
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,514
[cracking]

188
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:53,656
- [machinery winding down]
- Oh, no!

189
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,428
I don't like the look of this one bit.

190
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:04,129
It's happening fast.

191
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:08,231
The magic of Christmas
is fading away, right before our eyes.

192
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:21,382
[Eli whistling]

193
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:30,053
"Fernfield:
Where everything is possible."

194
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,722
My kind of place.

195
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:49,544
[whistling]

196
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:03,622
[grunting]

197
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,569
Holy Christmas spirit.

198
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:24,676
We're almost out of power.

199
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:27,549
[engine starts]

200
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:37,456
[rock music playing on radio]

201
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:54,542
[static, then
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing plays]

202
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:55,603
Oh!

203
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:03,180
[changing station]

204
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:12,695
It looks to me like we've tapped
into all the additional power we've got.

205
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:16,167
- [dripping]
- Oh, my. Another leak.

206
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,302
I hate to even say it, but I think
the North Pole is starting to melt.

207
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,399
Any thoughts, Eddy?

208
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:27,810
Well, sir, spirit is down, but there
seems to be something else going on.

209
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,941
The icicle is melting faster
than we ever thought possible.

210
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:34,612
Has anyone seen Puppy Paws?
He seems to be missing.

211
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:36,280
My guess would be the stables.

212
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:39,348
You know how he loves to play tricks
on Donner and Blitzen.

213
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:50,729
Come on then, you're next.

214
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:54,533
Ho-ho-ho.

215
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,405
[grunts] What do you want?

216
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:02,471
I was hoping you could deliver this note
to the real Santa for me?

217
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:05,017
- The real Santa?
- I know that the real Santa

218
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:08,714
is busy at the North Pole making gifts
and you're just one of his helpers.

219
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:11,985
If you could deliver this note to him,
I would really appreciate it.

220
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:13,787
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

221
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,851
OK. Time's up.

222
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,796
There's other boys and girls
that need to see Hank.

223
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:21,265
- I mean, Santa.
- Merry Christmas, sir.

224
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:24,701
- Thank you. And God bless.
- [Hank] Merry Christmas to you, too.

225
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:39,643
[Hank] Ho-ho-ho. What do you want?

226
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:49,553
They couldn't have found me already.

227
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:55,063
[tires screeching]

228
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,244
[gasps]

229
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:10,441
Ah! Ah!

230
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,782
I did it! Holy... Oh!

231
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:18,988
Say "cheese," pipsqueak.

232
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:23,085
Man, this is itchy.

233
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,654
Ew! An imposter.

234
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,669
[grunts] All right!

235
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:34,705
- [Puppy Paws] Whoa!
- [grumbling]

236
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:36,332
What are you doing?!

237
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:39,944
- Oh!
- [grunts]

238
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,002
[Hank] What'll it be?

239
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:45,115
- [Cruge] Yes!
- Hey! What in the heck are you doing?

240
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:47,415
That dog. I'm trying to catch that dog!

241
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:58,186
[reindeer sneezing]

242
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,329
Comet, what's wrong?

243
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:11,400
Santa Claus, Santa Paws,
I wouldn't come in here if I were you.

244
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:15,208
All of us reindeer, we've been
hit with some sort of flu bug.

245
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,476
Could be contagious. [sneezes]

246
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,313
Are you gonna be OK?

247
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,683
[groans] I don't know, Santa.

248
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:25,315
Cupid isn't feeling the love
and Dancer isn't doing much dancing.

249
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:30,556
- We all feel really weak.
- It's a lack of energy from the icicle.

250
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,325
It's affecting us all.

251
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:34,093
Is there anything we can help with?

252
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,964
We're looking for Puppy Paws.

253
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:38,868
- Have you seen him?
- Come to think of it, no.

254
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:42,169
He hasn't been
asking us for rides... [sneezes]

255
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:43,641
Everything OK?

256
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,045
People sure aren't
very jolly in Fernfield.

257
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,313
I think it's time to call it a night.

258
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,981
- [woman] Thanks again, Mrs. Davis.
- [woman 2] Take care.

259
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:02,118
[yawning]

260
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:05,062
I guess I'll have to find Budderball
in the morning.

261
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:11,798
[toy] Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

262
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:21,577
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

263
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:48,737
[man] Hey, look, everybody, Eli's back.

264
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,404
- [engine sputtering]
- [moans]

265
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:00,912
Hey, what happened? You're back early.

266
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:03,251
For a minute there
I thought I might have to push.

267
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,848
- What's wrong with the truck?
- Almost ran out of power.

268
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:09,060
Where's all the mail, sir?

269
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:11,957
That's all there was.

270
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:24,775
Oh! Sweet mama! Gingerbread cookies!

271
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:28,673
Budderball? Is it really you?

272
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:31,682
I've been looking for you all over town.

273
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:34,618
Wow! That polar bear cub
sure looks realistic.

274
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,882
His mouth even moves.

275
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:39,390
Come on, big fella!

276
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,586
Budderball! Wait!

277
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:43,523
Good boy.

278
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,625
[woman] Oh, my!

279
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:59,304
All right. I've just got... Hm.

280
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:03,910
OK... Just a little knot here.

281
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:09,320
What in tarnation? Huh?

282
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:18,095
[snoring]

283
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:21,133
- Excuse me?
- [snoring]

284
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,192
- Excuse me!
- Huh? Oh...

285
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:28,071
Oh, hello there, young'un.

286
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,166
Deputy Sniffer at your service.

287
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:31,938
I'm looking for a pup I just saw.

288
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:34,536
But then he disappeared.
His name is Budderball.

289
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,980
Oh, I've known that pup his whole life.

290
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,574
So you know where he lives?

291
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,085
Budderball lives at Livingston Manor.

292
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:44,521
Now to get there
you want to go left down Main Street,

293
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,082
then take a right
at the candy store and keep going.

294
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:50,891
It's on the outskirts of town.
You can't miss it.

295
00:22:50,963 --> 00:22:52,089
Thanks, Deputy.

296
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,694
[snoring]

297
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:58,032
[man] OK, heads up, I'm sending it down.

298
00:22:58,104 --> 00:22:59,571
[Jingle Bells playing]

299
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,702
Thanks, Budderball.

300
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:13,208
Got it.

301
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:14,981
This must be it.

302
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,585
[man] I think I got some in the van.

303
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,356
Yeah, there's a box right there.
I'll grab 'em.

304
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,528
Here you go!

305
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:34,999
I'll send them up.

306
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:39,338
- A bit heavy.
- OK, I got it.

307
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:40,970
OK. You sure?

308
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:51,952
Well, I think we

309
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:54,549
are just about done.

310
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:56,993
I think we should lower
the candy canes a little.

311
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:59,463
They're kinda hard to... see.

312
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:05,829
[man] Oh, that's heavy.

313
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:07,595
Off we go.

314
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,906
Come on, Budderball.

315
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:18,773
Whoa!

316
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,351
[Budderball] Oh, sweet mama.

317
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,267
I'm not sure how Dad does this,

318
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:41,169
but here goes nothing.

319
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,970
Aah!

323
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:52,612
Hey! Do you mind getting off me?

324
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:54,880
It's you, right? Budderball?

325
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:56,478
I finally found you!

326
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:02,691
Who do you think you are, rolling out of
my chimney and busting my candy cane?

327
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,992
I'm Puppy Paws. Pleased to meet you.

328
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:07,396
- Where do you come from?
- The North Pole.

329
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,526
Oh, yeah.
I bet you belong to Santa Claus.

330
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:12,195
Well, technically, yes.

331
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:14,501
But Santa Paws is my pa.

332
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:18,977
Yeah, right. You expect me to believe
that your dad is Santa Paws?

333
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:22,014
- Why wouldn't you?
- Who put you up to this?

334
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:25,812
No one. I was checking the naughty list
and you looked like fun.

335
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:28,046
What'd you say?
I'm on the naughty list?!

336
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,145
It was just a little turkey!

337
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:33,283
Don't worry, you can get off
the naughty list and onto the nice list

338
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,088
by doing good deeds for others.

339
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:37,925
- Like?
- Well, um...

340
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:40,795
Like teaching me
how to be an ordinary pup.

341
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:43,767
OK, well,
I'll show you what I like to do.

342
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:53,236
This is
the most magical room in the house.

343
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:54,904
What kind of toys do you make here?

344
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:57,211
They don't make toys, they make food.

345
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:59,217
The most delicious food around.

346
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:02,186
Like roast beef sandwiches,
chicken wings, chili dogs...

347
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:03,654
Is he one of your elves?

348
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:06,817
You're a real joker, aren't you?
That's the chef.

349
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:09,053
- What's he doing?
- Making cookies.

350
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:11,460
But we can't eat them,
they're for Christmas.

351
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:18,430
Huh? [gasps]

352
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,568
Hey, how'd you get up there?

353
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:26,703
[Budderball] Uh-oh! [groans]

354
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:28,406
[Budderball] Bad idea.

355
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:37,217
- Wow!
- What?

356
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,021
Those cookies.
They just changed. How did you do that?

357
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:44,187
It's no biggie.
Christmas magic is stored in here.

358
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:46,128
So I can do stuff like my dad.

359
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:48,359
But I can't quite control it.

360
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:50,299
Hey, you want a cookie?

361
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:53,634
Don't you remember?
I'm trying to get back on the nice list.

362
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:55,003
Well, suit yourself.

363
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:04,915
Om... Om... Om...

364
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:07,578
Be good, Budderball, be good.
Don't eat the cookies!

365
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:15,153
- Oh, no!
- [belches] My compliments to the chef.

366
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:21,198
I believe it's time for lunch, Budder...

-...ball.

Oh, yeah, laugh it up.

370
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,751
Now I'm going to be late
meeting my brothers and sis in the park!

371
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,254
Hey. How about you introduce me to them?

372
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:46,814
Once I get done with my timeout,
I'd be happy to get you out of my fur!

373
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:48,883
Thanks! You're the best!

374
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:53,054
Is Budderball fashionably late again?

375
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,827
I hope the dude's not in trouble.

376
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,801
I'll meditate
and send him some positive energy.

377
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,100
Om...

378

Who's the white,
fluffy dude Budderball's with?

380
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:10,715
Puppy Paws, these are the Buddies.

381
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:12,182
The mucky pup is Mudbud.

382
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,809
The blinged-out one is B-Dawg.

- Buddha looks like he's sleeping...
- Om...

...but he calls it meditation.

385
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,451
Oh. And Rosebud is our little sis.

I'm sorry about my brother.

393

We've just grown
a little skeptical about Christmas.

394
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,910
You're not alone. No one believes
in Christmas spirit anymore.

395
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:45,246
That's why I'm here.
To learn how to be an ordinary pup.

00:28:45,317 --> 00:28:47,945
Well, you found
the right dog to school you.

through meditation.

478
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:09,569
- Om...
- Om...

479
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:12,303
[both continue] Om...

480
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:20,679
My Buddha statue!

481
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:23,847
It's a snowman,
very Zen in the North Pole.

482
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:29,060
[barking]

483
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:49,944
[barking]

484
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,443
Hello?

485
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:57,352
[man] Anyone here?

486
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,692
Yes?

487
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:07,925
Hi. Um...

488
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,230
My son would like a puppy for Christmas.

489
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:11,564
Ha!

490
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:15,198
Well, then,
you've come to the right place.

491
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:24,880
- [whining]
- Quiet!

492
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:28,346
- Where are the puppies?
- They're hiding.

493
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:31,454
They'll come out
if they know what's good for 'em.

494
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:35,926
[man] This is the one.

495
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,556
She's perfect. I'll take her.

496
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,927
That's $300.

497
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:44,802
I thought the puppies were free for
adoption. We'll give her a loving home.

498
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,464
- Take good care of her.
- You're wasting your breath.

499
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:49,803
That doesn't matter to me.
I just want the $300.

500
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,867
It's for my son for Christmas.
He's sick.

501
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:54,469
[whimpers]

502
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:57,743
A puppy might be just
what he needs to brighten his spirits.

503
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:01,177
I have $50.

504
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:04,518
No money, no mutt.

505
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,657
If you can find it in your heart...

506
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:20,395
[door closes]

507
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,030
Ha!

508
00:36:25,744 --> 00:36:29,236
- Dudes, where's Buddha?
- Buddha's always on time,

509
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,612
whereas I'm only on time at dinnertime.

510
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:33,708
I sent Puppy Paws over to Buddha's.

511
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,720
I thought he might be the only one
with the patience to handle him.

512
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:40,189
That "being one
with the universe" stuff...

513
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:42,056
So powerful.

514
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:45,062
And being present,
not just giving presents, is so Zen.

515
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,826
- So, how'd it go?
- I lost it.

516
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,527
What's the "it," Zen Master?

517
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:52,434
My temper! That's the "it" I lost, OK?

518
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,735
Hey, I know something
that ordinary puppies always do.

519
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:59,208
- Play Hide-and-Go-Seek.
- Hide-and-Go-Seek? What's that?

520
00:36:59,278 --> 00:37:02,338
You close your eyes
and count down from 12 while we hide.

521
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:04,882
When you finish counting,
you yell really loud,

522
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,781
"Ready or not, here I come!"

523
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,945
And you start looking for us, got it?

524
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,285
Yo, BFFing dudes,

525
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:15,486
that sounds like mad,
gnarly fun for shizzle! Namaste.

526
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,721
- Oh, brother.
- [sighs]

527
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:21,232
Twelve drummers drumming,
eleven pipers piping...

528
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,498
Everyone go in a separate direction
and meet behind the stump.

529
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,835
Eight maids a-milking,
seven swans a-swimming.

530
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:32,570
Six geese a-laying, five golden rings.

531
00:37:38,283 --> 00:37:39,682
Two turtle doves,

532
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:42,117
and a partridge in a pear tree.

533
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:43,381
That's twelve!

534
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:46,253
Here I come!

535
00:37:46,325 --> 00:37:49,123
I called you to this stump meeting
to discuss Puppy Paws

536
00:37:49,194 --> 00:37:50,991
and what we are going to do with him.

537
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,399
This game isn't so hard.

538
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:05,609
Puppy Paws actually thinks
that I'm buying that his pop is Santa.

539
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:08,145
I'm not even shopping, yo.

540
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:11,307
That dude got me
in some serious doo-doo.

541
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:15,410
I had the humiliation of wearing
a clean coat for the entire day.

542
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:18,820
If he's Santa Paws' son,
why'd he get me in more trouble,

543
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,290
rather than helping me
get off the naughty list?

544
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,296
And you should have seen what he did
to me. It was a fashion disaster.

545
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:28,492
But I was just trying to be like them.

546
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:36,698
Wait a second, Buddies.
We all have our own karma.

547
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:40,142
Puppy Paws is not responsible
for me losing my center.

548
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:41,702
To find faults in him,

549
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,180
we're really just
finding faults in ourselves.

550
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:46,774
The Zen dude is correctamundo.

551
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:48,683
He was only trying to fit in.

552
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:57,620
- Oh!
- [whimpering]

553
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:59,823
[grunts]

554
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,697
- [Cruge chuckles]
- I was only jealous

555
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,500
'cause the dawg schooled me
in the hip-hop battle.

556
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:09,972
I guess I ate myself
onto the naughty list.

557
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:13,876
It's my responsibility
to get myself off, not Puppy Paws'.

558
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:15,606
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

559
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,013
Poor Puppy Paws
doesn't have any brothers or sisters.

560
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,552
I couldn't imagine not having you guys.

561
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,214
Let's embrace Puppy Paws
with compassion.

562
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:35,661
[whimpering]

563
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:38,831
Where did the dude go?

564
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:50,815
[water dripping]

565
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:02,559
The Christmas icicle is almost gone.

566
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,059
I wouldn't believe it
if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

567
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:13,537
When Puppy Paws left,
the icicle started melting even faster.

568
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:18,542
If we don't find Puppy Paws, Christmas
as we know it will be lost forever.

569
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:25,548
All right. Come on. Come on.

570
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:31,823
Sniff, sniff. All right, let's go.

571
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,456
All right now.

572
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:37,392
Ah, come on.

573
00:40:37,863 --> 00:40:39,831
[barking]

574
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:41,958
[Cruge] Quiet!

575
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,297
Come on, come on.

576
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,931
All right.

577
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:56,547
Yeah, you won't be needing
this anymore. [laughs]

578
00:40:58,517 --> 00:41:00,781
In you go.

579
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:08,025
[whimpering]

580
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:15,632
"Property of the North Pole?"
[laughs]

581
00:41:17,202 --> 00:41:19,397
Very, very funny.

582
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:39,717
What is this place?

583
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:47,654
The pound is where they put
us dogs that no one cares about.

584
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,731
No one cares about you?

585
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:53,465
- What's your name?
- They call me Tiny,

586
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:56,473
because I'm the smallest
of all the puppies.

587
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:59,203
I'm Puppy Paws. What's with that guy?

588
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:01,802
Did he get
coal in his stocking or something?

589
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,041
He lost his Christmas spirit.

590
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:06,379
No one cares about Christmas anymore.

591
00:42:06,451 --> 00:42:08,078
We do.

592
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:12,415
The hope for a Christmas miracle
is all we have.

593
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:15,716
[whimpering]

594
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:19,161
 Every night I look up

595
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:22,723
 And pray that someone sees

596
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:26,202
 The sadness in these lonely eyes

597
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:29,502
 And shares his love with me

598
00:42:29,574 --> 00:42:32,702
 As the night grows colder

599
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:35,940
 We really need to find

600
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:39,609
 A way to heal the hope we 've lost

601
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:43,586
 We really need a sign

602
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,816
 We need to know

603
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,225
 That there are Christmas miracles

604
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:56,290
 This year

605
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,537
Good job.
Now make a wish and we'll turn it on.

606
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,449
[coughing]

607
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:17,955
[whispers] I wish that Santa
would get my letter.

608
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:19,786
Here we go.

609
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:23,419
[Tiny]  We need to know 

610
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:27,659
 That there are Christmas miracles 

611
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:30,565
 Somewhere in our hearts 

612
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:36,039
 Somewhere in our souls
We need to feel 

613
00:43:36,107 --> 00:43:39,907
 The love, the hope and the cheer 

614
00:43:39,978 --> 00:43:45,610
 The magic in this time of year 

615
00:43:45,684 --> 00:43:49,347
 We need a Christmas miracle 

616
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:54,381
 A Christmas miracle 

617
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:56,984
 This year 

618
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:01,328
I had no idea.

619
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:04,425
Thank you, Tiny. Thank you.

620
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:26,821
- Magicometer.
- Magicometer.

621
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:33,363
Well, did you find any way
of boosting the power?

622
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:37,729
The boys have modified the E.L.F.
compressor with the magicometers

623
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:39,997
and gotten a little more power
with the spiriters.

624
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,730
[gasps]

625
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:48,102
We have great news!

626
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:50,807
I think we know where Puppy Paws is.

627
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:52,474
Fernfield, Washington.

628
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,313
In search of a pup
named Budderball.

629
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:57,048
You know how he was saying
he just wanted to be an ordinary pup?

630
00:44:58,623 --> 00:45:01,683
Santa Claus? Santa Paws? You OK?

631
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,628
Please, bring back Puppy Paws
as fast as you can.

632
00:45:05,697 --> 00:45:09,793
Without him, I'm afraid Christmas
may be gone forever.

633
00:45:10,435 --> 00:45:11,697
[gasps]

634
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:15,399
Yes, sir! We'll be back quicker
than you can say "Candy Cane Lane."

635
00:45:23,782 --> 00:45:26,649
[whooshing sound]

636

00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,953
Well, at least we made it. I have
no idea how we're gonna get back.

638
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:42,397
[Eli] The tank
is completely out of magic.

639
00:45:46,037 --> 00:45:48,562
All right. I'll try and find Puppy Paws.

640
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,438
And I'll see what I can do
about the truck so we can get home.

641
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:57,976
- Where's Budderball?
- That dawg ain't ever on time.

642
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:02,782
Being fashionably late is one thing,
but this is way out of style.

643
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:09,416
Dude, am I hallucinating
or is Budderball running with an elf?

644
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:10,756
It's an elf, all right.

645
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:13,923
Where does he find these dawgs?
The looney bin?

646
00:46:17,368 --> 00:46:19,598
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

647
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:22,139
I had another surprise visitor
from way up north.

648
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,404
[Budderball] This is Eddy.
He claims to be Santa Paws' head elf.

649
00:46:25,477 --> 00:46:28,503
We need your help.
Christmas is in great danger.

650
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,310
And we need to get Puppy Paws
back to the North Pole.

651
00:46:31,382 --> 00:46:36,115
Well, I for one totally love your shoes,
and will do anything to help.

652
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:39,816
Your presence indicates that
our disbelief may have been unfounded.

653
00:46:39,891 --> 00:46:42,621
But, regardless, there is one obstacle.

654
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,958
Puppy Paws has disappeared.

655
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:49,462
Quick, hide! It's Cruge!

656
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:53,098
Come on, let's go!

657
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:57,535
- [Mudbud] Coming through!
- [Rosebud] Hurry up.

658
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,981
Oh, no! Do you think Puppy Paws
might be in the pound?

659
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,041
[B-Dawg] This way, dawgs!

660
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:16,185
- All right...
- [engine sputtering]

661
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:18,388
[sighs]

662
00:47:19,764 --> 00:47:22,426
No magic in the tank,
no way to get home.

663
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,865
It's officially the end
of Christmas spirit.

664
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:28,264
[indistinct chatter]

665
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:29,863
- [Hank] Next.
- [man] Have a nice day.

666
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:32,637
- [Hank] Hello.
- That's great.

667
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,007
Hm...

668
00:47:34,412 --> 00:47:36,710
[Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
playing on PA]

669
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:50,721
[man] There it is. There you go.

670
00:47:50,795 --> 00:47:52,660
- Look at that. Keep it moving.
- Thank you.

671
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:55,221
If I had enough magic,
even just a little...

672
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,824
Hey!

673
00:47:56,901 --> 00:47:59,995
Bub, look, I'm all for slacking off,

674
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:03,632
but I've been busting my hump over here
and you've been standing over here...

675
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:06,268
-...hiding out, so...
- Oh, I'm not hiding out.

676
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:08,369
I'm trying to see
if I can make this sleigh fly

677
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:11,574
so that we can get Puppy Paws back
to the North Pole and save Christmas.

678
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:15,050
[laughs] Puppy Paws! Of course! Yes!

679
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,087
Ooh! I have an idea!

680
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:19,646
Let's sprinkle a little fairy dust
all over the reindeer

681
00:48:19,724 --> 00:48:22,989
to come alive and then
they can fly you back to Santy Claus.

682
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:24,153
Do you have some?

683
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:28,732
No. No...
If you don't get back to work right now,

684
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,529
I'm gonna tell the big boss, OK?

685
00:48:30,602 --> 00:48:32,467
This is killing me.

686
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:35,734
- [man] You want your uniform revoked?
- Oh, of course not.

687
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:37,399
All right, follow me.

688
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:42,479
[barking]

689
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:46,039
Uh... I don't think anyone's home.

690
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:48,984
Maybe we should come back
another time, dawgs?

691
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:52,216
Dudes, look! There's a hole in the back!

692
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:55,782
[B-Dawg] Yo, dawgs, hold up!

693
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:10,134
OK, you know the plan.
Budderball, you're on lookout.

694
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,438
Bark twice if Mr. Cruge returns.

695
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,774
[Rosebud] Mudbud and B-Dawg,
you find the key.

696
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:17,371
Buddha, Eddy and I will find Puppy Paws.

697
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:20,212
- Got it?
- [Eddy] Go! Quickly!

698
00:49:20,284 --> 00:49:22,878
- [B-Dawg] Come on, let's go!
- [Mudbud] Hurry.

699
00:49:28,493 --> 00:49:31,121
[all] Puppy Paws!

700
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:34,824
Eddy! Is that you?
Over here, last cage.

701
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:36,924
Eddy, I'm so happy to see you.

702
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:39,367
I'm so sorry I messed everything up.

703
00:49:39,437 --> 00:49:42,634
From now on,
I promise to be good for goodness sake.

704
00:49:42,707 --> 00:49:45,175
We're gonna need you
to be great for greatness sake.

705
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:47,404
[Eddy] The Christmas icicle
has all but melted now.

706
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:49,605
Santa Claus and Santa Paws
need you back.

707
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:51,774
Your dad has grown very weak.

708
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:54,010
Your dad is Santa Paws?

709
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:57,283
There isn't going to be a Christmas?

710
00:49:57,355 --> 00:49:59,220
I won't let that happen, Tiny.

711
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:02,259
You pups taught me
the true meaning of Christmas spirit.

712
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:06,820
It's not just about presents.
In fact, it's not about presents at all.

713
00:50:06,898 --> 00:50:10,197
It's about things you can't
wrap in a box or tie with a bow.

714
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,933
First, find my collar
so we can get out of here.

715
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:15,131
I'll retrieve it.

716
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:21,309
- The key is not in here.
- It's not over here, dawg.

717
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:23,313
We've gotta find Puppy Paws' collar.

718
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:31,181
There's too many, dawg. Which one is it?

719
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:35,889
I remember! It looks like a candy cane.

720
00:50:39,063 --> 00:50:40,052
There it is!

721
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:45,396
[grunting]

722
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:02,614
It's about time. Hurry!

723
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:11,158
Wow! I can't thank you guys enough.

724
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:13,857
That's what friends do,
help each other out of a jam.

725
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,878
- [door creaking]
- [gasping]

726
00:51:27,945 --> 00:51:30,971
Budderball, if you're here,
then who's on the lookout?

727
00:51:31,048 --> 00:51:32,140
Uh...

728
00:51:33,017 --> 00:51:34,279
Huh?

729
00:51:35,987 --> 00:51:37,955
Ha! They're coming to me now!

730
00:51:38,022 --> 00:51:39,990
You guys go. I'll take care of him.

731
00:51:40,057 --> 00:51:41,388
And we will help.

732
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,893
You would be willing to do that
for Christmas?

733
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:46,156
It's us or saving Christmas, right?

734
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:51,258
This job just gets easier and easier.

735
00:51:52,436 --> 00:51:53,926
Get back in your cage.

736
00:51:54,005 --> 00:51:55,336
Get out of here, go! Quickly!

737
00:51:55,406 --> 00:51:57,237
Eli's waiting for you
in front of town hall.

738
00:51:57,308 --> 00:52:00,141
You guys can do it. I know you can.

739
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:02,236
You're our Christmas miracle.

740
00:52:02,313 --> 00:52:04,144
We won't let you down, Tiny.

741
00:52:05,616 --> 00:52:07,174
[Puppy Paws] Come on, let's go!

742
00:52:09,587 --> 00:52:11,179
Follow me.

743
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,691
[Budderball] Watch out! Coming through!

744
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,318
[Rosebud] Move over, guys!

745
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:20,421
- [barking]
- Hey, hey! No, no, no!

746
00:52:20,498 --> 00:52:22,056
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

747
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,760
Go away! Go away!

748
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:24,995
Oh!

749
00:52:27,572 --> 00:52:29,767
[gasps] Oh...

750
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:32,401
Go away. Go away!

751
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:34,967
I'm ticklish!

752
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:36,809
[laughing]

753
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:38,212
I'm ticklish!

754
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,855
[laughing] I'm ticklish!

755
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:59,198
- [Puppy Paws] Eli, wake up!
- [snoring]

756
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,362
Puppy Paws!

757
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:03,236
We've got to
get back to the North Pole right away!

758
00:53:03,307 --> 00:53:05,775
- How'd you get here?
- The mail truck.

759
00:53:05,843 --> 00:53:07,936
But it doesn't have enough power
to get us back.

760
00:53:08,012 --> 00:53:10,640
I've been trying to figure out
how to get this sleigh to work...

761
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,717
Puppy Paws, your collar!

762
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:18,083
It might have enough magic
to make this thing fly.

763
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:20,555
It's lighter than the truck
and it needs a lot less power.

764
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:23,992
- But we still need reindeer.
- There are no reindeer in Fernfield

765
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:26,052
other than
those plastic ones right there.

766
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,621
Wait a sec!
We know how to pull a sleigh.

767
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:30,326
Let me get this straight, Elf Dude.

768
00:53:30,401 --> 00:53:32,335
All we have to do is pull the sleigh

769
00:53:32,403 --> 00:53:35,372
and Puppy Paws' magic collar
will make it fly?

770
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:38,499
- That is correct.
- Will you guys do it?

771
00:53:38,576 --> 00:53:41,511
B-Dawg is all about the heroics.

772
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:44,639
Yo, P-Squared,
you need help saving Christmas,

773
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:47,240
- we're your Buddies.
- Let's do it!

774
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:49,843
[barking]

775
00:53:52,556 --> 00:53:56,856
For that little stunt,
there'll be no dinner.

776
00:53:57,595 --> 00:53:58,584
[whimpering]

777
00:54:04,902 --> 00:54:07,462
[Eddy] I bet you haven't
laughed like that in a long time.

778
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:11,998
Huh? Who said that?

779
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:17,139
[Eddy] We know all about you
at the North Pole.

780
00:54:17,214 --> 00:54:21,241
You didn't get a puppy when you were
a boy, and it made you hate Christmas.

781
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:24,755
But Santa knew that your mother
was very allergic to dogs,

782
00:54:24,822 --> 00:54:27,655
that it wasn't right for your family.

783
00:54:28,459 --> 00:54:31,519
I know a lot of things about you,
Stan Cruge.

784
00:54:34,265 --> 00:54:36,256
Are you talking to me?

785
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:39,531
I'm from the North Pole where we can
communicate with all creatures.

786
00:54:39,603 --> 00:54:41,468
It's part of the Christmas magic.

787
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:44,997
And you know the best way
to heal your broken heart

788
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:47,636
is to give to those in need.

789
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:57,617
What has gotten into me?

790
00:54:57,688 --> 00:55:01,089
Christmas, sir.
Christmas has gotten into you.

791
00:55:04,462 --> 00:55:07,363
It's time to let Christmas
back into your heart.

792
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:13,096
Well, I would love to stay for eggnog,
but I have to get back to the North Pole

793
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,330
and help save Christmas.

794
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,718
Uh, dawgs, it just struck me
that we ain't playin' no more.

795
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:36,783
This Santa stuff is for real, yo.

796
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:40,991
OK, you're all set.
We only have one shot at this,

797
00:55:41,065 --> 00:55:44,330
so it's important you believe you can
fly without a shadow of a doubt.

798
00:55:44,402 --> 00:55:47,530
- Ready, Buddies?
- That's "reindogs" to you, bro.

799
00:55:47,605 --> 00:55:49,470
Next stop, the North Pole.

800
00:56:07,558 --> 00:56:08,616
Did you see that?!

801
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:12,353
They're flying.

802
00:56:15,232 --> 00:56:16,961
I most certainly did.

803
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:19,298
And, yes, they are flying.

804
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:28,734
- Whoa! This is so fly! I'm flying!
- But I'm afraid of heights!

805
00:56:28,813 --> 00:56:31,213
Budderball, don't look down.

806
00:56:32,716 --> 00:56:34,877
Yo, dawgs, there's the dog pound.

807
00:56:34,952 --> 00:56:36,886
[B-Dawg] Let's do a flyby.

808
00:56:55,606 --> 00:56:57,369
[Budderball] Guys, wait.

809
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:00,035
Does anyone actually know
how to get to the North Pole?

810
00:57:00,111 --> 00:57:01,908
Just follow the North Star.

811
00:57:16,827 --> 00:57:19,489
[Eddy] The best way
to heal your broken heart

812
00:57:19,563 --> 00:57:22,930
is to give to those in need.

813
00:57:54,565 --> 00:57:56,055
[sighs]

814
00:58:01,372 --> 00:58:03,499
[water dripping]

815
00:58:05,242 --> 00:58:07,506
[wind howling]

816
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:16,686
- Did you feel that?
- Somewhere, somehow,

817
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:20,281
somebody just decided
they believed in Christmas after all.

818
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:23,793
It only takes one person
to change the lives of many.

819
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:28,560
Santa Claus, I do believe the Christmas
spirit has begun its turnaround.

820
00:58:29,366 --> 00:58:31,596
[cheering]

821
00:58:33,604 --> 00:58:38,064
You see, the magic is stored all year
round in the great Christmas icicle

822
00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:39,973
and is released at Christmas.

823
00:58:40,044 --> 00:58:43,070
If people don't believe in Christmas,
there isn't enough magic for us

824
00:58:43,147 --> 00:58:45,843
to make the toys or fly the sleigh.

825
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:48,441
So, if there
isn't enough Christmas spirit,

826
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:52,114
then the icicle that stores
the magic will melt and...

827
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:53,884
...Christmas will be gone forever?

828
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,357
Precisely.

829
00:58:55,426 --> 00:58:58,190
Children will never get
to experience the joy of Santa,

830
00:58:58,262 --> 00:59:00,526
or learn about the spirit of Christmas.

831
00:59:00,598 --> 00:59:03,726
To children, you are Santa's elf.

832
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:06,998
That's why your job as
an elf representative is so important.

833
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:09,130
You don't actually work for us directly,

834
00:59:09,206 --> 00:59:11,834
but you do work
to spread Christmas spirit.

835
00:59:11,909 --> 00:59:15,072
And if you don't believe,
neither will the children.

836
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:19,415
Wow. Thanks, Eli.

837
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:23,779
See, I had no idea
my job was so darn important.

838
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:26,149
Oh. Here comes my boss.

839
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:28,191
That little dog is your boss?

840
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:31,754
Eddy, this is Clark.

841
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:33,922
- He's an official elf representative.
- Hey.

842
00:59:33,998 --> 00:59:36,728
Eli, we'd better get back
to the North Pole, lickety-split.

843
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,700
Santa's gonna need
all the help he can get.

844
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:40,901
- He can talk?
- Uh-huh.

845
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:43,639
We don't have enough magic
to power the truck.

846
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:47,939
We will soon.
Eli, things are turning around.

847
00:59:48,012 --> 00:59:49,309
What happened at the pound?

848
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,610
Christmas. That's what happened.

849
00:59:54,685 --> 00:59:58,587
- Remember your promise, Clark.
- I will.

850
00:59:58,656 --> 01:00:00,715
Merry Christmas.

851
01:00:07,898 --> 01:00:10,298
There it is, Buddies. The North Pole.

852
01:00:12,703 --> 01:00:14,864
We can land right by Santa's house.

853
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:16,530
Yo, don't worry, P-Squared.

854
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:18,939
You are in good paws with the B-Dawg.

855
01:00:19,009 --> 01:00:21,978
[all scream]

856
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,118
[moaning]

857
01:00:29,553 --> 01:00:33,887
[groans] I guess
I overshot the landing a little.

858
01:00:33,957 --> 01:00:35,447
You could say that again.

859
01:00:45,669 --> 01:00:49,696
- Dad!
- Son!

860
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:53,266
I'm so sorry for not believing.

861
01:00:53,344 --> 01:00:56,404
I just didn't understand
how important Christmas was.

862
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,607
And I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

863
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:02,118
I should have trusted you would come
to that realization yourself.

864
01:01:02,186 --> 01:01:04,780
Well, it took the help of a few friends.

865
01:01:11,895 --> 01:01:14,295
Buddies! Nice to see you again.

866
01:01:15,065 --> 01:01:17,033
How've you been behaving, Budderball?

867
01:01:17,101 --> 01:01:19,194
Any more turkey infractions?

868
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:22,466
No, Mr. Paws.
I haven't even sneaked a cookie.

869
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:26,873
Well, big fella, we'll have to see about
getting you off Santa's naughty list

870
01:01:26,944 --> 01:01:28,809
and back onto the nice list.

871
01:01:28,879 --> 01:01:31,040
That would make
my Christmas special, sir.

872
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:33,845
I can vouch for all the good
karma Budderball has created

873
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:35,714
since the infraction in question.

874
01:01:35,786 --> 01:01:39,517
Your wisdom is appreciated,
Buddha. Namaste.

875
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,150
We are totally stoked to help,
Santa Dude.

876
01:01:42,226 --> 01:01:44,524
Bro, that would be super rad.

877
01:01:44,595 --> 01:01:48,122
I'll make sure we all do everything
we can to make Christmas happen.

878
01:01:48,198 --> 01:01:51,690
Rosebud, your leadership skills
are exemplary.

879
01:01:51,769 --> 01:01:56,263
If memory serves, you're near
the very top of Santa's nice list.

880
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,174
Thank you all for coming. We're very
behind here at Santa's workshop,

881
01:02:00,244 --> 01:02:04,180
and it's going to take all the help
we can get to make Christmas happen.

882
01:02:12,256 --> 01:02:14,850
[choir sings Jingle Bell Rings]

883
01:02:19,129 --> 01:02:20,994
[man] Easy, easy.

884
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:23,321
[man 2] Oh, hello!

885
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,631
Yo, I gotta give props to those elves.

886
01:02:26,703 --> 01:02:28,671
They know how to get it done.

887
01:02:29,506 --> 01:02:31,440
[Santa] Ho-ho-ho!

888
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:34,375
- We are back in business!
- [cheering]

889
01:02:34,445 --> 01:02:38,438
- Is that Santa Claus?
- Yes, that's Santa himself!

890
01:02:38,515 --> 01:02:40,676
 It's two nights 'til Christmas 

891
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:42,946
 There's so much work
You see 

892
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:46,319
 Tie all the ribbons
Stuff all the stockings 

893
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,951
 Make toys with me 

894
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:53,724
 Grant every wish with every gift 

895
01:02:53,797 --> 01:02:55,662
 Young hearts will lift 

896
01:02:55,732 --> 01:02:59,259
 So come on
Help save Christmas with me

Oh! It's so great to see you!

901
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:16,981
What a glorious day! [laughs]

902
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,783
And you're right on time!

903
01:03:18,856 --> 01:03:21,051
The great Christmas icicle is back!

904
01:03:21,124 --> 01:03:23,820
Santa, my friends the Buddies
have come to help!

905
01:03:25,062 --> 01:03:27,929
Welcome, Buddies! Ho-ho-ho!

906
01:03:27,998 --> 01:03:32,332
As you can see, there's still lots of
toys to be made for children and puppies

907
01:03:32,402 --> 01:03:36,930
all over the world. We're gonna need
all hands and paws on deck!

908

[choir sings Jingle Bell Rings]

910
01:03:46,216 --> 01:03:49,117
- [Eddy] We're back.
- [Santa] Whoa!

911
01:03:49,186 --> 01:03:51,051
That's quite a haul you've got there.

912
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:54,818
From the looks of this load,
I'd say Christmas spirit is on the rise.

913
01:03:54,892 --> 01:03:58,419
All right, people, let's get
these letters opened on the double.

914
01:03:58,495 --> 01:04:00,463
- Christmas Eve's a-comin'.
- [bell rings]

915
01:04:00,531 --> 01:04:04,228
 There's the bell, let's work until
we grant each Christmas wish 

916
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:06,526
 We'll hurry up
And fill the sleigh 

917
01:04:06,603 --> 01:04:08,867
 With the best things on your list 

918
01:04:08,939 --> 01:04:12,932
 Santa makes it fun
He's always on the go 

919
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,035
 You'll know it's him
When the sleigh bells ring 

920
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:17,080
 And you hear, "ho, ho, ho" 

921
01:04:17,714 --> 01:04:19,875
[man] Hey, Budderball, nice haul.

922
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,577
Hey!

- Yeah! [laughing]
- [barking]

938

All right, Santa,
we're ready for a test flight.

939
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:54,643
OK, everyone,
let's give this our best effort.

Comet, Donner, Blitzen! Are you OK?

945
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:20,994
Sorry, Santa Claus. We still
don't seem to have enough strength

946
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:22,971

flew the small sleigh to the North Pole

that was left in my crystal.

Maybe we can fly Santa's sleigh?

- Whoa! What's happening?
- That's what happens to the leader.

It's to light the way
for the rest of us.

I think we're going to call you Ru-Dawg.

Now that's tight.
My nose shines just like my bling.

Prepare for departure.

Good luck, son. Stay focused.

No matter what happens tonight,
I want to thank you, Buddies.

- You're the best friends I've ever had.
- We should thank you.

We had stopped believing
in Christmas until we met you.

Enough of this Kumbaya stuff.

I'm in it to win it!

Santa, I know it's late
to be making Christmas wishes...

And I know I've been playing like
I don't believe in Santa Claus...

I don't need any presents.

The only thing I want for Christmas...

to be safe at home. Amen.

I know this is a lot to ask,

but this year if you could find a puppy

980

And he would take good care of us.

I know we would be the best of friends

985

and I think my parents
will worry less about me

I couldn't have done it
without the Buddies.

Indeed. Your teamwork tonight was most
certainly top of the nice list material.

Which is why, Buddies,

1063

we at the North Pole
have decided to present to you

- You earned this, son.
- Whoa!

You're one of us now, young pup.

1069

And with you on our team,
I think it's pretty safe to say

1070

that Christmas is going to be in very
good hands for a long time to come.

you wanted to be an ordinary pup?

You're too extraordinary to be ordinary.

1079

I feel the same way about you, Buddies.

Oh, no, no. I wouldn't want to impose.

Besides, I've got
a lot of work to do here, you know.

But it's Christmas, sir.

Stan, thank you.
It's great to have you here.

1112

Thank you for spending
Christmas with us.
