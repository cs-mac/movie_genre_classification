1
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:47,246
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
very gratifying to Ms. Green,

2
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:51,409
it is very gratifying to the
management, to listen to such

3
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,313
heartfelt appreciation as
you have just expressed.

4
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,977
You all know that this is the
last appearance of Ms. Green,

5
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,986
of our Harriet, on this
or any other stage.

6
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:15,729
She'll be back on the stage
in two years, sure as I'm

7
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,729
breathing.

8
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,736
Whether in two years or
twenty, they always do you know

9
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,237
it's like a favor.

10
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:32,088
To celebrate this unique
occasion, the last appearance in

11
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:36,256
public of our favorite, before
Cupid snatches her from our

12
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,337
mitts.

13
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:02,145
As I was saying, Ms. Harriet
Green, to celebrate this unique

14
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:05,726
occasion, has consented with
her company to sing the song

15
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:09,894
that first endeared her to
you, to me, to all of us.

16
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:13,014
Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a

17
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,306
Bow Wow.

18
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,613
Thank you.

19
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,892
? I love my little cat, I do

20
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,183
? It's coat is oh so warm

21
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:40,059
? He comes each day with me to
school and sits upon the form

22
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,525
? Then teacher says why do
you bring that little pet of

23
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:47,693
? Yours, I tell her that I
bring my cat along with me

24
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:53,783
? Because daddy wouldn't
buy me a bow wow bow wow

25
00:05:56,618 --> 00:06:00,956
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow

26
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:05,001
? I got a little pet,
I am very fond of that

27
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:09,853
? But I'd rather have a bow wow wow

28
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:21,851
? We used to have two tiny
dogs, such pretty little dears

29
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,546
? But daddy sold 'em 'cause
they used to bite each other's

30
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:31,425
? Ears, I cried all day and ate all night

31
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:33,895
? Papa sent me to bed

32
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:38,063
? When mom came home and
wiped my eyes I cried again

33
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:45,285
? And said daddy wouldn't
buy me a bow wow bow wow

34
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:54,014
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow

35
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:59,109
? I've got a little pet
and I'm very fond of that

36
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:04,831
? But I'd rather have a bow wow wow

37
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,838
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow

38
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,008
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow

39
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,009
Maudie.

40
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,513
She's actually waving to me.

41
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:27,198
It's the old structure look at that.

42
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,392
The old walrus, I'll throw
him a fish in a minute.

43
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,793
What are you going to sit with him for?

44
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:35,085
Oh a hundred reasons.

45
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,143
You know it means I'm going
out of your life forever.

46
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:38,947
That's one of the reasons.

47
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:43,261
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow

48
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,960
? Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow wow bow wow

49
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:50,506
? I've got a little pet
and I'm very fond of that

50
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:54,717
? But I'd rather have a bow wow wow

51
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,750
Ladies and gentlemen I want
to cry, but I mustn't because

52
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,572
I don't want to look horrid
the last time you see me.

53
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,299
Nonsense, you look wonderful!

54
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:42,060
I would rather leave you
all at this moment, the moment

55
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,894
when you love me most.

56
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,930
I would never like to
grow old before your eyes.

57
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,939
You'll never grow old Harriet Green.

58
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Evergreen.

59
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:03,628
As you all know, tomorrow
I'm getting married, and what

60
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:07,796
more can I say except that
I'm marrying a kind and a

61
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:11,161
splendid man.

62
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:21,226
? For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow

63
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:27,252
? For he's a jolly good
fellow, a toast to all of us

64
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:34,743
? A toast to all of us,
a toast to all of us

65
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:39,492
? For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow

66
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:43,660
? For he's a jolly good
fellow, a toast to all of us ?

67
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:47,664
Hip hip.

68
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:48,497
Hooray!

69
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:49,330
Hip hip.

70
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,413
Hooray, hooray!

71
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,777
Oh Shropshire Isn't it
touching, I've got a lump in me

72
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:06,942
throat.

73
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:11,474
Maudie, do you know
why I'm attracted to ya?

74
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,558
No, now tell us, go on.

75
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:19,899
Because you are figured
like an hour glass, and that

76
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,150
intoxicates me.

77
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,138
Hourglass, oh.

78
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,139
Hourglass.

79
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,836
Have some more San, you'll
need it if you want to boil

80
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,803
that egg, huh?

81
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:38,450
You've made me the happiest
man in the world little woman.

82
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,201
Oh, clever, cheers.

83
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:46,025
Maudie my dear, you are
Harriet's understudy, are you not?

84
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:48,359
Yes I am, or rather I was.

85
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:55,153
If she doesn't turn up at
the wedding, someone's gotta

86
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,115
take her place haven't they?

87
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,596
I don't know, I suppose so.

88
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:01,930
Maudie, will you marry me?

89
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:06,288
Don't say this is so sudden,
because it would be a wooping

90
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:07,289
big lie.

91
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,051
Oh really, I'm not good enough for you.

92
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,533
Shropshire, the pleasure's mine.

93
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,799
Mine too, and damn the county.

94
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:23,667
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
the honor to present to you

95
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,471
the future Lady Shropshire.

96
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:46,872
But this may mean that I may
never grace the boards again.

97
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,982
London will never get over it.

98
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,836
A treat ladies and gentlemen,
a treat never before seen on

99
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:03,445
any stage, the future Lady
Shropshire will sing a duet with

100
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:05,946
the future Marquis of Staines.

101
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:11,805
Harriet do you really think
we ought to, I mean remember

102
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:12,973
our positions.

103
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:17,760
Orchestra, orchestra.

104
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:21,928
? Why I wouldn't leave my
little wooden house for you

105
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:27,561
? I've got a lover and a good one too

106
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:32,506
? What might happen there
ain't no knowing, if he comes

107
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:34,913
? Around so you better get going, woo

108
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:39,741
? I wouldn't leave my wooden
little house for you ?

109
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:44,148
Come on now, come on, all together.

110
00:12:45,072 --> 00:12:49,239
? I wouldn't leave my
little wooden hut for you

111
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:53,839
? I've got a lover and a good one too

112
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,964
? What might happen there ain't no telling

113
00:12:55,965 --> 00:13:00,132
? If he comes around,
you better get going ?

114
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,161
I beg your pardon, I have to leave.

115
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,070
I love you all, goodbye.

116
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:17,104
What's the matter?

117
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:27,709
Cab please.

118
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,831
No dear, you must stay behind
and look after our guests.

119
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:40,665
But I--

120
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,498
Hawke will see me home, goodbye.

121
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,564
Ms. Green's apartment.

122
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:57,525
This is peculiar.

123
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,071
I'm very sorry miss.

124
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:06,055
It's all right Hawke, I felt
all along it was too good to

125
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:07,056
be true.

126
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:10,963
Where is he?

127
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:15,131
11 Mock Street Heckney,
should I tell the driver?

128
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,595
Hi Cabby, 11 Mock Street Heckney.

129
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:23,763
Right you are lady, at
your case, if you say so.

130
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,374
My darling long lost girly.

131
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,939
All right Hawke, you can
wait for me downstairs.

132
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,760
I thought I'd seen the
last of you this time.

133
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,898
You really mustn't be so
pessimistic about the future my

134
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:42,899
love.

135
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,003
Spent all the money I gave you?

136
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:46,337
I'm afraid so.

137
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,407
How?

138
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,627
And our little daughter?

139
00:14:56,628 --> 00:15:00,211
In a place where you
will never find her.

140
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:04,809
Well George...

141
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,515
My ship got in this morning,
and the first thing I read in

142
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:10,168
the paper was you are
going to be a Marshonest,

143
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,803
congratulations.

144
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:13,736
Very sweet of you George.

145
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:16,016
He's a millionaire, isn't he?

146
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,088
Well little girl we're in clover.

147
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:18,922
We?

148
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:20,005
You and me.

149
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:22,289
I see.

150
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,053
Good thing I never
married you eh my love?

151
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:26,471
Or else this would be bigamy.

152
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,629
Are you coming to the wedding George?

153
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,630
You bet.

154
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:37,902
You wouldn't like me to
give you away, would you?

155
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:45,646
Ooooh.

156
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,984
Harriet you must go
on with this marriage.

157
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:50,049
And be blackmailed by you
for the rest of my life?

158
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,925
Oh I'm a reasonable man,
I'd ask for a little and I'd

159
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:52,852
cheer off.

160
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:56,696
After a price, and unfortunately
you'd cheer back again.

161
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:59,567
Oh no George, I'm not so
keen on marriage as to let

162
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:00,419
myself in for that.

163
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,036
But this means everything to you.

164
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,869
Perhaps it does, but my
own peace of mind means still

165
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,703
more.

166
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,967
Harriet, this is a chance of a lifetime.

167
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,969
For you, yes.

168
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,401
Oh it's no use George, I'm sick
of having you hanging around

169
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:15,307
my heels, and if I marry
Staines it'd be a thousand times

170
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,141
worse.

171
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,060
Oh lovely how can you
say such things about me?

172
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,685
Besides, your engagement's been announced.

173
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,772
If I thought you were
going to turn up like this I

174
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,209
wouldn't have dreamed of going on with it.

175
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,105
But you must go on with
it, my dear it's a gift.

176
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,909
And think of the poor Marquis,
how could you be so cruel to

177
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,853
him, break the young man's
heart, they say he's as sensitive

178
00:16:31,854 --> 00:16:32,877
as they make 'em.

179
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:34,733
And if you let him go why he's
liable to throw himself in

180
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,140
his own battlements, and his
blood will be on your hand.

181
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:40,447
You can't go to Heaven
branded as a murderess.

182
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,651
Hawke, I've made up my mind.

183
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:45,236
Go up and tell him that
I've left the stage.

184
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,950
Tell him that I am not going
to get married, but I'm going

185
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:50,267
to clear off and go back
home to South Africa.

186
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:53,046
And me, aren't I coming with you?

187
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:56,756
No Hawke, you're going
into the country to bring up

188
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:58,445
Harriet Junior.

189
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:01,726
Couldn't you bring yourself
to take her with you?

190
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:05,704
No Hawke, her father stands
for too much that has been

191
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:07,455
miserable in my life.

192
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:11,906
My life is going to be my own from now on.

193
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:18,097
You'll bring her up beautifully
Hawke, I'm sure of it.

194
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:22,265
Harriet, Harriet my love,
you must listen to reason.

195
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:28,184
She would've made such
a lovely Marshonest.

196
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,685
Don't I know it.

197
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:37,559
? I wouldn't leave my
little wooden house for you

198
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:43,485
? I've got a lover and a good one too

199
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,111
? What might happen there
ain't no knowing if he comes

200
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:50,018
? Around so you better get going, woo

201
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:54,186
? I wouldn't leave my little
wooden house for you ?

202
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:20,749
Good luck dear.

203
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,167
Thanks darling.

204
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:33,008
Cut, cut, yeah yeah,
what's all this about.

205
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,605
I'm all right really, I was
a bit overworked from my last

206
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:39,523
job, that's what it is.

207
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,699
And when was your last job?

208
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,346
About six months ago,
but today's my lucky day.

209
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:49,452
Had any breakfast this morning?

210
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:50,982
I'm dieting.

211
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,813
That was
terrible boys, terrible.

212
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:19,319
I'm going to send you
home to your mothers soon.

213
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,914
And keep work, there's
nothing to laugh about.

214
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:26,332
Charlie, let her go, one two.

215
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:30,395
No.

216
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:31,228
Yes Mister.

217
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:32,524
Vivvy Abbington would like
you to go to lunch with her on

218
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:33,711
Friday.

219
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:34,545
Oh take a note of it.

220
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,190
Yes Mr. Ben.

221
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,358
I wanna see those girls.

222
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:44,258
Skirts up.

223
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:48,278
Mr. Ben have you decided on
the blue carpet or the pink

224
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,698
for the ballroom scene?

225
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:50,824
I want red.

226
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:51,992
Yes Mr. Ben.

227
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,421
Now tempo, tempo!

228
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:57,894
Would you give me a
rehearsal group Mr. Ben?

229
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:58,728
No.

230
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,895
Yes Mr. Ben.

231
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:03,434
Stop, stop everybody, stop.

232
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,969
This is a nice time for one
of my chorus ladies to turn up

233
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,019
in the morning isn't it?

234
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,504
Yes Mr. Ben.

235
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:12,091
Don't you get enough sleep?

236
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:14,254
What do you think Mr. Ben?

237
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:18,990
Keep quiet everybody, from
the commencement Charlie, one

238
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:19,991
two.

239
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:23,959
Stop, it is ordered, stop.

240
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,304
Rest up 15 minutes girls.

241
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,730
Mr. Ben what about these other girls?

242
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,855
I don't wanna see anymore girls today.

243
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:30,689
All right Mr. Ben.

244
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,022
Sorry ladies, no more auditions today.

245
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:36,596
Now what is it?

246
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:37,586
I'm livid.

247
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:38,958
You look a bit off what the
hell's the matter with you?

248
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,228
Am I supposed to be your
young and glamorous leading lady

249
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:42,303
or not?

250
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:43,688
Supposed to be, yes.

251
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:46,428
And didn't you promise me
some really good publicity?

252
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,450
I was tight at the time but I did yes.

253
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,284
Well listen to this?

254
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:54,558
Ms. Marjorie Moore, the
well known divorcee, that's a

255
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,726
great help for God's sake,
celebrated her 35th birthday very

256
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:02,453
quietly in her tiny Knight's
Bridge flat with a little tea

257
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:03,454
party.

258
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:09,232
Fish me Mr. Thompson, go
on fish me Mr. Thompson!

259
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,449
Mr. Thompson!

260
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,664
Mr. Thompson!

261
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:17,283
Mr. Thompson!

262
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:19,246
Here I am Mr. Ben.

263
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,497
How dare you.

264
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,546
What do you mean by this?

265
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:29,234
I'm not sitting anymore today!

266
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:32,717
How dare you say I'm 35,
the whole world knows I'm 28!

267
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:36,044
It's a new idea of mine,
truth in advertising, besides it

268
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,092
says in the theatrical
who's who that you're 38.

269
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:39,093
Oh.

270
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:43,890
And how dare you describe
this lady's flat as tiny, it is

271
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:44,724
enormous.

272
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,285
Well you know it better than I do sir.

273
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:47,953
What does he mean by that?

274
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:50,100
We'll let that pass.

275
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,172
I thought it might be good
to suggest that Ms. Moore has

276
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:53,631
simple tastes.

277
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:56,678
And as far as the public's
concerned, Ms. Moore's flat

278
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,825
isn't in Knight's Bridge it's in Mayfair.

279
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:01,659
Yes Mr. Ben.

280
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,807
Don't you realize that what
this theatrical profession

281
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:08,018
wants to put on it's feet is
a new and original idea, can't

282
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,439
you think of something
startling and original?

283
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,257
I have Mr. Ben, I though of
it this morning while I was

284
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:12,828
cleaning my teeth.

285
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:13,996
What was it?

286
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,235
Couldn't we suggest that
Ms. Moore had all her jewels

287
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,450
stolen?

288
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:19,451
Marvelous.

289
00:22:20,678 --> 00:22:21,511
Get out.

290
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,458
But Mr. Ben--

291
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,458
Get out!

292
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:28,817
Ooooh.

293
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:33,365
Where's my chair?

294
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:45,672
Damn Ms. Marjorie Moore, oh sorry.

295
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,090
It's all right.

296
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:50,088
I don't know you from any
Johnson, but there's something

297
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:52,853
I'd like to get off my chest,
I'd give anything in the world

298
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,244
to boil Mr. Leslie Ben in caster oil.

299
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:56,078
So would I.

300
00:22:56,078 --> 00:22:56,911
Can you afford the caster oil?

301
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:57,996
No, can you.

302
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:01,298
No too bad, but good morning.

303
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:16,748
I have good news to tell Mr.
Pryde, the Lady Shropshire is

304
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:17,671
here.

305
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:20,716
Oh, yes your honor, miss,
but he's with Mr. Ben now.

306
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:21,717
Mr. Ben?

307
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:24,476
Oh I knew him well.

308
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:30,333
I said nobody was allowed in
here while I'm with Mr. Ben.

309
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:33,127
Oh but Mr. Ben knows me so well.

310
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:35,939
God bless it's Maudie.

311
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,792
Maudie is one of my names,
but really I'm Lady Shropshire.

312
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,889
Hm, you haven't gone grand
on us by any chance have you?

313
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,808
And what do we owe the honor
of this visit Lady Jabaja?

314
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,443
Shropshire if you don't mind.

315
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:53,111
Well as you read in the
papers I am widowed.

316
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:56,752
But the rumor that my husband
left me in an acute state of

317
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,710
mortgage is quite untrue.

318
00:23:58,711 --> 00:24:00,067
Sounds rather rude to me.

319
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:03,626
Really.

320
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:07,556
But I have begun to feel, now
how can I put it, the desire

321
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:10,845
to return to the old profession.

322
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:12,048
What?

323
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,261
You never at the foot light.

324
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:18,460
Do you mind telling us
what the big idea is Lady

325
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:19,971
Shropshire?

326
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:24,139
Oh Les it's like this, see
I've been studying grand opera

327
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:28,189
and I thought well for old
time's sake, I'd like to give you

328
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,544
the first chance of presenting me.

329
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:32,477
Charming of you.

330
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:36,645
Can you play that.

331
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:44,284
? Na na na na na na

332
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:50,731
? Ah ha ha ha ha ha a ha ha ha

333
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:24,138
Maudie, you've moved us strangely.

334
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:32,446
Hello.

335
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,447
Oh, hello.

336
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:37,501
I thought you were a publicity man.

337
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:41,136
So did I, so I was, but
I've decided to go back to the

338
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:42,506
stage again.

339
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,619
How nice.

340
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,117
You couldn't get me to touch
that damn publicity record

341
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:47,476
not with a barge pole.

342
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:48,970
I haven't got a barge pole.

343
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:50,888
Oh clever aren't you.

344
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,198
Nothing new today folks.

345
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:13,460
They always say that, I'm going to wait.

346
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:16,961
Well if you'll take a chance, so will I.

347
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,739
And here am I one of the
greatest showmen in the business

348
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,247
prepared to spend any amount
of dough on the public and I'm

349
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:26,883
stuck, I can't bring them in.

350
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:28,841
And I've got to watch the man
that runs the Picture Palace

351
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:31,761
down the road turn away from his, and why?

352
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:34,128
Because he's got something
really good to show them.

353
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:36,151
Now I've got to have something
that will make them sit up

354
00:26:36,152 --> 00:26:40,319
in their seats and rub
their eyes, oh for a stunt.

355
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:46,156
Have a cup of tea, we
can talk about old times.

356
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:47,657
Oh, for a stunt.

357
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,162
A stunt?

358
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:53,558
A really marvelous publicity
stunt, so daring and original

359
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,479
that it'd make old Ben go down
on his knees begging me to go

360
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,573
back to him, gosh, what a triumph.

361
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:02,994
But I thought you'd finished
with the whole damn record.

362
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:04,578
So I have, still.

363
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,930
Oh I'm so tired of looking for a job.

364
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:13,524
Am I seeing things?

365
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,044
What's the matter, are you ill?

366
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:20,560
It can't be Harriet Green.

367
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:25,033
I'm afraid you've made a
mistake, my name is Harriet

368
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,468
Hawkes.

369
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:30,896
The voice is the same,
oh I'm going off my nut.

370
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:35,064
You're not Harriet Green's
daughter by any chance are you?

371
00:27:36,332 --> 00:27:39,999
I'm afraid you're
mistaken, I'm, my name--

372
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:45,834
Well what do you know about that?

373
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:47,241
And I thought I knew all there
was to know about Harriet

374
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:48,241
Green.

375
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,241
Her daughter, well well.

376
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,832
Do you mean the famous
Harriet Green of the olden days?

377
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,097
Yes, oh but that was before your time.

378
00:27:57,098 --> 00:28:01,265
I remember the door, the
top, the champagne, suppers.

379
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:08,041
And you're her daughter.

380
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:11,542
Oh please, I told you my name is Hawkes.

381
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,484
What's the matter with you?

382
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:22,838
Don't talk to me I'm giving birth.

383
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,089
Really, what is this world coming to.

384
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:27,768
Who is that young man.

385
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:30,697
I don't know, but I
think he's awfully silly.

386
00:28:30,698 --> 00:28:31,865
I've got it.

387
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,214
I'm going to put you at the
top of the tree my girl by a

388
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,215
stunt.

389
00:28:38,314 --> 00:28:40,208
By a stunt that will make
Leslie Ben's hair stand on him,

390
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:43,037
a stunt that will put Hitler
and Amy in the shade, a stunt

391
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,262
that will make all of London
cue up to see you my girl.

392
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:49,309
Did you hear me say nothing new today.

393
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,066
You're wrong old man,
gosh how wrong you are.

394
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:55,299
Come on, let's go to lunch, I
don't know who's going to pay

395
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,550
for it, but come one let's go to lunch.

396
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:14,540
Mr. Leslie Ben.

397
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:23,082
What the devil do you mean by this?

398
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,527
Oh you two knew each other, how nice.

399
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:26,361
We do not.

400
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:29,265
Oh but you must meet, such
a clever young man Leslie, and

401
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,183
a great friend of mine.

402
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:34,436
Mr. Ben, Mister, what did
you say your name was?

403
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:35,861
Thompson.

404
00:29:35,862 --> 00:29:38,355
Now Ms. Maudie, I thought
I came here to talk about old

405
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:39,189
times.

406
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,556
Oh did you?

407
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:43,357
Of course you did, and while
you're here, I'm going to

408
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:45,431
show you the greatest idea ever presented.

409
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:49,599
A chance that comes to a
man only once in a lifetime.

410
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:03,154
? When you're young, it's always
spring and light as a happy

411
00:30:04,491 --> 00:30:08,658
? Song, how many laugh at
her and sing as we all along

412
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:17,849
? Though the years go rushing
by and spring is a memory

413
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,887
? Life will always be
the same sweet song to me

414
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:37,535
? When you've got a little
spring time in your heart

415
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,677
? You can knod at all the
wintery winds that blow

416
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:51,053
? Though December comes your
way don't worry about a thing

417
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:56,671
? And the buttercups come
peeping through the snow

418
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:05,465
? You will be young you'll be
loved your whole life through

419
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:12,812
? Just as young and more
in love than at the start

420
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:20,274
? And each happy thing will
be Evergreen and as sweet as

421
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:23,849
? A blossom in June

422
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,017
? When you've got a little
springtime in your heart ?

423
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,720
Harriet Green.

424
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:48,874
Well?

425
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,410
Good Lord.

426
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:53,078
Remember you of anyone Duckie?

427
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:01,647
It is Harriet Green.

428
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,148
Of course it is.

429
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:06,090
Her daughter?

430
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,091
Yes.

431
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,247
It isn't anything of the
sort, it is Harriet Green,

432
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:13,446
you said it yourself, it is Harriet Green.

433
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:14,470
What are you driving at?

434
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:16,554
A stunt, the biggest
you've ever heard of.

435
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:17,388
Well go on.

436
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:20,599
I don't know, I'm not so
sure I want to talk about it

437
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,055
after your extraordinary
behavior to me yesterday.

438
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:25,448
Oh drop that for the love of Mike.

439
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:28,866
Well my idea is that from
now on this girl becomes her

440
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:29,867
own mother.

441
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:32,424
Impersonate her mother.

442
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:35,035
Yes, that's the idea.

443
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,453
You're all mad.

444
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:40,146
Oh don't go Leslie, don't go.

445
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:42,563
Just clever, objections please.

446
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:45,021
But her mother died years ago.

447
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:46,263
In South Africa, and there's
nobody who was interested,

448
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,119
nobody realized it, next.

449
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,422
Do you realize that her
mother was a very great artist?

450
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:53,367
I know I could do it Mr.
Ben, if only you would give me

451
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:54,368
the chance.

452
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,925
And don't forget I was
her mother's understudy.

453
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:58,410
And I was her dresser for years.

454
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,701
And I remember all
the little ways of her.

455
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:02,480
We could teach her.

456
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,314
You bet.

457
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,117
Do you seriously mean that
you think you could persuade

458
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:07,730
the British public that this
girl is a Harriet Green of

459
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:08,731
times?

460
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:12,144
Well, we persuaded you she
was two minutes ago, and you

461
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:13,386
knew her mother well.

462
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:16,944
You are no fool Mr. Ben now are you?

463
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:21,112
Yes, no, I only believed it
until I remembered my dates.

464
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:25,754
Do you realize if this
child's mother were alive today

465
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,839
she'd be about 50 years of age.

466
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,272
Good Heavens of course I do.

467
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,564
Oh but damn it, this kid looks sixteen.

468
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:32,791
Well of course she does.

469
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:33,792
Well?

470
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:37,311
Meet the star that will never grow old.

471
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:38,145
What?

472
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:40,844
The idol that brought
the look of the age of 16.

473
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:41,945
What charm the use of 1934?

474
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,161
By looking like sweet 16.

475
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:47,079
Meet the miracle of the
age, Ms. Harriet Green.

476
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:06,201
? If I give into you
I'm giving into myself ?

477
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:07,993
Now Harriet come along, I'm
gonna show you how your mother

478
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:10,021
always finished her numbers, come on.

479
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:11,939
Like this, big smile.

480
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,357
Yes, but that must come out
more and these must be down.

481
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,330
You've forgotten this one Madam.

482
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:20,831
Oh yes, she always did that.

483
00:34:22,598 --> 00:34:23,513
How lovely.

484
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:24,997
Isn't it touching?

485
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:28,017
Oh I can't go through with
it, it is indecent to go about

486
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:29,899
pretending to be my own mother.

487
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,777
Oh but Harriet, you never saw
your own mother so to speak.

488
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,641
I'm sure if she knew she'd
be ever so pleased that you're

489
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:38,334
keeping her memory green and
not meaning any funds either.

490
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:41,265
Come on Harriet, be a
big girl, one one two.

491
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,516
Oh all right.

492
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:50,865
? If I give into you
I'm giving into myself

493
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:52,941
? If you shatter my resistance

494
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:54,192
Lovely deary.

495
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:56,557
Just like her mother.

496
00:34:56,558 --> 00:35:01,221
? I know it may be wrong but
that would never have hold

497
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:05,509
? And against my better judgement I fall

498
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,677
? I am weak, now you can
go and bring your speak

499
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:16,197
? And I hear no one grin oh hush

500
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:20,365
? It's not my fault if I am
tucked away on your shelf

501
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,525
? I am giving into myself ?

502
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,555
That was lovely deary.

503
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:34,973
Oh give me a hankie.

504
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:37,278
You could never sing like
that, they'll think you've been

505
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:39,748
taking some monkey
glands to make you young.

506
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:42,347
Besides Harriet, you look
so lovely dressed as your

507
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,061
mother, all the boys will fall
in love with you as they did

508
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:45,895
with her.

509
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,941
Now listen kids we only
got three more days for

510
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:48,775
rehearsing.

511
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:49,608
Good morning.

512
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,441
Morning.

513
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:51,274
Quiet.

514
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,600
I wanna get a polish on.

515
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:54,703
Now you watch your tempo,
and you're very ragged.

516
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:56,593
And listen kids for Heaven's
sake look as if you're enjoying

517
00:35:56,594 --> 00:35:57,604
it.

518
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:01,253
? I'm the only doctor
who can cure your ills

519
00:36:01,254 --> 00:36:05,207
? No funding medicines,
no bitter tasting pills

520
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:09,125
? I have a magic pure and simple as can be

521
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:13,057
? I just prescribe this
sweet little melody

522
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:17,035
? Tinkle tinkle tinkle, what
if the raindrops sprinkle

523
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:20,101
? Tie a little bell to your
dancing shoes and the sun will

524
00:36:20,102 --> 00:36:22,375
? Shine

525
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:24,891
? Tinkle tinkle tinkle, what
if the stars wouldn't twinkle

526
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:28,123
? Tie a little bell to your
dancing shoes and stars will

527
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:29,275
? Shine

528
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:33,806
? When you moan and groan
in trouble comes around

529
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:37,467
? Heave my miles and
miles of very happy sounds

530
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:41,537
? Tinkle tinkle, what if
the raindrops sprinkle

531
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:44,533
? Tie a little bell to your
dancing shoes and stars will

532
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:46,534
? Shine

533
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:43,070
Now listen old man, you can't
keep us in the dark all the

534
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:43,904
time.

535
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:47,156
You've got to know something,
tell me, is Harriet Green

536
00:37:47,157 --> 00:37:48,078
rehearsing today.

537
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:49,078
No.

538
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,933
Is she ever gonna rehearse?

539
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:51,766
No.

540
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,568
Is anybody ever gonna see her at all?

541
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:54,682
No.

542
00:37:54,683 --> 00:37:56,004
Thanks so much.

543
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,602
You're welcome.

544
00:37:57,603 --> 00:37:58,584
Morning.

545
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,584
Hello.

546
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,503
Ben's a grand old trainer.

547
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:35,064
He's not that bad.

548
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,755
And what about Harriet Green?

549
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:39,330
Oh, come with me up in the
box, I'll give you a really

550
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:40,331
grand story.

551
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:49,421
Not at all bad kids.

552
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,502
Leslie, Harriet's ready,
she got to run through a

553
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:53,705
rehearsal with you.

554
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,291
Right, now everybody go to
your dressing rooms and on no

555
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,044
account must anybody come onto this stage.

556
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,712
Now come on kids get on with it.

557
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:07,913
We'll be just in time to see it all.

558
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:09,731
When are we gonna see this old hag?

559
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,497
Time will show.

560
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:15,165
Time will show in her
figure too I'll bet.

561
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,173
See you on the first night boys.

562
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,752
Now Tommy, see that the
critics get their drinks in the

563
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:43,802
second half.

564
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:44,636
Oh naturally.

565
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:46,642
Yes I got an idea that the
second half's a bit weak.

566
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:47,667
As usual.

567
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:50,699
Oh will you stop
walking about everybody.

568
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,347
This is a quick change not a skating rink.

569
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:56,395
Now Harriet there's nothing
for you to be nervous about.

570
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,767
You know what's at stake?

571
00:39:57,768 --> 00:39:59,866
I put every penny I've got into
this show, if we don't make

572
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:02,541
good tonight I'm absolutely ruined.

573
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,065
Everything's on your shoulders.

574
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:06,316
I've done everything I can.

575
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:25,052
? When you're young it's always
spring and life is a happy

576
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,197
? Song, how we love it yeah,
and sing as we're all along

577
00:40:35,663 --> 00:40:39,830
? Though the years go rushing
by and spring is a memory

578
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:46,882
? Life will always be
the same sweet song to me

579
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:59,503
? When you've got a little
springtime in your heart

580
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:07,235
? You can love with all the
wintery things that blow

581
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,945
? Though December comes your way

582
00:41:14,946 --> 00:41:19,113
? For you the buds will sing
and buttercups come peeping

583
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:24,084
? Through the snow

584
00:41:25,455 --> 00:41:29,622
? You'll be young and in
love your whole life through

585
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:36,009
? Just as young and more
in love than ever before

586
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:42,760
? And these happy things will be evergreen

587
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:47,201
? As the sweetest blossom in June

588
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:51,369
? When you've got a little
springtime in your heart

589
00:46:21,843 --> 00:46:26,010
? And each happy thing will
be evergreen as the sweetest

590
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:31,288
? Blossoms in June

591
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:36,903
? When you have a little
springtime in your heart ?

592
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:07,923
Ladies and gentlemen of the
press please have a little

593
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:11,621
patience, Ms. Green is not
so young and is easily tired.

594
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:14,348
The excitement of her great
triumph last night has exhausted

595
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:15,182
her.

596
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:18,150
She wishes me to apologize to
you for the delay, she will

597
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:20,568
be with you in a few moments.

598
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:38,002
Oh there you are.

599
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:41,036
My dear you look beautiful, are you ready?

600
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:42,037
Yes.

601
00:47:43,348 --> 00:47:45,265
I'll conduct them in.

602
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,831
Has a romance played a big
part in your life Ms. Green?

603
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:10,721
Oh yes, but the 20th century
isn't a patch on the 19th.

604
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,191
Do you think is
more becoming than they used to

605
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:15,183
be.

606
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:18,516
Yes, but red flannel had it's moments.

607
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,448
How old do you feel Ms. Green?

608
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:24,808
As old as I look.

609
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:26,179
Do you remember Merican Knight?

610
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,521
As if it were yesterday.

611
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:30,369
Were you Ms. Green?

612
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,825
Oh no, I've always liked my
men to have the upper hand.

613
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:36,189
Did Glaston ever say
anything interesting to you Ms.

614
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,190
Green?

615
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,606
Well, it was not so much what he said.

616
00:48:43,607 --> 00:48:45,878
What is your greatest ambition?

617
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:48,766
To have the same effect on
your grandchildren that I had

618
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:50,517
on your grandfathers.

619
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:56,192
Clever, thank you so much.

620
00:48:56,193 --> 00:48:58,189
You know why she wears
that high collar don't you?

621
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,023
No.

622
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:01,184
To hide the scars.

623
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:03,363
Scars, has she had her face smashed?

624
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:04,447
No, lifted.

625
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:09,494
And is your husband
still alive Ms. Green?

626
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:12,976
No, he died in South
Africa three years ago.

627
00:49:12,977 --> 00:49:14,477
Really, what of?

628
00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:19,521
Old age, he was a good ten
years older than me you know.

629
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:26,045
Have you any questions
of a more general nature?

630
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,895
Have you any children Ms. Green?

631
00:49:27,896 --> 00:49:29,563
Oh really, please.

632
00:49:30,524 --> 00:49:32,622
Come Ms. Green give us a
break, look what I did for you

633
00:49:32,623 --> 00:49:33,706
this morning.

634
00:49:35,216 --> 00:49:36,799
Oh, how charming.

635
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:51,011
Oh, excuse me I must go
consult my general manager.

636
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:54,702
What are you trying to palm off on me.

637
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:58,870
A most interesting news,
this should get us a long run.

638
00:50:05,094 --> 00:50:06,094
Maudie.

639
00:50:15,017 --> 00:50:18,023
Now that's in the second
act, and that's in the third,

640
00:50:18,024 --> 00:50:19,434
and oh you must publish that one.

641
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:22,657
That's the scene with the comic, remember?

642
00:50:22,658 --> 00:50:25,047
This'll be ten years not three.

643
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:27,965
Listen Leslie, keep your hair on.

644
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:33,553
We're the only four in the
know, and who else is going to

645
00:50:33,554 --> 00:50:34,554
find out?

646
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:37,345
The Marquis of Staines.

647
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:47,074
My mother's old fiance.

648
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:54,840
My dear, amazing, not a year
older, not a muscle changed.

649
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:58,437
This is the most touching moment
I've experienced since you

650
00:50:58,438 --> 00:51:00,698
consented to marry me.

651
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:04,866
Let me see, why it must be
quite the odd years ago.

652
00:51:06,353 --> 00:51:07,936
Don't you remember?

653
00:51:10,014 --> 00:51:12,669
Is it such a dreadful shock?

654
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,587
Have I changed so much?

655
00:51:17,303 --> 00:51:19,304
My dear old Staines.

656
00:51:19,305 --> 00:51:20,305
Maudie.

657
00:51:30,406 --> 00:51:33,076
How this does take one back.

658
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:35,160
Why it's quite shaken me.

659
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:37,622
It's quite shaken me too.

660
00:51:37,623 --> 00:51:38,580
Me too.

661
00:51:38,581 --> 00:51:40,090
And me.

662
00:51:40,091 --> 00:51:42,439
You don't know what a shock
it was to me when I got your

663
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,757
letter that night.

664
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:47,759
By the way you never told me
in that letter was the child

665
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,093
a girl or a boy.

666
00:51:58,149 --> 00:52:02,003
My dear boy, how foolish
of me not to notice the

667
00:52:02,004 --> 00:52:02,837
resemblance.

668
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:06,099
Yes yes, I'm delighted
to meet you, delighted.

669
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,553
And I must congratulate you
too my dear, a splendid champ.

670
00:52:10,554 --> 00:52:11,526
Thank you.

671
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:14,866
And if you have half the
beautiful nature your dear mother

672
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:17,221
has, you'll be a model son.

673
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:20,722
I was wrong, this means 20 years not 10.

674
00:52:34,691 --> 00:52:36,898
Do you think we better go and confess?

675
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:39,628
After all none of us
realized it was a crime.

676
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:42,844
Ignorance is no excuse
in the eyes of the law.

677
00:52:42,845 --> 00:52:46,134
There's no earthly reason why
anybody should find out is

678
00:52:46,135 --> 00:52:47,810
there, author of my being.

679
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:51,497
So you really think
we're safe, offspring?

680
00:52:51,498 --> 00:52:52,660
Oh safe as houses.

681
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:56,538
Simple see there's you and
me, and Maudie and Leslie.

682
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,706
Who else is there to know?

683
00:53:13,236 --> 00:53:14,236
Oh.

684
00:53:16,008 --> 00:53:17,175
Hello deary.

685
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,456
What are you doing in my room?

686
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:26,094
The porter let me in.

687
00:53:26,095 --> 00:53:27,869
Well I'll let the porter throw you out.

688
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,696
Here, here Harriet, don't
you know me, I'm your long lost

689
00:53:31,697 --> 00:53:32,697
husband.

690
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,583
You mean your my...

691
00:53:37,934 --> 00:53:39,656
Do you mind if I open the window?

692
00:53:39,657 --> 00:53:41,407
Not at all my dear.

693
00:53:42,614 --> 00:53:45,697
So long as you don't give me the air.

694
00:54:04,927 --> 00:54:08,446
Well little girly, we're in clover.

695
00:54:08,447 --> 00:54:09,447
We?

696
00:54:10,662 --> 00:54:12,162
Yes, you and me.

697
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:26,123
Won't you introduce me to your boyfriend?

698
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:27,698
He's not my boyfriend.

699
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,822
No I'm this lady's son.

700
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:33,842
Oh an only child eh, it may
interest you to know young man

701
00:54:33,843 --> 00:54:36,900
the last time I saw you I
distinctly remember you as a

702
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:38,117
little girl.

703
00:54:38,118 --> 00:54:39,547
No you don't.

704
00:54:39,548 --> 00:54:41,403
I do indeed I remember quite
well, I never could make up

705
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:45,071
my mind which one I
wanted, a boy or a girl.

706
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:49,839
Just goes to show.

707
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,416
Are you my father?

708
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:54,178
No chap, but I'll tell you
what I am, if you're this

709
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:57,346
lady's son, then I'm your grandpa see.

710
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:03,240
Now there Harriet, you say
you're glad to see your dear old

711
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:04,074
daddy.

712
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:05,407
I'm delighted.

713
00:55:08,613 --> 00:55:10,946
I must run along, one
or two calls to make.

714
00:55:10,947 --> 00:55:12,052
What calls?

715
00:55:12,053 --> 00:55:15,463
Well I just thought I'd barge
in on the Marquis of Staines

716
00:55:15,464 --> 00:55:19,072
and have a chat about the old
days when he was in love with

717
00:55:19,073 --> 00:55:20,250
your mother.

718
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:22,516
Oh no you don't.

719
00:55:22,517 --> 00:55:25,050
He may remember to pay me
a little sum that he lent me

720
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:26,266
some time ago.

721
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:27,125
How much?

722
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:31,292
Oh it isn't much it's 200
pounds, I'm a reasonable man and

723
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:39,664
as long as I can keep body
and soul together that's all I

724
00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:41,248
ask for here below.

725
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,335
Thank you sonny.

726
00:55:44,336 --> 00:55:46,703
Pleasure's mine pop.

727
00:55:46,704 --> 00:55:50,871
Well goodbye til our next
meeting Harriet Green and son.

728
00:55:55,955 --> 00:55:57,955
Harriet Green and son.

729
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:02,585
Harriet Green and son.

730
00:56:02,586 --> 00:56:03,669
What an idea.

731
00:56:21,888 --> 00:56:24,335
Good morning mother, good morning sir.

732
00:56:24,336 --> 00:56:26,111
Good morning my boy.

733
00:56:26,112 --> 00:56:27,724
I just fixed up the most
marvelous picture contract for

734
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:29,683
you, best bit of waning I've ever done.

735
00:56:29,684 --> 00:56:31,005
Splendid.

736
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:33,466
Well I must be off to
the club, late already.

737
00:56:33,467 --> 00:56:36,550
Think it over my dear, think it over.

738
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:41,526
How would you like to
have a stepfather, what?

739
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:45,481
A step what?

740
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:47,169
He's asked me to marry him.

741
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,170
Ha ha.

742
00:56:49,628 --> 00:56:51,711
What do you mean ha ha?

743
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:55,095
Another of my schemes hashing out.

744
00:56:55,096 --> 00:56:56,601
You've been expecting it?

745
00:56:56,602 --> 00:56:57,593
Expecting it?

746
00:56:57,594 --> 00:56:59,069
Engineering it.

747
00:56:59,070 --> 00:56:59,903
I see.

748
00:56:59,904 --> 00:57:01,916
Can't you see the marvelous
publicity angle of it?

749
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:04,321
Just as we're starting in on the show too?

750
00:57:04,322 --> 00:57:05,953
You mean I ought to accept?

751
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:08,346
Course, later on if you like
you can call the whole thing

752
00:57:08,347 --> 00:57:11,080
off, wouldn't break the old
boy's heart, it's only a

753
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:13,077
sentimental idea of his.

754
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:17,352
And suppose I were to fall
in love, to take a fancy to a

755
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:19,310
man of my own age.

756
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,739
Shh, do be careful my dear.

757
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,569
Well it has been known
to happen you know.

758
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,033
Well it mustn't happen
in your case old girl.

759
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:26,784
And don't you call me old girl.

760
00:57:27,991 --> 00:57:30,243
And if it's any news to you
as my publicity agent, I'm not

761
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:32,381
only going to accept the
Marquis, but I'm going to go

762
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,877
through with it to marry him.

763
00:57:34,878 --> 00:57:36,605
And we can sit by the fire and
talk about the good old times

764
00:57:36,606 --> 00:57:39,485
for the rest of our lives.

765
00:58:57,655 --> 00:58:59,333
It's not like Harriet to be late.

766
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:00,914
She's never been late before?

767
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:03,455
That doesn't prevent it being
excessively irritating that

768
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,539
she is today.

769
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:09,696
You're very pevish today
young man, what's the trouble?

770
00:59:09,697 --> 00:59:11,903
Come on, tell Auntie Maudie.

771
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:14,253
I'll tell Auntie Maudie
to mind her own business.

772
00:59:14,254 --> 00:59:16,813
Oh what a very rude
thing to say to a lady.

773
00:59:16,814 --> 00:59:17,814
Would it be?

774
00:59:18,836 --> 00:59:19,836
Thank you.

775
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:25,813
You're late.

776
00:59:25,814 --> 00:59:28,116
I've been driving around
the park with my fiance.

777
00:59:28,117 --> 00:59:29,547
Oh not the damn Marquis.

778
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:31,684
Don't be such a damn snob Maudie.

779
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:34,244
Oh I like that coming from
you, when you worked the whole

780
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:36,413
thing, you knew you did you naughty boy.

781
00:59:36,414 --> 00:59:39,040
That was a publicity stunt.

782
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:42,007
And publicity's everything,
believe me, isn't it

783
00:59:42,008 --> 00:59:43,091
Mr. Thompson?

784
00:59:43,976 --> 00:59:44,976
Oh you.

785
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:50,017
Now kids, give me a romance.

786
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:52,106
Now here's the spot for it in the show.

787
00:59:52,107 --> 00:59:54,575
Now in this number here, you're chased.

788
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:58,043
I'm in your pursuit, you're very coy.

789
00:59:58,044 --> 01:00:01,669
You the pursuer got that?

790
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,685
Right, now in the first little
ta ta ta, I want a kiss.

791
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:08,297
Very coy again, then in
the second ta ta ta, a more

792
01:00:08,298 --> 01:00:11,637
passionate kiss, and at the
end of the refrain, you're

793
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:12,638
abandoned.

794
01:00:13,336 --> 01:00:14,336
All right.

795
01:00:16,935 --> 01:00:20,274
? As you drum in here
you I ought to fear you

796
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:23,545
? Rather than think you ran

797
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:27,594
? But I can't assemble, it
makes me tremble merely to touch

798
01:00:27,595 --> 01:00:29,476
? Your hand

799
01:00:29,477 --> 01:00:33,644
? Though we're under
conditions I'm so glad

800
01:00:35,787 --> 01:00:39,954
? No proper apprehensions have I had

801
01:00:41,765 --> 01:00:45,932
? All of our transgressing
seems such a blessing in my bed

802
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:56,172
? Dear dear this is much too
nice, it won't happen twice

803
01:00:58,712 --> 01:01:02,879
? Dear dear do you think we should

804
01:01:05,926 --> 01:01:10,093
? Dear dear this is all so
quaint and I'm not a saint

805
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,560
? Dear it's too good to be good

806
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:24,897
? No love scenes on movie
screens compare with the one

807
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:28,023
? We've staged now

808
01:01:28,024 --> 01:01:32,209
? With the urge completely
to merge you'd think we were

809
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,006
? Both engaged now

810
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:39,090
? Dear dear one is made from two

811
01:01:40,184 --> 01:01:42,627
? Which of us is you

812
01:01:42,628 --> 01:01:46,795
? Dear it's too good to be true ?

813
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:06,384
Get ready for your first
kiss kids, you missed it, all

814
01:02:06,385 --> 01:02:07,635
right carry on.

815
01:02:16,638 --> 01:02:20,471
Watch it there's another
kiss coming, oh dear.

816
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,343
Give me romance, come on.

817
01:02:37,497 --> 01:02:39,580
Look happy, there, smile.

818
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,381
Now this is where we kiss.

819
01:02:45,986 --> 01:02:50,166
And hold it while I fade out the lights.

820
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,669
Well if that's romance kids, it's lousy.

821
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,767
Harriet Green and son, there's
a limit to family feeling

822
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:57,741
you know.

823
01:02:57,742 --> 01:03:00,404
Oh there you are my boy, I
want a word with you, will you

824
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,672
excuse us my dear?

825
01:03:01,673 --> 01:03:02,673
Certainly.

826
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:08,690
Has your mother told you?

827
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:12,709
The marriage, oh yes,
yes, congratulations.

828
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:16,050
Oh thank you my boy, thank
you, I knew you'd be delighted.

829
01:03:16,051 --> 01:03:18,717
Now I have a little
proposition to make to you.

830
01:03:18,718 --> 01:03:21,466
It'll be sometime before the
details in my marriage to your

831
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,028
mother can be simple.

832
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:26,484
Now with her age I don't like
to think of how frail she is,

833
01:03:26,485 --> 01:03:29,632
living alone liable to be
accusted by the first newcomer

834
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:32,669
who might be deceived into
thinking she's a young girl.

835
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:35,027
So what do you think I've done?

836
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:38,931
I've taken a charming little
house for the two of you so

837
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:41,932
that you can look after your mother.

838
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:47,241
Oh, well that's very kind
of you but we couldn't, could

839
01:03:47,242 --> 01:03:48,075
we?

840
01:03:48,076 --> 01:03:52,899
No, we couldn't possibly
accept a house from you.

841
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,483
It's lovely, oh it's beautiful.

842
01:03:57,995 --> 01:04:00,031
I'm delighted you like the
new house and I hope you both

843
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:03,458
sleep well on your first night here.

844
01:04:03,459 --> 01:04:05,876
Now goodbye my dear, goodbye.

845
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,308
Goodbye my boy.

846
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:10,642
Goodnight sir.

847
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:16,192
Dear old gentlemen, isn't he?

848
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:28,755
Why didn't you think of one
of those great ideas of yours

849
01:04:28,756 --> 01:04:30,005
to get us out of this one?

850
01:04:30,006 --> 01:04:33,829
Well after all, it's grand publicity.

851
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:37,215
Mr. Thompson if you mention
the word publicity again I

852
01:04:37,216 --> 01:04:38,917
will scream.

853
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:42,417
You seem to think I exist to
give you a state in the papers.

854
01:04:42,418 --> 01:04:44,895
Is there anything in the
world you care for except

855
01:04:44,896 --> 01:04:46,013
publicity?

856
01:04:46,014 --> 01:04:49,533
Well it's my job, and I'm ambitious.

857
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:53,701
And you'd sacrifice everything
for that, wouldn't you?

858
01:05:08,379 --> 01:05:12,642
Good evening my children,
I hope I don't intrude.

859
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:16,810
Not at all, it only needed
you and the day's complete.

860
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:21,407
As a matter of fact
my boy I'm shy of cash.

861
01:05:21,408 --> 01:05:22,558
I thought as much.

862
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,270
So if you would let
me have 2, 300 pounds.

863
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:27,438
You've had 1500 from us already.

864
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:31,384
So I have, but I've got
a lot on my conscience.

865
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,264
I'll let you have the
money tomorrow, now get out.

866
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:35,274
But my daughter, my only daughter.

867
01:05:35,275 --> 01:05:38,419
I'm a reasonable man as long
as I can keep body and soul

868
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:41,029
together that's all I ask for here below.

869
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,857
In your state it's not safe
to let you have the money.

870
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:44,646
It's not safe not to.

871
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:47,727
Not a word, I'm a man of the world.

872
01:05:47,728 --> 01:05:49,561
Now come on come on.

873
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:56,749
Well, there should be
some good publicity in that.

874
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:00,917
I'm rather tired, I think
I'll wish you a good night.

875
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:10,481
Goodnight.

876
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:35,834
Won't you have a cup of tea.

877
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:36,835
Thank you.

878
01:09:39,586 --> 01:09:41,415
I can't sleep a wink.

879
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,916
That's funny, neither can I.

880
01:09:45,991 --> 01:09:46,824
My tea's hot.

881
01:09:46,825 --> 01:09:49,782
That's funny so is mine.

882
01:09:49,783 --> 01:09:51,317
I never sleep in a strange bed.

883
01:09:51,318 --> 01:09:52,568
Neither do I.

884
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:59,854
You know Harriet, I don't
think this stunt is treating you

885
01:09:59,855 --> 01:10:01,047
fairly.

886
01:10:01,048 --> 01:10:05,819
Oh I don't know, it's brought
in a lot more money than I

887
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,648
ever thought I'd have, a career
which I've always wanted,

888
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:13,115
a charming fiance which I'd
always hoped for, and a dear

889
01:10:13,116 --> 01:10:15,949
little son which I never expected.

890
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:20,937
Goodnight.

891
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:53,530
? The world little because a
miracle has brought my lover

892
01:10:53,531 --> 01:10:57,698
? To me, though it's another
place, his face I see

893
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:06,314
? At night I creep in bed,
but never sleep in bed

894
01:11:06,315 --> 01:11:09,822
? Just look above in the air

895
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,990
? And do my sweetest joy, my boy is there

896
01:11:16,632 --> 01:11:20,799
? It is my prince who walks
into my dreams and talks

897
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:30,156
? He dances overhead on
the ceiling near my bed

898
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:36,671
? In my fight through the night

899
01:11:40,107 --> 01:11:44,274
? I try to hide in vain
underneath my counter pain

900
01:11:47,263 --> 01:11:50,846
? There's my love up above

901
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:58,337
? I whisper go away my lover it's not fair

902
01:12:00,647 --> 01:12:04,814
? But I'm so grateful to
discover he's still there

903
01:12:07,469 --> 01:12:11,636
? I love my ceiling more
since it is a dancing floor

904
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:18,693
? For my love ?

905
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:16,306
And I hope that I may still
remain the public's most

906
01:14:16,307 --> 01:14:19,307
obedient.

907
01:14:26,624 --> 01:14:28,914
I've got a great idea.

908
01:14:28,915 --> 01:14:30,335
You have, cough it up my lad.

909
01:14:30,336 --> 01:14:32,652
I think it's just the way
to finish things off a sort of

910
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:34,162
marvelous finale.

911
01:14:34,163 --> 01:14:36,837
I suggest that Harriet Green vanishes.

912
01:14:36,838 --> 01:14:37,838
Vanishes.

913
01:14:39,147 --> 01:14:40,104
Into thin air?

914
01:14:40,105 --> 01:14:42,125
No no no, to South Africa.

915
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:45,912
I see, on the day before
her first night, why?

916
01:14:45,913 --> 01:14:48,580
Because she's tired of it all.

917
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:53,204
Yes well we don't want
her to be tired of it all.

918
01:14:53,205 --> 01:14:54,038
Have you seen the box office receipt.

919
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:57,481
Now wait a minute, she
vanishes, and three weeks later,

920
01:14:57,482 --> 01:14:59,550
her young and beautiful
daughter arrives in England to

921
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:02,507
console her mother's heartbroken
public by taking her place.

922
01:15:02,508 --> 01:15:05,171
You see, she's been studying
singing and dancing hard.

923
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:06,411
On the belt I suppose.

924
01:15:06,412 --> 01:15:07,245
Yes.

925
01:15:07,246 --> 01:15:10,328
No, do you realize what this means?

926
01:15:11,421 --> 01:15:14,215
Impersonation fraud, we've
been lucky enough to get away

927
01:15:14,216 --> 01:15:16,974
with it up to now, now
we've got to go on with it.

928
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:20,808
Well suppose I tell
them it was all my idea.

929
01:15:24,468 --> 01:15:27,137
This young man's crazy Harriet,
do you know what's wrong?

930
01:15:27,138 --> 01:15:28,805
Yes, I think I do.

931
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:33,421
Don't you see Harriet, Harriet
Green the star disappears

932
01:15:33,422 --> 01:15:35,393
and the daughter comes to England.

933
01:15:35,394 --> 01:15:36,956
I see.

934
01:15:36,957 --> 01:15:39,741
And you go to South Hampton
to meet your sister.

935
01:15:39,742 --> 01:15:40,742
My sister?

936
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:42,851
Oh Lord yes.

937
01:15:43,785 --> 01:15:46,868
Oh Lord my sister, oh Lord my sister.

938
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:52,411
It's the excitement,
that's what it is, he's been

939
01:15:52,412 --> 01:15:53,460
overworking.

940
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:56,532
Suppose we do follow
up that idea of Tommy's.

941
01:15:56,533 --> 01:15:59,899
Suppose we do, then
everything gets found out.

942
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,947
Exactly how many of
us would be for the--

943
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:02,781
High drum?

944
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:04,046
Yes.

945
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:07,899
Well you'd be first,
impersonation and fraud, and then

946
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,162
Tommy for posing as your son.

947
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:11,956
What about you and Maudie?

948
01:16:11,957 --> 01:16:14,475
Well of course if you'd like
to have it that you took us

949
01:16:14,476 --> 01:16:17,967
in the same as Staines and the
public, I suppose we get off

950
01:16:17,968 --> 01:16:20,385
without a blood or a scratch.

951
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,707
I see.

952
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,612
Ah my boy, did you get it.

953
01:16:36,613 --> 01:16:40,780
What would you do if I
didn't give you this money?

954
01:16:43,162 --> 01:16:45,118
I'd go straight to Scott and
Yard and give the whole game

955
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:47,202
away, that's what I'd do.

956
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:49,472
Is that a promise?

957
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:50,472
It is.

958
01:16:56,597 --> 01:16:57,597
Hey.

959
01:17:10,054 --> 01:17:11,804
Darling, thank you.

960
01:17:14,627 --> 01:17:17,125
Now you mustn't get too
tired tonight my dear.

961
01:17:17,126 --> 01:17:18,126
I won't.

962
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,383
Darling, come here a minute.

963
01:17:27,618 --> 01:17:29,761
I've got something to confess to you.

964
01:17:29,762 --> 01:17:31,927
Don't tell me you've
kept all my letters.

965
01:17:31,928 --> 01:17:36,095
No, no it's something
much more serious than that.

966
01:17:38,146 --> 01:17:42,313
Look at me closely, is this
the Harriet Green you loved

967
01:17:43,388 --> 01:17:44,388
years ago?

968
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:55,900
Well aren't you furious at
being taken in like this?

969
01:18:01,308 --> 01:18:05,058
I haven't been taken in,
I knew the minute I saw you.

970
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:08,930
I remembered your mother better
than most people you know.

971
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:09,772
But why did you let us--

972
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:12,072
Because I admired your plaque.

973
01:18:12,073 --> 01:18:14,684
Because I like the look of your
young man, because I wanted

974
01:18:14,685 --> 01:18:18,852
you to get away with it, and
because you're Harriet Green

975
01:18:25,111 --> 01:18:26,111
Junior.

976
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:43,355
Come on my dear, I'm sure
it's gonna be a most exciting

977
01:18:43,356 --> 01:18:44,356
first night.

978
01:18:45,212 --> 01:18:47,629
I have a feeling it is too.

979
01:20:51,656 --> 01:20:54,157
Well that went over all right Tommy.

980
01:21:23,499 --> 01:21:28,375
? I've been a prisoner locked in a jail

981
01:21:28,376 --> 01:21:32,643
? Love held the only key ?

982
01:21:32,644 --> 01:21:33,477
Here my girl.

983
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:34,310
What are you doing here?

984
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:36,040
Never you mind, I'm
here and I want my money.

985
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:38,958
Ms. Green it's your quick change.

986
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:44,094
? I want a wonderful feeling
to be free, really free

987
01:21:50,992 --> 01:21:55,010
? So over my shoulder goes one hair

988
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:59,260
? And over my shoulder goes two hairs

989
01:21:59,261 --> 01:22:02,678
? Why should I cry above

990
01:22:03,549 --> 01:22:07,785
? I'm free at last and I'm in love

991
01:22:07,786 --> 01:22:12,521
? Over my shoulder goes three ?

992
01:22:12,522 --> 01:22:14,610
Of course I know the young
man was only having his little

993
01:22:14,611 --> 01:22:18,349
joke with me this morning when
he wouldn't give me my money.

994
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,749
So he didn't pay you?

995
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:23,502
No he didn't, so I've come to you.

996
01:22:23,503 --> 01:22:28,084
After all daughter, I'm a
reasonable man as long as I can

997
01:22:28,085 --> 01:22:32,252
keep body and soul together
that's all I ask for here below.

998
01:23:02,592 --> 01:23:04,130
What would you do if I didn't pay?

999
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:06,286
Well I'd go straight to Scott
and Yard and get the whole

1000
01:23:06,287 --> 01:23:08,475
game away that's what I'd do.

1001
01:23:08,476 --> 01:23:09,653
Is that a promise?

1002
01:23:09,654 --> 01:23:10,654
Yeah.

1003
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:31,080
Mr. Ben, Mr. Ben.

1004
01:23:31,081 --> 01:23:34,581
Oh what's the matter, what's the matter?

1005
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:39,214
What's she doing?

1006
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:40,557
I don't know, she's
never done it before.

1007
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:42,808
She'll never do it again.

1008
01:24:08,683 --> 01:24:10,433
I can't believe it.

1009
01:24:15,954 --> 01:24:18,204
That isn't Harriet Green.

1010
01:24:23,774 --> 01:24:27,107
I don't believe she can do that at 60.

1011
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:43,562
She's a fraud.

1012
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:13,434
Now you know what I've been
dying to tell you for weeks.

1013
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:14,959
A woman of 60.

1014
01:25:21,943 --> 01:25:26,110
Put your house lights up
and bring down that curtaiin.

1015
01:25:28,692 --> 01:25:30,882
What's the matter, put
out the houselights stop the

1016
01:25:30,883 --> 01:25:31,716
orchestra.

1017
01:25:31,717 --> 01:25:33,250
And what are you doing on my stage?

1018
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:35,668
Nothing, it was by mistake.

1019
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:45,855
She's not Harriet Green, she's a fraud.

1020
01:25:48,364 --> 01:25:52,531
Ladies and gentlemen.

1021
01:25:57,621 --> 01:25:59,885
I'm not gonna make a speech,
I'm just going to appeal to

1022
01:25:59,886 --> 01:26:02,803
you as the sporting British public.

1023
01:26:10,889 --> 01:26:13,203
Give us our money back.

1024
01:26:13,204 --> 01:26:14,954
Who's baby are you?

1025
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:21,510
We've been had.

1026
01:26:21,511 --> 01:26:25,441
You've been had, how about
me, I've been in love with

1027
01:26:25,442 --> 01:26:29,609
her for weeks and had to
go about calling her mommy.

1028
01:26:38,244 --> 01:26:41,660
But she's not Harriet Green.

1029
01:26:41,661 --> 01:26:44,348
I know that my friend, but
let me tell you something,

1030
01:26:44,349 --> 01:26:47,768
she's the daughter of Harriet Green.

1031
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:52,693
She hadn't got a job, she was
hungry, a few of you here may

1032
01:26:52,694 --> 01:26:54,371
know what that means.

1033
01:26:54,372 --> 01:26:56,611
But she had the talent she
had inherited from her famous

1034
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:59,926
mother, the talent that
has charmed you tonight.

1035
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:02,154
Now be honest ladies and
gentlemen, it has charmed you

1036
01:27:02,155 --> 01:27:03,155
hasn't it?

1037
01:27:23,095 --> 01:27:26,115
Now ladies and gentlemen, this
girl got a chance to prove

1038
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:28,511
that she had it in her to be a star.

1039
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:32,374
She wanted you to take her to
your hearts, do you blame her?

1040
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:33,458
No.

1041
01:27:35,819 --> 01:27:40,118
Some may say she tried
to defraud the public.

1042
01:27:40,119 --> 01:27:43,292
I respectfully ask you to
note that phrase which is of

1043
01:27:43,293 --> 01:27:45,404
imperative importance.

1044
01:27:45,405 --> 01:27:49,731
Defraud the public, that means
surely to promise something,

1045
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:53,586
to take payment for same, and
then to prove yourself unable

1046
01:27:53,587 --> 01:27:55,861
to fulfill that promise.

1047
01:27:55,862 --> 01:27:58,729
In plain English my Lord,
unable to deliver the goods.

1048
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:03,555
Well ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, this is my case that

1049
01:28:03,556 --> 01:28:06,588
this young lady could not
possibly have defrauded the

1050
01:28:06,589 --> 01:28:09,788
public, because she delivers
the goods and I so prove it.

1051
01:28:09,789 --> 01:28:11,456
I call the prisoner.

1052
01:28:24,343 --> 01:28:26,455
You are charged with
defrauding the public by

1053
01:28:26,456 --> 01:28:30,281
impersonating your mother,
the late Harriet Green.

1054
01:28:30,282 --> 01:28:31,766
What is your name?

1055
01:28:31,767 --> 01:28:33,788
Harriet Green.

1056
01:28:33,789 --> 01:28:35,289
You see my Lord.

1057
01:28:36,628 --> 01:28:38,780
Proceed, proceed.

1058
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:39,971
What is your profession?

1059
01:28:39,972 --> 01:28:40,805
I am an actress.

1060
01:28:40,805 --> 01:28:41,638
And your mother?

1061
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:43,106
She was an actress.

1062
01:28:43,107 --> 01:28:44,408
Who was?

1063
01:28:44,409 --> 01:28:46,985
Her mother my Lord,
the late Harriet Green.

1064
01:28:46,986 --> 01:28:49,353
Who was Harriet Green?

1065
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:54,080
Silence in court.

1066
01:28:54,081 --> 01:28:58,269
Harriet Green my Lord
was a famous stage star.

1067
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:01,539
So you've been singing
several songs of your mother's

1068
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,908
reportou.

1069
01:29:02,909 --> 01:29:03,742
Yes.

1070
01:29:03,743 --> 01:29:05,250
You sing them as well as she did?

1071
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:08,003
Well, it's rather difficult
for me to answer that

1072
01:29:08,004 --> 01:29:09,004
question.

1073
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:11,996
My Lord in my submission it
is a question of facts for the

1074
01:29:11,997 --> 01:29:13,989
jury to judge.

1075
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:15,407
Exhibit A please.

1076
01:29:16,445 --> 01:29:19,395
I have here my lad a
phonographic reproduction of one of

1077
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:22,927
the late Harriet Green's
most famous songs.

1078
01:29:22,928 --> 01:29:26,928
I submit that this is
not admissible evidence.

1079
01:29:28,747 --> 01:29:32,128
In the case of Smith vs.
Smith 1914, to the King's bench

1080
01:29:32,129 --> 01:29:33,546
my lad, page 493.

1081
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:38,699
Was allowed to prove his
statement by demonstration of his

1082
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,700
art my Lord.

1083
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:42,906
Hear the evidence.

1084
01:29:55,453 --> 01:29:59,331
? When you're young it's always spring

1085
01:29:59,332 --> 01:30:03,499
? And life is a happy song,
how we care and sing as we go

1086
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:12,036
? Along, though the years go rushing by

1087
01:30:15,062 --> 01:30:19,229
? And spring is a memory,
life will always be the same

1088
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:28,099
? Sweet song to me

1089
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:38,345
? When there's spring in your heart

1090
01:30:41,448 --> 01:30:45,615
? And the wintery winds that blow

1091
01:30:55,135 --> 01:30:59,302
? Buttercups come peeping through the snow

1092
01:31:02,865 --> 01:31:07,032
? And you love your whole life through

1093
01:31:10,324 --> 01:31:12,824
? And in love

1094
01:31:15,879 --> 01:31:20,046
? And each happy thing will
be evergreen as the sweetest

1095
01:31:21,536 --> 01:31:24,428
? Blooming in June

1096
01:31:24,429 --> 01:31:28,596
? When you've got a little
springtime in your heart

1097
01:31:31,789 --> 01:31:35,956
? When you've got a little
springtime in your heart

1098
01:31:45,563 --> 01:31:49,730
? Over my shoulder goes one
hair, over my shoulder goes

1099
01:31:50,669 --> 01:31:54,502
? Two hairs, why should I cry

1100
01:31:56,329 --> 01:31:59,653
? I'm free at last and I'm in love

1101
01:31:59,654 --> 01:32:03,163
? Over my shoulder goes three hairs

1102
01:32:03,164 --> 01:32:07,331
? Over my shoulder goes four hairs

1103
01:32:10,433 --> 01:32:14,600
? Over my shoulder goes it all ?

1104
01:33:30,258 --> 01:33:33,175
This is all I ask for here below.
