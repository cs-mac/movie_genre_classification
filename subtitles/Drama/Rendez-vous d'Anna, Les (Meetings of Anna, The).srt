You see, one way
to achieve the impossible

is to change the climate.

You are English.

Guilty as charged,
Your Majesty.

786
00:59:54,346 --> 00:59:58,273
Mr. Kincaid's company

with other countries,
Your Majesty.

789
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:05,344
Also, I think, to arrive
at forefront of world

790
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:08,166
in wealth and power, yes?

791
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:16,454
Still, progress
through commerce is logic.

792
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,627
King find most practical

793
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,413
and excellent topic
for discussion.

794
01:00:21,481 --> 01:00:24,417
All due respect,
Your Majesty.

795
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,180
It is a little
far-fetched to think

796
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:29,152
that commerce alone will bring
progress to your people.

797
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,007
Especially when they're
awash with, uh, superstition

798
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:35,369
and fear, like your
lovely concubines here

799

worn, no doubt,

800
01:00:37,674 --> 01:00:40,194
to protect them from us
foreign devils.

801
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:54,373
A friend once said,
Mr. Kincaid,

802
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,224
English also have
fantastical beliefs.

803
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,007
Or am I mistaking
your country

804
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:03,108
for being land
of Merlin and Camelot?

805
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:06,786
Ah. Point taken,
Your Majesty.

806
01:01:06,857 --> 01:01:12,040
However, there's no arguing
the superiority of the English.

807
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:14,212
And in the light of
these dreadful massacres

808
01:01:14,283 --> 01:01:16,225
up and down your border,

809
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:19,681
it's no wonder
you're seeking our favor.

810
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:22,307
Superiority,
Mr. Kincaid?

811
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:23,807
I do not recall anyone
being given the right

812
01:01:23,883 --> 01:01:26,818
to judge whose cultural
customs are superior.

813
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,386
Especially
when those judging

814
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:31,721
have frequently done so
at the point of a gun.

815
01:01:34,571 --> 01:01:36,991
Would you not agree,
Your Majesty?

816
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:40,964

1461
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:35,334
Even if King is also
wanting it to be different.

1462
02:11:37,934 --> 02:11:40,586
I still must go,
Your Majesty.

1463
02:11:48,304 --> 02:11:52,460
So, where is it
you will be going?

1464
02:11:52,528 --> 02:11:54,666
England.

1465
02:11:58,062 --> 02:12:00,070
Home.

1466
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,240
This is good, Mem.

1467
02:12:03,311 --> 02:12:06,344
Very good for Louis
as well.

1468
02:12:17,904 --> 02:12:18,852
What?

1469
02:12:22,129 --> 02:12:24,975
Am wondering if,

1470
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:27,276
given circumstances,

1471
02:12:27,344 --> 02:12:30,574
it is appropriate

1472
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:34,317
for King to ask...

1473
02:12:34,384 --> 02:12:36,392
Anna...

1474
02:12:36,464 --> 02:12:38,220
to dance?

1475
02:12:42,608 --> 02:12:46,023
I have danced with
a king before, Your Majesty.

1476
02:12:51,536 --> 02:12:53,446
And l...

1477
02:12:56,146 --> 02:12:59,561
an Englishwoman.

1478
02:13:24,433 --> 02:13:28,177
Until now...

1479
02:13:28,242 --> 02:13:31,536
Madam Leonowens,

1480
02:13:31,602 --> 02:13:34,536
I did not understand
supposition

1481
02:13:34,609 --> 02:13:39,879
man could be satisfied
with only one woman.

1482
02:14:28,211 --> 02:14:30,032
I was only a boy,

1483
02:14:30,098 --> 02:14:32,465
but the image
of my father

1484
02:14:32,530 --> 02:14:34,287
holding the woman
he loved

1485
02:14:34,355 --> 02:14:35,632
for the last time

1486
02:14:35,699 --> 02:14:38,513
has remained with me
throughout the years.

1487
02:14:38,579 --> 02:14:42,320
It is always surprising
how small a part of life

1488
02:14:42,387 --> 02:14:45,356
is taken up
by meaningful moments.

1489
02:14:45,426 --> 02:14:49,421
Most of them, they are over
before they start,

1490
02:14:49,491 --> 02:14:52,175
although they cast
a light on the future

1491
02:14:52,244 --> 02:14:57,546
and make the person who
originated them unforgettable.

1492
02:14:57,619 --> 02:15:02,222
Anna had shined
such a light on Siam.

1493
02:15:41,111 --> 02:15:44,241
Cannot touch

1494
02:15:44,309 --> 02:15:47,245
Cannot hold

1495
02:15:47,319 --> 02:15:54,061
Cannot be together

1496
02:15:55,607 --> 02:15:58,324
Cannot love

1497
02:15:58,391 --> 02:16:01,292
Cannot kiss

1498
02:16:01,366 --> 02:16:08,438
Cannot have each other

1499
02:16:09,558 --> 02:16:12,820
Must be strong

1500
02:16:12,887 --> 02:16:17,525
And we must let go

1501
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:20,887
Cannot say

1502
02:16:20,951 --> 02:16:24,781
What our hearts must know

1503
02:16:24,855 --> 02:16:28,368
How can I not love you?

1504
02:16:28,439 --> 02:16:32,564
What do I tell my heart?

1505
02:16:32,632 --> 02:16:36,526
When do I not want you

1506
02:16:36,599 --> 02:16:40,975
Here in my arms?

1507
02:16:41,047 --> 02:16:44,788
How does one waltz away

1508
02:16:44,855 --> 02:16:48,882
From all of the memories?

1509
02:16:48,952 --> 02:16:52,879
How do I not miss you

1510
02:16:52,951 --> 02:16:58,135
When you are gone?

1511
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:01,069
Cannot dream

1512
02:17:01,143 --> 02:17:03,992
Cannot share

1513
02:17:04,056 --> 02:17:11,792
Sweet and tender moments

1514
02:17:11,864 --> 02:17:15,126
Cannot feel

1515
02:17:15,193 --> 02:17:18,061
How we feel

1516
02:17:18,135 --> 02:17:25,872
Must pretend it's over

1517
02:17:25,945 --> 02:17:29,523
Must be brave

1518
02:17:29,592 --> 02:17:34,262
And we must go on

1519
02:17:34,328 --> 02:17:37,176
Must not say

1520
02:17:37,241 --> 02:17:41,396
What we've known all along

1521
02:17:41,464 --> 02:17:45,208
How can I not love you?

1522
02:17:45,273 --> 02:17:49,300
What do I tell my heart?

1523
02:17:49,370 --> 02:17:53,460
When do I not want you

1524
02:17:53,529 --> 02:17:57,786
Here in my arms?

1525
02:17:57,850 --> 02:18:01,493
How does one waltz away

1526
02:18:01,561 --> 02:18:05,490
From all of the memories?

1527
02:18:05,562 --> 02:18:09,490
How do I not miss you

1528
02:18:09,562 --> 02:18:13,905
When you are gone?

1529
02:18:13,978 --> 02:18:18,352
How can I not love you?

1530
02:18:32,569 --> 02:18:36,432
Must be brave

1531
02:18:36,506 --> 02:18:40,913
And we must be strong

1532
02:18:40,986 --> 02:18:44,150
Cannot say

1533
02:18:44,219 --> 02:18:50,131
What we've known all along

1534
02:18:51,515 --> 02:18:56,272
How can I not love you?

1535
02:18:56,348 --> 02:19:00,307
What do I tell my heart?

1536
02:19:00,378 --> 02:19:04,341
When do I not want you

1537
02:19:04,412 --> 02:19:08,404
Here in my arms?

1538
02:19:08,475 --> 02:19:12,272
How does one waltz away

1539
02:19:12,347 --> 02:19:16,471
From all of the memories?

1540
02:19:16,539 --> 02:19:20,500
How do I not miss you

1541
02:19:20,571 --> 02:19:24,084
When you are gone?

1542
02:19:24,155 --> 02:19:30,962
How can I not love you

1543
02:19:34,363 --> 02:19:41,554
When you are gone?

1544
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:58,100
