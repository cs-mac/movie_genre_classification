1
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,638
I asked my grandfather or
substance makes us sneeze

2
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,914
and he said, "Yes, but that you also see a sunset.
'

3
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,357
There was not a day that Grandpa
told me nothing would remember.

4
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,592
That day I woke up and I remembered
the days of the La Paloma.

5
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,597
So I called him later.

6
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,872
I had that many days
to give names.

7
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,911
It happened so much.

8
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,712
On that one day.

9
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,832
Forget the misery.
Forget the depression.

10
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,598
Visit the La Paloma,

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,271
Soue Philly's first movie theater
since before the crash.

12
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,316
Completely renovated.
New seats, carpets and
room attendants.

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,154
With air conditioning.
25 cents for a whole
day, up to 18 hours.

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,557
Special midnight show,
just tonight.

15
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,030
I was almost a teenager.
Now I'm almost middle-aged.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,228
The day of the La Paloma was
Saturday, August 26, 1933.

17
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,313
Remembering dates me
by my grandfather.

18
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,919
There is no milk.

19
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,951
I took a lot from him.

20
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,995
Only his bad habits, "said Mamma.
But he did not.

21
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,590
In those days nobody had.
Not difficult ...

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,236
Gennaro is up?
- It was a depression.

23
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,596
Tell him I want to see him.

24
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,598
There is no milk.
- Here.
Grandpa and asking for you.

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,677
The refrigerator ran over.

26
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,868
You had them yesterday
but empty?

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,517
Drink your milk.
And not so frightened. Chew.

28
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,996
Why do you sweep the dust
under my bed ever end?

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,194
Go to your grandpa and give no criticism.
I'm in transition.

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,157
She is always in a transition,
but not change it.

31
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,476
Want to see your dime?
- I saw it yesterday.

32
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,477
And then?

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,592
I've seen it every day
since the crash.

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,950
I think you get it today.

35
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,072
You think all of two weeks.

36
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,918
Sunday was almost there, huh?
Have you already forgotten?

37
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,510
That priest Edmund me the last
rites administered to?

38
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,551
I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,910
I know until I get there.

40
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,271
Make no mistake, today
is going to happen.

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,790
So ... So think of today.

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,599
Prove it.

43
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,593
How do I prove that?
- Easy.

44
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,916
Just give me the penny.

45
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,152
If I now give you the penny,

46
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,716
what should I leave
you if I really go?

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,990
Then I can leave nothing behind.

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,998
You said it's mine when you die.

49
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,755
If you're going to die today,
give it to me today.

50
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,599
I'm not sure if today.

51
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,350
You know until you give me.

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,630
What are you talking to?

53
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,479
Mom, if Grandpa dies
today, he ...

54
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,752
God forbid.
How can you say that?

55
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,712
He said it.

56
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,789
Well, if he dies, someone
let me search.

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,109
Dad, why do you talk about
such things with the boy?

58
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,312
Who else can I talk about dying?

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,629
When I think about it now, I realize
that you must be stupid

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,311
to agree that you will get
one penny when he dies.

61
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,912
I was then sure that I've
never given quarter,

62
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,192
because Grandpa would
never leave us.

63
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,476
Are we going to do something?
- I'll take mom to the clinic.

64
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,275
Her teeth look like, because
"r gums festers.

65
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,833
Jeez.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,878
She'll look like a potato.
A fake smile is too expensive.

67
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,276
Look away right now?
- Afternoon.

68
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,438
We have the whole morning.
- Are we going to church?

69
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,949
A wedding?
- Funeral.

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,876
Soon we have one.
Grandpa says it is today.

71
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,358
Did you get the penny?
- Would I go to church?

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,957
Are we playing field?
- It's too hot.

73
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,835
If I could only go to the movies.
- The church is cool.

74
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,072
This seems like a marriage.

75
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,398
Ma said the niece of our
neighbor has a funeral.

76
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,559
Thank you.
- Over here.

77
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,675
See?

78
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,317
Life on the streets
of Philly Soue

79
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,192
was actually just a movie.

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,678
This was a double movie,
burial and marriage.

81
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,759
Before I saw him, I heard
the announcer in mind.

82
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,679
"Forget the misery, forget
the depression.

83
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,950
Visit the La Paloma. '

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,559
Who would need it?

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,355
It took place before my
eyes a real movie.

86
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,953
Excuse me, but you got
the wrong church.

87
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,392
My neighbor, Victor Sculucci,
married here today.

88
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,392
On the side, please.

89
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,435
Let the family to grieve
in all intimacy.

90
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,354
Daddy, there's a coffin.

91
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,593
What is this a joke?
Get that thing out of there.

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,155
This must be a mistake.

93
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,238
Make sure they remove them.
That's bad luck.

94
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,752
How could you call my daughter
at my happiest days?

95
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,315
It must be a mistake.

96
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,275
We booked the church and priest
Rubolina for 10 hours, today.

97
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,711
We. We are saddled with Edmund.

98
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,310
The evil eye.
I am a widow before I'm married.

99
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,752
Where is my Victor?
- What respect for the dead.

100
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,394
Get that fucking thing
out of there.

101
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,158
What is going on here?

102
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,034
Victor, it's a sign. You die.

103
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,233
I? You also still married.
Coffins bring misfortune.

104
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,432
It is not my coffin.
- Ok.

105
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,917
You can remove them
here more quickly.

106
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,035
Let's put them in the alley.

107
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,032
Forget the misery.
Forget the depression.

108
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,798
Visit the La Paloma.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,516
Soue Philly's first movie theater
since before the crash.

110
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,317
Completely renovated.
New seats, carpets and
room attendants.

111
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,550
25 cents for a whole
day, up to 18 hours.

112
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,430
Special midnight show,
just tonight.

113
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,599
H, Gennar.
- Hi, Uncle Joe.

114
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,395
How does Grandpa?
- The road to the fucking beast.

115
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,431
H, you want a banana?

116
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,158
If you buy a horse.

117
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,951
Come here, drink some.

118
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,597
Stupid macaronivreter.

119
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,233
What time does it open?
- 12 hours.

120
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,439
Afternoon?
- Afternoon.

121
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,556
It must have been
the cold water,

122
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,910
but I had an idea or a dream,

123
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,510
I would go home and grandfather
would walk around there

124
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,790
and dad would give me two coins.

125
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,518
But everything was
the same course.

126
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,195
If only I had more in him.
I always walked around,

127
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,958
wasted time.

128
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,870
I wish I 's had taken
time to say:

129
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,033
"I love you, Grandpa.
"Because ...

130
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,835
I really did.

131
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,993
What no?

132
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,350
No, I have no money.

133
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,194
It's crisis, though.
- Where to get a quarter?

134
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,078
I had to go buy bread
and milk on credit.

135
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,759
That is so gnant

136
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,633
I asked the lady of
the assistance

137
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,516
if we get some more, so
we can get by one week.

138
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,238
She looked at me strangely and said that "Ms.
Spirito,

139
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,159
Many use their money to gamble,

140
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,990
to take the train to go to the coast or to the movies.
'

141
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,557
She said the council is considering
giving us even less.

142
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,194
I said, 'That's great.

143
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,678
Less money, we can starve all the same.
'

144
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,319
She laughed.

145
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,435
She's not a bad woman.
- Can I sell something?

146
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,433
Charm not.

147
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,076
Do we have old newspapers?
- I sold them.

148
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,430
Could I find a job?

149
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,869
How much would you get
so much for wax?

150
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,718
I thought you were asleep.

151
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,950
If a mouse in a meelbak.
- Grandpa?

152
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,593
What now?

153
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,396
How can I tell you what
I did with the penny,

154
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,678
if you do not live like
me publishing it?

155
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,509
Then I do not care what
you do with your money.

156
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,429
I think it's not fair, Grandpa.
- What?

157
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,473
You have to die so I can
go to the movies.

158
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,594
Who said I must be dying?

159
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,758
Nobody said that.
Nobody even thought that.

160
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,274
Even to a large opening to
go, I do not want to die?

161
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,714
What is it?
Are you afraid that
if I am dead,

162
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,595
you will have nobody to get
knots out of your laces?

163
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,430
If I die today, you go to
the movies, you hear me?

164
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,359
Whatever happens.
That's an order.

165
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,628
My father died.
- I heard that.

166
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,513
I was 2 years, 4 months,
1 week, 3 days,

167
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,915
6 hours, 12 minutes
and 7 seconds old.

168
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,680
Ma helped me to calculate that.

169
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,873
Please, do not do it
again when I'm dead.

170
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,911
Does it hurt?
- What?

171
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,350
Die. Some suffering.

172
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,916
Old people, I think.
You will suffer?

173
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,554
I suffered enough, I might
die without suffering.

174
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,753
If you are not suffering, you
can still go to heaven?

175
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,279
If there is a heaven,
I go there.

176
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,551
How would it be there?

177
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,832
It is exactly as you
were proposing.

178
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,669
Until now, nobody knows
more than that.

179
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,550
I can not imagine.

180
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,150
Well, tonight I'll send
you a postcard.

181
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,914
I just got an idea
of ​​what it is.

182
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,069
Well, God bless you.
- It's beautiful.

183
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,078
Rest assured that
you will like it.

184
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,277
You see my house?

185
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,718
The house that God built for me.

186
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,712
Is it finished?

187
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,479
You can not call home,
rather it is a palace.

188
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,435
Of what is it made?

189
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,791
It is made of gold.

190
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,238
Of stone.

191
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,275
When you are born, God begins
to build a house for you.

192
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,231
And whenever there is a good
deed, he put a stone at.

193
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,591
If you do something bad,
he takes a stone.

194
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,191
So in my life as I did
more good than bad,

195
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,359
I think maybe my house
is almost ready.

196
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,472
It's ready.
Now I see it very well.

197
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,593
Do not worry, it's nice there.

198
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,429
I'm not worried. I think you do.

199
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,236
Would you push me sometimes in
my grave for a measly quarter?

200
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,389
I did not mean.
Honestly, Grandpa.

201
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,956
I swear.
- Okay, I know.

202
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,238
While you're there,
scratching it 's.

203
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,629
I'm going to earn a penny.

204
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,079
Grandpa knew that if I am not giving
up something in my head.

205
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,713
And he was right.

206
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,236
But there was no one who knew
less than I earn money.

207
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,236
You took the heart that
I gave you ...

208
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,716
and broke in two.

209
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,118
Now someone did the
same with you.

210
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,835
Is not that a hoot?

211
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,636
Well, you're the little prick

212
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,991
who got the reward he deserved.

213
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,076
Heart Breaker with
the broken heart,

214
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,999
you got what you deserved.

215
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,718
You got your salary.

216
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,395
You took the heart
that I gave you

217
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,830
and broke in two.

218
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,235
Now we did the same with you.

219
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,590
Is not that a hoot?

220
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,749
You're the setter who got
the reward he deserved.

221
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,757
Heart Breaker with ...

222
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,796
Hello, Auntie. Go to your mom?

223
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,594
Are you here to sing for money?

224
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,473
Indeed.
- He 's begging.

225
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,035
Not true, I have to entertain.

226
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,472
That is begging.
You make your mother's
name to shame.

227
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,318
I reveals' r name.

228
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,876
There was never a beggar
in our family.

229
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,119
What you got?
- 3 cents.

230
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,514
Enter.
- No.

231
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,598
Enter.
- I need to earn a penny.

232
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,279
Come on.
- Give.

233
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,359
Maybe God forgives you when
I do a candle burning.

234
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,678
Another one.

235
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
God bless you.
You become so big.

236
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,513
How is your mother?
- Same.

237
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,272
I'll take your grandfather tonight after
Mass homemade macaroni salad.

238
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,274
Grandpa said that during a depression
the strong lose their jobs.

239
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,675
The others lose their minds.

240
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,668
On the day of the La Paloma,
I noticed that it was true.

241
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,915
Today no credit.
- I want a job.

242
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,119
I want no credit, but a job.

243
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,913
You know, there are men
who want to arrest,

244
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,675
because you're better off
in prison than in a loft.

245
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,996
There are kids your age

246
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,432
who put on the street by their
own mother and father.

247
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,838
I work all day for two coins.
Until a quarter to six.

248
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,152
In my time working
up until closing.

249
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,353
When do you close?
- Forget it. Fuck off.

250
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,679
Redeem him.

251
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,637
I have not the soap.
- It's my assistance check.

252
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,991
Do you suffer from the heat?
- Cash in him.

253
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,879
Do you hear it.

254
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,949
This certificate plus ten cents
entitles you to a bar of soap

255
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,199
with a picture of a movie star on.
This is not assistance check.

256
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,791
It is my assistance check.
- I would pay you out Saturday.

257
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,312
Redeem him, please.
- It's not a support check.

258
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,557
My children staring through
the window of hunger.

259
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,433
Jeez, she now gives
me a rotgevoel

260
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,949
because my children can eat.

261
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,516
How do I redeem a 
ertificate for soap

262
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,109
If I can not even give credit?

263
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,395
Maybe ...
Maybe we can arrange something.

264
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,114
Send your man over here.

265
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,756
He went for a walk.
- If he comes back.

266
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,428
He left four days ago.

267
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,589
Want a job? Bring 'r home.

268
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,110
So they do not go hiking.
- Can they pay me?

269
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,878
I'll pay you.
- A penny?

270
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,957
Five cents.
- Ten cents.

271
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,673
Five cents.

272
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,918
Where do you live?

273
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,190
They stare out the window.
- Yes, but what street?

274
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,631
H, let her go.

275
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,473
Let her go.

276
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,118
She must go home.

277
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,353
And one night ...

278
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,397
she will wake up crying because
she stole some potatoes.

279
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,558
This morning there was a fat
lady in a red dress inside

280
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,830
and stole a bag of rice.

281
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,838
I let her alone.

282
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,436
I can not stand that
fat ladies hungry.

283
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,390
Hold it, stupid ragamuffin.

284
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,109
It could be worse, Mr..
Zavattoni.

285
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,279
Let me see.
Keep your head a little higher.
Good.

286
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,039
Your daughter believes
it was the heat,

287
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,119
but you and I know better.
- Help me get up.

288
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,833
Why?

289
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,590
I do not like lying on the ground.
Who knows what the
cats did here.

290
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,837
You had to be hospitalized.

291
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,951
Let me sit in my office.

292
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,757
Keep a seat.
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

293
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,591
Deep breathe, not talk.
- Since when are you
complaining about?

294
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,631
Deep breath. Still 's.

295
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,158
Here he is, now no
longer needed.

296
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,749
Grandfather.

297
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,631
Now it was almost there.
Help me in my office.

298
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,469
Let him sit.
We bring him upstairs to bed.

299
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,036
I'm not going to bed.
- You're so stubborn
like a mule.

300
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,312
I'm not going to bed.
- Just a donkey.

301
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,875
Do not listen. Ok.

302
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,199
Ok, sit.
- I will die out,

303
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,470
where God can see me.

304
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,633
Shut me about the hospital.

305
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,589
I arrived on the same
boat as your uncle.

306
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,792
Do not start over.
- He worked for ...

307
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,037
You think I'm crazy?
Grab my hat.

308
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,159
You know what I saw
when I was lying?

309
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,272
You know what I saw?

310
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,433
I saw the sky.

311
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,399
Really?

312
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,633
I was no more than
a half block away.

313
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,271
You know how it looked?

314
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,435
It looked ... exactly like ...

315
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,191
The new ... La Paloma.

316
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,353
Do you hear him laugh?
In his condition.

317
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,358
How can a man obey me?

318
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,439
Maybe he listens to you
He just ignores me.

319
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,438
What do you mean by
"in his condition?

320
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,632
It is all in order?
- Keep it out in bed.

321
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,031
Is that all?
- That's it.

322
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,711
Will you pay them, to
tell him to stop bed?

323
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,071
Can you give him any medicine?

324
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,629
If you give him a drug,
I make sure he takes.

325
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,635
Maybe it takes something out.
- It will not.

326
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,230
Maybe ...
it takes something out.

327
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,477
You should especially ensure
that he stays in bed.

328
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,309
The pills should be, because
he refuses syrup.

329
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,632
I do not know.

330
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,712
He says he saw the sky.

331
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,038
I was just a joke, but I
think he'm really saw.

332
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,357
I do not understand
why he has not.

333
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,233
Make sure your mother
will find it.

334
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,398
Shall I try s?
- I can manage.

335
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,149
There.
- Do you have many people visit?

336
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,316
There many people died.

337
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,072
Suppose I have a quarter to six to
wear your bag wherever you go.

338
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,989
I get 20 cents?
- I wear my bag myself.

339
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,749
In this heat?
I just need 20 cents.

340
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,229
With such a face, so stubborn,
you have nothing.

341
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,716
Anyway, honest. Come on.
- Do not.

342
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,470
What is that?
- H, boy, are you crazy?

343
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,990
There are people here.
- My grandson is so rich

344
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,156
he throws away money.

345
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,750
That boy's got a doctor.

346
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,633
I'm so sorry.
- What?

347
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,277
I can not pay sidekick.
My patients gain nothing.

348
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,754
Well ...

349
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,150
I can give you ten cents, if you
want to do some dirty work.

350
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,193
I want to do anything.
- Do not say that.

351
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,868
To anyone for any amount
whatsoever.

352
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,036
Tell me what to do.

353
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,152
My burner is full of ash.
You know where I live?

354
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,509
Where is your office?

355
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,110
Climb by my window, in order
not to disturb my wife.

356
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,359
Put newspapers in the baskets
for you the axle does.

357
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,997
Put them under the window, I will put
them in the garbage Wednesday.

358
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,713
Got it?

359
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,430
You want your money.

360
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,279
Here it is.

361
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,076
Some boys were Dr.
Bruna no. They found him funny.

362
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,149
Until that day I did not
know what that meant.

363
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,072
Ms. Bruna?

364
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,433
Dr. Bruna gave me 10 cents
for the ashes to clean.

365
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,279
Who are you?
- Gennaro.

366
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,556
That's a strong name.
Is that your first name?

367
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,958
Yes. My family name is Spirito.
- Spirit.

368
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,633
Do you speak any Italian?
- With Grandpa when he's drunk.

369
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,670
You're a ghost.

370
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,634
Well ...

371
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,948
I must hurry. Go on up.

372
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,870
The dust creeps into your nose.
If you muzzle, your
black handkerchief.

373
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,517
Previously he hired older
boys in his chores.

374
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,234
I'm old enough. I'm twelve.

375
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,669
Twelve is old enough?
- Listen ...

376
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,909
I must really hurry.
If you do not mind ...

377
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,033
You will not get blisters?
- I have strong hands.

378
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,038
Strong, yes, but not beautiful.

379
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,119
I am a boy.
- Did you see Dr. Bruna's hands?

380
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,437
He has the best hands
in the world.

381
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,430
Yes, he's a good doctor.

382
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,712
Those beautiful hands
never touched me.

383
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,519
Not once.

384
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,712
Nowhere.

385
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,589
If you get pneumonia, he did.

386
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,838
I start now, I need
the money on time.

387
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,554
From six hours is
more expensive.

388
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,396
He touched me was not as
bad as the reason why.

389
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,917
He did not confess anything.

390
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,357
Such disease.

391
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,509
And after the job I need
another ten cents.

392
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,996
With the money I have 15 cents.
- Do you 10 cents?

393
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,992
I have over 10 cents,
on my desk.

394
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,479
Want it?
- What should I do?

395
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,309
Go away.
Get out of here, please.

396
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,433
No, I have to clean up the ashes.
He has already paid me.

397
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,629
Do not go. Go upstairs, please.

398
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,312
Jeez, Tullio, you make me angry.

399
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,515
Did you play all programs with girls?
- They are too bossy.

400
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,354
No, I mean play.

401
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,991
Have you's done?

402
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,638
Do not just watch?
- No, just watch.

403
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,479
Why do you think about it now?
- I will not.

404
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,148
Would you do it for 10 cents?

405
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,839
What?
- You know.

406
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,678
Would they give you 10 cents?

407
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,714
It is a sin, paid or not.
- Who knows?

408
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,708
Saturday I will go to confession.
- Let her confession.

409
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,195
Then do not you do more.

410
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,631
Gosh, I do not even
know what to do.

411
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,400
You want me to go, huh?
- Do you?

412
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,794
A lady?

413
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,638
How old?
- A lady, so old.

414
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,479
A mother?
- She has no children.

415
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,195
Her husband did not hurt his hands.
Shut up about it.

416
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,756
She has tested just how
much money I wanted.

417
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,516
If I could go, we will
share the money?

418
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,029
Share?
With 5 cents, I can do nothing.

419
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,993
I share the sin, including
the money.

420
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,159
What did you do that?
- Something from last summer.

421
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,594
I want to share.
- Gennaro, wait.

422
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,878
Come on.
- But we ...

423
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,399
Come on.

424
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,193
Come on.

425
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,069
Call her.
- We're clearing the first axis.

426
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,034
I did not ...
- When she hears noise,
she comes.

427
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,708
You want the hair that
God sees sin.

428
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,229
I'm sorry I let you come.

429
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,555
Did come?

430
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,991
Turn on the light, wall
underneath the stairs.

431
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,113
Go along.
- Damn.

432
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,196
I did not tell the grandfather,
by his weak heart.

433
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,231
But my mother was gone.

434
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,352
He did not utter a sound.

435
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,795
He gave me a safe feeling.

436
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,072
He said it was not my fault.

437
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,874
That he kept repeating.

438
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,075
Did you hear what
I told grandpa?

439
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,875
Really, Mom, I just wanted
to clean up the ashes.

440
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,757
No, that's not true.

441
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,278
Go back to sleep.

442
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,954
I tell you ok grandpa are.

443
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,280
Did my grandfather
sneakers again?

444
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,191
What's wrong, Mom?

445
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,391
He sits all day every
morning in the Sun

446
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,919
You'd think his face would
get some color.

447
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,717
In the shadow you see his face
paler than yesterday.

448
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,116
As if the sun went by
without him noticing.

449
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,749
What kind of world is it if not what
color you get from the sun?

450
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,033
Ma?

451
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,435
I have insurance classification
last month.

452
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,268
What does this mean?

453
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,950
That I do not penny
more to give.

454
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,832
I do not want.
- Yes it is.

455
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,192
For once you are wrong.
- I'm not mistaken.

456
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,155
You want to film, anyway.

457
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,831
It does not mean we are poor
and crazy women scare you.

458
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,951
You have something in your head

459
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,755
and you notice that others
do not have a breakdown.

460
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,190
You only think, 'I want, I will.
'

461
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,076
And you do not realize is
that nobody can give you.

462
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,118
Give me a towel.

463
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,278
Do you cry when you're mad?
- You should cry.

464
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,514
Why, you do not want a dime?
Why not?

465
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,191
Because you do not get it?
I can cry my whole life.

466
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,960
I never heard you talk.

467
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,072
Now I believe you are sitting
in the transition.

468
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,510
Come here, scamp.

469
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,799
You know what I'm saying?

470
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,550
I say I'm not a penny. Get it?

471
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,150
I can not give. But you want it.

472
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,874
Who says?
- Your mom says.

473
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,277
Why you are so smart.
- Come on.

474
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,118
And I'm not smart.

475
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,315
Your father never said I was smart.
Otherwise, he said that,

476
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,988
for he never missed anything.

477
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,114
Will you give me a
glass of water?

478
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,994
After we buried him, I sat
here crying for weeks.

479
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,876
I did not utter a sound.
But I sat here crying like
a deaf mute girl.

480
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,719
No sound.

481
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,389
They said: 'You should care for your child, you put over it.
'

482
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,918
I said, "I can not help it.
I want my husband.

483
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,999
I want him to come through the door and ...
"You know.

484
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,797
I always had a dream.

485
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,994
He saw me sitting there, in
black, crying like a fool,

486
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,636
and he said, "Why are you crying?
I'm not dead.

487
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,196
It was a joke.
I was in Atlantic City. '

488
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,949
And we laughed and laughed and ...
God ...

489
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,239
I wish that dream was real.

490
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,394
God, that I wanted so badly.

491
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,435
Little by little she
helped me on top

492
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,270
and I saw that it does not
feel like the impossible.

493
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,952
But when I finally said, 'OK,
it's impossible "...

494
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,912
You know what happened?

495
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,716
I never had that
beautiful dream.

496
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,155
And from that day,

497
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,668
God how I beg before
I go to sleep,

498
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,234
I can not dream of him.

499
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,234
I can not dream of him.

500
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,351
If you give me 's would not
interrupt you for flies,

501
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,235
you would know that I no
longer need the penny.

502
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,590
I only need 10 cents.

503
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,076
Then you have 15 cents.
Go buy me a can of tomatoes.

504
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,034
I know you've hidden some
money somewhere.

505
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,513
It would be in summer school,

506
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,473
because then children make
their parents crazy.

507
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,151
What am I?
I get even more glass of water?

508
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,353
Someone to talk to?
- Okay, Dad, you slept.

509
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,073
Watch out.

510
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,075
This may be the last glass
of water that brings me.

511
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,317
Bring him and talk to him.
- It's five hours.

512
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,559
I still earn 10 cents.
- Use your grandfather talk

513
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,389
be nice, and I'll give
you ten cents.

514
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,591
Promised.
- Yeah, right.

515
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,076
Look at me.
I once broke a promise?

516
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,353
Well, that all mothers do.
Come on, come on.

517
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,435
It's coming.

518
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,198
Put it down there.

519
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,119
Come talk to me?
- Until I aanheb my sneakers.

520
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,078
Your mother said you had
to do with me talking

521
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,432
not until you're wearing sneakers.
- Your ears miss nothing, huh?

522
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,430
I know one thing.
If I have five minutes to die,

523
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,110
you would not get your quarter.
- Why not?

524
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,110
Because ...
you want to do me a favor.

525
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,993
Who says?
- Do you?

526
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,193
What?
I mean, sure, but what then?

527
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,672
I've been here one whole
day to think ...

528
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,514
Especially since this
is my last day.

529
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,109
I need someone for a favor.

530
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,154
Not your mother, who would
drop dead of shock.

531
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,638
I must therefore ask you.
- Well, ask me.

532
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,752
Take care, it is not easy.

533
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,670
You must ask me first.
- That's the hardest.

534
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,560
Ok, come here. Sit down here.

535
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,315
When I was a young
man, 17 years old,

536
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,670
I came here with my wife.

537
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,350
I know.
- She was my wife.

538
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,030
She was a girl I
met on the boat.

539
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,677
I always call her my wife, even
though we were not married.

540
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,110
And then?
- Well ...

541
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,517
In my hometown, Abruzzi,

542
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,393
The men had a saying.

543
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,913
And that means ...

544
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,916
"If a man is virgin on
his wedding night,

545
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,590
he remains a virgin throughout his life.
'

546
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,314
Can men than virgin?

547
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,877
Will you ever interrupt me?
- Continue.

548
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,519
So ...
as my wedding night approached,

549
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,554
played again by saying
that my head.

550
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,433
I could not touch
your grandmother,

551
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,668
because I wish they were immaculate
as they walked to the altar.

552
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,758
But I was still a virgin.
I had to do something.

553
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,876
I started looking around for the
good of your grandma, and ...

554
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,391
I found a girl ... Guendolina.

555
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,397
Guendolina was much
older than I,

556
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:35,037
but very frail.
As slender as a doll
in a shop window.

557
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,873
Anyway ...

558
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,155
I will keep the story short.

559
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,438
I told her I was engaged.

560
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,838
I let her believe that ...

561
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,035
if they treated me well, you
know, I 'r would marry.

562
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,596
She gave herself to me.
Do you understand?

563
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,632
When I married your grandmother.
That was bad of me.

564
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,559
It is the only sin I
have ever committed,

565
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,478
I could not forget.

566
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,878
Have you ever confessed?
- What could I confess?

567
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,470
I committed the sin
against Guendolina.

568
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,592
A priest forgive me.
That's his job.

569
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,518
But Guendolina ...

570
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,430
I am playing with the idea that
she has never forgiven me.

571
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,995
Have you ever asked her that?

572
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,159
That's what you do for
me before I die.

573
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,999
That's the favor I ask.
- I?

574
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,553
She lives in ...

575
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,476
Norwood Street, 6 ... 4 ... 3.

576
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,276
With her two sons.
- Maybe they moved.

577
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,357
She is not moved.

578
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,596
I have often thought to
go himself, but ...

579
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,116
it never happened.
And now I can not remember.

580
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,237
You must do it for me.

581
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,592
Well? Do not do it?
- Absolutely not.

582
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,950
Please, Gennaro.

583
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,513
Do not let me die with
this on my soul.

584
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,756
Look, it's simple.

585
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,077
You just go to her and says:

586
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,840
"I'm Gaetano's grandson.

587
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,912
He sent me to say that he regrets what he did.
'

588
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,918
She remembers you down anymore.

589
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,510
She remembers me, believe me.

590
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,759
After what happened to her, by me.
- What happened?

591
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,517
You're too young.
Where you going?

592
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,918
I'm not going to her.
- Come on. Gennaro, come on.

593
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,236
Tell me what happened.

594
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,639
Ok, come here.

595
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,072
A few years after
this happened ...

596
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,031
Guendolina had handled
her disappointment

597
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,390
and married.

598
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,119
It is obvious that her
future husband ...

599
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,751
thought he was married
with a clean girl.

600
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,679
But ...

601
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,390
on the wedding night he
discovered the truth.

602
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,158
Who told him?

603
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,110
Nobody should tell
a man something.

604
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,836
He hit her. Very.

605
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,437
He hit all her front teeth.

606
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,792
She never got a false tooth.
- Then she looks like a potato.

607
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,628
Ok, now go. It is getting late.

608
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,595
I'm Gaetano's grandson and I
must say that he repents.

609
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,712
From what he did.
- From what he did.

610
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,558
Would you forgive him?

611
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,588
Wait, wait.

612
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,913
You're right.

613
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,038
You're right.

614
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,350
I have to walk.
- I did not say.

615
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,709
No, I have.

616
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,390
Until Norwood Street?
That you never get.

617
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,433
I'll lean on you, to your door.

618
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,632
I'm not going inside.
- Up to the door.

619
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,997
Forget it, Grandpa.

620
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,873
Sit down to catch his breath.

621
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,397
I'm going down.

622
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,192
Maybe God still places
a stone on my house.

623
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,033
What, Dad?

624
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,955
Stop singing that song.

625
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,872
What song? I do not sing.
- La Golondrina.

626
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,753
I know La Golondrinaniet agree.

627
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,117
My heart does pain.

628
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,678
That was the secret that
Grandpa carried.

629
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,758
It was already after 5 hours,
the La Paloma had to wait.

630
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,916
There was almost nothing.

631
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,998
I just had to say he was sorry.

632
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,032
Guendolina live here?

633
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,709
But for a reason.
To her neighbors life miserable.

634
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,430
I hope you have a good reason.

635
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,598
My grandfather sent me.
- It's good.

636
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,189
If your grandfather is the pope.

637
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,195
I want to speak Guendolina.

638
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,914
I have something for her.
- What? I will give her.

639
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,429
I have to do, it's a message.

640
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,790
My mother is the supper.

641
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,639
Briefly. Then grandpa die happy.

642
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,149
We could always get along well.

643
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,275
He ran inside.

644
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,518
Sit down. Give Mom her food.

645
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,598
What do you want?

646
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,308
Who are you?
- I'm Gaetano's grandson.

647
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,638
I had to say he was sorry.
Would you forgive him?

648
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,312
Come here.

649
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,428
Gaetano's grandson.

650
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,919
Eat.

651
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,752
He will carry me.
- I?

652
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,519
Gaetano Zavattoni's grandson.

653
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,718
I gotta go. It's late. Please?

654
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,910
Put it half full.

655
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:06,830
If you have more brags,
I spit it out.

656
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,594
What did you tell me?

657
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,360
Is sorry. Would you forgive him?

658
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,028
It is almost six hours,
the price rises.

659
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,631
I still have 10 cents to fetch
and say you liked it.

660
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,434
Did he say what he did?

661
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,959
Will you ever do that too.

662
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,150
Boys are born ... to destroy.

663
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,031
Let him go, mom.

664
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,712
You did too much.

665
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,349
But not enough.

666
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,396
Boys are born unclean.
- I do not know.

667
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,717
You are unclean.
- Mom, stop it.

668
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,115
Louis, lure not fight off.

669
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,438
Give Gaetano's grandson
a plate and some food.

670
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,232
No, I do not have time.

671
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,558
Say that you forgive him, yes
or no, before it's too late.

672
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,230
Is he dead?
- For me, I mean.

673
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,638
Kiss me.

674
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,029
Then I'll forgive him.

675
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,553
Give me ten cents.
- Where did you go?

676
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,318
I can not say.

677
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,830
Ok, it's between
you and Grandpa.

678
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,598
Here's your ten cents.

679
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,556
She has forgiven you, Grandpa.

680
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,110
I heard only the announcer:

681
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,072
"Forget the depression.

682
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,637
Soue Philly's new cinema.
New seats, carpets. '

683
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,755
I ran as fast as I could go.
Nothing could stop me.

684
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,672
That was it.

685
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,068
Philadelphia's newest cinema

686
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,029
After what had happened,
I had no sense anymore.

687
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,468
Ma was probably right.

688
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,990
If I did not get my way,
anyone in the tree.

689
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,437
But that place was something
I did not come loose.

690
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,358
I went back and stared at it.

691
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,679
But now it seemed so far away.

692
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,994
Grandfather.

693
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,319
Grandpa?

694
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,676
For my grandpa

695
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,713
Grandfather.

696
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,791
Are you there?

697
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,794
What do you do when our
heart is breaking?

698
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,673
I do not know.
- The doctor wants a blanket

699
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,235
for your grandfather. Bring him.

700
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,755
Is grandpa ok?

701
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,674
Yet you went to La Paloma?
- The price was increased.
50 cents.

702
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,552
I only have a quarter.

703
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,594
Well, if there is
a midnight show,

704
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,189
you will certainly get.

705
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,233
I looked at the stuff
in your room.

706
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,591
And what did you steal?

707
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,711
I love you, Grandpa.

708
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,315
Get that blanket away.
I sweat out of me.

709
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,114
you can never do what
the doctor says?

710
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,470
I do not even listen
to my real doctor.

711
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,998
He is here simply because
the other his wife ...

712
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,189
Where's your mom?
- In the parlor, to cry.

713
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,150
Ask her if she can stop
crying long enough

714
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,351
coffee for me to continue.

715
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,871
He is one of the guys ...

716
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,594
who saw the woman hanging there.

717
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,598
He found her.

718
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,390
He is so scared.
He does not know how
scared he is.

719
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:23,278
Someday he a lamb hanging in
the window of the butcher

720
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,631
and vomiting.
The onlookers will say:

721
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,071
"What's that guy? He left. '

722
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,428
Dad?

723
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,112
Want coffee?

724
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,717
Are you sure? Ok.

725
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,718
If he wants coffee,
he can go to bed.

726
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,992
No bed.
- You can not lie.

727
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,033
Please, no.
- What if it rains?

728
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,630
Then we need umbrellas on him.

729
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,276
Joe, are you there?
- Yeah, Dad, here I am. What?

730
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,790
I want to apologize
for what I did

731
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,719
that your wife was
such a curmudgeon.

732
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:08,119
Nice of you, on your deathbed.
- Sorry. Come, give me a kiss.

733
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,074
Put him up.

734
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,590
Where is the nurse?
- No ambulance.

735
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,228
The doctor knows best.
- Send him away.

736
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,512
Send him away.
- Get out of here.

737
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,030
My father gets what he wants.
Leave him alone.

738
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:32,473
We will take turns to sit
with him to talk to him.

739
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:37,151
Place a large coffee.
Get seats to sit on.

740
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,396
Go home, you. And ...

741
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:44,312
Tell your cousins ​​to their
father and I stay here,

742
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,272
they do not have to wait.

743
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,153
Want a piece?
- No, thanks.

744
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:06,358
When I think back, I could
hardly understand

745
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,677
how one could have fun,
dancing, laughing,

746
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,874
while the world was so poor and my
grandfather was sick at home.

747
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,878
I was that day as adults.
Everyone does his best.

748
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,278
The beauty of life is
that it continues.

749
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,189
Our Father which art in heaven.

750
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,753
Hallowed be thy name.

751
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,032
Thy will be done ...
No, Your kingdom come.

752
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,312
Thy will be done on
earth as in heaven.

753
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,193
Grandpa?

754
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,556
She promised that she would
not let me close my eyes.

755
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,436
You see, you can not trust them
once they reach adulthood.

756
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,835
Would you stay here, Gennaro?

757
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:02,597
Keep my eyes closed.
You promise?

758
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,438
Okay, Grandpa.

759
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,358
As I close, save me.
- Ok.

760
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,917
But lettuce is not too hard, because ...
I'm not that strong.

761
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,634
Grandpa?
- What now?

762
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,070
Only people to die?

763
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,914
Dogs and cats die too.

764
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,597
I do not mean.

765
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,598
Lamps die.
- I mean other things.

766
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,438
The things inside us.

767
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,837
You mean the feelings we have?

768
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,955
Yes, they die too.
- No, just people dying.

769
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:46,593
Jeez, you ask me a question
because you know the answer

770
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,598
and then you give me the answer,

771
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,553
as if it was I who asked
the question.

772
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,116
I'm sorry.
The things we die too.

773
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,117
How do you know?

774
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,596
You think all I say is
true because I die?

775
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,030
No, I knew it before.

776
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,599
Please, let me die crying.

777
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,509
Can I sleep here tonight,
besides you?

778
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,156
Are you afraid that you
do not get dime?

779
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,635
I did not need, Grandpa.

780
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,318
What did you say?

781
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,877
Really, I do not need it.
- Why?

782
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,237
Why did not you need?
- I do not want the movie.

783
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,236
You no longer require,

784
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,953
that is something else.
- What 's the difference?

785
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,357
It is an enormous difference.

786
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,395
Your belly needs.

787
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,317
Your heart desires.

788
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,110
That's the difference.

789
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,271
What's wrong with you?

790
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,798
You stand under the same
cloud as everyone else?

791
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,150
You're twelve years old.

792
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,955
You can also run faster
than any cloud.

793
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,357
I did when I was your age.

794
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,238
I wanted to come here, that I wanted
more than anything else.

795
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,797
Everyone said, 'No, I can not.
It is impossible. '

796
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,951
But here I am.

797
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,832
In what kind of world
I live today?

798
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,239
Someone should just say something
is impossible ...

799
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,635
and then nobody wants it yet.

800
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,876
As if ...
longing for something
impossible ...

801
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,151
impossible.

802
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,116
Why do you talk with
your eyes closed?

803
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,390
I had to promise you.

804
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,716
You must promise me one thing.

805
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,874
Will you do that?
- Why not.

806
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,993
Wish.

807
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,952
Wish.

808
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,271
What do I desire?

809
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,875
Open your eyes, Grandpa.

810
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,991
I'll hit hard.

811
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,273
Grandpa?

812
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,631
I'll hit hard.

813
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,874
Grandpa?

814
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,599
What is it?

815
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,432
Dad?
- What did he mean?

816
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,030
I promised him something,
but I do not know what.

817
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,873
Come on.

818
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,514
Pa.

819
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,635
You must not stay, Gennaro.

820
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,150
You do not need such images
in your head prints.

821
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,270
Just go to my house.

822
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,278
Thank you, Grandpa.

823
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,753
You know how it looks above?

824
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,473
It looks like La Paloma.
