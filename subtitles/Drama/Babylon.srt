1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,250
The minute he takes the
Iron Chair, your head on a pike.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,550
I think you should apply
for Commissioner.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,950
You are a contender.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,050
I missed the gun,

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,100
~ He was packing and I missed it.
~ It weren't your fault.

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,330
He bottled it. His head's gone.

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,450
~ Someone's fucking us.
~ Where did this come from?

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,610
There's something I thought you'd
like to know about Charles Inglis.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,130
~ He's under investigation.
~ He's got a little silver bell.

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,530
Whenever he's feeling sad,
he gives it a little ring.

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,970
Just give me some space!

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,890
Would it be fair to say
your judgement's gone?

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,010
I'm never going near a gun
for the rest of my life!

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,170
I should've said something,
but I didn't!

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,730
~ It wasn't him! ~ Nah.

16
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,850
PCSOs.

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,490
A representative snapshot of London,
and you at the head of it.

18
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,810
I did something
and no-one else knows about it.

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,890
I moved the gun, Matt.

20
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,610
~ So, you moved the gun
next to his hand? ~ Yeah.

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,660
That's exactly what I did.

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,050
Don't worry.
This PCSO idea is dead in the water.

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,170
~ As soon as she says it.
~ It's pre-killed.

24
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,610
She's bringing home
a brand-new puppy,

25
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,660
but I've already dug its grave.

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,450
Thank you!

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,810
Thank you, gentlemen!

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,090
Drop your cocks and grab some Ewoks,
it's the return of the Jedi!

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,890
Yes, man!

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,850
~ Yes, Robbie! ~ Yeah!

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,900
What you saying?
You fucking missed us?

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,530
I know you're concerned
that three of the officers

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,290
involved in the Karl Jeffries
incident are back on duty,

34
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,340
but the inquiry was fair
and it was thorough.

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,130
And one officer has been suspended,

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,970
but that doesn't mean
we can't improve.

37
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,570
What about Karl? Tell us the truth!

38
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,210
~ Justice for Karl! ~ Justice!

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,890
OK, thank you.

40
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,940
I personally believe in a new era
of openness

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,570
and that all Police Community
Support Officers,

42
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,090
who are, of course, they're drawn
much more broadly,

43
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,140
from the black, Asian
and minority ethnic populations,

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,770
all of them,
after a brief induction,

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,210
should be made full police officers.

46
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,130
Jesus Christ!

47
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,490
So, I don't say anything publicly?

48
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,530
No need. You stay quiet.
She's kicked the wasps' nest.

49
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,450
Let's see how she likes it
when a swarm comes

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,130
and stings her up the wazoo.

51
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,450
All right, but... take it easy.

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Final interview is tomorrow.
I don't want this to explode.

53
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,650
Just one question, this is from me,
but is the wazoo,

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,010
is that the front bottom
or the back bottom?

55
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,410
I never know.

56
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,090
~ Really good question, Tom.
~ Thank you.

57
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,090
Yeah, why don't you Google it
and fuck off out of my face?

58
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,770
Hi, Sally?

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,770
Yeah, just a bit of background
on this Community Support bollocks.

60
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,370
~ How would it work?
~ Who's going to pay?

61
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,330
Look, Sharon Franklin
isn't even Commissioner... yet.

62
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,210
What Sharon's saying is

63
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,770
we cannot gain the trust of London
until we look like London.

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,890
Failure to gain the trust
of people of colour runs like a wire
in a time bomb

65
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,930
through everything that's gone wrong
in this city for the last 50 years.

66
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,210
And what we're saying is, we can fix
that and we're going to fix that.

67
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,770
Are you running, or is she, Liz?

68
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,410
Fuck off, Harry.

69
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,690
Liz, I wanted to show you
this and get your reaction.

70
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,740
~ What is this? Can we do this later?
~ Er... you might want to take a look.

71
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,690
Why are my eyes looking at this?

72
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,530
Well, that's your officer.
That guy went straight out on duty

73
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,930
and shot Karl Jeffries
at the nightclub.

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,730
Apparently, he's back on duty today.

75
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,170
How long has this been up?

76
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,090
~ Four-and-a-half minutes. ~ Right.

77
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,140
Thank you.

78
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,930
Yeah, that's something...

79
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,410
Well, it's vital to the
integrity of London Police.

80
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,130
On pay and pensions,

81
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,450
officers may well have to take
a short-term hit.

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,500
What about this?

83
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,930
~ Um...
~ How long have you known about this?

84
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,730
Look, I'm sorry.

85
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,290
~ Bear with me. ~ We need to get you out.

86
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,340
I'm just hearing about this,
um... right now, with you.

87
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,650
So... I'm concerned.

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,700
And if there is any doubt
about the officer in question,

89
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,260
the investigation could be reopened.

90
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Thank you.

91
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,490
And so, in conclusion,
can I just say, justice is blind.

92
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,770
And that is why, if you give
her norks a squeeze and run fast,

93
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,250
she's very unlikely to be able
to ID you in a line-up.

94
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,730
What about Warwick?

95
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,250
Warwick's off ops.

96
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,300
We got a slapped wrist on that one.
It all came out.

97
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,570
Oi-oi! It's Osama bin Banjo.

98
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Britain's most wanted
waste-disposal terrorist.

99
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,370
They're going to reopen
your investigation.

100
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,170
What? Are you serious?

101
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,410
We're back on duty tonight.

102
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,050
One video and the brass buckle?

103
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,690
Guv?
They can't do this, can they, Guv?

104
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,610
Are we on duty tonight, or what? Guv?

105
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,090
Can I get a Twix and a cup of tea,

106
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,570
or do you want me to bend over for
a set of fucking psychological tests?

107
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,620
I'm checking it out.

108
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,770
Fuck!

109
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,210
Plastic pigs into cops? Seriously?

110
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,810
Pension cuts, overtime cuts,

111
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,610
job security knackered.

112
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,050
Amazing!

113
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,330
Sharon Franklin gets her kite out
and starts flying it

114
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,770
and I go home, and what?

115
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,690
I can't fucking sleep
because I don't know

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,690
if I can afford a pot to piss in
when I retire.

117
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,370
This is Battleship Potemkin.

118
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,810
Kronstadt. 1905. The Black Sea.

119
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,810
The Imperial Russian Navy are served
borscht made with rotten meat.

120
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,570
The men rebel. An empire falls.

121
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,370
Oh, right, that Potemkin.

122
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,770
I was getting mixed up
with all the other Potemkins.

123
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,330
Never heard of Battleship Potemkin,
Davina? That surprises me.

124
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,450
What the fuck's wrong with you two?

125
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,250
Oi, Davs, can I borrow your face?
I want to go rat-catching.

126
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,130
Black and white. Russian.
And silent.

127
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,970
Uh-huh. The big three.

128
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,370
Oh, hello!

129
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,210
Hey, Davs, here's a question
for you.

130
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,010
How would you like to see
your husband

131
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,060
going absolutely fucking mental
on a rubbish bin?

132
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,250
Oi!

133
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,210
"The inquiry into the death of
Karl Jeffries could be reopened."

134
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,290
It follows confirmation
from police sources

135
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,530
that the rubbish bin vandalism
footage sweeping the internet

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,290
does indeed feature
an officer involved in the shooting.

137
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,340
Another of the officers involved
has already been suspended.

138
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,450
You off shift?

139
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,610
What's it to you? Got mates
coming over, as it happens.

140
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,170
Yeah, all right, mate. No worries.

141
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,970
Sorry. Er...

142
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,090
Cheers. Sorry.

143
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,010
So the governor wants extra
directed patrols through Earlsfield.

144
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,850
A number of weapons we're aware of
out of Nottingham have come south.

145
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,330
Now, it shouldn't involve us,
but be aware.

146
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,850
OK? Any questions so far?

147
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,090
Yes, sir.

148
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,050
Sir, will you be wanting us
to take the guns out today, sir?

149
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,490
~ How do you mean? ~ Shooting guns,

150
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,530
with the bullets that make holes
in the baddies.

151
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,810
Will you be wanting us
to carry those around today, sir?

152
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Because we're thinking we might not.

153
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,570
~ OK, what's... ~ It's bollocks, Guv.
What they're saying about Banje.

154
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,450
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
you're on duty.

155
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,290
I've received nothing to suggest
otherwise as yet, so...

156
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,650
Oh, I'm allowed out, am I?

157
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,050
Just don't touch anything
or play with the sirens, is it?

158
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,050
Senior officers
are aware of your situation

159
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,090
and at this time,
they want to support you.

160
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,410
Yeah, well, they're providing about
as much support as my nana's bra.

161
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,010
It's a fucking ornamental belt.

162
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,450
We're not picking up our weapons
today, Guv.

163
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Well, obviously, as you know,
that's at your discretion.

164
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,900
So, can I start off by telling you
a bit about the production company

165
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,930
set up to find a mass audience
for serious current affairs?

166
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,610
I don't want to be rude, but I'm
going to come right out with this.

167
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,890
~ Oh, right.
~ I've got the fucking mother lode.

168
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,490
~ You have the mother lode?
~ I have the mother lode, yeah.

169
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,170
Don't ask me how, but I've been
filming a renegade cop for months.

170
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,690
You see, he's admitted, on camera,

171
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,970
to covering up the Jeffries
shooting.

172
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,050
The kid never had a gun.
At least not in his hand.

173
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,570
That's interesting.

174
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,090
Oh, yeah, it's interesting.
It's bidding war interesting.

175
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,140
It's "get your MD in here
and make me an offer" interesting.

176
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,730
I am a managing director.

177
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,570
Yeah?

178
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,570
Good. Well, I'll be talking to a few
of your competitors this week

179
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,770
and I'll be inviting offers
by Friday.

180
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,930
You're very aggressive.

181
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,570
The king of the jungle
don't drink peppermint tea, you know.

182
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,890
Get into bed with me,

183
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,940
you'll be burping BAFTAs
and shitting Emmys, yeah?

184
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,490
This may not be in direct
contravention

185
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,130
of clause 2.11 of your terms
of employment,

186
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,180
but it's in contravention
of the spirit of it. Yes?

187
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,490
Also, gentlemen,
on a personal level,

188
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,010
can you see how this looks for me?

189
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,060
They want to fill the service up
with jumped-up traffic wardens!

190
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,610
Is that who you want next to you
when the petrol bombs are coming in?

191
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Eh? Eh? A plastic pig melting away?

192
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,050
We need to have a think
how we respond.

193
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,850
I'll tell you how I think we respond.

194
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,130
Apparently, the ARV relief
are not picking up their guns.

195
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,010
I think, personally,

196
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,060
~ today, we let the brass know that
you don't fuck with the TSG. ~ Yeah.

197
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,730
So if you value the work I've done
for you,

198
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,810
then, yes, I'm ordering you.

199
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,290
But, also, I'm saying,
let's work together

200
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,530
to create a new paradigm of trust.

201
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,970
Bollocks!

202
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,890
Of course, as you know, legally,

203
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,410
the Police Federation
cannot endorse strike action.

204
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,210
I've got a strong feeling there might
be bad prawns going around today.

205
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,850
If I don't get home, I'll be shitting
through the eye of a needle
from 100 yards.

206
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,010
Very important not to come to work

207
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,250
if you think you might be spreading
this virulent infection.

208
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,290
Let your mates know, yeah?

209
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,770
We're getting reports of a number
of spontaneous street protests

210
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,810
focused on the handling
of the investigation

211
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,010
into the shooting of teenager
Karl Jeffries.

212
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,050
The Mayor has appealed for calm.

213
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,170
But with a new commissioner
yet to be appointed

214
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,220
and reports of unofficial industrial
action by some London police,

215
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,420
questions are being raised
about security across the capital.

216
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,450
And they can do this?

217
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,210
British police carry weapons
at their own discretion.

218
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,290
They can't strike,
but as long as they turn up,

219
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,810
they're not in breach of contract.

220
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,130
So your armed police can choose
not to be armed?

221
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,930
Can they also choose to be firemen?

222
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,690
Are they policemen or are they
fucking philosophers?

223
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,970
What are we going to say?

224
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,890
We have to keep this
out of the public sphere.

225
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,450
No-one can know we don't have
an armed-response capability.

226
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,330
Right.

227
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,610
That's unfortunate,
what you said, off the cuff,

228
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,850
about reopening the investigation.

229
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,900
Obviously, some people believe that
I should hang you out to dry.

230
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,890
But I believe that that would look
bad for the force as a whole.

231
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,490
So we're sticking together on this.

232
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,290
Yeah, some of the
non-firearms-trained senior officers

233
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,810
are willing to go out with Tasers.

234
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,690
~ No. ~ Should we talk to
the Home Secretary

235
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,010
about using the Army?

236
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,450
Not yet, no.

237
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,930
Actually, Sharon, can you break out
and check on the TSG situation?

238
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,980
I'll talk to Firearms Command.

239
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,090
Can we find some dirt on Charles?

240
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,450
Beef that up into a story.

241
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,050
Sure. Really?

242
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,650
Liz, I'm up for this.

243
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,650
~ We have to do what it takes.
~ Sure. But that is not good tactics.

244
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,130
It could come back and bite us.

245
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,650
We need to be able to play rough.

246
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,730
Can you play rough?

247
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,810
Yes, I can play rough,
when I need to.

248
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,130
I'm thinking perhaps
it might be judicious for me

249
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,010
to back down now,
drop the PCSOs thing.

250
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,410
Well, no, because that's
the cornerstone of your pitch.

251
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,810
This is just Finn stirring.

252
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,970
Sure. I've just got
negative vibes today.

253
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,730
Tactically, for now,
we say I didn't say it.

254
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,970
~ You DID say it. ~ I announced
I was GOING to say it.

255
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,850
But I'm not going to say it.

256
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,130
OK.

257
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,180
That's my directive.

258
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,770
~ Won't be long.
~ Well, she's very ambitious.

259
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,690
Yeah? So what? Good.
I'm ambitious. You're ambitious.

260
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Nothing wrong
with an ambitious woman, Mia.

261
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,410
Look, this could go bent, all right?

262
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,330
It's getting out to the public
we have reduced forces to call on.

263
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,370
That's bad. They should get all the
PCSOs to put down their big slurps

264
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,570
and stub out their joints
and waddle into action.

265
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,050
Yeah, look, I know what's going on,

266
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,290
~ but I need you out there as
deterrence... ~ Sorry, Guv.

267
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,970
I need to be near a toilet.
I might brown the seats.

268
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,210
You pulling my dong?

269
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,890
Look, when does a revolution
happen, Guv?

270
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,410
I don't know.

271
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,410
When wankers go bonkers?
I don't know.

272
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,890
When the coercive arm of the state

273
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,810
has more in common with the people
in front of them, attacking them,

274
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,860
than they do with the people
behind them, paying them.

275
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,370
Nice one, Citizen Clarke.

276
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,090
Oh, so you're talking to me now,
are you?

277
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,410
I've always been
talking to you, dickhead.

278
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,460
Dickhead. Lovely.

279
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,570
Human garbage bags.

280
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,620
Skin sheaths
of festering putrescence.

281
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,050
Yeah, I mean,
they're only after some trainers.

282
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,330
Inglis.

283
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,930
Oh, yes, of course, I'll make myself
available for interview

284
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,530
at the Home Secretary's convenience.

285
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,650
All good?

286
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,570
Final interview.

287
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,620
Word is, Sharon's got it.
Well, that's what's being briefed.

288
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,410
Oh, hello, it's started.

289
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,460
"We're going to need a bigger boat."

290
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,130
As in?

291
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,050
There are no boats.

292
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,690
No, I mean...

293
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,530
I thought it was appropriate.

294
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,930
Would it be appropriate
for you to shut up,

295
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,980
until the Acting Commissioner
asks for your opinion, Bananaman?

296
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,690
Right, can I just say,
that I am a senior police officer

297
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,410
and I refuse to be spoken to
in that manner.

298
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,090
And I would like
to officially request

299
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,250
to be moved from your staff, sir,

300
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,850
to that of Assistant Commissioner
Franklin, sir.

301
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,450
It's been an honour to serve you,

302
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,330
but I think it's best
for all concerned if I moved on.

303
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,490
And if there is any hesitation,

304
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,540
I have kept a diary of my treatment
over the past weeks.

305
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,490
Of course, Tom.

306
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,570
Well, thank you.

307
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,570
Finn? Can I get two?

308
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,610
Is your diary pink
with a lock on it, Tom?

309
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,130
I bet it is, isn't it?

310
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,610
Finn, you need to stop stirring
on the "PCSO into cops" idea.

311
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,330
I didn't. I haven't.

312
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,530
Oh, shut up, please.

313
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,650
You stirred up the rank and file,
and I know that.

314
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,450
Call off your dogs.

315
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,250
Well, you started this.

316
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,690
You. With your
back-of-a-fag-packet PCSO bollocks.

317
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,450
So don't come crying to me now, OK?

318
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,850
I'm not crying, Finn.

319
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,570
I know you lack emotional
intelligence, but that's an easy one.

320
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,450
We are in trouble.
We need to work together, get it?

321
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,290
We're in more
than fucking trouble, Liz.

322
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,490
We are on the verge of a riot

323
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,450
and the armed police
won't pick up their guns.

324
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,970
And do you know whose fault that is?

325
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,690
Yours. Pumping up Sharon,
reopening the inquiry.

326
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,570
I'm not the one
who smeared a young black kid

327
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,210
after he was shot to death, OK?

328
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,050
I bet you were top of your
high school class, weren't you?

329
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,770
But you always wanted more,
didn't you?

330
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,570
Don't come and Hannibal Lecter me.

331
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,530
I was home-schooled by hippies,
as it happens.

332
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,730
I was raised by wolves in a cave.
You don't know me.

333
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,410
Why are you even here?
It's just a jaunt, isn't it?

334
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,770
It's a fucking gap year for you.

335
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,010
I turned down serious money
to come here.

336
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,410
Oh!

337
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,010
So, so kind.
Thank you, Miss America!

338
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,610
I came here because I think
there's a new way of doing policing

339
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,770
and so did Richard.

340
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,890
And fucking Liz, who washes whiter.

341
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,250
You don't just want to win, you want
to win and everyone to love you.

342
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,250
Well, newsflash, I will not let you
turn this police force

343
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,970
into some big fucking loofah
you use to massage your ego

344
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,210
and then chuck away, as you fuck off
to Tibet to relaunch the Dalai Lama

345
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,130
and take some options on Buddhism
when it goes public, all right?

346
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,170
Take a look around you.

347
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,220
You're the best thing that's
happened to London since the plague.

348
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,460
I know you find it threatening
that I believe in something.

349
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,770
You'd like everything
to be a shitty joke.

350
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,170
And for everyone
to be just like you,

351
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,490
down in the fucking gutter,

352
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,410
smearing black kids, playing some
pissing up the wall competition.

353
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,370
You know what I see when I look
at you spewing your shit?

354
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,010
A dinosaur -

355
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,530
roaring at monkeys sailing by...

356
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,170
.. on bikes,

357
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,220
with iPads.

358
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,050
I really need to know
we're on the same page.

359
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,290
Actually, I need to know
we're reading the same book.

360
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,450
What book are you reading?

361
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,250
Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Earth.

362
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,810
There's No Oxygen On Mars,
You're Fucked. Sorry, Goodbye.

363
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,130
~ It's a good book, isn't it? ~ Sharon.

364
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,530
We are going to change
the police force, yes?

365
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,570
Honestly?

366
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,210
Well, yes, obviously honestly.

367
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,450
Yes.

368
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,250
Yes?

369
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,330
Uh-huh.

370
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,610
Yes, but we need to be realistic.

371
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,530
It's very hard to change the force,
in my opinion,

372
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,170
~ because it doesn't exist.
~ What doesn't exist?

373
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,730
What is it? Where is it?
It's 50,000 different people.

374
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,890
There's nothing to change.

375
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,170
Leadership, Assistant Commissioner.

376
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,930
I can change my office.

377
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,810
I can change him...

378
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,530
and her...

379
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,370
and him.

380
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,290
Just chip, chip, chip.

381
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,490
We have to just do what we can.

382
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,810
It'll be...

383
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,490
It'll be another generation or two,
before the culture changes.

384
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,330
But we're part of that.

385
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,380
I'm the change.

386
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,450
Hello, gentlemen.

387
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,410
Liz, Tom needs Finn
for his handover.

388
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,930
I need you at Firearms, OK?

389
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,450
Good luck with this, sir.

390
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,610
We've had the Commander
and a chief inspector

391
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,370
and someone from the Home Office,
and the mood is not good.

392
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,250
Do you want me to suggest
some talking points?

393
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,570
I'll get them
in the briefing room...

394
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,490
No, let's just, erm,
we'll just do it here.

395
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,250
~ In here? ~ Yeah.

396
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Listen in. Quiet, please!

397
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Morning...guys.

398
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,970
I'm here to, er...

399
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,090
I'm here to listen
to whatever packet of bollocks

400
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,410
you've been asked to swallow.

401
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,130
But, first, guys,
I need to talk to you.

402
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,290
And I need to say a few words
that are probably going
to make your skin crawl,

403
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,850
because normally, they only
get rolled out when you're
being asked to take a pay cut,

404
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,250
or do some overtime
for the love of the Queen.

405
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,300
But I am going to say "duty".

406
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,130
I'm going to say "nobility".

407
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,650
The nobility of service
to your community

408
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,700
and to this great world city.

409
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,810
But listen, erm, this case -

410
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,690
the bin,
the whole nightclub operation,

411
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,850
the way you've been treated -
we'll examine it.

412
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,690
There'll be some changes
to the procedure

413
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,490
in the investigative process

414
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,890
and I'll try to make sure you get
all the protection you can.

415
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,050
Things'll get a bit better here,
a bit worse there.

416
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,100
A few more forms.

417
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,490
But I'm not going to bullshit you,

418
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,090
they won't change.

419
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Not really. Not much. They can't.

420
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,530
Well, you get judged strictly,

421
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,580
because that is how you know, in
your heart, you need to be judged.

422
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,690
Because when you go out there,

423
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,250
the whole force
of right-thinking society,

424
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,970
of civilisation,

425
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,020
is concentrated in the sinews in
the muscles of your trigger finger.

426
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,170
And I know it makes you sick,
cos it makes me sick,

427
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,250
that the great stupid mass
of fat, lazy, paper-reading,

428
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,210
Professor Yaffles
in their armchairs,

429
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,810
reading the Guardian and wanking...

430
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,330
That they get to...

431
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,610
to stroke their chins and
chew for months, for years,

432
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,050
the decisions that you make
in a second.

433
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,650
You know what we do about that?

434
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,330
We take it.
We just... we just take it.

435
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,650
Because we know who we are.

436
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,410
We know what they are. So fuck them.

437
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,410
And when we're disregarded
and beaten down

438
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,090
and smeared and written off -

439
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,130
that isn't
when we sack off our duties, no.

440
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,210
That's when we say,

441
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,290
"I'm going to protect you,
nevertheless, because I'm a knight.

442
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,930
"I'm a king."

443
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,810
And it's when the city is
at its most unruly and peevish

444
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,250
and ungrateful, that we... we say,

445
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,850
"Shush now, I'm here, you're safe."

446
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,050
And we still act like kings,

447
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,210
when all around us are cowards
and fakes,

448
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,260
throwing their shit at us.

449
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,970
But you're the best people I know.

450
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,850
And you've got to let
this bad feeling pass,

451
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,250
or you'll always feel grubby

452
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,300
and regret the day
you left your city undefended.

453
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Thank you.

454
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,690
~ Grant. ~ Liz.

455
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,890
~ Jeremy. ~ Liz.

456
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,370
So, we're looking
at large-scale disturbances

457
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,410
in five of the boroughs and rising.

458
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,410
Yes. The mayor could do
with a frank, off-the-record

459
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,650
assessment of what they're
actually rioting for, Liz.

460
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,970
Unfortunately, they haven't
appointed a head rioter

461
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,250
for us to negotiate with.

462
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,330
Is it because of
a lack of police on patrol?

463
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,330
I think it's gathering
its own momentum.

464
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,090
Anger about the bin footage,
the Karl Jefferies shooting,

465
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,410
rumours about no cops.

466
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,050
There seem to be some kids in Brent,

467
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,370
angry about the World Cup
going to Qatar.

468
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,170
It's all very, very combustible.

469
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,530
I think we need visible leadership.

470
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,730
We agree - and the Home Office
and the Mayor's office

471
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,650
have agreed to accelerate the
appointment of the new commissioner,

472
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,930
following final interview.

473
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,250
It's Hillary versus Obama.
We're happy with either.

474
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,810
We just have to convince the Home
Secretary they have an iron grip.

475
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,610
Granular detail.

476
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,370
But we feel that Hillary's
the reform candidate.

477
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,050
I mean, what about that offer
to use British Transport Police

478
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,210
to arrest striking officers?

479
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,410
Ballsy.

480
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,050
Berwick.

481
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,370
Thank you so much for coming, sir...

482
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,370
Arresting our own?
Can you hear that sound?

483
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,420
That's Richard, turning like
a rotisserie chicken in his coffin.

484
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,420
'Crowds gathering
are violent. Other units...'

485
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,180
'PCSOs requesting urgent backup.'

486
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Charles,
can I speak to you for a moment?

487
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,150
Well, let me guess,
you're going to stop the riots with
the power of new media?

488
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,510
Ask Jeeves
to stop the civil disturbance?

489
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,910
Very hip joke, sir.

490
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,870
Look, I think
you should be the next Commissioner.

491
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,470
Well, I agree with you.

492
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,830
~ I've seen Sharon up close.
~ Yes...

493
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,510
Some people, when they get up high
and the air's too thin,

494
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,510
they start throwing stuff
out of the balloon.

495
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,560
First, the sandbags, then the
picnic, then they're looking at you.

496
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,550
She was going to
arrest her own guys.

497
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,430
Yes, well, I've known Sharon a long
time and that doesn't surprise me.

498
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Watching you give your speech, I
thought you were really impressive.

499
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,150
Is this your pitch to work for me?

500
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,830
Thank you for your input, but I...

501
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,310
Look, I liked your speech
but it was bullshit.

502
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,550
OK, thanks, Liz,
you're quite the sweet talker.

503
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,510
Build the fortress walls higher?
Huddle up?

504
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,630
You need to lose that mentality
and you need someone like me

505
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,190
running your PR or you're
going to have a short, disastrous

506
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,150
tenure as Commissioner, if you can
persuade them in the first place.

507
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,510
Why should I trust you?

508
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,070
Because I already nailed a story
about you being a shoplifter.

509
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,750
I am prepared to support you
and if you want me, great,

510
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,830
and if you don't...

511
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,880
.. I'm going to walk.

512
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I'll think about it.

513
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Mia, we're switching horses.

514
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,590
So, thanks for meeting us.

515
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,470
~ You're probably wondering what
this is all about? ~ Yeah.

516
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,670
So, listen. You know
Matt, our camera guy?

517
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,390
~ Yeah.
~ Well, a little birdie's told us

518
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,390
~ that Matt is hawking around some
footage he's got of you. ~ Yeah?

519
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,430
He's giving it
large about what's on it.

520
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,750
"Something amazing.

521
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,790
"Something that's going to bring
down western civilisation," yeah.

522
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,230
Some admission of wrongdoing by you?
Secret filming? He won't show it.

523
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,790
He's keeping his copy locked down.

524
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,790
~ But I thought you might like to
know. ~ Yeah.

525
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,670
I mean, from our end, he could do
some very serious damage with this.

526
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,310
He could get us closed down.

527
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,030
We want to get the toerag expunged.
Stopped. Deleted.

528
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,190
For the good of society.

529
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,870
Primarily society.

530
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,510
But we were thinking, from your end,
you might want to,

531
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,350
I don't know,
talk to lawyers...

532
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,110
.. mates.

533
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,630
Right, we're getting
reports of outbreaks of looting

534
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,680
across Balham, Tooting, spreading
Clapham North, and East Putney.

535
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,990
Some gunplay
in Loughborough Junction.

536
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,990
Now, you all heard the big man,
and I suppose the question is,

537
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,040
are you coppers or not?

538
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,200
What do you reckon, Banje?

539
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,270
Yeah, all right.

540
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,320
I'm a king, or a knight.

541
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm the Count of Twatty Christo.
Just send us out.

542
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Right. Trojan 134, 144, 154.
Details as you deploy.

543
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,430
Thing about a riot is,
the chance of any actual gunplay?

544
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,710
Virtually zero, mate.

545
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,350
'Trojan 131 to assist
Haymond Gardens, New Cross.

546
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,910
'Anonymous call to an IC3 male
acting suspiciously.

547
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,590
'Caller states
he may have seen a handgun.'

548
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,190
Trojan 134 in progress.

549
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,510
Whoa, shall we not let
Baker's mob get this?

550
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,590
Yeah, well, I've answered it now,
haven't I?

551
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,910
Well, hit the drama, then.

552
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,870
All right, guys, possible firearm.
Let's just take it easy, lads, yeah?

553
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,920
I'll lead, all right?
You got me Banje, yeah?

554
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,640
You're fucking keen, ain't ya?

555
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,470
Armed police! Come to the door
with your hands in view.

556
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,790
Armed police!

557
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,310
~ Robbie? ~ Armed police, let me see
your hands.

558
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,670
~ Let me see your fucking hands!
~ Rob, don't you know him?

559
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,870
Come here. Get down. Get down, man.

560
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,910
Have you got any weapons on these
premises, eh?

561
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,590
~ No, what the fuck!
~ Hey, Banje. Cuff him. Cuff him.

562
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,670
What's going on, eh?

563
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,830
Shut your mouth! Shut your mouth!
Keep still.

564
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,750
All I want to...
What's happening?

565
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,790
Right, local are here,
what's this...

566
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,510
Rob, what are you doing?
What the fuck?

567
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,950
Get up. Tony, get him in the van.

568
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,190
Oh, wait, van? Van?
I ain't done nothing. What van?
Where am I going?

569
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,430
Here's how this breaks down.
I'm going to do a quick search.

570
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,070
Robbie, what the fuck is going on?

571
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,270
Just trust me on this one.
We've got to do this now.
I'll explain later.

572
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,030
~ Tell me what you're doing, yeah?
~ All right. You want to know?
Right, fucking quick.

573
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,430
The kid you shot, yes?
He did have a gun.

574
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,950
But it was in his pants,
so I put it where it should've been,

575
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,550
where it was.

576
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,950
Hang on. He didn't have a...

577
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,470
Exactly. No thanks required.
We're mates, right?

578
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,590
He didn't have a gun?

579
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,830
Look, Matt, the camera guy... I told
him, didn't I?

580
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,150
Oh, what? Why did you do that?

581
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,990
Because he's a fucking snake, ain't
he? He was filming me secretly.

582
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,950
The kid didn't have a gun?

583
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,670
Right, he's with local. What
the fuck is going on, lads?

584
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,710
~ You want...
~ You don't want to know. ~ No?

585
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,710
The kid I shot. The gun wasn't in
his hand, and Robbie moved the
weapon.

586
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,950
La-la-la-la...

587
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,190
Right, so we've got two options.

588
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,710
I'm finished, done, toast,
and you're fucking toast.

589
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,190
~ I'll go down, mate.
~ We both go down, mate. Cops in jail.

590
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,390
Cum in the porridge, razors
in the shower. No. No fucking way.

591
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,230
Right, so press option two. Right?
I sweep the flat.

592
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,910
We bag all the footage. Simple.

593
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,670
No, no, no... This is fucking
heavy-duty. This isn't me, mate.

594
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,190
~ Come on, man. ~ He's going to squeal.
This won't work.

595
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,470
It will work if we fucking make
it work, won't it?

596
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,950
He's going to shout all about it.

597
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,510
Oh, right, he'll squeal, yeah?

598
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,590
I mean, if we get it all,
what's he going to do?
What's he going to say, eh?

599
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,270
We just put our fingers in our ear
and say, prove it, mate,

600
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,670
the kid's talking bollocks.

601
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,750
~ A kid who spent a month filming you?
~ Exactly.

602
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,230
Little black kid who's got a grudge,
trying to fuck us up.

603
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,280
It's standard, innit?

604
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,990
Let's do it.

605
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Do it, do it.

606
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,910
Mate, you're stitching me up.

607
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,950
Yeah, we hear that a lot.
It's cleared of firearms, lads.

608
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,470
But a substantial quantity of herbal
marijuana from a visual.

609
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,630
He might have binned the gun,
who knows?

610
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Robbie.

611
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,110
Governor says there's
rioting in Deptford now.

612
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,710
What do you reckon, Clarkey?
Shall we respond?

613
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,150
Got the brass nuts for it?

614
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,990
Now they need us.
Now they send for us.

615
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,390
Yeah, well that's how it works,
isn't it, Clarkey?
That's what we signed up for.

616
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,150
We don't get paid the good money
for the days we sit on the carrier.

617
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,670
This is the day we get paid for.

618
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,720
No-one needs a bloke anymore, do
they? Unless everything goes bent.

619
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,270
I want to move in with you.

620
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,750
You do know that, don't you?

621
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,710
Yeah, sure. But when?

622
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,030
Wait till he gets off,
wait till the bin footage dies down,

623
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,830
wait for Easter, wait for the new
fucking iPhone to come out.

624
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,870
Look, I know this whole
thing has been a complete mess,

625
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,920
but I like you.

626
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,390
Yeah, well, it's very hard for me
to trust you, you know?

627
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,270
Because I've made a lot of gestures
but we're still sneaking round

628
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,070
and keeping it quiet.

629
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,390
Nobbo?

630
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,440
What now?

631
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,950
Me and Clarkey have been
riding each other raw for years.

632
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,110
Now we're going legal.

633
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Fuck off.

634
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,950
Fuck off!

635
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,910
~ Fuck off, serious?
~ Serious.

636
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,470
We're moving in together
and everyone's going to find out,

637
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,350
so, we wanted you to be first.

638
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,630
Fuck me. Under my nose!

639
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,750
Story of the century!

640
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,790
Right. Things are getting
serious out there.

641
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,510
It's all going bent round
the South Circular.

642
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Now, the ARV are going out.
What about you?

643
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,990
We'll see what we can do.

644
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Thank you.

645
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,550
Right, then.

646
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,510
Right. Prawns are back on the menu.

647
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,670
I mean, the little prick was
filming me on the sly.

648
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,390
He lied to me and he cheated me.

649
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,590
Banjo would go down and I'd go down.
And for what?

650
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,790
Nah, we just did a clean-up job,
that's all.

651
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,670
Boo-hoo, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury.

652
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,630
The defendant says he had
incriminating film of a police
officer.

653
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,150
~ We stick together.
~ All for one, eh?

654
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,030
'You have one new voicemail.'

655
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,510
'Banje. I think
we need to have that talk.

656
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,560
'Erm... I'm on duty now, but I'll
speak to you tomorrow, yeah?

657
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,720
'Bye.'

658
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,910
Whoa!

659
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,960
You all right, mate?

660
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,630
Oh, fuck this. Where are they?

661
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,680
I thought I'd be cracking chavs'
heads like they were boiled eggs.

662
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,240
I'm, erm, just going to...

663
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,990
All right, boss, mind
if we just use the facilities?

664
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,950
~ Are you wanting a coffee?
~ Sorry?

665
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,630
~ It's just toilets are customer
use only. ~ Right.

666
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,470
What, and you're going to stick to
that, are you? For us?

667
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,670
~ That's the situation.
~ That's the situation?

668
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,720
That's the situation. Otherwise,
we'll be cleaning them all day.

669
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,950
What do we get out of it,
from our point of view?

670
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,990
Brilliant.

671
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,390
'Throughout the city,

672
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,550
'the Mayor returned to praise
and thank the professionalism...'

673
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,630
Just checking the facilities, boss.

674
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Equipment check.

675
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,390
Heads up, lads.

676
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,070
Clarkey. Forming up.

677
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,910
'Forming up, Clarkey.

678
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,270
'Clarkey?

679
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,030
~ 'Clarkey?'
~ Oh, fuck.

680
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,080
'Clarkey?'

681
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,480
'Have you checked
the battery on yours? Clarkey?'

682
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Corner!

683
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,310
Forward!

684
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,550
On the right.

685
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,590
Hold!

686
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,670
Here we go.

687
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Keep the line!

688
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,630
And you don't think we should just
say, "Not today. Not now.
More prep."

689
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,670
No. This is it, today.
It's not an interview.

690
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,150
~ I mean, I'm across everything.
~ Philosophically, you're impregnable,
ma'am.

691
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,470
When you say "ma'am" I feel like I'm
the Queen and I don't like it.

692
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Apologies, Assistant Commissioner.

693
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,350
Assistant Commissioner, thank you
for making time to come in today.

694
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,790
Oh, that's fine.
Nothing much going on today.

695
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,510
Oh, I thought that you'd be
operationally over-stretched

696
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,750
with the civil disturbance?

697
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,150
No, yes. I was joking.

698
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,790
Oh, I see. You were making
a joke about the riot?

699
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,830
No, I was making light of the...

700
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,430
Perhaps we could start by going
through the various commands

701
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,870
a commissioner has under them
and what the current force levels

702
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,950
are and what sort of adjustments you
would envisage making in those?

703
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,950
Yes.

704
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I was thinking of talking
about the conceptualisation of

705
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,080
law enforcements in terms of
natural law and Thomas Aquinas
and...

706
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,920
So, you'll forgive me
if I talk in broad terms?

707
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Well, talk in broad terms if you
must and we'll see, shall we...

708
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,040
.. if we forgive you?

709
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,390
Fucking bloodbath.

710
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,750
They cut my belly open,
pulled my entrails out,

711
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,750
and showed them to me, we all had
a bit of a laugh,

712
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,470
and then I had to eat them,
while they watched.

713
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,510
One always feels there's room for
improvement in an interview process.

714
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,390
It was like there were three
men watching me

715
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,830
take the most difficult
shit in the world.

716
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,070
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

717
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,590
I mean, why wasn't I aware?

718
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,790
You were definitely told
that would be informal?

719
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,710
That is the impression I was given.

720
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Fuck. What just happened? I've been
fucked. I've been sand-bagged.

721
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Maybe you can play rough.

722
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,510
Assistant Commissioner.

723
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,550
Charles.

724
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,590
How's it looking?

725
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,110
We're praying for Inspector Rain
to move in.

726
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,430
Met Office have said it's, what,
50/50?

727
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Beck's is a no-go
and we've had to retreat in Ealing.

728
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,990
Home Secretary?

729
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,040
Uh-huh.

730
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,510
Well, no, thank you.

731
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,830
Yes, of course.

732
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,510
Thank you.

733
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,710
Congratulations, Commissioner.

734
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,760
~ Congratulations.
~ Congratulations, Charles.

735
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Liz.

736
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Right, erm, I need to meet
the Prime Minister. Liz, Finn.

737
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,750
We're wanted at Lambeth Command.

738
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Tom, you're not with the groom's
party. You're with me.

739
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,550
So, what's our line on the riots?

740
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,910
Mmm...

741
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,350
I'll tell the Prime Minister
we have a full force on the streets.

742
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,750
We're drafting in more backup from
the regions.

743
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,670
Jesus!

744
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Shit, what's... This is
the Commissioner, what's going on?

745
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,910
'We're just taking you south,
Commissioner.

746
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,960
'It's got a lot worse, I'm afraid.
It's spreading to Central London.'

747
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Shit! Stop the car.

748
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,750
Can we get through?

749
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,870
'There's no way through. Turn around.
Turn around.

750
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,790
'Requesting backup.'

751
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,910
Fucking back up!

752
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,960
~ Reverse!
~ I can't. We need to reverse.

753
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,830
Go, go, go, go!

754
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Get us out of here!

755
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,000
All right, Frank.
Find us another route.

756
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,690
Yes, I know there is a riot
happening.

757
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,740
I'm in the middle of it.

758
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,700
I'll fuckin' do ya!

759
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,650
Hold the line!

760
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,700
Hold the line, lads.

761
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,010
Hold the line!

762
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Stay back.

763
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,090
Get back!
Stay back!

764
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,810
Come on!

765
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,410
Come on!

766
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,210
Stay back.
Keep clear.

767
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,810
Come on. Let's have it!

768
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,930
~ Please! ~ Fuck off!
~ Let me through!

769
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,250
You might want to
review your toilet policy, mate.

770
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,530
You seem to have angered
some local patrons.

771
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,650
Go on, then.

772
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,810
Where you going? Come back here.

773
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,370
Come on!

774
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,420
Get back. Stay back!

775
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,740
Stay back!

776
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,420
Fucking get back! Get back!

777
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,770
Erm, he's insisted on coming to see
you directly.

778
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,890
Mia, I'm too busy.

779
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,010
~ It's about the Karl Jefferies
shooting. ~ OK...

780
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,060
If he's an oddball, call
and ask for a peppermint tea, yeah?

781
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,170
Hi. How can I help you?

782
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,220
Hi. Yeah, I, erm...
I wanted to see you.

783
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,170
~ This should go to DPS.
~ Provisional Standards?

784
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,220
Yeah, but DPS has a certain
reputation and...

785
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,620
Sorry, I, erm, saw you give a talk
at Paddington Green about openness,

786
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,370
and, erm...

787
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,250
Can I trust you?

788
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Yeah. You can trust me, absolutely.
Do you want to...

789
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,420
Yeah.

790
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,730
The Prime Minister has appealed
for calm as he announced that

791
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,570
police are now largely in control
of London this evening.

792
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,970
He went on to say he had every
confidence in newly appointed

793
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,570
Commissioner Charles Inglis being
able to return calm to the city,

794
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,810
despite reports
of widespread looting

795
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,860
in the wake of today's disturbances.

796
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,010
I think this is how
I would have wanted to go out.

797
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,890
Democracy. You know? Freedom. Hmm?

798
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,970
Equality? Maybe.

799
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,020
Fucking good nails. That's what
I want to go down defending.

800
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,810
What you doing here?
I said we'd talk later.

801
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,930
~ It's all right, love.
~ You all right, Clarkey?

802
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,290
~ Banjo, we're on duty.
~ Yeah, I know.

803
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,050
See, something ain't felt right
lately, and, er,

804
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,450
I realised what it was.

805
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,090
Yeah, someone's
had his prick up my missus.

806
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,850
For God's sake, Banjo, come on.

807
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,490
Now, in nature,
if that happened to a stag,

808
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,690
they'd find the other stag, go,
"Oi, tuck your cock away, give

809
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,250
"those antlers a polish, cos you and
me are going to have a
straightener."

810
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,300
~ A straightener? ~ Yeah, a straightener.
Are you deaf or fuckin' what, cunt?

811
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,250
No, mate, no. Not here.

812
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,050
~ I want a fight.
~ Well, I don't want a fight.

813
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,050
Well, you see,
I really, really want to fight.

814
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,450
You're being a prick, Banjo.

815
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Right, now if I start fighting you,
yeah?

816
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,890
Very little you can do to avoid
being in the fight, is there?

817
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,810
~ We can't just stand here!
~ It's OK, just leave them be.

818
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,860
Now, if you don't fight, makes it
quite easy for me.

819
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,290
And, also, if you do fight,
then I'm quids in,

820
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,850
cos that's what I want, innit?

821
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,900
A fuckin' fight. So...

822
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,660
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let them have it out.

823
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,930
~ Ahh, shit. ~ Right, that's enough.

824
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,980
Fuck it. I'm going in.

825
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,570
Stay down.
Are you all right, Clarkey?

826
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,130
~ Get off my throat. ~ Stay down, Banjo.

827
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,210
Calm down, pal. Stay there.
Stay there. Calm down. It's over.

828
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,260
Stay. You got him. Calm down.

829
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,460
Yeah, that's exactly what I did.

830
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,730
I thought you'd want to know.

831
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,490
Banjo fucked up. You got it right.

832
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,170
I think you should make a statement.

833
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,220
~ Yeah? ~ Get back on the team.

834
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,170
Er... No, thanks, mate.

835
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,690
Buddy, we can have a word.

836
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,740
You'll get reinstated
and in a month, you'll...

837
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,850
Why not?

838
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,970
Cos I don't like shooting
people any more.

839
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,930
Turns out, it don't feel very nice.

840
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,770
Warwick,
you were just doing the job, mate.

841
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,820
Yeah, I know. I did the right thing.

842
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,330
Did the job.

843
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,610
But you know what?

844
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,660
It's not a very nice fucking job,
and I ain't doing it any more.

845
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,370
♪ Millions of people
swarming like flies round

846
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,420
♪ Waterloo underground

847
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,370
♪ But Terry and Julie
cross over the river... ♪

848
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,420
Yeah, that's exactly what I did.

849
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,650
~ I have to say, I don't think
we should even be looking at this.
~ Oh, Christ.

850
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,610
This is... It's...
It's inappropriate.

851
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,660
~ It should go to professional
standards. ~ Oh, you do love your
procedures, don't you?

852
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,770
Call a committee, put on the gloves,

853
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,410
maybe they can tell you what's
in front of your fucking eyes?

854
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,250
So, we've seen it. Big deal.

855
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,290
Who knows if he's even telling the
truth?

856
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,930
What do you want us to do?

857
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,410
Put it up.

858
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,460
We give it to Gavin
and we put it up.

859
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,650
You are amazing.

860
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,050
Just when I think you've gone
to your most bat-shit

861
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,770
MacBook-in-a-yurt-fucking-cuckoo,
bang!

862
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,370
You... you take it up a level.

863
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,850
This is the perfect response to the
garbage can footage.

864
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,650
We will show you something ten times
more damaging, ourselves.

865
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,700
We are just, just getting
control of the city back.

866
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,890
Do I need to read you the Riot Act?

867
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,570
The last line is,
"Do not restart the fucking riot."

868
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,490
It would establish him as an
unimpeachable advocate of openness
and reform.

869
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,970
~ Sub judice.
~ Not until somebody's charged.

870
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,890
Look, if I'd shagged my boss and
he'd killed himself, I might be a

871
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,940
bit more wary about making
everything open and transparent
24/7.

872
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,810
Tell me, Finn,
what would you do with this?

873
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,490
I would take this to the DPS
and I would let them investigate.

874
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,650
And then I personally would use
whatever legal

875
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,450
and technical arguments I could to
delay or stop the release of this
damaging material.

876
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,450
You think you can
stamp on something like this?

877
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Charles? He's taken it around town.
Rumours. Copies.

878
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,730
Gavin, me, the kid who filmed it,
the cop who brought it in.

879
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,170
What are you going to do, kill them?
Gag them?

880
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,370
Wait for the riot to start
the day it does come out?

881
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,810
Because it definitely will.

882
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,130
Is there a chance that this might
calm things down, out there,

883
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,490
us coming clean?

884
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,540
Fuck knows. No. Yes.

885
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,370
Twice as bad, half as bad.
Who knows?

886
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,420
Look, I'm not saying put it up
because I'm some fucking crusader
who wants to die riding into battle.

887
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,490
I'm telling you that this
is our only winning option.

888
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,540
It would prejudice any future case.

889
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,700
Finn, when you came to me
I listened to you.

890
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,860
Charles is the best man for the job.
Now, listen to me.

891
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,330
This is going to come out.
That's definite.

892
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,380
And when it does it will be very
fucking bad. Police murder.

893
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,250
Evidence tampering.
Us on the defensive, again.

894
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,530
Hiding behind procedures, again.

895
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,580
Expressing sorrow, again.

896
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,740
What if, for the first time,
we throw the doors open?

897
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,140
What do you think?

898
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,260
I don't know how we got to this
fucking position.

899
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Honestly. Honestly, I don't know.

900
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,410
Maybe she has a point.

901
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,450
Maybe.

902
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Robert Vass?

903
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,410
Neil Bancroft?

904
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,460
Quiet everyone, please.
Quiet. Thank you.

905
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,010
Thank you for being here.

906
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,370
I'm Commissioner Charles Inglis,

907
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,420
and this is the Head
of Communications, Liz Garvey.

908
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,570
In a moment we're going to be
presenting some video material.

909
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,620
We are taking the unusual, I think
unprecedented step of bringing

910
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,180
to light, today, material which
suggests dishonourable

911
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,180
behaviour by one of our officers.

912
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,410
But, firstly, can
I say that we have seen
disgraceful...

913
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,290
When this hits the streets,
they are going to explode.

914
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,570
And I will be bringing the full
force of the law to

915
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,620
bear on any future
instances of public disorder.

916
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,940
You are going to be seeing from this
force a new era of transparency,

917
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,570
but matched with an uncompromising
challenge to lawlessness

918
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,620
wherever it is found.

919
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,180
OK.
Could you play the footage, please?
