1
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh, God, it's a fire!

2
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,000
Fire!

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,700
A jackhammer?

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,700
On Saturday? He should be castrated.

5
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,800
Saturday.

6
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, God. Oh, God, it's Saturday.
Get up! Get up!

7
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,700
Get up, get up, get up!

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,700
My sister's gonna kill me.

9
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,100
Oh, my God, what did we do last night?

10
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,500
The usual.

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Collected money for the poor little
homeless children at the church bazaar.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,900
l think the vicar must
have spiked the Kool-Aid.

13
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,900
We are way late!

14
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
What am l gonna tell my sister?

15
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
ls this yours or mine?

16
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,900
-Oh, my God, how did that happen?
-l haven't a clue.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,300
There's my excuse. l'm late
because my tits caught on fire.

18
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,000
Come on!

19
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,300
Find a cab! Taxi!

20
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,700
-Hey, cab!
-Right there! Get him.

21
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Can you go a little faster, please?

22
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,700
Fast and alive. Alive, all right?

23
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,700
The alive part is
incredibly important in this case.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
You all right, darling?

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,800
Oh, God, l could care less.

26
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,200
That's the whole point.

27
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,200
Right. To care less.

28
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,400
This is tasting like cherry brandy
because l haven't got her gift.

29
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,800
Thank God for bar cars.

30
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,200
You're late!

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,300
Jasper, this is...

32
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,800
...a bridesmaid
with makeup and a dress.

33
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,400
Really late. Like, 45 minutes.

34
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,700
She has absolutely no sense of humor,
but she's really good at telling time.

35
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,300
l am so sorry.

36
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,300
There was a water main break
and the train got stuck in Rye.

37
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,100
An electrical thingy.
And just, explosion--

38
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Gwen.

39
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,000
You make it impossible to love you.

40
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,200
Shit!

41
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,900
May we present
Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Topton?

42
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,700
Like one?

43
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,300
Did you think it was
a pretty wedding? l did.

44
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
Wasn't it pretty?

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,900
Yeah, but no one wants pretty
anymore from a wedding.

46
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,600
They want a scandal.
They want to take home a story.

47
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,300
Try these.

48
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,900
This is a party. Let's have some fun
with it, for God's sake.

49
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, my God!

50
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,900
-What happened?
-You--!

51
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,100
Possibly crank it up a little?
Liven everything up.

52
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
There's a ladies' room
right over there.

53
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,000
Settle down, buddy!

54
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Oh, sorry.

55
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,300
Don't worry. l'll replace it.

56
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,800
l'll be right back.

57
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,600
Hey, lady! Hey, lady,
what are you doing?

58
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Cake store. Cake store. Cake store.

59
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,400
This is HeIga. What city?

60
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,700
Yes, Bedford.

61
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
A cake store.

62
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,600
Lady, if l knew the name,
l wouldn't have called you, okay?

63
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,900
Oh, God!

64
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,300
This is perfect.

65
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,400
All right, everybody.
Now, circle up.

66
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,700
That's it.

67
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Come on.

68
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Together, we're better!

69
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,300
We're better together!

70
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,900
No drugs!

71
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,300
That judge totally screwed me.

72
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,400
Good morning!

73
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
I shouId've picked
that rehab in the city.

74
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
People chant.

75
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
-They do what?
-They chant.

76
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,200
They think l'm chanting, they have
a whole 'nother thing coming.

77
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,600
lt could be worse. Could be prison.

78
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,200
Oh, that's worse?

79
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,100
You never hear of being raped
with a plunger in rehab.

80
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
Because they cover it up.

81
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,700
lt's not funny!

82
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Excuse me. Talking.

83
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,500
No cell phones.

84
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,700
Gwen C., l'm Betty. Follow me.

85
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,400
We carry our own bags here.
This isn't the Sheraton.

86
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,900
Oh, glass. ln case l slit my wrists.
l get it.

87
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,700
An eyelash curler.

88
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,300
What'll l do with that? Stab myself?
Curl my tongue to death?

89
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
While you're going through my stuff,
let's see...

90
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,900
...what Betty's got in her drawers.

91
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, my God.
Betty has locked her drawers.

92
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,100
What? lt's for my back pain.

93
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,100
These things will be returned
to you when you check out.

94
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,500
Except for the Vickodin,
which will be flushed.

95
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Smile!

96
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,900
lt's ''Vicodin.''

97
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,300
No calls, except during posted
phone time and only for 1 0 minutes.

98
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,900
No fraternization. That's romance
and/or sex between patients.

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,600
Oh, and we chant here.
Don't be put off by it.

100
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,300
Some people prefer it
to the Serenity Prayer.

101
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,000
I'II be your friend

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,100
I'II heIp you carry on

103
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,900
For it won't be Iong

104
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,800
TiII I'm gonna need somebody--

105
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,100
Your room.

106
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,100
You're responsible
for keeping it clean.

107
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Andrea, this is Gwen.

108
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,200
Settle her in.

109
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,100
-Do you watch Santa Cruz?
-Pardon me?

110
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,900
Santa Cruz. lt's my soap.

111
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,500
They only let us watch TV at night,
so l've missed the last two weeks.

112
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Hey, an intellectual.

113
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,200
Like the stuff you did to get you
in here was real brain food.

114
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,600
Parker House people, this is Gwen.
Gwen, this is everybody.

115
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Hello, Gwen.

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
l'm thinking booze.

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,900
Cocaine.

118
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,200
Painkillers.

119
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,700
-This is not a nice game.
-Well?

120
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,300
Well, what?

121
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
What's your drug of choice?

122
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Alcohol, cocaine, Percodan,
heroin, glue?

123
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
l have to pick one?

124
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,400
Your gateway drug.
What you go for first.

125
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
l guess l drink.

126
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,300
Yes. Come to Papa.

127
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
Hand them over.
l know people, admit that.

128
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,700
Get your thumb out of that.

129
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
What's the matter?

130
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,300
Haven't you ever seen
a trach scar before?

131
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,000
lt's a tracheostomy.
lt's not a growth.

132
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,000
lt's not a deformity. lt's a scar.
So you can stop staring at it.

133
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,200
Okay, good. Thank you.

134
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,000
She wasn't staring, Daniel.

135
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,900
No? And how would you know, faggot?

136
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
You're about as perceptive
as Helen Keller.

137
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,000
When you think about it,
Helen Keller was pretty perceptive.

138
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Shut up!

139
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,200
Look at him walk away!
Run away! Run away!

140
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,100
We were up in heaven
Now we're in the mud

141
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,900
We feII off the wagon
You shouId have heard the thud

142
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
-l like your coat.
-Thanks.

143
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,700
-ls that leather?
-Yes.

144
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,400
-Not vinyl?
-Nope.

145
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,100
-You believe in killing animals?
-Yes.

146
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,100
-For clothing?
-Yes.

147
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,200
So do l.

148
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,600
For 28 boring days

149
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,300
Don't worry about Daniel.

150
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,300
He's just self-conscious about
his neck because he did it to himself.

151
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,600
He had this thing where he'd pump his
stomach so he wouldn't get a hangover.

152
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,900
l guess he knew how, because,
you know, he's a doctor. Or was.

153
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,800
He lost his license after
he killed that patient, but....

154
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,300
Anyway, l guess one night while he was
scraping that tube to his stomach...

155
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,800
...somehow he screwed up and he
couldn't breathe and he had to...

156
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,300
...poke a hole in his throat
with a pen or something.

157
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,900
Jasper, see if you can
dig up some Vicodin.

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The gestapo found my first batch.

159
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,200
That here-but-not-here iIIusion
wiII be...

160
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,100
...much easier to sustain
with chemicaI heIp.

161
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,800
Love, Gwennie.

162
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Good night.

163
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,200
Good night.

164
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,000
Chocolate. Heroin addict.

165
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
What are you, like, 1 2 or something?

166
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,200
Seventeen.

167
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,500
Loving this.

168
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Good night.

169
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Jeremiah was a buIIfrog

170
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,400
Jeremiah was a buIIfrog

171
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Was a good friend of mine

172
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,600
I never understood
A singIe word he said

173
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
But I heIped him drink his wine

174
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,200
And he aIways had
Some mighty fine wine

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Singing joy to the worId

176
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,800
You girls are a lot of fun.

177
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,000
And that's the most important thing.

178
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,000
Because if you're not having fun....

179
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,400
What's the frigging point?!

180
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, God.

181
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
You can keep your drugs
and your whiskey sours.

182
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,600
We got us a higher power!

183
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Yay, God!

184
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,200
Don't forget
tonight's Iecture at 8:30:

185
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,700
''How Many Brain CeIIs
Did I KiII Last Night?''

186
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Decaf.

187
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,700
There's no caffeine.
lt's mood-altering.

188
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,200
Hi.

189
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
That was a nice moment.
Where you going?

190
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,100
What do you mean?
You gotta have cigarettes.

191
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,800
Sorry, but we're fresh out.

192
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,100
Those people are addicts. They need
cigarettes like they need air.

193
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
l guess that explains it, then. Gum?

194
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
lt wasn't a problem...

195
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,800
...till Emmett, he took up
with that girl.

196
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Those nights that he was
out with her...

197
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,100
...and l was home with the TV....

198
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,700
See, l figured we could
see it through.

199
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,500
So when he said...

200
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,200
...he was moving her in with us...

201
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,000
...and that l could stay or leave...

202
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,300
...l see now l should've left.

203
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,200
l've got something....

204
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
When you....

205
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,300
You want to do it later?

206
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,900
l think, yeah.

207
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,300
Why did you--?

208
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,800
Some feeling words in there, or...?

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,300
-You know?
-''l....''

210
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,300
l don't know how to explain.

211
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,800
All right. Okay, well,
that's a good start.

212
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,700
Another time. lt's all right.

213
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
So let's finish up today
with a prayer, all right?

214
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,500
Let's all hold hands.

215
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,600
God, grant me the serenity...

216
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,500
...to accept the things
l cannot change...

217
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,600
...the courage to change
the things l can...

218
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,900
...and the wisdom to know
the difference.

219
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,800
lt works if you work it.
lt's worth it!

220
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,300
All right!

221
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Take on the day. Go ahead.

222
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,000
B-minus.

223
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,000
Hey, Gwen C.!

224
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,100
Your bed was not made up,
your clothes were all over.

225
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,100
l'm giving you an F for daily
inspection and fining you a dollar.

226
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,400
So pay up.

227
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,000
Tell you what.

228
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,700
Here's five dollars.
l don't plan on cleaning all week.

229
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Bitch.

230
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
How you doing?

231
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,800
Good.

232
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
l don't know how much money
l have in my account...

233
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,000
...but it's yours
if l could bum a cigarette.

234
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,900
Sure.

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
They're Reds.

236
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,700
Thank you.

237
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
Been here long?

238
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,800
Yeah.

239
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,400
What's the deal here if somebody
was looking for something...

240
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,600
...with a little more kick
than nicotine?

241
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,300
Do people actually get stuff here,
or is it...?

242
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
lt happens.

243
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,500
How does it work?
l mean, how can you get stuff?

244
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
Can you get stuff,
or is it, like...?

245
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,900
lf your counselor catches you using,
you can get kicked out.

246
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,200
l don't plan on discussing it
with him.

247
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,300
Too late.

248
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,600
Generally, people come to rehab
not to get loaded.

249
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,700
Well, l try not to run with the pack.

250
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,500
You're a real individual.

251
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,300
You're the only person
who does drugs and alcohol.

252
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,500
l meant what l said.

253
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,400
You get caught using,
you risk getting kicked out.

254
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,700
Fair enough. We done?

255
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,300
And believe me,
l'll know if you're using.

256
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,800
You always this charming?

257
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,800
You always use humor to
deflect things when you're uneasy?

258
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,100
Do you always use insight
to disarm your new recruits?

259
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,900
-What's that?
-lt's literature about your disease.

260
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,100
AA Big Book, some worksheets.

261
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,400
A journal l want you
to write in every day.

262
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,300
l suppose l have to do this.

263
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,700
You got better things to do
with your time?

264
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,600
Hey, listen.

265
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,400
This isn't the last lousy day
you'll have here.

266
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,000
So remember, God never dumps
more on us than we can handle.

267
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,400
ls that available stitched
on a pillow?

268
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,100
Tonight's Iecture: ''Are You A BIackout
Drunk, Or Don't You Remember?.''

269
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,900
You going down?

270
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,900
My problem is, my father just
happened to watch DateIine...

271
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
...the night they're doing
some expos_...

272
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,100
...on Park Avenue drug users...

273
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,600
...the night he caught me
doing blow in the bathroom.

274
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,600
But l don't have a problem.
l don't have health problems.

275
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
l play Ultimate Frisbee
two times a week.

276
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,400
And l'm, you know, a patron of the
arts, and diseases and cures and stuff.

277
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,400
That's what l spend my money on.
So l like to have a little bit of fun.

278
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,700
''AduIt ChiIdren Of AIcohoIics''
is moved to 9 p.m. in room 8.

279
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
CoDA starts at 8 p.m. in B.

280
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,600
CAs and NAs meet tomorrow...

281
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,000
...and overeaters, sexuaI addicts....

282
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,400
Who the hell do you have to know
to get a drink around here?

283
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,800
Oh, God.

284
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,300
Oh, my God, l love you so much.

285
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,400
-Where are all the celebrities?
-There are none.

286
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,800
What? Come on.

287
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,200
All anyone wants from rehab's
a good coked-out star story.

288
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,300
Elizabeth Taylor, weeping in group
about how she never felt beautiful.

289
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,700
Never. Not one single day.
Now, that's the story they want.

290
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,100
-l'll get you out of here.
-l'm not supposed to leave.

291
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,600
You're not supposed to have
Mummy's Little Helper, either.

292
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,200
Hold on, hold on.

293
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
Okay, go.

294
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,200
Be very, very quiet. l'm hiding.

295
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,200
Be very, very quiet.

296
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,300
Drunk men stagger, drunk men faII
Drunk men swear and that's not aII

297
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,200
Quite often they wiII urinate outdoors

298
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,800
Like widowed women, drunk men weep

299
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Like chiIdren curIed up
Drunk men sIeep

300
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,200
Like a dog, a drunk wiII
CrawI around on aII fours

301
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,900
If you're broke bum or rich rake
His dinner be it bread or cake

302
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,900
His beverage be the worst of whiskey
Finest wine

303
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Puke, it stinks, and so it seems
That drunkards go to great extremes

304
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,100
There is yet to be
A perfectIy straight Iine

305
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,400
Hi, everybody.

306
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,700
So what's the deal? l'm out?

307
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,000
lt'll take me a day to
arrange your transfer.

308
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,400
l know where l want to go.
This place in the city--

309
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
l'm not referring you
to a treatment facility.

310
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,700
l get to go home?

311
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,600
Nope.

312
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
Where am l going, then?

313
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Your sentence was
for 28 days of rehab or jail time.

314
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,400
You don't honestly think
l'm going to jail, do you?

315
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,500
For driving drunk, hitting a lawn jockey
that could've been a 4-year-old child?

316
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,000
But it wasn't.
lt was a 4-year-old lawn jockey.

317
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,400
That's fine if this is all a big joke,
but in here we have rules.

318
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
And l warned you about them.
Pack your bags by morning.

319
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
No, l'm not.
Because l don't belong in jail.

320
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,200
l don't even belong in here.

321
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,600
You know, yeah, l know l drink a lot.

322
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,400
l'm a writer,
and that's what l do, we drink.

323
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,300
Cornell Shaw for Clancy, please.

324
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,800
l'm not like those people.
l can control myself.

325
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,500
No, l'll hold.

326
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,000
lf l wanted to, l could.
lf that's what l wanted. l could.

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
l can.

328
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,900
l can!

329
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,900
You know what?

330
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,800
Forget that, Mr. Rogers,
you 1 2-stepping geek.

331
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,200
What do you know about me?

332
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,000
Nothing. You don't know a goddamn
thing about me, you know that?

333
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
AIways tomorrow

334
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,100
Lean on me

335
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,800
-When you're not strong
-Excuse me.

336
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,100
-I'II be your friend
-Excuse me.

337
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,200
-I'II heIp you carry--
-Excuse me!

338
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,700
We're better together! No drugs!

339
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,800
Grant me the serenity to...

340
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,000
-...accept the things l cannot change--
-Excuse me!

341
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Are you coming?

342
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,800
No.

343
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,200
Hi, my name is CorneII.

344
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,000
Hi, my name is CorneII.

345
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,800
l am a drug addict, alcoholic,
compulsive gambler/liar.

346
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,300
Hi, Cornell.

347
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,200
For those of you
who are new tonight...

348
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,600
...l know that this is not your year.

349
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,000
lf that'll make you happy,
l will stop drinking.

350
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,600
And then l would tell myself:

351
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,400
''Tonight l will not get wasted.''

352
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
And then something would happen.

353
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,400
Or nothing would happen.

354
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,400
And l'd get that feeling.

355
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,500
And you aII know
what that feeIing is.

356
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
When your skin is screaming...

357
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,800
...and your hands are shaking...

358
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,400
...and your stomach feeIs Iike
it wants to jump...

359
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
...through your throat.

360
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,900
And you know that
if anyone had a cIue...

361
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,000
...how wrong it feIt to be sober...

362
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,400
...they wouIdn't dream
of asking you to stay that way.

363
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,900
They wouId say, ''Oh, jeez,
I didn't know. Here.

364
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
It's okay for you.
You do that mound of cocaine.

365
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,100
Have a drink. Have 20 drinks.

366
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,200
Whatever you need to do to feeI...

367
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,700
...Iike a normaI human being...

368
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
...you do it.''

369
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,500
And, boy, I did it.

370
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,000
I drank, and I snorted...

371
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,200
...and I drank and snorted
and drank and snorted.

372
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,500
And I did this day after day
after night after night.

373
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,000
I didn't care about the consequences.

374
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Because I knew that they couIdn't be
haIf as bad as not using.

375
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,400
Oh, God!

376
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,900
And then one night
something happened.

377
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,900
You know you're screwed.

378
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,600
I woke up.

379
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,400
I woke up on a sidewaIk.

380
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,000
l had no idea where l was. l couldn't
have told you the city l was in.

381
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,900
My head was pounding...

382
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,200
...and l looked down
and my shirt is covered in blood.

383
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,700
And as I'm Iying there,
wondering what happens next...

384
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,300
...I heard a voice.

385
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,700
And it said:

386
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,700
''Man, this is not a way to live.

387
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,200
This is a way to die.''

388
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,000
Can l help you?

389
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,800
Eddie Boone, checking in.

390
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,700
You can't bring a girl
into treatment with you, Eddie.

391
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,400
l wasn't gonna keep her.

392
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,400
You were really lucky
you didn't break anything.

393
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,300
lt'll be tender and swollen
for a while.

394
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,900
You'll have to live with the pain,
because l can't give you anything.

395
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,400
So take these.

396
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,200
That's good.

397
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,400
Listen, rest.
Alternate heat and cold.

398
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,300
You know, your carpet is filthy.

399
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
l only bring that up because...

400
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,500
...carpet grit's responsible
for a lot of major health problems.

401
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,000
That's the last thing
that you need around here.

402
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Listen, about that jail thing...

403
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,000
...l can't. l can't go.

404
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,500
Not because l don't
want to go, but....

405
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,800
Oh, God, my hands. They just keep
doing that. That's not normal.

406
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
There's something
wrong with my hands.

407
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,500
Well, with me.

408
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,400
Because what kind of person
just jumps out of a window, you know?

409
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,000
Because she can't sit still, you know?

410
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,500
And be alone, and, you know,
in a room without....

411
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,800
You know, a person should be able
to just be alone, right?

412
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,500
You know, human beings should
be able to just breathe.

413
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,800
l can't breathe.

414
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,200
And l feel that....

415
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,300
l think, l know
that if l go to jail...

416
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,200
...like this, you know, l'll die.

417
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,500
l don't want to die.

418
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,000
l don't like what's happening here.

419
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,900
Wait a minute, let's try to use
a feeling word.

420
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,500
l'm pissed!

421
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,300
Okay, pissed. Why?

422
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
Because no way should she be here.

423
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Tell her.

424
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,500
No way should you be here!

425
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,100
That's right. There's a rule.
No using. You broke it.

426
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,200
-l'm sorry.
-Sorry, my ass.

427
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,300
All you've done since you got here is
sit around while the rest of us work.

428
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,100
You expect us to be glad
that they let you stay?

429
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,400
l'm not expecting anything.

430
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,700
Gwen, just listening.
Everybody, feeling words.

431
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,400
l don't think you are giving.

432
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,800
l don't feel that
you are giving person.

433
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,600
l'm trying!

434
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,200
l don't feel niceness coming from you.

435
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,700
Should l go to another group?

436
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,100
Great idea. Spread
your negativity even further.

437
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,200
You know, if you really try...

438
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,400
...you could ruin the experience
for the entire patient population.

439
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,700
l am having a bad day!

440
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,800
l am having the worst damn day
of my whole damn life!

441
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,300
So if it is not too much
to ask of you people...

442
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,100
...will you just back the fuck off?!

443
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,000
Excellent work.
Really excellent work.

444
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Good sharing, everybody.

445
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,200
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

446
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,300
l wanted to talk to you
about last night.

447
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,200
l don't normally do that,
but you were great.

448
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,900
Oh, my Lord.
You gotta be kidding me.

449
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,800
-What?
-Promise me we were safe.

450
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,400
-We were what?
-Safe.

451
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,600
Safe?

452
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,200
You're not one of them
paternity suit kind of gals--

453
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,300
What are you talking about?

454
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,500
What are you talking about?

455
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,100
l'm talking about last night.

456
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,400
You don't remember last night?

457
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,400
l got a little drunk on the plane.

458
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,000
Of course you did.

459
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,600
You know what?

460
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,500
lt was nothing.
Just don't worry about it.

461
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,400
-We didn't...?
-Nope.

462
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,900
Thank God, boy--

463
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,900
You know what?
That's more than enough, thank you.

464
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,200
Nothing personal,
l just made myself a promise:

465
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,100
No more ending up naked
with some girl l don't know.

466
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,000
That's a noble goal, and l wish you
the very best of luck with it.

467
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,500
Cirrhosis is the ninth leading cause
of death in the United States...

468
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,700
...and 45% of the time,
that is alcohol-induced.

469
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,000
Let's take a look at the first slide.

470
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,200
This could be your liver right now.

471
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,100
Do you have plans for dinner?

472
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,700
This is not a test about you
and how you act in relationships.

473
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
lt's called Equine Therapy.

474
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,800
Tennessee doesn't lie and manipulate.

475
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,200
He'll just respond to how you feel.
And your job is to clean his hoof.

476
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,400
This is how one gets sober?

477
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
lt's character-revealing.
The way we approach the horse...

478
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,900
...is like the way
we approach the world.

479
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,200
We gotta try to match our insides
with our outsides. Be real.

480
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,200
So my therapist today is
a very large, smelly beast of burden.

481
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,800
We're totally in sync.

482
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,000
Step in, you breathe.

483
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,300
Couldn't stink more if he were dead.

484
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,200
You reach down, pinch the tendon...

485
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,700
...trust yourself,
and let the horse do the rest.

486
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,700
Who's gonna be first? Gwen?

487
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,700
-Think you might need help?
-Nope, l'm fine.

488
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,000
Let yourself go.

489
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,000
All right, Mr. Ed,
just pick up your stupid foot.

490
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,100
Can't force it.

491
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,700
-Sure you don't need some help?
-No. l'm fine.

492
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,600
All right, look, Cornell,
just give me a pill...

493
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,400
...give me a shot, l don't know,
give me a lobotomy.

494
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,000
lnstant gratification has worked
so well for you in the past.

495
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,200
Just take it easy and keep it simple.

496
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,200
l am so tired by the way
you people talk.

497
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,900
''One day at a time.'' What is that?

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Two, three days at a time
is an option?

499
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,800
l don't need the Romper Room
bullshit. l need....

500
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,800
What are you doing?

501
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,400
lt's a therapeutic tool.
You leave me no choice.

502
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,000
Betty, you gotta get me
a new roommate. He stinks.

503
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,500
l don't know
if he's just eating beef...

504
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,000
...and secreting ketones
out of every pore--

505
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,500
We're gonna come back to this.
l'm gonna be back.

506
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,100
We're in each other's lives, okay?

507
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,000
Gwen, did you get a sign?
''Confront me if l don't ask for help.''

508
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,200
What kind of help
you looking for exactly?

509
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,800
Okay, Traci.
l want you to tell your mom:

510
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,800
''When you do drugs,
this is what happens.'' Okay?

511
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,300
When you do drugs, you don't do
any fun stuff like you used to.

512
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,500
Be specific, Traci. What was fun?

513
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,600
Well, when you play games with us
and do puzzles.

514
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,200
That was fun.

515
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,100
l have an idea.

516
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Tell your mom
about the drawing, Darnell.

517
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,300
lt's of me and Traci home
late at night, and Mom's not there.

518
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,600
Tell your mom how that makes you feel
when she's not there.

519
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,200
Worried.

520
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,000
Scared.

521
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,200
Great.

522
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,800
Man! Not again.

523
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,800
I don't know.

524
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,000
Mom, wake up.

525
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
I don't know.

526
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Mom?

527
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,000
Hello, wake up!

528
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,900
Sad, I guess.

529
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,400
Lonely.

530
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,300
-Hello?
-No reactions.

531
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,100
l have an idea.

532
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,600
-She's fine.
-She's up.

533
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,700
Bye.

534
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,300
Hey, hey, what do you know?

535
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,300
Pills and booze have got to go!

536
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,100
Hey, hey, what do you say?

537
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,900
Sober is the only way!

538
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,900
Good night, Eddie.

539
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,300
Wait for me!

540
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,800
-Beat you!
-Girls!

541
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,700
What?

542
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
-Aunt Helen, why are you here?
-Where's Mom?

543
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,900
l'm just gonna be straight with you.
Your mother has passed.

544
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,400
Just slap her real hard
and she'll wake up.

545
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,100
This'II onIy be for a whiIe untiI we
figure out something more permanent.

546
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,800
-HeIIo?
-Hey, it's me. Gwen.

547
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,200
Well, l know which ''me'' it is.
What is it?

548
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,200
Let me guess. You need money.

549
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,600
-l'm not giving you any more money.
-LiI, I don't need money.

550
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,300
-lt's different this time.
-I'm gIad to hear it.

551
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,600
Whatever happened to our
fun-and-friendly sister rapport?

552
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,600
l don't know. You tell me.

553
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,700
Look, they make you....
They're having a family week.

554
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
What?

555
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,000
Family sessions.

556
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,400
They work with us for a few days,
teach us how to talk to each other...

557
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,000
...and then supervise
an actual conversation.

558
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,800
You want me to come there?

559
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,200
They make you ask somebody,
so it's either you or Aunt Helen.

560
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,700
So let me get this straight.

561
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,300
You screw up, and then l'm supposed
to drop everything in my life?

562
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,900
They can schedule it around
what's good for you. So....

563
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,400
No, it's just--

564
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,300
l'm cooking here, okay?
l've got people coming over.

565
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,700
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

566
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,100
-l didn't mean....
-No, you never do.

567
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,700
Gwen, you never mean anything.

568
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,600
l have to go.

569
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,500
Lil, look,
l bet this one's really fast.

570
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,000
lt's just a table, stupid.
Leave it alone.

571
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,700
No. lt's a sled.

572
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,500
Well, l'm not a fan of
all soap operas. Just Santa Cruz.

573
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,000
l mean, it's just an incredible show.
l saw it the first time...

574
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,000
...when l was hospitalized a while ago
after l got out of my first rehab.

575
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,300
There was this girl
on the show, Darian.

576
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,600
She was also hospitalized, and it was
like l was staring at myself.

577
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,100
l mean, not physically,
because l don't have the curly hair.

578
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
This whole thing
had happened with her.

579
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,200
She had actually been impregnated
by her brother...

580
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,200
...but she obviously didn't know
it was her brother at the time.

581
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,700
And l don't have a brother.
But l have sisters.

582
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,200
So it's really sort of...

583
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,700
...been an inspiration...

584
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,000
...for me.

585
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,400
And it's really sort of
helped me stay sober...

586
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,300
...off and on.

587
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,200
Mom, everything's okay.

588
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,600
Hey, Andrea.

589
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,600
Hey, Daniel.

590
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,700
Want to give me one of those?

591
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,500
Get your own.

592
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,500
All right, then.

593
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,200
Hey, Gary, can l bum a cig?

594
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,200
There she is. Hello, darling.
How are you?

595
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,000
-Christ!
-Oh, my God, what's that?

596
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,000
Nothing.

597
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,400
You poor thing!
What are they doing to you?

598
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,100
-l fell.
-ls that part of the therapy?

599
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,000
You poor baby.
l know, l'll get you home, darling.

600
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,800
-Everyone's asking after you.
-Like who?

601
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,500
Like Mrs. Lefkowitz from downstairs.
Remember?

602
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
-The non-talker?
-Five years, not a peep.

603
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,100
l'm crossing the lobby yesterday,
she looks at me and says:

604
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,900
''Thanks God you got rid of that girl.
She's nothing but bad news.''

605
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,400
-That's not funny.
-Of course it's funny.

606
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,800
Anonymous strangers thinking
l'm bad news, that's not funny.

607
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,300
Everyone l've told has laughed
really hard.

608
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,400
-That's great.
-You need cheering up.

609
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,900
-l'll take you away.
-What?

610
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,700
Get away from these freaky people.

611
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,500
l don't want to leave--
Oh, God!

612
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,500
Here, have some cheese.

613
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,400
Have it on a roll.

614
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
No bread.
l'm getting fat.

615
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,300
-lt's better with bread.
-l don't want bread.

616
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,400
l'll have the bread.
Just break it open for me, will you?

617
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,600
-What is your problem?
-Break open the bread.

618
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
This is a ring.

619
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,200
Yep.

620
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,200
What, are you proposing?

621
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,600
Yeah, l am.

622
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,100
At rehab.

623
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,400
No. l'm proposing to you now.
You happen to be here.

624
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,900
Yeah, but....

625
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,400
l don't know. l mean....
''Well, how did he ask?''

626
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,200
''He visited me in rehab and....''

627
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,000
So it's not moonlight in Maui.

628
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,200
Where would we get married?
McSorley's Pub?

629
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,100
Why not? Make a good story.

630
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,800
l don't need any more stories. l have
enough stories. l would like a life.

631
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,100
That's what l was offering.

632
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,800
-What is that?
-Champagne.

633
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,000
l brought it thinking, wrongly,
this might be a romantic moment.

634
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,900
This is so not how l saw
this whole thing playing out!

635
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,200
l'm not taking this
as lightly as l used to.

636
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,400
-Taking what?
-This.

637
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,000
This.

638
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,300
This straighten-up-and-fly-right thing.
This....

639
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,300
l don't know. Maybe there is
something wrong with me.

640
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,600
-That's what they say?
-No!

641
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,500
lt is. You know what?
l think they're right.

642
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,300
They're not. You're just in a rut.
lt happens to everyone.

643
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,800
No, there's an entire world of people
who do everything right.

644
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,700
They live right, they don't drink,
they don't do drugs.

645
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,200
-A crock of shit.
-They're happy.

646
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,000
They're not happy.
No adult human being is happy.

647
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,400
People are born.

648
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,700
They have a limited time to think
life is dandy, but then...

649
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,400
...inevitably, tragedy strikes
and they realize life equals loss.

650
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,400
The point of the game is to minimize
the pain caused by that equation.

651
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,800
Some people do it by having kids
or making money or coin collecting.

652
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,300
And others do it by getting wasted.

653
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,800
Letting that switch in the head turn
the hot light off and the cool light on.

654
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,200
Nobody gets hurt collecting coins.

655
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,800
Everybody hurts everybody.
lt's the human condition!

656
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,600
Don't let them tell you there's
something wrong with you! You're fine!

657
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,100
l don't feel fine.

658
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,200
Of course not. You're in DeIiverance
country surrounded by sober freaks.

659
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,100
And you're not with me.

660
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,800
l don't feel fine these days either,
and l think that's because we're apart.

661
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,200
You're mine.

662
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,800
l'm yours.

663
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,600
l love you.

664
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,600
Why do you want me, Jasper?
l am such a mess.

665
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,500
Maybe l like mess.

666
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,400
There's a time when you can share...

667
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,000
...and you can hold hands
and be on the same path.

668
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,100
But there's always
a fork in the road at some point.

669
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,400
And sometimes you have to go
on one part of the fork...

670
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,200
...and they gotta go
on the other part of the fork.

671
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,400
Or just down the back part of the fork
while you go forward.

672
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,200
And they're like....

673
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,100
Or they got a salad fork
and you have a big dinner fork...

674
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,400
...and you have longer to go,
but they're done, because that's it.

675
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,700
They're stuck on a piece of food
that they....

676
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,700
The dessert fork or, like,
one of those, you know...

677
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,300
...small crab forks,
and you're trying to get out a crab.

678
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,200
And you're over here jumping to
the huge serving fork...

679
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,600
...or something like that.
Or a ladle, you know.

680
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,200
Hey, And?

681
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,400
Guess what.

682
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,600
Goober. Are you not
talking to me right now?

683
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,700
l only had, like, five pieces.

684
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,200
What are you doing?

685
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,900
Here, give me that.

686
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,500
-She didn't come.
-Your mom?

687
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,700
l waited all day for her.

688
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
l did my hair.

689
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,500
She probably had to work
or something like that.

690
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,300
No, she just hates me.
l make her embarrassed.

691
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
She doesn't hate you.
l'll get someone.

692
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,300
-Don't tell anybody!
-lt's okay.

693
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,100
We have to. lt's very serious.

694
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,200
They'll take me to Psychiatric!

695
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,000
Please, l can't get kicked out again.

696
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,100
Okay, we're not gonna go anywhere,
all right?

697
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,700
All right, come on.

698
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,600
Why don't we go in the other room?

699
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,700
-How did you do that?
-What? That?

700
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,600
lt's pretty easy.

701
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,200
You just take one of these.

702
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,200
Tear it in half.

703
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,100
Just so you know, l wasn't...

704
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,700
...trying to off myself or anything.

705
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,200
lt's just something l do sometimes.

706
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,600
Doesn't it hurt?

707
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,300
lt feels better.

708
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,900
Than what?

709
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,400
Everything else.

710
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,600
Like that.

711
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,400
Then you try and slip them
into the cracks like that.

712
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,200
ls he a drunk?

713
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,200
l don't know. Maybe.

714
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,400
Then you'll have to say no.

715
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,100
lt's just like Darian and Falcon.

716
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,000
He was addicted to gambling...

717
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,300
...and even though
she completely loved him...

718
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,900
...she had to walk away.

719
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,900
Do l know these people?

720
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,700
From Santa Cruz.

721
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,600
lt was more complicated for them.

722
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,200
They were actually
half-brother, half-sister.

723
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,700
But Darian didn't know that
when she found out about the gambling.

724
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,100
Can't believe this is
the advice l'm getting.

725
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,300
A show doesn't stay on the air
for 1 8 years for being stupid.

726
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,800
Tonight's Iecture:
''I've Worked AII 1 2 Steps.

727
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
Can I Go Home Now?''

728
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,200
Bus is here.

729
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,700
Thanks.

730
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh, my God.

731
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,300
Let's go, team!
lt's all about trust today.

732
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,600
Come here.

733
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,600
Listen.

734
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,300
About last night, l really think
you should tell somebody.

735
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,200
-Oh, yeah. l already did.
-Yeah, when?

736
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,400
This morning. l found my counselor,
and l told her...

737
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,600
...and we talked about it.
She'll help me.

738
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,700
Hold on. You really talked to her?

739
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,700
No, l'm making it up.

740
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,300
We don't really have to climb
this thing, do we?

741
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,100
We don't know the whole story.
We ought to hear her side...

742
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,500
...before we go saying what's what.

743
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,000
Guzzling Gwen!

744
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,800
-What's with the ring-in-the-roll guy?
-Who?

745
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,000
Your boyfriend!

746
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,400
Andrea, does the phrase
''in confidence'' mean anything?

747
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,500
You never said not to tell.

748
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,600
l know better than anyone
how important it is who you marry.

749
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,700
But just because somebody proposes,
that don't mean you have to say yes.

750
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,400
-Did someone propose to Gwen?
-Her boyfriend.

751
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,300
-l thought Gwen was a lesbian.
-l'm not a lesbian!

752
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,500
lt's okay if you are.

753
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,300
Can we talk about something else?

754
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,500
When did this happen?

755
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
Yesterday. On the lake.

756
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Was it sunset?
Sunset by the lake is very romantic.

757
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,400
lt was lunchtime,
and he brought a picnic...

758
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,600
...with champagne.

759
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,200
He brought champagne?

760
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,500
We didn't drink it.
l threw it overboard.

761
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,500
lt's not a very cool guy
to bring you booze in rehab.

762
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,200
He doesn't understand
what l'm doing here.

763
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,300
lf you're serious about getting sober,
your love partner would know.

764
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,600
You must not be committed
to your recovery.

765
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,600
-Oh, my God!
-Sorry.

766
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,700
Shouldn't you be doing something now?

767
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,300
-l got you.
-l say you dump that guy.

768
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,600
l can make this decision on my own,
okay? l don't need your help.

769
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,000
That's not what your sign says.

770
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,600
Forget what my sign says!

771
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,500
He doesn't know a thing about me!
Neither do you all!

772
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,900
You don't live my shitty life.

773
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,900
Until you do, do not tell me to give
up the one person that matters to me!

774
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,200
l know he's not perfect, but he's the
one that'll show up on my birthday...

775
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,400
...and say, ''l'm glad you were born!''

776
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,600
What's the matter with you?

777
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,600
-Just let go.
-Trust it.

778
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,500
Oh, my God! Look at my package.

779
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,000
No matter where I may roam

780
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,800
On Iand or sea or foam

781
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,100
You can aIways hear me
Singing this song

782
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,700
Show me the way to go home

783
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,900
Here we go.

784
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,100
ls there a key to the ladies' room?
Thank you.

785
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,300
Excuse me, sir.

786
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,400
Can l have the key to the men's room?

787
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
What?

788
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,900
-What?
-Eddie Boone!

789
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,200
Thank you.

790
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,300
Come on, come on, come on.

791
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,900
l need some paper, some pens.

792
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,800
Dad, we need a napkin or something.

793
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,300
Okay, hold on. Let me look.

794
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,100
-This is all l got. That's it.
-Thanks.

795
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,600
-What's your name?
-l'm Adam.

796
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,100
-And l'm Dan.
-Adam and Dan.

797
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,200
You pitched a no-hitter against
the Braves on August 4th.

798
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,500
ls that right? August 4th?

799
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,400
Eddie, where's your car, man?
l bet it's really cool!

800
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,400
My car?

801
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,300
Guys, we gotta get home.
Say goodbye now.

802
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,700
Nice to meet you.

803
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,800
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

804
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,600
Have a great season, Eddie.

805
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,400
Mail call.

806
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,500
Charm Blossom,
this really isn't necessary.

807
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,300
Lining up the mail like a bar graph
to show the fullness of our lives.

808
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,100
l know my life is empty, okay?

809
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,700
For you.

810
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,800
-Watching game tapes?
-Yep.

811
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,000
They're out of ginger snaps.

812
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,300
Looks like your mail's
more fun than mine.

813
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,100
Do you want them?

814
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,700
-You don't want them?
-No.

815
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,400
What'd you get?

816
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,300
-My sister's coming to family sessions.
-That's good.

817
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,100
No. l'd pay very good money
not to hear what she has to say.

818
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,800
So what's wrong with your balls?
So to speak.

819
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,100
So to speak, nothing.
l don't want them.

820
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,900
-Why not?
-Because l don't.

821
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,300
That's a tautology. Something is
what it is because it is what it is.

822
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,000
The sky is blue
because it reflects the ocean.

823
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,300
The ocean is blue
because it reflects the sky.

824
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,000
Who are you talking to?

825
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,200
l have no idea.

826
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,600
l bet you can't sit still
and be quiet for one minute.

827
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,000
l can.

828
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,600
ls this what we're doing now?

829
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,100
A little quiet contest?

830
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
Wait a minute!

831
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,400
-These are not game tapes.
-Wait!

832
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,500
-Oh, my God!
-Let me have that!

833
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,700
l know what this is!
l can't believe you watch this!

834
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,800
-l wasn't!
-Santa Cruz watcher.

835
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,400
-l'm sorry.
-lt's fine.

836
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,300
-No, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
-No, it's totally fine.

837
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
l always do that. l always do that.

838
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,500
You always do what?

839
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,400
Women....

840
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,100
Drugs, women.
l mean, just leap before you think.

841
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,500
Not you. l mean....

842
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,000
What are you saying?
What? You were...

843
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,000
...trying to snort me?

844
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,100
Yeah, maybe.

845
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,600
What a perfect opportunity
to thank him for curing your cancer.

846
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,200
If I had known he was gonna save
your Iife just to join it with his...

847
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,300
...I wouId've preferred you'd died.

848
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,700
Pretty good show once
you get to know everybody in it.

849
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,100
So who sent you all those balls?

850
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,800
My agent. He's trying to psych me up.

851
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,400
Oh, for next season?

852
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,900
Well, for there to be a next season.

853
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,000
Why? You thinking about retiring?

854
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,700
l don't know. Might have to.
l mean, you gotta quit sometime.

855
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,400
l'm not 22 anymore.

856
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,600
Plus, you know,
maybe a more normal life...

857
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,600
...might be a little less pressure.

858
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,200
l understand. Marry a cute girl,
move to the suburbs...

859
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,300
...spend your weekends mowing.
You won't want to do coke again.

860
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,700
-Are you okay?
-These headaches!

861
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,000
Darian? Darian?

862
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,500
What the heII is he doing here?

863
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,600
Get an ambuIance.
He has meIigioma astrocytroma.

864
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
What is it?

865
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,700
A tiny IittIe cIuster of brain tumors.

866
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,100
''Tiny clusters''?

867
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,600
He's very sick.

868
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,000
Attention aII patients.
Tonight's Iecture:

869
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
''What's Wrong With CeIebrating
Sobriety By Getting Drunk?''

870
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,300
Give it to her.

871
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,200
Just give it to her.

872
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,900
My God! Where did you get this?

873
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,900
Guys, this is the soap opera
that l watch.

874
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,800
-You watch my soap?
-Yeah.

875
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,600
Eddie, you surprise me.

876
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,400
l only work every fifth day.
What else do l do with my time?

877
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,800
Well, thank you very much.

878
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,900
Sometimes l like to read.
You know, literature? Stuff like that.

879
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,600
Your betting is what Iost you
your money and my respect.

880
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,700
I Iove you.

881
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,700
Mom, Dr. Griffin,
what are you doing here?

882
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,600
We've come to teII you
something about FaIcon.

883
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,700
Darian, it Iooks Iike I may be
carrying FaIcon's chiId.

884
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,400
What do you want to bet
that chiId...

885
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,500
...turns out to have
a gambIing probIem?

886
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,600
It's just another tiny cIuster.

887
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,800
Do something!

888
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,400
It'II be over in a minute.

889
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,900
He'll get over it.
Falcon will be back, better than ever.

890
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,500
No, Falcon's leaving the show.

891
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,400
He's having brain clusters.

892
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,100
Maybe it's more than a tiny cIuster.

893
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,400
l hate that mother.

894
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,500
l love her.

895
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,900
-You do?
-l think she's hilarious.

896
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,700
l want you to talk to Gwen,
and be specific.

897
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,400
Pick one incident.

898
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,700
You ruined my wedding.

899
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,100
And when that happened,
how did you feel?

900
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,400
How do you think it made me feel?

901
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,900
Tell her.

902
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:34,300
l'm trying to explain here, okay?
l mean, you asked me, so l'm just....

903
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,900
l mean, she shows up drunk...

904
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,400
...stumbles through
the entire ceremony.

905
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,300
At the reception, she gets up...

906
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,700
...and, in front of my friends...

907
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,900
...my new in-laws,
she gives this toast...

908
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,100
-...that was completely--
-What? What toast?

909
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,700
-Gwen, let your sister talk.
-What toast?

910
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,300
''Well, not everybody can be perfect.
But at least some of us can try.''

911
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,000
We all know that grownups
have to make compromises.

912
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And Lily is very, very grown up.

913
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,800
So that's what she did.

914
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,500
She said:

915
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,700
''ls Andrew...

916
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,900
...the very best man for me...

917
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,800
...on this earth?

918
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,800
No. And l mean, no.''

919
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,600
She says, ''Hey, l'm not
getting any younger.

920
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,000
He makes a hell of a lot of money.

921
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,200
So l'll marry the little sucker.''

922
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,000
To Lily and her little sucker.

923
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,600
That's not what happened.

924
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,600
You think that your memory of that day
is somehow better than mine?

925
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,200
-l don't think so.
-Stick with the format.

926
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,800
l'm sticking to the format. l'm just
trying to give you a picture here.

927
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
And she walks around...

928
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,500
...like some victim...

929
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,800
...like life just handed her
this raw deal.

930
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,000
Well, you know, my father left too.

931
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,700
And my mother died
when l was little too.

932
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,100
And you don't see me using that...

933
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,000
...as some excuse to just completely
abandon all self-control...

934
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,400
...and indulge myself--

935
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,000
lndulge? What?
You think l like this?

936
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,600
We've gotten off-track here. Lily.

937
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,500
Think about Gwen's behavior
at your wedding...

938
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,400
...and tell her now how you feel.

939
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,400
Yeah, Lily, how does it make you feel?

940
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,800
You know, this is just....

941
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,300
l don't need this.

942
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,100
l have a life.

943
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,200
Lily, wait for me.

944
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,400
Beat you.

945
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,900
What are you doing?

946
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,400
Great. Another thing l suck at.

947
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,300
Well, hold on. Gwen, hey.

948
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,800
Please.

949
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,900
Come here a second.

950
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,100
-What?
-What were you thinking about?

951
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,300
When you threw the ball,
what were you thinking about?

952
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,100
l don't know. The mating habits
of African ants. l don't know.

953
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,300
The striped thing.

954
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,500
You were thinking about
hitting the mattress.

955
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,300
Well, you know, it might sound funny
to you, but that's all wrong.

956
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,400
When you lock in on the strike zone...

957
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,800
...it's looking about
the size of a peanut.

958
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,500
And you think, ''Damn. l gotta get
that little ball in there?''

959
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,900
You've psyched yourself
right out of the game.

960
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,200
The strike zone, the call...

961
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,600
...the count, the batter,
forget all that.

962
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:21,100
You gotta think about the little
things. The things you can control.

963
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,700
You can control your stance,
your balance...

964
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,400
...your release, your follow-through.

965
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,100
Think about those little things
and only those little things....

966
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,500
You know? l mean....

967
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,900
Because when you let go of the ball...

968
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,700
...it's over.

969
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,700
You don't have a say in what happens.
That's somebody else's job.

970
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,000
-l want you to try this.
-l don't want to.

971
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:51,900
l'm just curious.

972
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,400
-l don't want to do it.
-l just want to see how you hold it.

973
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,700
Don't grab it, don't grab it.
Look at it, look at it.

974
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,600
Hold it like an egg.

975
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,400
Loose. Easy. All right?

976
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,900
Let me get a look at it
from over there.

977
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,300
Let me get a look at it
from over there.

978
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,600
All right.

979
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,400
l want you to throw it over here
nice and easy.

980
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,500
Point at me with your left hand.

981
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,500
Throw it where you're pointing at.

982
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,900
Better. But you nutted the batter...

983
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,700
...and the other team's beating
the crap out of you.

984
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Try again. Heads up.
l want you to do it again.

985
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,500
This time, shut your eyes.

986
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,500
-What?
-Just shut your eyes.

987
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,500
-So weird.
-Fire away.

988
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,100
Right there.
That is a strike in any country.

989
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,100
You're a natural.

990
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,600
Come on.

991
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,500
Folks, the definition of insanity...

992
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,100
...is repeating the same behavior over
and over, expecting different results.

993
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,400
Thank you.

994
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,500
l have a question.

995
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,700
Once we all leave, we have needs
that are going to need to be filled...

996
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,700
...by people, physically, at times.

997
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,400
How and when can we do that?
Not how, just when?

998
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah, l know, l know.

999
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:44,200
People in recovery want to know
when's a good time to start dating.

1000
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,400
And my rule of thumb is, when you
get home, get yourself a plant.

1001
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,100
l like spider plants,
but whatever turns you on.

1002
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,000
Then, in about a year, get a pet.
And then, if, in say...

1003
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:01,100
...two years, the plant
and the pet are still alive...

1004
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,500
...then you can start to think about
having a relationship.

1005
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,100
Thanks.

1006
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,300
l'll be fine. l know what to do.

1007
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:13,900
Don't drink, go to meetings,
find a sponsor, ask for help.

1008
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,800
Don't drink, go to meetings,
find a sponsor, ask for help.

1009
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,500
Happy traiIs to you

1010
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,700
Keep smiIing untiI then

1011
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,700
Who cares about the cIouds

1012
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,600
If we're together

1013
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,200
Just sing a song
And bring the sunny....

1014
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,800
Well, l hope he makes it.

1015
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,600
Statistically,
only three out of 1 0 of us will.

1016
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,300
So in a way...

1017
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,300
...it's good for us if he goes back
to using. You know?

1018
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,200
Odds-wise.

1019
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,400
God, l love afternoons like this.

1020
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,400
Do you know what's missing?

1021
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,700
That l don't have a dry vodka martini
with two olives in a chilled glass.

1022
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,700
God, l miss that.

1023
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,300
Lately l've been
lying awake at night...

1024
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,000
...thinking of the dumb-ass things
l've done when l was messed up.

1025
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:15,400
One night last year, at dinner,
l threw up all over my glazed ham.

1026
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,800
Then l thought,
''Well, maybe nobody noticed.''

1027
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,600
l don't think of it as a garnish.

1028
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,600
l'm a winner.

1029
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,700
Oh, God.

1030
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,100
You know what the worst one was?
For me?

1031
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,100
My best friend in the whole world.

1032
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:33,400
We grew up playing ball,
hunting and fishing.

1033
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,600
One Sunday morning, he walks in
on me and his wife in bed.

1034
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,300
You never live that one down.

1035
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,700
Tell me one of yours.

1036
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,300
Excuse me?

1037
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,200
What's the worst thing you did
when you were messed up?

1038
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,500
l don't know.

1039
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,200
Come on. Give me a couple.
l'll pick one.

1040
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,200
l don't really remember any.

1041
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,400
l just told you some stuff that's....

1042
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,500
l'm a drunk.
Drunks forget everything. You know?

1043
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,700
Come on.

1044
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:09,300
Why? So l can recount the last 1 5
disgusting years to humiliate myself?

1045
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,800
-No, thanks.
-Why not?

1046
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,800
Because l don't feel like
talking about it.

1047
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,000
You too good for me?

1048
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,600
Are you dense?
Did your mom drop you on your head?

1049
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,900
l said no. l don't want to
talk about it. Just drop it.

1050
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,400
God, it's so hard.

1051
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,100
You're a doctor.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1052
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,100
We carry our own bags here.
This isn't the Sheraton.

1053
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,100
Your chores are posted.
We will take the stairs.

1054
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,400
What? l paid you a shitload of money.
l am not doing any chores.

1055
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,600
-Pills.
-Booze.

1056
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,600
Coke and sex.

1057
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,900
It's your daughter, Darian, Deirdre.

1058
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:05,100
Don't worry about Darian.
I tucked her into bed hours ago.

1059
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,800
So did I.

1060
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
No.

1061
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,700
Oh, God!

1062
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,300
lt was an unbelievable episode.
l wish you'd seen it.

1063
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,700
Everyone was losing their minds.

1064
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,300
What are you doing?

1065
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,800
Packing.

1066
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,400
What does it look like?

1067
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,300
-You're not leaving for a couple days.
-So?

1068
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,200
l am leaving.
Might as well get ready.

1069
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,900
There's no point in
making this room all homey...

1070
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
...for only, like, 42 more hours.

1071
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,800
There's 20 minutes left till curfew.
Let's get ice cream.

1072
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,500
-Satisfy your sugar cravings.
-No, thanks.

1073
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,800
You don't have to do this.

1074
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:56,900
Do what?

1075
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,800
How do you know what l have to do?
Have you ever left rehab?

1076
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,900
No, but l--

1077
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,400
You've never left rehab, so you
don't know what you're talking about.

1078
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,000
True, but l have been a part
of some very emotional sing-outs--

1079
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,700
l'm sorry. That's right.
You sang ''Lean On Me'' a few times.

1080
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
The stupidest cheesy song ever.

1081
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,700
You must know about leaving rehab
better than anyone.

1082
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,300
l got an eyelash. Make a wish.

1083
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,300
Custody of my kids.

1084
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,900
Sobriety.

1085
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,600
Come on, baby. We all want that.

1086
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,000
Think of something else.

1087
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,000
My foreskin back.

1088
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,300
No one asked me before they took it.

1089
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,200
They just took it.

1090
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,200
Way to share, Gerhardt.
Way to share.

1091
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,600
Okay, here we go.

1092
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,400
All gone.

1093
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,100
Read the sign.

1094
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,400
Betty, where's the love?

1095
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,100
Daniel, wow.

1096
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,100
Guzzling Gwen.

1097
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,900
What happened?

1098
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,500
This? l honest to God don't know.

1099
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,300
Well, it's really nice to see you.

1100
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Get a room.

1101
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,100
Oh, my God, it's a joke!

1102
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,900
lt's a miracle! Oh, you know what?

1103
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,700
l could use your medical expertise,
if you got a second.

1104
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,300
l got a second.

1105
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:22,200
-Use a condom.
-Ah, two! Two in one day!

1106
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,900
Gerhardt?

1107
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,600
l wrote this for Andrea's going away,
and that is for you.

1108
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,200
-Am l the lead?
-Yes.

1109
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,800
lf you could do that,
that would be great.

1110
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,300
l should direct this.

1111
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,800
-You don't want me.
-You'll be great.

1112
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,100
Gwen, l'll ruin it.

1113
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,900
You get to wear lipstick.

1114
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Really?

1115
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,500
So just think Meryl Streep.

1116
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,800
Think Cry in the Dark. Remember?

1117
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,400
''Dingo stole my baby.
A dingo stole my baby.''

1118
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,100
Andrea D., mail pickup
at the Parker cabin, main room.

1119
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,900
Okay, go. Go, go.

1120
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,400
-Gerhardt, come on!
-All right. Okay.

1121
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,000
Watch the phone.

1122
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,100
Somebody sent you
a cute little monkey.

1123
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,200
We used to make those here.
They're real easy.

1124
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,500
You take a string,
tie it around the toes.

1125
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,400
Becomes the head.

1126
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,300
And arms--

1127
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,700
Come here.

1128
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,400
Sit down.

1129
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,400
Hello, everybody. My name's Gwen.

1130
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,300
l'm an alcoholic and an addict.
But l guess you already know that.

1131
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,900
ln honor of Andrea's departure...

1132
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,400
...instead of singing
''Lean On Me'' yet again...

1133
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,700
...we have our own version
of Santa Cruz.

1134
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,200
l hope you like it.

1135
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,800
And now...

1136
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,900
...Santa Booze.

1137
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,400
Oh, Falcon. l am so afraid.

1138
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,800
When they find l've taken you
out of the hospital...

1139
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,800
...Mother and Dr. Griffin Hartley
are sure to come here.

1140
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,600
What will we do?

1141
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,000
lf l can't be without--

1142
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,100
With you.

1143
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:34,900
lf l can't be with you,
l would rather be dead.

1144
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,600
But, dear God, the tiny clusters
of tumors in my brain.

1145
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,900
Oh, God, the tiny little clusters
of tumors in his brain!

1146
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,700
Somebody, help! Oh, God!

1147
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:46,800
Wait...

1148
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,100
...l have some pills that....

1149
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,500
l'm okay. lt's okay. l'm okay.

1150
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,100
Oh, Falcon...

1151
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,500
...hold me.

1152
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,300
l knew we'd find you two together.

1153
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,500
Darian, your lover...

1154
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,700
...is also your sister!

1155
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,400
No!

1156
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,500
lt's not possible.

1157
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,900
lt is not possible.

1158
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,400
Deirdre, darling,
l have some bad news.

1159
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:20,200
Your daughter, Darian,
Falcon's lover and sister...

1160
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,100
...is also carrying my baby.

1161
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,700
-No!
-No!

1162
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:24,900
Oh, God!

1163
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Get out of here! Get out of here!

1164
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,800
All right. l got no problem
getting out of here. l'll do this.

1165
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,300
-What are you doing?
-lmprovising. They do that on soaps.

1166
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,600
What are you doing?

1167
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,400
Just improvising. Go with it.

1168
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,800
-Oh! But, no, my tumors!
-lt's the melio....

1169
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,100
Melagioma nestrocytroma.

1170
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,400
Whatever. l'm sorry.
There's nothing l can do.

1171
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,700
What are you doing?

1172
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,000
lt says in the script that we kiss.

1173
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,900
l like you, bon voyage,
but l'm not kissing Gerhardt.

1174
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Okay, everybody.

1175
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,400
Excellent work. That was really
good sharing. l really enjoyed that.

1176
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,200
Good use of feeling words
and all that. Give me more.

1177
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,400
Who are you?

1178
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,500
Evelyn. Don't you recognize the hat?

1179
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,400
Okay, but seeing as
you're all addicts...

1180
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,700
...drugs, sex, the same story line
for 1 6 years...

1181
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,400
...here are some therapeutic tools
to keep you going.

1182
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:28,700
Sometimes you gotta kiss ass
before you can kick it.

1183
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:32,300
lt's the engine that kills you,
not the caboose.

1184
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,300
Make love, not war.

1185
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:40,500
Don't ever be someone's slogan,
because you are poetry.

1186
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,200
Thank you.

1187
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,300
You're welcome.

1188
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,100
You missed a damn fine show. All your
favorite characters were there.

1189
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,600
Yeah, well, l'm happy for you.

1190
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,000
You can't still be mad at me.

1191
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,200
Listen, l'm sorry l said that.
You're not dense.

1192
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,600
You're great. And....

1193
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,400
That's why l didn't want to rehash...

1194
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,300
...my entire disgusting history
in front of you, because....

1195
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,000
And what you'll think. You'll just--

1196
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,800
l know people's perceptions of girls
who screw other girls' boyfriends.

1197
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,000
l know what the world's perception is
on somebody who goes into a bar...

1198
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,700
...and realizes hours later l've left
my 3-year-old godson in the car.

1199
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,800
People don't like people like that.
l don't like people like that.

1200
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:50,500
Those are just things you've done.
Not who you are.

1201
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,900
People make mistakes, you know?

1202
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,300
Who you are is just fine.

1203
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,200
More than fine.

1204
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,000
Jasper. What are you doing here?

1205
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,200
l was looking for you.
Successfully, as it turns out.

1206
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,800
l meant, why aren't you
at your parents' house?

1207
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,700
l realized, what with them
being completely senile...

1208
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,200
...l could thank them for a great time,
they'll think l made the trip.

1209
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,600
See, l thought you might be lonely.

1210
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,800
This is Eddie.

1211
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,800
He's a patient here.

1212
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,100
And he's from Oklahoma.

1213
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,600
How do you do, Eddie from Oklahoma?
l'm Jasper.

1214
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,800
l'll leave you guys to it, then.

1215
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,700
Hang on, l don't know about that.

1216
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,500
You see, the way l see it, Gwennie,
we've got two options here.

1217
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,300
Scenario 1 : We let Eddie
head off to the showers...

1218
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:47,300
...wash off that manly sweat, and we
could bullshit our way through the day.

1219
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,600
Or scenario 2:

1220
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,600
We could acknowledge
the awkward situation we're in.

1221
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,500
l don't know what you mean.

1222
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,400
That's a clear vote for scenario 1 .
How about you, Eddie from Oklahoma?

1223
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,200
Care to weigh in?

1224
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,200
Abstaining? lnteresting.

1225
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,500
That leaves only me in favor
of calling a spade a spade.

1226
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,400
And saying, pardon me, but l'd prefer
if you wouldn't sleep with my fiance.

1227
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,400
You got the wrong idea here, pal.

1228
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,200
Don't call me ''pal.''

1229
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,400
l'm not your pal.
And don't treat me like an idiot.

1230
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:20,000
Do me that one courtesy,
because l'm not that, either.

1231
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,300
ln fact, l've got more brain cells...

1232
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:26,100
...than your entire redneck family
all put together.

1233
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,100
Don't be a jerk.

1234
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,400
Gwen, don't be a slut.
Back off, pal.

1235
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,200
Go. Go.

1236
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,900
-Let me see it. Let me just--
-Get off!

1237
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,700
Let's put some ice on it.

1238
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,200
Come on.

1239
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,300
This way.

1240
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,100
Honey, wake up.

1241
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,100
Somebody! Somebody! Come!

1242
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,600
Gwen, what is it?

1243
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,300
Go back in your rooms!

1244
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,200
What did you do?
Your hands are so cold.

1245
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,000
Hurry up!

1246
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,600
What happened?

1247
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,300
-She took that.
-Well, what?

1248
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,500
l don't know what this is!
Get somebody!

1249
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,000
We have an emergency.
Send an ambulance.

1250
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,700
Let me in.

1251
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,200
Get back in your rooms!

1252
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,600
Oh, Jesus.

1253
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,200
I'd rather be dreaming than Iiving

1254
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,100
Living's just too hard to do

1255
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,500
It's chances, not choices

1256
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,300
Noises, not voices

1257
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,900
A day's just a thing to get through

1258
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,100
Living's just too hard to do

1259
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,100
Dreams might be pretend

1260
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,500
But at Ieast dreams end

1261
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:41,600
And I just can't stop thinking, you see

1262
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,400
Thought's a smaII comfort to me

1263
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,500
We as a community have all been
deeply affected by our loss.

1264
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,500
l'd like to begin with how l feel.
And that's...

1265
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,000
...scared.

1266
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,700
Because l've heard so many people here
say, ''l just want to use one more time.''

1267
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,300
Andrea's ''one more time''
was what killed her.

1268
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,000
She didn't kill herself.

1269
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,000
She used.

1270
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,900
She overdosed.

1271
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,000
That's what happens....

1272
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,100
There's nothing...

1273
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,000
...you or l or anybody
could've done about it.

1274
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,400
lt's important.
You need to understand this.

1275
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,000
lt's me.

1276
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,100
What happened?

1277
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,900
Are you aII right?

1278
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,500
Gwennie?

1279
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,600
l'm sorry.

1280
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,400
l don't know....

1281
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,500
You want to know how l feel?

1282
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,300
How l always felt around you?

1283
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,500
Small.

1284
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,500
You have this...

1285
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,900
...way.

1286
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,700
You know, it's that Mom thing.

1287
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,400
That amazing gravitational force.

1288
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,300
Even when she was a mess, you know,
the world noticed her.

1289
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,800
You have that.

1290
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,700
And l guess...

1291
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,900
...l figured that
you always knew that.

1292
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,400
l don't know.
When l went back home...

1293
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,000
...l started thinking.

1294
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,600
And maybe you don't know that...

1295
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,000
...about yourself.

1296
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,800
l mean, who would've told you,
you know? Not me.

1297
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,900
The only thing l ever told you was...

1298
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
...what a pain in the ass you were.

1299
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,600
l am a pain in the ass.

1300
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,200
Even a pain in the ass needs...

1301
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,000
...someone...

1302
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,600
...to take care of them.

1303
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,300
l didn't do that.

1304
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,500
l didn't...

1305
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,700
...and l should have.

1306
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,500
l should have helped you
with your homework.

1307
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:27,200
l should have walked you home
after school.

1308
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,100
Sometimes l'd be walking
with my friends, and l'd see you...

1309
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,800
...half a block ahead, all alone.

1310
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,700
You were so little.

1311
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,100
Well, so were you.

1312
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,100
l never asked for help, so....

1313
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,500
But you needed it. Didn't you?

1314
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,700
And everybody does.

1315
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Yep.

1316
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,900
l'm sorry l make it
so impossible to love me.

1317
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,300
You make it impossible
for me not to love you.

1318
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,400
Ninety meetings in ninety days.

1319
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,100
And ask for help. lt's always there.

1320
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,300
Anything else?

1321
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,300
Just goodbye.

1322
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,900
Jeremiah was a buIIfrog

1323
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,500
Was a good friend of mine

1324
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:08,700
I never understood
A singIe word he said

1325
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,300
But I heIped him drink his wine

1326
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,400
And he aIways had
Some mighty fine wine

1327
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,300
Take care, sweetie.

1328
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,900
Joy to the worId

1329
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,700
AII the boys and girIs

1330
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,400
Joy to the fishes
In the deep bIue sea

1331
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,900
Joy to you and me

1332
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:34,600
If I were the king of the worId

1333
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:38,100
I'II teII you what I'd do

1334
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,000
I'd throw away the cars
And the bras and the war

1335
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,200
And make sweet Iove to you

1336
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,600
Look, l messed up.

1337
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,900
l got riled up.

1338
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,900
There isn't a lot l can do
about it now, except to say l'm sorry.

1339
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,400
And you know, people make mistakes.

1340
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,700
lf you can't handle that, if you....

1341
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,100
lf you want to decide that...

1342
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,300
...my messing up means l'm not
worth being your friend...

1343
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,600
...then you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1344
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,400
That guy, Jasper.

1345
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,400
l don't know him.

1346
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,100
But l do know that
he is dangerous for you.

1347
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,100
Wait.

1348
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,100
Turkey.

1349
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,700
Meant to be symbolic of my behavior
last time we saw each other.

1350
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,000
l tried to track down
some roasted asshole, but....

1351
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,900
Listen, all right?

1352
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,700
l've been thinking about us.
l can change if you want me to.

1353
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,400
And we can have a totally
different life. All right?

1354
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,100
l'll buy running shoes.

1355
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,300
We'll take up yoga or jogging.
We'll be organized.

1356
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,100
Pay our bills, floss our teeth.

1357
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,400
We won't set fire
to the apartment anymore.

1358
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,400
l'll buy a goldfish,
and we'll be like normal people.

1359
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,400
You hate normal people.

1360
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,400
No. What l hate is being without you.

1361
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,300
You don't want to do this
on your own, do you?

1362
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,900
We have to go.

1363
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,700
Ten people die, but 500 people have
an amazing time...

1364
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,700
...chasing this cheese
in the middle of the Cotswolds.

1365
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,500
The only person who dies,
should really die, is old women.

1366
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,100
Jasper, do you ever shut up?

1367
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,400
l'm sorry.

1368
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,300
But it's just that, you know,
if l'm gonna really--

1369
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,100
Stay clean and sober,
as they say in the program.

1370
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,100
Yeah. But it's not that simple.

1371
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,100
Everything has to be different.

1372
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,600
Absolutely.

1373
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,600
And that includes us.

1374
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:07,700
l'm trying to change things in me.

1375
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,000
-l'm trying to--
-Look who's here.

1376
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,900
Hey, Marty.

1377
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:13,800
Elaine, look.

1378
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,800
l was hoping l'd find you here.

1379
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,800
My God, she's alive.
Gwennie's back in action.

1380
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:23,200
Celebrate with us. We got a
monster table going in the back.

1381
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,300
Excellent idea.

1382
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,800
We're in the middle of something now.

1383
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,200
Oh, come on, Gwennie.

1384
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,400
Give us a couple of minutes.
We'll be over.

1385
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,400
That was really embarrassing.

1386
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,100
Where are you going?

1387
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,700
They're waiting.

1388
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,800
We'll just go in the back,
have a soda water, and then go.

1389
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,600
They just want to say welcome home.
Come on.

1390
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,700
What are you doing?

1391
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:15,300
l don't know. l'm just trying to make
my outsides match my insides, l guess.

1392
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,500
Leave the horse alone.

1393
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,800
Oh, come on.

1394
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,500
l just need help!

1395
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,400
Right now!

1396
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,200
l can control the little things.

1397
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,600
Then l just have to let go.

1398
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,500
And it's up to somebody else.

1399
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,000
The hoof's looking pretty good.

1400
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,200
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1401
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,600
Are we all fixed now?

1402
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,300
Not yet...

1403
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,300
...but l'm getting there.

1404
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,600
What else have you gotta do?
Check his teeth?

1405
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,100
Bye, Jasper.

1406
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:02,000
Sir, l can't replace the plant
just because you killed it.

1407
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,200
l did not kill it.

1408
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,700
lt was sick or something.
l gave it everything.

1409
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,800
l was talking to it,
telling it stories.

1410
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:11,500
l drew a sketch of it
and put it on my refrigerator.

1411
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,200
Did you water it?

1412
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:19,600
lt's important that l did not kill
this plant. Do you understand?

1413
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,500
lf you're just saying that
because that's your excuse...

1414
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,300
...you have to understand....

1415
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,300
You can't mess with--
l'm never gonna get laid.

1416
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,100
You obviously don't care.
And that's one thing l do, is care.

1417
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,300
l feel sorry for
all the plants in here.

1418
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,700
l'm going home.

1419
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,000
l killed the plant.

1420
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,600
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1421
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,800
l killed the plant.

1422
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:54,300
lt's okay. You still have your dog.

1423
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,400
l don't even think he likes me.

1424
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,100
l don't want to, l just....

1425
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,400
What are you doing here?
lt's so good to see you!

1426
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:58,400
lt looks like somewhere
out in the middle of nowhere.

1427
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,700
-l see trees--
-No cell phones.

1428
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,800
We carry our own bags here.
This isn't the Sheraton.

1429
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:08,900
Hey, Falcon.

1430
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,400
What?

1431
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,800
l don't mean to bother you, but....

1432
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:19,000
Don't miss tonight's Iecture:
''Is God An AIcohoIic?''
