is just how and where
the former Green Beret...

came into possession
of the weapons with which...

he allegedly killed
one deputy sheriff...

For chrissake's! Spit it out!

516
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:16,351
Well, I was,
I was just talking to Mitch,

517
00:44:17,218 --> 00:44:19,320
and he was saying that Galt
and a couple deputies...

518
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:22,157
were, uh, a little hard
on the guy.

519
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:24,059
Assholes!

520

Doesn't make one goddamn
bit of difference, Dave,

521
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:29,031
and you know it!

522
00:44:29,098 --> 00:44:31,133
Look, if one of my deputies...

523
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,850
gets out of line
with a prisoner,

524
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:35,671
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

525
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:38,207

I kick the deputy's ass!

We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel. What can I do for you?

534
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:06,634
I've come to get my boy.
Your boy?

535
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,404
I recruited him.
I trained him.

536
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,073
I commanded him in Vietnam
for three years.

537
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,409
I'd say that makes him mine.

538
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:18,880
I wonder why the Pentagon would send a
full-bird colonel down here to handle this.

539
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:21,417
The Army thought
I might be able to help.

540
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:25,453
I don't know in what way. Rambo's
a civilian now. He's my problem.

541
00:45:26,921 --> 00:45:28,081
I don't think you understand.

542
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:31,259
I didn't come here
to rescue Rambo from you.

543
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:34,128
I came here
to rescue you from him.

544

Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.

545
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,602
I will try to be extra careful.

546
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:43,473

any of your posse to live.

548
00:45:45,507 --> 00:45:48,943

That's just great!

550
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:53,048

551
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:55,416
why one of your machines
blew a gasket.

552

A man who's been trained
to ignore pain,

557
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,634
ignore weather,
to live off the land,

558
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:14,536
to eat things that would
make a billy goat puke.

559
00:46:15,304 --> 00:46:18,306
In Vietnam, his job was
to dispose of enemy personnel.

560
00:46:18,674 --> 00:46:20,876
To kill. Period.

561
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:22,878

562
00:46:23,545 --> 00:46:25,480

picked up in Seattle.

Of course he's listening.

But he's not gonna break radio silence.
No. Not for us.

<i>How?</i>

Got himself killed in 'Nam.

647
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:01,066

knew where to find you.

I wish I was back at Bragg now.

657
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:26,891
We'll talk about that

There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king-shit cop.

<i>but the man kept pushing, sir.</i>

668
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:02,460
You did some pushing
of your own, John.

669
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:05,663
They drew first blood, not me.

670

Look, Johnny, let me come in and
get you the hell out of there.
