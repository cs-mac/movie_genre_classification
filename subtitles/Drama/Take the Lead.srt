1
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,100
Shh-hh.

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,600
# I've got rhythm #

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,900
# I've got music #

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,500
# I've got my man #

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,600
# Who could ask
for anything more? #

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,000
# I've got daisies #

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,400
# In green pastures #

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,500
# I've got my man #

9
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
# Who could ask
for anything more? ##

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,600
## Got rhythm, got rhythm,

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,600
- # I've got rhythm #

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,800
# Got rhythm, got rhythm #

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,000
# One, two, three #

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,600
# Who could dance with us
or who could stand with us? #

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,000
# Look at us tonight,

# Freshed it up to def

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,300
# Out on the town putting on

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,600
# One foot in

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,900
# Sexy salsa,

20
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,900
# Well, listen, after I take it back
to old schoolin' #

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,700
# Like Lena Horne,

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,300
- # I've got rhythm #

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,200
# I've got-got-got rhythm #

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,700
# M.C. will lead
but, yo, I can't take it #

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,300
# When that young thing
like to shake it, shake it, shake it #

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,700
# When she move forward

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,000
# And I got a beat on point
and live on something #

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,900
- # Come on... #
- # 'Cause my hood is greasy #

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,200
# It ain't easy #

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,700
# But for tonight
gonna be a'ight #

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,500
# Whoo-whoo #

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
# One, two, three ##

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,300
Ladies and gentlemen.

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,500
## I've got my man #

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,700
# Who could ask
for anything more? #

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,600
# Who could ask for #

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
# Anything #

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,400
# Mo-o-o-o-ore? #

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,400
Jay, get out here.
Your father needs to use the bathroom.

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,500
Aw!

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,300
Help clean him up
for me, Jay.

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
You good, Pop?

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
You got it, Pop.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh Pop!
Come on, man.

45
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,300
Gigi, catch it.

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
- One mike break.
- Hide my purse

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
so when somebody tries to steal it,
at least they have to work for it.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,100
This puppy's got
a bark, kids!

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,700
# One-two, one-two,
one, two, three... #

50
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Thank you.
Thank you.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Now it is with great pride

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,600
that I introduce
the highlight of the evening...

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,500
our student exhibition!

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Blaine Academy students,
please, take the floor.

55
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Dancers ready?

56
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,300
Don't forget the new turn.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,500
- # Let's go #
- # Talk to 'em, Drag #

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,700
# Look here, dawg,
I'm d-r-to-the-izzay #

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
# I'm born a "G," if I ain't in
the club, I'm on the streets #

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,600
# And if I ain't in the Benz,
I'm on my feet #

61
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,600
# And I'm probably
the most slept on on the East #

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,500
# But I'm still in the club,
throwin' it up #

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,700
# Fightin' break out in the club,
they knowin' it's us #

64
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,800
# Damn, who dat?
Drag and 'em, same nigga #

65
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,600
# Walk through any block
and don't know half of them #

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
# I like it when the girls grab the boys
and their bodies get loose like this #

67
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,300
# I like it, I like it,
I like it, I like it ##

68
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
## That's why
I ask the Lord #

69
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,300
# In heaven above #

70
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,700
# What is this thing
called love? ##

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,600
- ## Whoo! #
- # Let's work... #

72
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
# Jae Millz... some call me
"The Statue" #

73
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,000
# Worldwide hustler
but I'm from the area #

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,700
# Rose gold sit on my neck,
rose gold sit on my wrist... #

75
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,400
Let's go, let's go.

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
What're you trying
to pull, son?

77
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
I ain't pulling nothing, man,

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
it's a real ticket.
It just got wet, that's all.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
Just turn around
and go home, all right?

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Hey-hey!

81
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,300
Look, man, I paid for my ticket,
you're gonna let me in.

82
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,700
I am?

83
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
Come on, man.
Get off me!

84
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,700
Hey-hey, get off me, man.

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
- Ah! Get off me.
- Calm down, son.

86
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,900
- What's going on here?
- I got it, Augustine.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,900
- It's under control.
- This fool won't let me in.

88
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,500
Watch your mouth. You're not
going in this dance with your attitude.

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
For what? The ticket's real. Everybody
else's punkass is going in there.

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,800
Everybody else's punkass does not
have your history, Jason Rockwell.

91
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,700
- That ain't even right, man.
- Keep talking.

92
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,300
Give me a reason to kick your butt
out of my school. Give me one.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,200
Whoa!

94
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,100
You!

95
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Whoa, what?!

96
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,200
What's poppin',
playboy?

97
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Whassup?

98
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,400
What, you good?

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,100
Yeah, I'm cool.

100
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Yo, what's up, man?

101
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
Ain't seen you since
your brother's service.

102
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,200
- Almost a year now, dawg.
- Yeah, almost.

103
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,000
You're not dancing?

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
- No.
- Miss James punked you again?

105
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Sh... whatever, yo.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,100
Check it... we rolling.
You down?

107
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
That ain't yours, man.

108
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,800
Looks like Miss Principal
left you a little present, baby.

109
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,700
She in there
enjoying your party.

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
You feel me?

111
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Whatcha gonna do?

112
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,200
Gonna get
some justice, right?

113
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,000
Now's your chance, son.
Know what I'm saying?

114
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,500
Take the goddamn iron and leave
this bitch a little message.

115
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,800
I ain't messing with you, man.
You're reckless.

116
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,500
Pussy!

117
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,700
- Oh shit!
- Damn! Bag that shit, brother.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Hit that shit!

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,500
- Oh, that's gonna be expensive, boy.
- Just smash that!

120
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,500
- Let's go, dawg!
- Shit.

121
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,300
Is that your car, man?

122
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
No.

123
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
So what you
running up on me for?

124
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,700
What was he thinking?

125
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,200
- # You wanna see how we flow? #
- # Here we go, here we go #

126
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
- # Gimme dough and do a show #
- # Here we go, here we go #

127
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,500
- # Your guy nearly got mad #
- # Here we go, here we go #

128
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
- # Timberland and Dirtbag #
- # Here we go, here we go, yo #

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
# Here we go, yo, here we go,
yo, here we go, here we go #

130
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,300
# They call me dirty dirty
but I shine so clean #

131
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,500
# Push birdy birdies
but I got a new scene #

132
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
# Me and Timmy T
droppin' out a limousine #

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,800
# While the girls throw their hips,
they zipping their blue jeans #

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,200
# We slip in their blue dreams,
and it feels so good #

135
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,300
# I shouldn't have another
but I thank I would #

136
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,700
# My location, conversation,
relation that made me hood #

137
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
# The rotation of my records
every second made me good #

138
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,800
# I ain't trying to have relations,
Dirt trying to wood #

139
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,700
# Strong penetration,
it hurts when it's good #

140
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,100
# Should I choose you
or your girl? I choose both #

141
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,300
# Call Timmy and enforce,
my nigga, it's time to go #

142
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,600
- # You want to see how we flow? #
- # Here we go, here we go #

143
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
- # Gimme dough and do a show #
- # Here we go, here we go #

144
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,400
- # Your guy nearly got mad #
- # Here we go, here we go. #

145
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
What you here for?
A funeral or somethin'?

146
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,300
I don't want it pimped,
I want it fixed.

147
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,300
All right, you've got somewhere to be
and it is not in my hallway.

148
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,400
Get there and get there fast.

149
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,700
Paul Lopez, put a belt
in those pants.

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,300
I do not want to have
to see your drawers. Good morning.

151
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,100
Chin, if I see you on that cell phone
one more time, it's mine.

152
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,100
Eddie French, in my office,
you know why.

153
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Augustine, have you made a decision
yet on my calculus lab?

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,700
Joe, do you really think I can get
special funding for your six kids

155
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,700
when I have all the rest
of them to worry about?

156
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,300
My six are the ones that have a chance.
They're smarter than...

157
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,200
You know how I feel
about "smarter than."

158
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,700
There's kids out there selling drugs,
doing the calculus in their heads.

159
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,500
Now if you want to open up
that lab to the rest of them,

160
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,900
- maybe we could swing a grant.
- Are you serious?

161
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,500
Yes, I'm serious.

162
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,700
Augustine, we have to honor the kids
that are excelling, not neglect them.

163
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,600
Joe, we operate on limited resources...
morning, Gretchen.

164
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,100
Yo, son, who died?

165
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,900
Apparently,
your manners.

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,200
Excuse me, sir,
was that lady the principal?

167
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,100
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

168
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,300
Uh-huh.

169
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,400
You mean "You're welcome,"
right?

170
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Uh-huh.

171
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,600
And what's this I hear about you
bailing out on detention today?

172
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm not giving up my math club time
to babysit a bunch of delinquents.

173
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,900
Excuse me, those kids need
your attention as well.

174
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,700
But the ones who try
actually deserve it.

175
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,600
Yo, son, what the hell
you do that for?

176
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,200
She wasn't carrying nothin'.

177
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
She could've opened the door
her damn self.

178
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,200
It's called courtesy.

179
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,900
Yeah, well, it makes you
look like a punkass.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
- You think so?
- Damn straight.

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,800
Man, punkass moves like that
won't get you no play around here.

182
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
Trust me, I've tried it.

183
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
Oh, I've got plenty of play.

184
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,800
You're kidding, right?

185
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,800
Did you see that?

186
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,300
Every single one of them
smiled at me.

187
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,700
Yeah, but you didn't
get no numbers.

188
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,000
I didn't ask
for no numbers.

189
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
Whatever.

190
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,400
What about Kline? He hasn't
taken detention in months.

191
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,300
- Out with the flu.
- Cranky-butt Lewis?

192
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,900
- Jury duty.
- Again?

193
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,500
- What are you looking at?
- Mr. Dulaine.

194
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
- Friend or foe?
- Too early to say.

195
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
But check this out.

196
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,100
He's been doing that
for everyone.

197
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,600
And he stands every time
a woman walks past.

198
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,900
Freak.
It's just my luck.

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,900
Have security standing by.

200
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,300
Mr. Dulaine.

201
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,600
Come on in.

202
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,000
Eddie, sit your ass down.

203
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
So what can I do for you?

204
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,100
You're not a parent, you're not a sub,
you're certainly not a cop.

205
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,500
How can you tell all this?

206
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,400
If I depended on the students to tell me
what's going on, we'd all be in trouble.

207
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,400
I've got five minutes,
Mr. Dulaine.

208
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,100
Yeah, um...

209
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,300
I ran into one of your
students on, eh, Saturday night...

210
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,800
- How nice for you.
- Yeah...

211
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,400
he was vandalizing
private property.

212
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,900
Did you file
a police report?

213
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,100
No.

214
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
I felt I should
come to you.

215
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,000
It's the wrong move.
I try to prevent crime from happening,

216
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,200
but once it does, the police are
who you want to talk to.

217
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,900
So... good day.

218
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,900
That's it?

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,600
That's it for me.
Gretchen'll show you out.

220
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,900
Oh oh oh,
hold on, uh...

221
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,100
who should I talk to
about this?

222
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Probably one
of your students, right?

223
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,800
You must have a lot
of angry kids at this school.

224
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,000
Now if your kids were
as important to you as your car...

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Excuse me for caring
about my car, Mr. Dulaine.

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,000
And do not talk to me about angry kids
like you are some kind of expert.

227
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,500
This is my school. I decide
what is or is not a priority.

228
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,300
And these kids?
Are they your priorities?

229
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,600
Honor roll?

230
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,300
Those kids are dead,
Mr. Dulaine.

231
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,200
Each and every one of them
killed since I have been here.

232
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,100
I keep them right there
to remind me of why I'm tired,

233
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,700
and why I keep
coming to work

234
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,100
and why I have
no time to waste.

235
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
I'm sorry. Sorry.

236
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Please excuse me.

237
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,900
- Mr. Dulaine?
- I would like to help.

238
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,200
There are numerous ways
community members

239
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,300
can help the students
of John Drake High School.

240
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,500
There is a tutoring program.
There's Big Brothers.

241
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,800
There's the math center, the language
skills lab, book club, DARE outreach...

242
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,000
Y-yeah, I-I'm sure
these are fine programs,

243
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,300
uh... but I have
my own methods.

244
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,400
All right, uh...

245
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,200
I want to teach
your kids to dance.

246
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,500
Believe me, the one thing
they do know is how to dance.

247
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,300
- Ballroom?
- What did you say?

248
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,000
He said, "ballroom."

249
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Uh, yeah.
Waltz, fox-trot,

250
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,700
all the basics.

251
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,400
It would be great for them.

252
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
Okay, where is
the camera?

253
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
If you are talking about teaching
my kids the fox-trot,

254
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,700
I must be on television.

255
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,400
All right, um,

256
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,900
your kids, your call.

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Thank you.

258
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Good morning.

259
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,500
Mr. Dulaine! Wait.

260
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
If you are serious,

261
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,300
I just might have
an opening for you.

262
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,100
You meet me back here
at 3:00 sharp.

263
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,500
3:00?

264
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,100
I'm not a particularly
patient woman, Mr. Dulaine,

265
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,000
either you want
to help out or you don't.

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,200
I'll rearrange my schedule.

267
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,200
I see you sneaking out
on me, Joe L.

268
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
We have kids in there
for everything

269
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
from stealing someone's bag,
to cheating on exams...

270
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,100
Hector, home safe...
to possession,

271
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,800
vandalism, to rearranging
somebody's face.

272
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,500
Basically, if you get...
hat! Hat!

273
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,200
If you can think of a way to cut
a corner and collect a dime,

274
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,600
the kids in detention are all over it
before we have had our morning coffee.

275
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
- Detention?
- You said you wanted to help.

276
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,100
Believe me,
these kids could use some.

277
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,400
Everyone else calls them
the school rejects.

278
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,400
They're in here
for the rest of the term.

279
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,800
In case you were wondering
why the scenic tour,

280
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,000
detention's far
from a beauty spot,

281
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
but it's the only space
we have available

282
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,000
after some knucklehead
burned up the study hall.

283
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
On purpose?

284
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,000
I got five bucks saying
you won't be back tomorrow.

285
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,900
Miss James,

286
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,200
what, you springing us
for good behavior or something?

287
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,100
No, I'm not, Mr. Epps.

288
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,500
Listen up, everybody,
this is Mr. Dulaine.

289
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,200
Mr. Dulaine here is
running your detention

290
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,600
and you will do
whatever Mr. Dulaine says.

291
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,700
That's what you think.

292
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,500
- Yeah, right.
- They're all yours.

293
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Hey, gimme, gimme the ball.

294
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,000
- Let's go, man.
- Wow! Right there.

295
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,200
Yo, follow that queen.
Let's go.

296
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,300
Pay attention,
pay attention.

297
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,700
Okay, a'ight.

298
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,200
My name is
Pierre Dulaine.

299
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
But you...
you can call me Pierre.

300
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
- Pierre?!
- You don't sound French.

301
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah, uh...
my mother was Spanish,

302
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,600
my father was French.

303
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,500
I understand
six languages.

304
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,400
- I speak five.
- Give me that.

305
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,100
All of them
with a Spanish accent.

306
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Um, so...

307
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,800
you are?

308
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
Sir.

309
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,400
That's Jason Rockwell.

310
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,400
Yeah, but you
can call him Rock, Pierre.

311
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
What about you,
mademoiselle?

312
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,000
LaRhette,
LaRhette Dudley.

313
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,100
Very nice
to meet you, LaRhette.

314
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
So what kind
of teacher are you?

315
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
Yeah, what'd you do
they made you run detention?

316
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,300
- I asked to be here.
- Punkass move number two.

317
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,800
I teach...
ballroom dancing.

318
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,900
- What?!
- Ballroom dancing?

319
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,500
And you... are going to learn
ballroom dancing

320
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,100
here in your detention.

321
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Nothing this wild
ever happens in English.

322
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,700
Or biology.

323
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,500
The wildest thing yet
is that I said yes.

324
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
You did what?

325
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm gonna arrange you
by height.

326
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,900
You... and you.
Yeah, together.

327
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,000
- No freaking way.
- Ooh!

328
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,700
Mr. Epps, was it?
And the lady to your right,

329
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,600
let's have you and you together.
You two together.

330
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,100
Hol-hold on a sec.
Why I can't be with her?

331
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,600
Not at this time, sir.

332
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,400
Yeah, bu-but everybody know
Danjou can't dance.

333
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,000
- Are you a dancer, sir?
- What, tu no sabes? I can shake it.

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,600
Then I suggest you shake it
with the partner I assigned.

335
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,300
Look, nobody wanted to host
the detention hall.

336
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,000
- This is a joke.
- If I turn it over to Mr. Dulaine,

337
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
we get our detention
halls for free.

338
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,900
Detention is meant
to be a place

339
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,200
where the kids who need to spend
extra time in school do just that...

340
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,600
spend extra time in school.
Not dancing around.

341
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,600
Joe, do you know
any of our students

342
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,500
that are gonna want
to do ballroom dancing?

343
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,300
Absolutely not.

344
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Exactly. I think I just discovered
the cure for cutting class,

345
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
and for cheating, and for any
number of miscreant behaviors.

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,800
- To the fox-trot!
- To the fox-trot!

347
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,300
- You and... yes, you, together.
- Hold up, that's my cousin.

348
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,700
- I can't dance with my cousin.
- Yeah, man.

349
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,300
You know what? Me and Big Girl
can switch. I'll dance with Monster.

350
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,900
Oh no, man...

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,700
And you, sir, will be with
this lovely lady over here.

352
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,400
- No, he won't.
- Ooh-ooh.

353
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,300
- More cousins, right?
- Hell no!

354
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,000
- Uh-oh.
- Yo, I can't dance with him, for real.

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,600
- Put me with anybody else.
- All right...

356
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,900
- She's trash, that's why.
- You shut the hell up.

357
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,100
Hey hey hey hey.

358
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,400
Yo, roll up!

359
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,100
I don't want
to be here anyway.

360
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,600
- Hey, hold...
- Bye.

361
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,200
We're out of here, son.

362
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,500
All right, we are
finished for today.

363
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,900
Argh... tsk!

364
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,900
Did you see what happened
to my bike?

365
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,800
Nope.

366
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,900
"Nope, nope."

367
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,600
How does this work in
with the lesson schedule?

368
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,800
And the new students
and Caitlin's cotillion?

369
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,100
And Morgan always wants
more time before a competition.

370
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
We can rearrange.
It'll be fine.

371
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,400
- That's your plan?
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
"It'll be fine"?

373
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Just when this place was
starting to do well, Pierre.

374
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,600
These kids probably don't even
want what you're offering.

375
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,000
Did you ask them?

376
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
- Did you?
- Huh-uh.

377
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,000
- Pierre! Pierre, we have an emergency.
- We'll talk about this later.

378
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,300
Ahem, ladies,
what a pleasure.

379
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,900
Hey.

380
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
- We've got to do something, Pierre.
- Mother!

381
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,600
She's not getting any better,
in fact she may be getting worse.

382
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,300
Oh, she'll be fine, Mrs. Spencer.
She just needs a little time is all.

383
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,900
Time's running out.
This cotillion is a huge event.

384
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,700
Now Caitlin's father and I
have spent a fortune on the party.

385
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,600
All of our friends are coming and I will
not have her looking like a...

386
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,200
I just... I just want Caitlin
to feel secure all right?

387
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I understand. Please.

388
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,000
Maybe I'm not made to dance.

389
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,000
Caitlin, do you like dancing?

390
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,400
Then you were made
to dance.

391
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,200
Mr. Dulaine, I want
to dance more than anything.

392
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,800
It's just... I know I suck.

393
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,200
No no!

394
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,500
My mom and dad paid
so much for my lessons...

395
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,400
Right there is the problem.

396
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,300
You need to dance for yourself,
not for anybody else.

397
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,700
All right.

398
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Very slow, all right?

399
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
# Are you ready?
Ready ready #

400
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,500
# I need everybody to report
to the dance floor right now #

401
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,400
# All my ladies say one, two,
hands in the air #

402
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,000
# Put your right hand up,
put your left hand up #

403
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,500
# Put your right hand up,
put your left hand up #

404
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,700
# Put your right hand up,
put your left hand up #

405
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,100
# Put your right hand up,
man, man #

406
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,200
- # It's whatever, whatever #
- # Get it poppin', get it poppin' #

407
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
- # Whatever, whatever #
- # Get it poppin' #

408
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,700
# It's whatever,
like a four-alarm blaze #

409
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,100
# And I'm hotter than...
that work at the Days Inn #

410
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
# People try to make hits
that make people bop #

411
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,000
# I make hits they play,
then people be shot #

412
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,600
# Whatever, whatever,
whatever, whatever #

413
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,900
# Whatever. #

414
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,500
- I know.
- she's on the other line right now.

415
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,500
- May I ask who's calling?
- Let me call you back.

416
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,400
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

417
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,000
I believe you owe me
five bucks.

418
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,100
And I believe
I am seeing things.

419
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,000
A little early for detention.

420
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,300
Thank you.

421
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Yeah, uh...
we need to talk.

422
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,900
This is LaRhette's
twin brother.

423
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,400
He was an honor student,
but we lost him to drugs.

424
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,700
He was a good kid,
just poor as hell.

425
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,900
He got in the way of a crew
led by this fool... who's Rock's brother.

426
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,300
Raymond Rockwell was the most
screwed up evil kid I ever knew.

427
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,900
What started out as a fist-fight
turned into a little gang war

428
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,200
and when it was over,
some kids were hurt, some were dead.

429
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,800
Tybalt slays Mercutio.

430
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,700
This isn't Shakespeare,
Mr. Dulaine, it's public education.

431
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,200
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

432
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,300
You know who wrecked
my car, don't you?

433
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,700
Might have been
either black or Hispanic.

434
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,100
Let me know if you remember.

435
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,800
# The way you sip your tea... #

436
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
- Shoot me.
- What is this?

437
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,600
- # The memory of all that... #
- Man, what's that noise?

438
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,600
That noise is the work
of the great American songwriters

439
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,800
- Ira and George Gershwin.
- Who?

440
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,500
Some of the many amazing
artists you'll be dancing to.

441
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Yo, man, I need the remix.

442
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,400
All right, everyone, stand up!
Step forward.

443
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,700
# The way you haunt
my dreams #

444
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,500
# No no, they can't take
that away from me... #

445
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,700
All right. Maybe I'll just give you
a chance to absorb Gershwin.

446
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,500
#... meet again
on the bumpy road to love #

447
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,900
# Still, I'll always #

448
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,000
# Always keep
the memory of... #

449
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
He likes it.

450
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,800
# The way you hold
your knife... #

451
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,400
Okay, can you
turn it off now?

452
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Excuse me?
I am afraid I can't hear you.

453
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,300
# The way you've
changed my life #

454
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,400
# No no, they can't take that
away from me #

455
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,100
# No, they can't
take that away #

456
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
# From me... #

457
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,400
Classic ballroom consists
of these dances...

458
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,700
the tango,

459
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,400
the rumba, fox-trot,

460
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,000
swing, standard waltz,

461
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,300
merengue and, of course,
the Viennese waltz.

462
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
These dances were danced
by the fiercest warriors.

463
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Oh, the Viennese waltz?
Sounds fierce.

464
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,100
All right, all right,

465
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,400
how many of you think
this style of dance is weak?

466
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,600
Two votes for me.

467
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
you have been misled.

468
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,300
Miss LaRhette,
would you do me the honor?

469
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Nah, I don't think so.

470
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Mademoiselle,
please, come on.

471
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,200
Okay...

472
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,700
in ancient times,

473
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,600
it was believed
that any man

474
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,600
who could kill
with speed and accuracy

475
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,700
should be able to dance
with grace as well.

476
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,000
Ballroom dancing is...

477
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,800
for kings and empresses.

478
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
It is the dance of strength,

479
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,500
of romance and love.

480
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,800
- Thank you, it was lovely.
- Uh-huh.

481
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
I believe the appropriate answer
to that is, "You're welcome."

482
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Uh-huh.

483
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,200
- All right.
- Look, son,

484
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,100
you're talking about a bunch
of rich white folks, slave-holders.

485
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,600
I mean I've never seen
Martin Luther King...

486
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,000
You're right, you're right,
you're right. Correct.

487
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,000
- You know?
- Some were.

488
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,200
But the tango, the milonga,
and even the rumba

489
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,500
were first danced
in some form by Africans.

490
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,000
- Oh-ho!
- Here we go.

491
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Why is it that every time
you want to fly something by us,

492
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
you claim it's got ties
to Africans,

493
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,200
but every time you get scared or mad,
you blame it on African killer bees?

494
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,200
- African Ebola virus.
- Right.

495
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Freaking West Nile fever.

496
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,300
All right, all right,
what if I told you

497
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,700
these dances will
make you look very cool?

498
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,100
I'd say you're full of shit.

499
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,300
- What is this, Mr. Rockwell?
- A doctor's note.

500
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,100
I can't dance,
I got a heart condition.

501
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,200
I see... interesting man,
your doctor.

502
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,900
Not many physicians write
notes on three-holed paper.

503
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,600
- Busted.
- Partners, please.

504
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
No? All right.

505
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,500
No, hey, okay, hey hey!

506
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,300
Now, ballroom dancing
is about two bodies

507
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,000
moving as one.

508
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,700
I'm down with that.

509
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Gentlemen, please,
take your partner's hand.

510
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,200
Hold up, how the hell do
I know where his hands have been?

511
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,000
- Here, I'll show you, see?
- Oh, no no!

512
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,500
- Now you know.
- No. No no no.

513
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,100
That is not right.

514
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
- Now that's "ball" room.
- You are nasty!

515
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,200
Welcome to
the fox-trot, people.

516
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,400
- Step a little closer.
- # I've got rhythm... #

517
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,000
- All right.
- # I've got music... #

518
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,500
Yo, why we got to use that?

519
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,300
My grandparents don't even
listen to that stuff.

520
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,700
That stuff give us
the perfect fox-trot rhythm.

521
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,000
- # Who could ask for anything more? #
- Good good.

522
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,000
Now, ladies,
start on the right foot,

523
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,600
- going backward.
- # I've got daisies... #

524
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,300
Men on the left,
stepping forward.

525
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,700
- Two slow steps back.
- # I've got my man... #

526
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,600
- # Who could ask for anything more?
- Two quick ones to the side.

527
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,500
It goes like this... slow, slow,

528
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,200
- quick, quick, slow, slow.
- # Old Man Trouble... #

529
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,300
- Quick, quick, slow, slow.
- # I don't mind him... #

530
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,800
- Quick, quick, slow, slow.
- # You won't find him... #

531
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,600
Quick, quick, good.

532
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,100
- # Around my door... #
- Come on, guys, quick, quick.

533
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,600
- Stop!
- # I've got starlight... #

534
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,800
Sir, sir, sorry, just let me
just show you, eh?

535
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,600
Everybody! Please.

536
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,400
Why I always got
to demonstrate it?

537
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,400
- Because you can do it.
- # I've got my man... #

538
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,200
- # Who could ask for anything more? #
- Slow, slow,

539
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,900
quick, quick, slow, slow,

540
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,100
quick, quick, slow, slow,
quick, quick...

541
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,900
Slow, quick, quick...
hi, Mommy.

542
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,800
Go in back.
I'll be there in a minute.

543
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,700
- Kids eat?
- Baby had a second bottle.

544
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,000
I fed them at like 6:00.

545
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
We'll talk when I'm through.

546
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,300
Slow, slow,
quick, quick, slow...

547
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
# New eyes grilling,
your blood's spilling #

548
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,100
# Tell me, little homie,
what's the reason? #

549
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,300
# That can lead
to freeway squeezing #

550
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
# What you fake it for? #

551
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,600
# Here we go... one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven #

552
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,800
- # Kick in the door #
- # Yeah and rhyme for the legend #

553
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,100
# Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one #

554
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,400
# This is my twelfth album,
but your man's not dizz-un #

555
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,500
- # What you want? #
- # Defaces the coupes and the Lincs #

556
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,100
- # What you get? #
- # Top models that Garbo in the mink #

557
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
# Whoever want it,
I take it to the brink #

558
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,600
# It's funny but I needed Philly money,
we had a link, let's go #

559
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,700
# New eyes grilling,
your blood's spilling #

560
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,000
# Tell me, little homie,
what's the reason? #

561
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,200
# That can lead
to freeway squeezing #

562
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,400
# What you fake it for? #

563
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,900
# 24s killin',
ain't no ceilin' #

564
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,000
# Move, little homie,
see the hootchie leaning #

565
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
# L.L., I keep
birdies feenin'. #

566
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,000
- What you doing?
- Why the hell's the music off?

567
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,200
- Here he is... life of the party.
- Dude is so whacked.

568
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,900
Here we go.

569
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,500
Du-lame.

570
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,000
You don't have to stop.
That was amazing.

571
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

572
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,400
Now guys, why can't you put that emotion
and energy into my style of dance?

573
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,100
That's impossible, man.

574
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,200
Really, why so?

575
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,400
'Cause your music sucks.

576
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,900
It's corny. There ain't
no feeling in it.

577
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
- No feeling?
- Huh-uh.

578
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,600
How can you say that?

579
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,300
- Lena Horne, Joe Williams,
- Who dat?

580
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,300
Nat King Cole... these songs are
all about love.

581
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,200
Maybe you love different
than we do.

582
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,300
Look at you, you're all
flowers and things.

583
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,500
Talk to your woman all sweet, saying
shit trying to make her feel nice,

584
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,400
well, we ain't got
no time for that.

585
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,000
We want to get right down
to the ill na-na.

586
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,600
Love is universal,
my friend.

587
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,000
We just may look for it
different ways,

588
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,300
hearing different songs.

589
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
Yeah, whatever.

590
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,500
This is what you think
about love, right?

591
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,300
# Won't you fly me
to the moon... #

592
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,200
- Hmm... smooth, romantic.
- # And let me play among the stars... #

593
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,100
I would call that a love song.
I could dance to that.

594
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Dance to this.

595
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,300
# Now shake that ass out #

596
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,900
# Make that cookie pop,
shake it down to the floor #

597
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,600
# And make that cookie drop,
shake that ass out #

598
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,100
# Make that cookie pop,
shake it down to the floor #

599
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,600
# And make
that cookie drop #

600
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,700
What you think about that,
Mr. Ballroom man?

601
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,400
# She want it on the ball,
use your dirty little head #

602
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,200
# To hustle on the floor... #

603
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,000
I didn't see you
on the floor today.

604
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,000
If you're not going to dance,
why bother even showing up?

605
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,700
If I don't go to detention,
then I can't go to class,

606
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
and then I can't graduate.

607
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
What d'you want
from me anyway, man?

608
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,800
I know you know who I am.

609
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,500
Glad to know you are so observant.
Now, if you'll allow me...

610
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,100
Hold on, man.

611
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,100
Don't be doing me no favors.

612
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
I don't owe nobody nothing,
I don't get down like that.

613
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,300
So I'm-a ask you again...
what you want from me?

614
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,500
I think a simple, "Thank you for
keeping my ass out of the slammer"

615
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,700
might be appropriate,
Mr. Rockwell.

616
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,200
Nobody gives something
for nothing.

617
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,600
I'll see you in class...
tomorrow.

618
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,300
All right, let's begin.

619
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,100
Caitlin, are you all right?

620
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,600
Would you be all right if you were me
and you had to have a cotillion?

621
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Don't lie. It's like everyone here
is a beautiful swan

622
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,100
and then boom,
I'm the butt-ugly duckling.

623
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,100
Sweetie, if you don't
want a cotillion,

624
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
why don't you just tell
your parents to call it off?

625
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,200
I'd want one
if I could move like her.

626
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,400
It's like sex on hardwood.

627
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,900
I would kill
to dance like that.

628
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,200
Uh, excuse me a second.

629
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Morgan?

630
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,100
# Now run and tell your mama
and your daddy how your shit is weak #

631
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,200
# 50 deep... damn nigga,
this ain't what you want in life... #

632
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,100
I mean, the deepest
darkest parts of me,

633
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,200
like the blood
through my veins and arteries,

634
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,500
- we see the fact...
- Yo.

635
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
# The presidential shit
is what I mean #

636
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,600
# Chop, chop... yeah,
I'm back on the block, on the block #

637
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,500
# We've got it ready
for you straight... #

638
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,600
Check this out!

639
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,500
Check Mr. Dulaine,
just getting his flirt on.

640
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,900
You can't do that.

641
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,700
Thank you, Morgan.

642
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
- Did you see that?
- How'd you do that?

643
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,600
That was amazing. I've never
seen anybody move like that.

644
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm sure.

645
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,900
- Teach me how to do that.
- Okay.

646
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
All right, all right.

647
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,100
Listen, listen to me,
listen to me now.

648
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,600
Try to get her number.

649
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,800
How many of you men would like
to handle a woman like that?

650
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,700
- Ooh.
- Two times for me.

651
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Good good.
And ladies,

652
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,400
how many of you would like the power
to drive your man to distraction?

653
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,600
Why are you showing us
what Miss Uptight could do

654
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,000
when she got parents who give her
lessons and the other crap she wants?

655
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,800
- That was not the point.
- Oh, it ain't?

656
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,300
No. You could be
just as good.

657
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,500
If you work at it,
of course.

658
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,200
And for those of you who already
think you'll be good enough,

659
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,000
there is a citywide competition
at the end of the term.

660
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,300
Now, the winning couple
splits $5,000.

661
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,500
Hold on, hold on, are you
talking ducats?

662
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,800
- Uh-huh.
- Five Gs?

663
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,300
- That's right.
- Yeah, I'm with that.

664
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,500
But I thought you said it wasn't
about the money, teach.

665
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,800
Money for dancing?
But only if you're good, right?

666
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,200
Yeah, only if you're good.

667
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,900
- Positions, please.
- Let's get busy.

668
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,400
- Let's review the fox-trot.
- Yo, I thought we were gonna tango.

669
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,300
Oh, no no no no,
the tango must be earned.

670
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,000
You, Mr. Ramos,
cannot handle the tango.

671
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,100
- Yet.
- Ooh-ooh.

672
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,000
Heard you had
a hell of a class today.

673
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,600
I love the tango.

674
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,400
How do you hear
about my class?

675
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,400
I hope you understand
what you're doing, Pierre.

676
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,400
Yes, I understand very well.

677
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,700
Just be careful
of what you're promising.

678
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,400
Everyone is entitled
to a little culture.

679
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,200
To me, dance is like life.

680
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,600
No, that's where you're wrong,
Mr. Dulaine.

681
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,900
Life, for these kids,
is like a fight to stay alive

682
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,800
and a hustle to make ends meet,
not ballroom dancing.

683
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,600
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much.

684
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,600
See you on Thursday, okay?

685
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,900
Thank you.

686
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,400
We need to talk schedule
and financing...

687
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,100
- Mr. Dulaine.
- Yeah?

688
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,900
Morgan said the kids you teach uptown
are a bunch of no-talent losers.

689
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,400
Ah, you can't always believe
what Morgan says.

690
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,200
I'd really like
to join them.

691
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,200
# Fall back, get down,
lay down #

692
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
# Sit down, stay down,
head round #

693
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,400
# Hey now... does a nigga
wanna get a little off his mind? #

694
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,900
# I'm a nigga
that'll hit a nigga off his time #

695
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,400
# Brains in the air,
flame to the hair #

696
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,200
# 'Cause the game ain't fair,
and I'll take it there #

697
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,700
# With the right one, baby #

698
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,400
# Got that?
We tryin' to light one, baby #

699
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,600
# I run shit here... #

700
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,300
What the hell
are you looking at?

701
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,600
# I run shit here... #

702
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,700
- # If you wanna see me prove it... #
- What?

703
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,700
- She was staring at me.
- # Watch how quick a nigga lose it #

704
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,900
# Make you get all my shit
and have you fearing for your life... #

705
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,900
- The furnace is whacked.
- All right.

706
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,400
Class, this is,
uh, Caitlin Spencer.

707
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,900
She'll be joining us
for the day.

708
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,300
Yo, thought we saw
the last of your visitors.

709
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,900
Well, Caitlin is... different.

710
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,200
Think of her as
a foreign exchange student.

711
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,200
Hold on, where did
the equipment come from?

712
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,900
- Oh...
- Didn't you...

713
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,500
Yeah, I bought it
from a friend.

714
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. You're trying to tell me

715
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,300
you actually bought
all this for detention?

716
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,700
No, well...

717
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,100
- Yeah, it's all good.
- I got it for Christmas.

718
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,600
We'll pretend I believe you.

719
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,300
Now, put on something
I can work with, please.

720
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,600
And guess what?
Positions, please.

721
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,700
All right, here we go.

722
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
All right.

723
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,700
Eyes over here,
eyes over here.

724
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,600
Today, we rumba.

725
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,000
And... quick, quick, slow.

726
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Quick, quick, slow.

727
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,200
That's the basic rumba.

728
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,000
Eddie... Eddie!

729
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,700
Dance with Caitlin
so I can show you.

730
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh, man, no, hell no,
I'm not dancing with her.

731
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Look, I know I'm not the best dancer
in the world or anything,

732
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,400
but your girl right here
is just pitiful.

733
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah a-a-and another thing...

734
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,100
we don't need any more
white-bread tourists

735
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
seeing how the other half lives.
We don't.

736
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,500
White bread? I'm sorry,
do you own a mirror?

737
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,800
All right, Ramos,

738
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,000
you dance with Caitlin.

739
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,700
I'm so fly I can make
anyone look good.

740
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,100
- Thank you, sir.
- Uh-huh.

741
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,500
All right.
Attention and...

742
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,200
quick, quick, slow.

743
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,700
Quick, quick, slow.

744
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,900
Quick, quick, slow.

745
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,400
- Quick, quick, slow.
- How are you doing?

746
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,200
Quick, quick, slow.

747
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,900
- Quick, quick, slow.
- You like this?

748
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
Nice jump.

749
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
You could have used that
in class today.

750
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,200
Rock!

751
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,900
Just a second.

752
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,300
The night you destroyed
Augustine's car...

753
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,900
- why did you do it?
- Because it felt good.

754
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,100
That's all?

755
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,400
Why are you
in my business, man?

756
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,800
It's hard to lose someone
you love. It hurts.

757
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,600
It's easy to think that something in the
street can fill the bad feeling inside,

758
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,800
but you know what?
It won't.

759
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,600
You need to stop acting
like you know my life.

760
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,000
Stop assuming I was
talking about your life.

761
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,500
What are you doing here?

762
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,600
Not everyone has
ulterior motives.

763
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,100
In my world they do.

764
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,300
And if our worlds ain't that far apart,
you would understand that.

765
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,600
You come around here
with your fancy suits on,

766
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,400
your slick little dance moves, you think
you're better than us, don't you?

767
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,000
- No no, you don't know who I am.
- Oh, I don't know anything, huh?

768
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,800
You can know about me,
but I can't know anything about you?

769
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,400
I got work.

770
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,200
You're late again,
Rockwell.

771
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,100
Yeah, I know, I've been getting
caught up with some stuff at school.

772
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,900
I-it's not going
to happen again though.

773
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,800
Damn right it won't.

774
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Let me take this opportunity to thank
all of you for being with us.

775
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,500
Good luck with the decisions
that you make now.

776
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,300
You know, why do you stay
with someone who cheated on you?

777
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,100
It seems to make no sense
and yet...

778
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,800
How come you're here?

779
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,300
- I got fired, Ma.
- What did you do?

780
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,100
Where's the food at?

781
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,800
- I gave you money for food, Ma.
- Now you know I tried, Jay.

782
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,200
- I try, I can't do it all...
- Come on, I don't want to hear that.

783
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,300
- I can't do it myself...
- Hey-hey. What's with all the yelling?

784
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,700
- I'm hungry, Pop!
- You, lower your voice.

785
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,700
Where's the food at?
And why am I busting my ass all day

786
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,900
while you in here
drinking on yours?

787
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,800
- You know I'm sick.
- I know you're drunk.

788
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,700
You've been like that ever since
Ray died. That ain't no excuse.

789
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,600
People out there sicker than you
still supporting their families.

790
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,000
...You have in a sense
the same sickness...

791
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You know what?
You ain't even worth it.

792
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That's why I'm busting my ass
at school every day

793
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,900
to make sure I'm
nothing like you.

794
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,200
If that's the reason you're not leaving
the person who's cheating on you,

795
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,500
then for your own sake,
you should seek help.

796
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,000
If you don't, then you're cheating.
You're cheating yourself.

797
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,900
You get out of this house.

798
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,700
Get out!

799
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,900
Yo, G!

800
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,600
Whassup, man?

801
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,200
Say... you wanna ride?

802
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,800
Yeah.

803
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,800
# See, I know
you like my swagger #

804
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,000
# Oh, you know I'm strapped
when I come through #

805
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,000
# Chain hanging
like Ali Baba, oh #

806
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,500
# Know me,
you know how I do #

807
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,400
# The way that I move #

808
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,300
# You're never gonna get it,
'cause I'm too smooth #

809
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,200
# You're never gonna get it,
I thought you knew #

810
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,300
# You're never gonna get it,
'cause you ain't got a clue #

811
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,600
# You're never gonna get it,
get it, get it. #

812
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,100
Thank you very much,
ma'am.

813
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
# I wanna spaz out,
throw a brick #

814
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,500
# Sucker-ass, liquored glass
house in the suburbs #

815
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,100
# I know the time comin'
child support gonna bust in #

816
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,900
# To try to find
somethin', but no... #

817
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,100
- # I know your mama don't understand #
- What are you doing here?

818
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,300
# I ain't getting busy dissin' events,
but she knows... #

819
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm here for dance class.

820
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,400
Oh, you think
you're one of us now?

821
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,300
- No.
- Oh, you want to go back downtown

822
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,100
and tell your little rich-ass friends
what it's like to slum with us?

823
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,800
- No.
- Then what?

824
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,600
Look...

825
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,000
I want to be here...

826
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,500
not because I'm slumming,

827
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,600
but because I feel better
up here than I do where I live.

828
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,300
So what you got
in the suitcase?

829
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,200
# Stop, mami, work that ass out
and get it on the floor... #

830
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,300
# I spit fire
till the day that I die-a... #

831
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,600
Gimme that mike, dude.
What are you doing, man?

832
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,200
- I'm flowin'.
- You can't rap.

833
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,800
# Hey, lemme hear you say
I like that, yeah... #

834
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,500
- What happened to George and Ira?
- Hey, they retired, man.

835
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,300
Demo time!

836
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,700
# Lemme hear you say...
I like that, yeah #

837
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,400
- # What ya think about it? #
- # I like that #

838
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,900
# Yeah, what ya think
about it? #

839
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,700
You're looking
a little confused.

840
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,000
It's simple really. We scratched
two different joints together.

841
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,900
But the underbelly
of the beats are all the same.

842
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,200
- See, watch.
- # Yeah, what you think about it? #

843
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,400
Yeah, it's the bottom beat
that I'm dancing to now.

844
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,200
But I can
change it up though.

845
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,200
- Yo, E! Flip it.
- #... Rose gold sit on my wrist #

846
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,700
# Dash, no, you and your...,
you better stop ##

847
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,200
## I like it when the music come on
so we can just rock like this #

848
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,300
- # Yeah #
- # I like... #

849
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,600
# I like it when the beat just pumps
so we can just move like this... ##

850
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,700
I mean, it's simple.
You can take out the underbelly

851
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,200
and dance to the top
of the beat,

852
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,100
or you can take out the top
and dance to the underbelly.

853
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,300
It's crazy, right?
It's tight.

854
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,200
Yes. Yes...

855
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,400
## If I ain't in the club,
I'm on the streets... #

856
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,800
two songs...

857
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,200
- working together?
- Yeah.

858
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,300
# I like that... #

859
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,400
This is a beautiful
idea, yeah.

860
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,300
Yeah, it is.

861
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,100
Which means,
we could use, let's say...

862
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,900
your music with...

863
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,300
- my music and then back to your music.
- Wha-aat?

864
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,000
Let me try something.

865
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,500
Uh, this one.

866
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,500
- All right, see if this works.
- A'ight.

867
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
- Number four.
- This better be something new.

868
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,000
# The way you wear your hat... #

869
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Now these are the basic
beats for salsa, right?

870
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,500
Good good,

871
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,000
now I want you to fall in
and count with me.

872
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,200
- # No, they can't take that away... ##
- Underbelly of the rhythm only.

873
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,100
All right? Good.
Now, partner it up.

874
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,500
Yeah yeah, come on.

875
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,100
# Your boy's crazy, man... #

876
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,500
Eyes off of the floor.

877
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,900
Your soul is not
in your feet, all right?

878
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,500
- # Lemme hear you say it... #
- # The way you wear your hat #

879
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,700
# Wonder... wonder...
wonder what's the winning #

880
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,900
# Homie, you'll always
be a runner-up... #

881
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,900
Monster, you're too big.

882
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,400
Every move you make,
it's like the Rocky Mountains.

883
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,200
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Pierre, I need another partner.

884
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,500
- All right and...
- # They can't take that away... #

885
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,600
Wanna dance with me?

886
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,100
Better not. Didn't you see
what just happened?

887
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,100
They call me Monster
for a reason.

888
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,200
I'm just not made
to dance.

889
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,500
- Monster, do you like dancing?
- Yeah, I guess so.

890
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,700
Then you were made
to dance.

891
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,800
## I like that #

892
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
# I like when the music
come on #

893
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,100
- # So we can just rock like this #
- # I like that #

894
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,000
# I like it when the beat just pumps
so we can just move like this #

895
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,100
- # I like that... ##
- Whoa!

896
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,100
What is the name
of that move you just did?

897
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,700
It ain't got no name. What you're
looking at is history in the making.

898
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,600
- Good, just do it.
- ## Follow the leader #

899
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,700
# Rose gold sit on my neck,
rose gold sit on my wrist #

900
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,400
# You and your...,
you better stop #

901
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,500
Guys...

902
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,000
why don't you try
just to dance together?

903
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,600
You know, try.
Come on.

904
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,700
## Follow me into a solo #

905
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,900
# Get in the flow
and you can pitch it like a photo #

906
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,100
# Music makes mellow, maintains
to make melodies for M.C. s #

907
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,000
# Motivates the breaks #

908
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,100
# I'm everlasting,
I can go on for days and days #

909
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,200
# With rhyme displays that engrave,
deep as x-rays #

910
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,100
# I can take a phrase
that's rarely heard #

911
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,200
# Flip it,
now it's a daily word... ##

912
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,400
All right, walk forward.

913
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
Everyone and...

914
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,400
## Let me hear you say,
now you know what I'm 'bout #

915
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,800
# Come on, let's go,
whatcha think about it? #

916
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,400
# I like that,
I like it, I like it #

917
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,800
# Let me hear
you say, yeah #

918
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,200
- # Whatcha think about it? #
- # I like that #

919
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,500
- # I like it, I like it #
- # Let's work #

920
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,600
# Come on. #

921
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,900
- See ya later, black.
- All right, man.

922
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,100
The place is always
a mess around here.

923
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,900
You never listen
to me no more.

924
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,700
Is that too much to ask?

925
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Get your old lazy ass up away from that
TV and do something around here.

926
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,600
I thought Santy Claus was
supposed to foot the bill for the tree.

927
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,300
He does ordinarily,
but this year we're doing it for him.

928
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,600
You just try and think of yourself
as one of Santa's little helpers.

929
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,300
Who is it?

930
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,000
It's Woodley.
You know, your mama's friend.

931
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,200
My mom's not home yet.

932
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,900
Yeah, I know,
she told me to wait.

933
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,900
A'ight.

934
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,800
Take a seat
if you can find one.

935
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,600
There's a branch on the right
side that spoils the shape.

936
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,000
- Which one?
- This one right up here.

937
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,500
Fred, would you go down in the basement,
get your saw and cut that off for me?

938
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,600
It's a little unbalanced.

939
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,200
Oh, now, honey, maybe we can
hang something there.

940
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,200
He don't have to go all the way down
to the basement to get a saw.

941
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,500
Look, honey, the tree has
to be balanced, you know that.

942
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,700
We can't have
one branch out like...

943
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,900
I ain't gonna ask you where
you're getting this money from.

944
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,600
It's none of your business.

945
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,600
My mom said
she was coming.

946
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,100
- What, you want a soda or something?
- Huh-uh.

947
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
Just tell me something.
Where do you sleep?

948
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,100
Right here.
The kids share the bedroom.

949
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,200
You wanna
make some money?

950
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,900
Come on, you know
what I'm talking about.

951
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,300
You're your mama's
daughter, ain't you?

952
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,900
Whatever you've got with my mom has
to wait till she get home, all right?

953
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,900
Come on, mister.

954
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I didn't mean no harm by it.

955
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,400
Yeah, whatever.

956
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,300
Nasty...

957
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,000
Listen, I offered to pay you.

958
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,100
- Get out! Get out!
- I should just take it from you.

959
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,200
What you're gonna do, girl?
What you're gonna do?

960
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,300
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Hey!

961
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,200
- Mommy!
- What's going on here?

962
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:31,200
# When I was just
a little girl #

963
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,300
# I asked my mother #

964
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,200
# Who'll I be #

965
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,600
# Will I be pretty? #

966
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,400
# Will I be rich? #

967
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,800
# Here's what
she said to me... #

968
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:54,000
# Que sera, sera #

969
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:03,900
# Whatever will be #

970
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,200
# Will be #

971
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:11,700
# Will be #

972
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,200
# The future's not ours #

973
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,200
# To see #

974
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,200
# Well, well, well, well #

975
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
# Come #

976
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,900
# Que sera #

977
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,700
# Que sera... #

978
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,100
What the hell
are you doing here?

979
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,800
I could ask you the same thing,
but I could already see.

980
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,000
# When I grew up
and fell in love... #

981
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,900
You know what?
Leave it on, I'm gonna go.

982
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,900
But you didn't answer my question...
what are you doing here?

983
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,700
Oh.

984
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,100
Well, I was down the hall, you know,
practicing my fox-trot

985
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,100
and then I heard your music,
so I figured...

986
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,800
Go to hell!

987
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,700
You wanna know why I'm here?
'Cause I can't go home.

988
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,700
My pop's been drunk
ever since your punkass brother

989
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,600
- and his friends rolled up on Ray.
- Don't talk about my brother!

990
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,800
He was sick to begin with, then your
dumbass brother had to do some...

991
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,900
- I said, don't talk about my brother!
- He was a crack dealer.

992
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,300
He only dealt to bring food
into our house.

993
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,100
- Ever since my daddy...
- "Daddy"?!

994
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,800
How do you even know
who your daddy is?

995
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,800
- Everybody know your mom is a ho.
- Don't talk about my mama!

996
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,700
Hold it.
What's going on?

997
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,800
Step away from her.

998
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,400
Hello?

999
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,000
What?

1000
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,600
You could have warned me you told
them I was your father, I mean...

1001
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,200
Don't trip, nobody cares about who
your real pops is around here anyway.

1002
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,300
Obviously not.
Where I come from,

1003
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,800
when a person gets woken up in the
middle of the night, they get answers.

1004
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,400
So what you want to know?

1005
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,800
Let's start with...

1006
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,100
why call me?

1007
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,400
You're the only one I could think of
who might come down and get me.

1008
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,700
Need I ask you why you were
living in the boiler room?

1009
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,700
Man, if she never came down there,
everything would have been cool.

1010
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,200
Unbelievable.
You know...

1011
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,100
maybe you two have more things
in common than you think you do.

1012
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,600
My son, come on.

1013
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,700
Hey, man, it's just
for the night, you know,

1014
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,200
so don't think I'm gonna come
to your class or anything.

1015
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,100
An-and we ain't kicking it.
We ain't friends.

1016
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,600
I got it.

1017
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,000
And maybe I snore a little,
I don't know...

1018
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Oh, that's okay,
'cause I know I snore.

1019
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,000
It's a nice place
you've got here.

1020
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,400
I'm gonna have me a spot
like this someday...

1021
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,500
someplace clean.

1022
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
You can get
whatever you want, Rock.

1023
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,300
No, only some people get
the shit they want.

1024
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,100
That's true.

1025
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,200
And those are the people
who show up to get it.

1026
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,600
Anybody ever tell you
you talk too much?

1027
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,700
Yeah...

1028
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,900
they did.

1029
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,600
Good night.

1030
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,400
- That's not the point.
- No, the point is they need help,

1031
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,000
not suspension from school.

1032
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,900
Oh, really, please tell me,
Professor Dulaine,

1033
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,400
exactly what kind
of help it is they need?

1034
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,900
So, as your principal has
made me your executioner,

1035
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,300
you will report to me every
morning here at 7:30 A.M.

1036
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,200
- for a private session.
- What?!

1037
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,500
Whatever problems you have with each
other, you can work out as partners.

1038
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,400
Sometimes the best way
to conquer an enemy

1039
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,300
is to get right up
in his face.

1040
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,100
I'd rather be dead
than up in his face.

1041
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,600
You know what?
I feel the same way.

1042
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,100
You know, guys,
you're lucky.

1043
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,600
Common emotions
can be very powerful.

1044
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,100
This is an excellent beginning,
starting now.

1045
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,600
Please, take
the dancing position.

1046
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,800
Please... come on.

1047
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,900
Let's see this.

1048
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,100
We are just going
to move, very simply.

1049
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,000
Let's just, uh, walk.

1050
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,900
No no no.
LaRhette, the man leads.

1051
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,900
It is the woman's job
to follow.

1052
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,600
Oh, so if he gets to lead,
then he's gonna think he's boss?

1053
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,100
No, but he's not. You see,

1054
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,800
the man proposes the step.

1055
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,900
It is the woman's choice
to accept

1056
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,100
by following.

1057
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,100
Now, to follow takes
as much strength as to lead.

1058
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,200
Good? All right.

1059
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,400
Let's do it again.
Come on, come on!

1060
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,900
Now, Rock, just walk.
Just forward, just walking.

1061
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,900
Yeah, forward.
Just walking, like that.

1062
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,800
Here you go.

1063
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,100
Yeah, you know how to walk.
Now walk back.

1064
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,000
There you go.

1065
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,000
# You're dancing,
you're dancing... #

1066
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,900
In the corte position
of the tango,

1067
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,000
you must hold
your partner much closer.

1068
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,300
Now boys, don't get too excited.
And girls, don't get too scared,

1069
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,500
all right?
Now, your leg goes here, gentlemen.

1070
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,500
And ladies, your upper right chest
touches his, like so...

1071
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,200
- You're so far back. Move up.
- Uh, yeah.

1072
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,200
The top of your thighs
must stay

1073
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,300
glued to each other
for perfect balance.

1074
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,500
That way, this is possible.

1075
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,500
Good flys.

1076
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,100
Come on,
dance together.

1077
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,300
There are multiple
positions for the tango.

1078
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,400
So where're you going?

1079
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,700
- What's up, yo?
- What are you doing here?

1080
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,900
Some hottie in the office
gave me your 411.

1081
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,800
- I-I was eating... supper.
- After me, huh?

1082
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,100
Are you all right?

1083
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,800
I'm a'ight. It's just, uh...

1084
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,400
it's just for a player like me,

1085
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,800
man, I gotta keep
them girls on lock, you know?

1086
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,400
Uh... what exactly
are you saying, Kurd?

1087
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,100
Me and Big Girl, man...

1088
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,200
you know, with the thighs
touching together and shit?

1089
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,000
Is that a problem?

1090
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,700
Hell yeah, it's a problem.

1091
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,800
I'm done for if the homies
find out I like her.

1092
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,200
Uh, uh... just...
thank you.

1093
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,800
Everybody else
thinks Big is, well,

1094
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,200
you know, not exactly
the hottest female around?

1095
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,100
It is only what
you think that matters.

1096
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, easy for you
to say, man.

1097
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,800
- You already a freak.
- Thank you.

1098
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,400
Look, I don't know
how it happened.

1099
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,700
One day, it was
just like whoa!

1100
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,700
Uh, listen, having the courage
to follow your heart...

1101
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,100
- Yo!
...is what makes a man a real man.

1102
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,600
- That's what...
- Whoa, yo man, who's this hottie?

1103
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,500
Uh, that is my wife.
Thank you.

1104
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,900
- Your wife?
- Yes.

1105
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,900
Lucky man.
Where's she at?

1106
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,200
She died, five years ago.

1107
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,800
Oh. So uh...

1108
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,600
so are you like Buck Wilding
anyone else now?

1109
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,700
No, I am not.

1110
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,300
The waltz.

1111
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,200
It cannot be done without trust
between partners.

1112
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,500
Well, then it's just
not gonna happen.

1113
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,800
But trust must
be earned, LaRhette.

1114
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,600
- Good luck with that.
- All right, I have something here

1115
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,000
that is gonna help.

1116
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Don't put that thing
on my eyes!

1117
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,400
I'm asking you to do
something very courageous.

1118
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,100
Besides dance with him?

1119
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,100
There. Come on.

1120
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,200
Now Rock, you have the...
over here.

1121
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,900
You have the opportunity
to use

1122
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,300
every bit of strength
and skill you possess,

1123
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:22,200
not to dominate her,
but to take her on a journey.

1124
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,700
It is a lot to ask.

1125
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,900
If and how
you take the journey...

1126
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,800
that's entirely up to you.

1127
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,100
He's gone?

1128
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,900
Yeah.

1129
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,000
- You down?
- I guess.

1130
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,300
Wrong way.

1131
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,900
You always start forward
and I start back.

1132
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,500
- All right, yeah. I can figure it out.
- I'm just trying to help.

1133
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,900
I wish he'd tied that thing
around your mouth.

1134
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,000
- You ready or what?
- Okay!

1135
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,200
- Okay.
- O-kay.

1136
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,400
- I saw that.
- What?!

1137
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,300
- What are you smiling for?
- Shut up, I'm not.

1138
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,400
All right, you're not.

1139
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,000
Set it down right there.

1140
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,100
All right, hit it, Tommy!

1141
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,700
All right, people, no street shoes
on the dance floor, please.

1142
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,600
# Hey you! #

1143
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,900
# Come out here
on the floor! #

1144
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,700
# Let's rock some more #

1145
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,800
# Come out-a here
on the floor #

1146
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,000
# Honey, let's rock
some more, yeah #

1147
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,800
# Now when you get out here,
don't ya have no fear #

1148
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,100
# Put your hands on your hip
and let your backbone slip #

1149
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,900
# And work out! #

1150
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,900
# Ah, ma-mama, move up! #

1151
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,100
- # First step #
- # Honey, move back #

1152
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,700
- # Second step #
- # Shuffle to the left #

1153
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,500
# Third step... #

1154
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,300
- Cool!
- # Wobble to the right #

1155
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,700
# Fourth step... #

1156
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,800
I mean, it's corny
but, you know, it's cool.

1157
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,700
# But it's a natural fact #

1158
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,900
- # Ha! I like it like that... #
- Right, practice your turns!

1159
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,400
# Yeah-hh #

1160
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,200
# Round and around
and around and around #

1161
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,000
# Round and around
and around and around... #

1162
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,700
# Round and around
and around and around #

1163
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,200
# Round and around
and around and around... #

1164
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,500
# Ahh-hh, ahh-hh #

1165
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,000
- # Ahhhhh! #
- Um, 5:30 p.m.

1166
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,200
- Hello, Morgan, how are you?
- # Don't you know, don't you know? #

1167
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,400
Get dressed
and join them on the floor.

1168
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,800
You're kidding, right?

1169
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,800
- Uh... no.
- # Where we stop, nobody knows, yeah! #

1170
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,200
# The band is swinging
on the stand #

1171
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,000
# We're moving in, we're moving out,
then we'll step back now... #

1172
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,500
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1173
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,300
Uh, certainly.

1174
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,100
- In private.
- # Yeah-hhhh... #

1175
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,500
- Okay.
- # Baby, let's shout! #

1176
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,100
# Shout, baby!
Shout shout #

1177
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,700
- # Honey, let's shout! #
- # Shout, baby #

1178
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,200
- # Ah, baby, let's shout! #
- I have just one small question.

1179
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,600
What the hell
are you doing?

1180
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,100
Well, it's kind of complex
to explain what's going on.

1181
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,500
# Shout all night long!
I gotta have it... #

1182
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,700
- Bounce, dawg, I'm cuttin' in.
- What?

1183
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,700
Don't talk about me like I'm invisible.
I'm standing right here.

1184
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,200
Well, what?

1185
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,400
This dance taken?

1186
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,100
# Work all night long... #

1187
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,700
Come on, man, don't trip.

1188
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,700
Dance.

1189
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,700
# Work out, baby #

1190
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,500
- # Work, baby, work out #
- # Work out, woman #

1191
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,100
- # Work, baby, work... #
- # Shout and turn the joint... #

1192
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,200
You know what? By the time
the Academy students warm up,

1193
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,200
the other kids
will be done...

1194
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,800
I'm so sorry.

1195
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
- Sorry.
- You all right? You cool?

1196
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,200
No no, I'm-I'm not cool.

1197
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,200
Look around you.

1198
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,700
This is an advanced class,
a real class.

1199
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,800
You guys are just taking up
time and space I paid for.

1200
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,500
You see that? That's what
ballroom dancing looks like.

1201
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,100
What you're doing
doesn't even come close.

1202
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,400
Yeah well, let's see who
comes close at the competition.

1203
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,600
The competition?
You guys are going to compete?

1204
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,600
Yeah. What, you surprised?
Worried maybe?

1205
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,800
- What's going on here?
- If you want to shell out

1206
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,400
200 bucks apiece to get
slaughtered, fine by me.

1207
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,100
Hold on, man, hold on.
$200, what is she talking about?

1208
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,900
Everybody,
back on the floor, come on.

1209
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,500
- What for?
- Excuse me?

1210
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,900
Hell yeah, excuse you.
What you teaching us, dude?

1211
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,800
Some bargain basement two-steps
while these kids got the real moves?

1212
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,200
No no, Ramos, Ramos,
the steps are all the same.

1213
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,500
They've simply been doing them longer,
that's all. C'mon, c'mon.

1214
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,800
How are we supposed
to compete with something like that?

1215
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,500
- Game over, let's roll.
- No no no, wait wait wait!

1216
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,500
No no no, you've been
wasting our time, homes.

1217
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,900
Making goddamn fools
out of all of us.

1218
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,000
You knew all along
we couldn't do this thing.

1219
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,600
That is not true!
What I have taught you has value.

1220
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:04,000
Where?
Not where I live.

1221
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,400
I can't believe this...

1222
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,500
you've got fourth percentile
general math and reading scores,

1223
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,900
and you've got kids
wasting time dancing around.

1224
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,200
I've got no choice
but to report you.

1225
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,400
That's yours.

1226
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,000
It was like, uh, constructed
in the 1920s.

1227
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I didn't know
you liked architecture.

1228
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,800
Oh, you like architecture?
How'd you like my bedroom?

1229
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,600
Shut up! Why are you
such an ass?

1230
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,600
Forget both of you.
I can't take this no more.

1231
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,700
- What the hell was that, man?
- Forget you too, man.

1232
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,600
Leave your love-triangle
problems to yourself.

1233
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,400
This sucks.

1234
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,000
Good afternoon, everyone.

1235
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,700
Positions, please.

1236
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,000
Yo, dance class is over, man.

1237
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,000
No, it is not.

1238
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,000
It is just beginning.

1239
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,000
Your dancing is becoming...

1240
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,300
so good

1241
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,400
that I neglected to tell you,

1242
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,400
and I am sorry for that.

1243
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,600
But if you really want
to compete...

1244
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,300
you're gonna have to kick
some serious ass to win.

1245
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,000
These kids have been dancing
for years.

1246
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,100
And there is
a whole city more

1247
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,300
who are better
than they are.

1248
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,800
Yeah, so what the hell
are we supposed to do?

1249
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,900
Surprise them.

1250
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,300
Everyone competing
expects nothing... nothing from you,

1251
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,200
so you have nothing to lose,

1252
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,100
except everything
you have achieved so far.

1253
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,000
Look, I'm being honest
with you,

1254
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,700
competing
on any level is tough,

1255
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,900
and good dancers
make it look easy.

1256
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,300
So what we need to focus on now
is not winning or losing,

1257
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,700
but doubting.

1258
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,700
So if you're not sure,
then sit down,

1259
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,300
just stay home.

1260
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,300
But if somewhere
you see a dot,

1261
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,700
a glimmer of belief
in yourselves,

1262
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,300
then you might have
what it takes to win.

1263
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,600
You really think so?

1264
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,700
Oh yes.

1265
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,900
It is the strongest
secret weapon there ever was.

1266
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,100
Yeah, well,
belief is fine and all,

1267
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,500
but what about
that $200 entrance fee?

1268
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,000
I mean I can believe all I want,

1269
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,400
but I still can't make
a dollar out of 15.

1270
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,800
I'll find a way to handle it.

1271
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,400
- You would do that?
- Even for the school rejects?

1272
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,500
It's funny...

1273
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,600
I look around this room

1274
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:06,300
and all I see is choices.

1275
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,800
Choices waiting to be made.

1276
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,000
Not a single reject.

1277
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,700
Maybe a punkass or two.

1278
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,300
I'm in.

1279
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,300
Well?

1280
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,400
You guys with me or what?

1281
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,400
Mr. Dulaine?

1282
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,300
Miss James needs to see you.

1283
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,300
Miss James.

1284
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,500
"Terminated."

1285
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,700
These are the parents
of the kids in my class?

1286
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,900
No, they're not. This is a meeting
of the Parent Teacher Association.

1287
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh.

1288
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,600
So none of you have even seen firsthand
what my class is all about, right?

1289
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,500
Okay, stop calling it a class,
it's detention.

1290
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,400
These are the kids that need
the most help of all

1291
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,000
and you're with them
doing the cha-cha-cha...

1292
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,600
What are you doing
to help them, Mr. Temple?

1293
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,600
Don't pretend you care
about these kids.

1294
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,700
Let's be clear here.

1295
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,700
What exactly is this about?

1296
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,100
What this is about is wasting time with
something that is totally impractical.

1297
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:44,500
When are these kids ever gonna
ballroom dance? It's ridiculous.

1298
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,500
It's impractical,
as you say.

1299
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,200
It's creating a dividing line where some
kids are entitled to learn about art

1300
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,300
and are entitled to your time
and others are not.

1301
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,700
Please, Mr. Dulaine, we've all heard
enough of your dance-is-life philosophy.

1302
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,900
I get it.

1303
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,400
To do something,
anything, is hard.

1304
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,500
It's much easier to blame
your father, your mother,

1305
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,000
the environment, the government,
the lack of money,

1306
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,900
but even if you find
a place to assign the blame,

1307
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,800
it doesn't make
the problems go away.

1308
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,200
I'm trying something new.

1309
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,700
I'm trying it.

1310
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,200
So now you're gonna come to this school,
tell us about our kids,

1311
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,100
our problems and how
you're gonna fix them with a box-step?

1312
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,700
No.

1313
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,800
I'm just gonna show you.

1314
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,900
Uh, Augustine,
please, could you?

1315
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,300
Mr. Dulaine!
This is absurd. Augustine!

1316
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,300
Joe, shut up,
it's my body.

1317
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,200
All right.

1318
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,700
Don't worry.

1319
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,800
We're gonna just move.

1320
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,300
Here you go...

1321
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,100
just like this...
very simple.

1322
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,000
And now we're gonna walk
a little bit.

1323
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,200
Yes, we're gonna walk,
we're walking.

1324
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,600
Are we walking?
No, we're dancing.

1325
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,100
So you know how to walk,
you know how to dance,

1326
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,500
yeah.

1327
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,500
You see...
if she allows me to lead,

1328
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,200
she's trusting me.

1329
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,800
But more than that,

1330
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,500
she's trusting herself.

1331
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,100
Now, if your
16-year-old daughter

1332
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,300
is strong and secure
and trust herself,

1333
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:22,000
how likely is she to let
some idiot knock her up?

1334
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,600
And if your son...

1335
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,500
can learn to touch
a girl with respect,

1336
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,700
how will he treat women
throughout his life?

1337
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Beautiful.
Thank you.

1338
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,200
We've got names on this piece of paper
of parents who have decided

1339
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,700
- to terminate your class.
- So, ladies and gentlemen,

1340
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:49,300
this is what I do here
at this school. I teach dance.

1341
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,700
And with it, a set of rules

1342
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,900
that will teach your kids
about respect,

1343
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,600
teamwork

1344
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,700
and dignity.

1345
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,500
And that will help to give them a vision
of the future they could have.

1346
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,200
A vision of the future
they could have.

1347
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,200
Are there any questions?

1348
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,500
Do you teach adult classes?

1349
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:22,500
I suppose the studio
could cover all the fees.

1350
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,400
Great.

1351
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,200
Are you sure you really
want to do this?

1352
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,100
T-A-N-G-O.

1353
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,400
T-A-N-G-O.

1354
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,900
I don't care

1355
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,900
if you think this is stupid,
all right?

1356
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,500
Count it out
so you can feel the beat.

1357
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,900
Let's go.
Don't give up.

1358
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,200
T-A-N-G-O.

1359
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:52,800
They'll be giving you
points on technique, style

1360
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,600
- and originality.
- T-A-N-G-O.

1361
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,600
Better if you put them
together now.

1362
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,900
T-A-N-G-O.

1363
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,800
Danjou, what is wrong with you?
You're not even trying.

1364
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,000
I don't know why you're wasting my
man's time, you ain't winning nothin'.

1365
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Leave him alone, okay?
He's getting it.

1366
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,300
No, homes, I'm getting it.

1367
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,400
I got it, Mr. D.

1368
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,700
Both of you are so stupid.

1369
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,000
That's it!

1370
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,400
You boys will be banned
from the competition

1371
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,700
unless you can all
work together.

1372
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,200
How are we
gonna do that?

1373
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,200
From this point on,
you will both partner Sasha.

1374
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,900
You will equally decide
who dances what.

1375
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:36,200
You sweat through it,
you work it out.

1376
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,900
Positions, please.

1377
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,200
Let's go.

1378
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,500
Come on.

1379
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,800
And guess what?

1380
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,700
Count it out...

1381
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,300
T-A-N-G-O.

1382
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,700
T-A-N-G-O...

1383
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,300
Hey.

1384
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Hey, what's up?

1385
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,500
What you doing?

1386
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,700
Just trying to get
a head start,

1387
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,200
because I've got math stuff
to do when I get home.

1388
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,200
By the time I get
my baby brother fed,

1389
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,100
get Donny
through his homework...

1390
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:29,300
So it's just you and your mom
handling stuff at home?

1391
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,300
Look, if you're
about to crack on my mom...

1392
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,900
No, it's not even like that.

1393
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,000
I don't mean no disrespect.

1394
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,500
What I said before about
your mom, that was just before.

1395
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,300
Yeah, it is just me
and my mom handling stuff.

1396
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,900
My pops left when me
and Treyvaughn were 12.

1397
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,400
My mom was pregnant
with Donny.

1398
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,600
We did a'ight
for a minute, but...

1399
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:03,800
then the last few years,
Treyvaughn decided to start helping out.

1400
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,000
Before Ray got hit,
my pops got sick.

1401
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,100
So I had to start working.

1402
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,800
Where you work at?

1403
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,700
I'm just doing some odd jobs
for a family friend right now.

1404
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,600
Hey, LaRhette.

1405
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,800
I'm sorry about what happened
to your brother.

1406
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,700
Yeah, me too.
For yours.

1407
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,000
Stand clear
of the closing the doors.

1408
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:56,200
So what's the deal? You going
to the competition next Saturday?

1409
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,900
I can't, it's the same night
as my cotillion.

1410
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,100
Oh...

1411
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,200
what's a cotillion?

1412
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,600
A stupid dance where the whole world
gets to look at you

1413
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,400
and see what a throwback
you are.

1414
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,000
Come on now, you ain't
hardly no throwback, Caitlin.

1415
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,700
So do you have someone
to take you to this cotillion?

1416
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:18,300
Yeah, this stupid
jerk cousin I hate named Philip.

1417
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,000
Forget it, why don't you
just let me take you?

1418
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:27,300
I'd love that, really, but...

1419
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,700
I don't think I can.

1420
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,300
I mean, it's cool we dance together
after school and everything,

1421
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,500
but there is just
no way anyone,

1422
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,500
especially my mom,
would understand.

1423
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,400
Oh, it's okay.

1424
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Would you be willing
to help me practice for it anyways?

1425
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,500
# Whoa #

1426
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,200
# Whoa #

1427
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,800
# Whoa #

1428
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,600
- # Can you feel it in your body, oh? #
- # Can you feel it? #

1429
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,200
- # Can you feel it in your body, oh? #
- # Can you feel it? #

1430
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,200
# 'Cause I can feel it
in my body, oh #

1431
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,800
- # It feels good to my body, oh #
- # Oh, this is it #

1432
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,200
- # You've got to keep it moving #
- # Don't stop #

1433
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,700
# Once you get moving,
don't quit #

1434
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,900
- # Next thing you know you on top #
- # You on top #

1435
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,500
- # So hop to the rhythm that we... #
- # Rock #

1436
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,800
- # Get loose and express what you got #
- # What you got #

1437
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,600
- # At least you've got
to give yourself a shot #

1438
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,500
- # A shot #
- # Hey, never give up, and... #

1439
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,200
One, two, three.

1440
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,800
# Can you feel
the hi-i-igh-i-igh? #

1441
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,700
# I can feel
the hi-i-igh-i-igh #

1442
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,700
# Can you feel
the hi-i-igh-i-igh? #

1443
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:47,200
# I can feel
the hi-i-igh-i-igh #

1444
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,800
# Can you feel it? #
- # Can you feel it in your body, oh? #

1445
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,300
- # Can you feel it? #
- # Can you feel it in your body, oh? #

1446
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,800
- # Can you feel it? #
- # 'Cause I can feel it in my body-o #

1447
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,500
- # I can feel it #
- # Feels good to my body-o, we go #

1448
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,100
# To my body,
to my body, to my body-o #

1449
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,500
# Body, to my body,
b-b-body-o #

1450
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,100
# Dabadada-dada #

1451
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,600
# Dabadada-dadada... #

1452
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,100
# Talatala-talatala-
doo-be-doo #

1453
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,200
# Laladadoo-ladadadah. #

1454
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,800
Oh yeah, Black Eyed Peas
on The LIZ.

1455
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,700
If you feel it,
I can feel that.

1456
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,400
Traffic on the eights,
on 800 W-LIZ.

1457
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,100
- Hey, I got a question.
- What's up?

1458
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,300
So...

1459
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,600
are you gonna do the competition
with me or what?

1460
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:37,600
Pierre wants me to waltz
and I need a partner.

1461
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,400
You want me to do it?

1462
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,200
I'm asking you, right?

1463
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,400
Why? Does what
I want count now?

1464
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,100
No.

1465
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,700
You know what? It'll be worth it
to see their faces when we all roll up.

1466
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,700
They'll probably
hide the orchestra.

1467
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,800
You think there's gonna
be a orchestra?

1468
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,300
Yeah, I mean... I guess.

1469
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,500
Oh!

1470
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,900
- My bad.
- It's all right.

1471
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,700
You know, you look
different when you dance.

1472
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,800
How?

1473
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,900
Like calm, like...

1474
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,600
like you're at peace
or something.

1475
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,900
Well yeah, that's 'cause

1476
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,100
when I'm dancing
I'm in my moment.

1477
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,000
What's that mean?

1478
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,200
It's just this place
where it gets all silent

1479
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,200
and I forget
about everything bad.

1480
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,900
And it just feels good.

1481
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,300
All right, come on.

1482
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,300
And one and two
and three...

1483
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,400
All right.
Don't do it anymore.

1484
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,100
- All right.
- Don't do it anymore.

1485
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,200
This is like Elvira's dress.

1486
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,800
- Those are mine... be careful.
- Cool!

1487
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,200
Not this bright
pink one, I'm not!

1488
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,100
Put that one down, because it
does not go with my dress.

1489
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
- You look good.
- Hmm.

1490
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,100
- Wow! Sexy.
- Hello hello.

1491
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,900
Okay, try this one.

1492
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,500
Tina?

1493
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,000
Thank you.

1494
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,700
# Let me tell them, let me show them,
let me tell them #

1495
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,800
# Ya ya-ya-ya ya-ya-yah... #

1496
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,400
Fasten this up.

1497
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,600
Nice.

1498
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,300
You know, it kills her
when you do that.

1499
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,700
What was that?

1500
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,900
Tina... the hand
on the shoulder thing...

1501
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,700
it kills her.

1502
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:13,600
Look, I know how you love
to talk about...

1503
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,900
romance and magic and two bodies
moving as one and everything.

1504
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,100
But let me see if I can
make you understand something...

1505
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,100
she likes you.

1506
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,800
- Look what I found on the street.
- Eddie, Eddie...

1507
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,000
I'm just playing, Mr. D. These was
on hold for my brother's wedding.

1508
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,100
But we've got to be
real careful with them,

1509
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:39,000
get them back on time or my ass
is family history, you feel me?

1510
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,700
Hey, look what I got, y'all.

1511
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,100
Whassup? Whassup?

1512
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,800
- Ah!
- Shoot it, shoot it!

1513
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,500
Man, shoot it!

1514
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,300
Oh-ho-ho no.

1515
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,200
On Saturday?
You said this Saturday?

1516
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,600
Yeah, this Saturday, fool.

1517
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,800
- Shoot it.
- He's being lazy.

1518
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,500
Yo, you playing or what?

1519
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,100
Get up, get up!

1520
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Game point, game point.

1521
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,300
Nice bike.

1522
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,600
Thank you.

1523
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,700
You're welcome.

1524
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,300
Good evening and welcome

1525
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,900
to the 25th Annual
Grand Ballroom Competition.

1526
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,500
I see many many
familiar faces here tonight.

1527
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,200
And a whole lot
of new black ones.

1528
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,400
So at this time,
if you'd like to warm up,

1529
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,500
please, take a partner and join me
on the dance floor

1530
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,100
for our first all-in waltz.

1531
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,600
Our orchestra this evening is
under the direction of Frank Laurence.

1532
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,000
Please, give them
a very warm welcome.

1533
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,100
Man, she knows she wrong.

1534
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,800
You ought to give it to her
though, the girl is bad.

1535
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,800
- Dancers, ready?
- Ready?

1536
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,900
Yo, Ease,

1537
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,400
this don't feel right, man.

1538
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,300
- If somebody comes...
- You shoot 'em.

1539
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,800
What d'you think I gave you
the piece for? To play with?

1540
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,500
I ain't about
to shoot nobody.

1541
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,600
So what you gonna do?
Dance 'em outta here?

1542
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,200
Give me that back.

1543
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,200
If you're gonna punk out,
punk out now. You understand me?

1544
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,300
Like your
goddamn brother, dude.

1545
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,500
He got hit because he punked.

1546
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:33,600
Now I'm not saying
that I did it, so...

1547
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,400
you gonna be like him, huh?

1548
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,000
Huh?

1549
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,100
No.

1550
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,200
Good.

1551
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,800
Handle your business, man.

1552
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,800
The next category
will be the salsa.

1553
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:02,700
Dancers, ready?

1554
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,400
Whoa, dawg.
Come on, man.

1555
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,700
What you gonna do with that?

1556
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,100
What'd you do that for?

1557
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:13,000
Doing what my brother should have
done when he had the chance.

1558
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,700
I'll kick your ass!

1559
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,000
Man, we gotta go!

1560
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,700
You know who you're
messing with, son?

1561
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,700
- Huh?
- We gotta go, Easy.

1562
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,700
I'll hit his ass again.
Get off of me.

1563
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,900
You messed
with the wrong brother.

1564
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,200
Leave that fool there.
Come on, man, let's go.

1565
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,700
Numbers 14,

1566
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:49,600
212 and 346

1567
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,900
remain.

1568
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:53,400
All others,
please clear the floor.

1569
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,100
Presenting our next deb...

1570
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,700
Oh my God, here she comes.

1571
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,600
- Caitlin Spencer.

1572
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,300
Don't freak out.
Please, don't freak out.

1573
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,800
Don't screw up.
Please, don't screw up.

1574
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,900
Please, don't freak out.
Don't freak out, please.

1575
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,800
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
Please, don't freak.

1576
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,400
Just make it to Philip now.

1577
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,900
That's all you have to do.

1578
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,800
Where's Philip?

1579
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,700
Please, don't freak out.
Don't freak out. Please don't...

1580
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,800
Oh!

1581
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,800
That's not Philip.

1582
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,600
Now, come on,
we've got to bounce.

1583
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,100
The next dance is the tango.

1584
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:06,200
All competitors, please.

1585
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,700
- I better take this one, son.
- No, I got this. I got tango.

1586
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,800
Yeah, but you can't
dance it, junior.

1587
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,300
Look, Sasha, you decide
who the better man is.

1588
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,200
Danjou, come on.

1589
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:17,600
Remember,
ladies and gentlemen,

1590
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:20,000
that the $5,000 grand prize
is awarded

1591
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,400
to the couple scoring the highest
in any single round.

1592
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,400
And I'll announce the winners

1593
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,800
at the end of the evening.

1594
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:30,500
And now... the tango.

1595
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,100
Are you holding up?

1596
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,400
I'm fine.

1597
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,300
I'm sure he's got
a good reason.

1598
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,500
It's not even about him.

1599
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,200
It's me.

1600
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,200
I feel so stupid.

1601
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,500
People have been leaving me
hanging my whole life.

1602
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,800
I don't know why I thought
this would be different.

1603
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:50,500
You really made me believe magic
can happen anywhere, Mr. D.

1604
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,600
I guess you just
didn't mean with me.

1605
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,200
- Very well done.
- Yeah!

1606
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:21,200
Please show your appreciation,
ladies and gentlemen,

1607
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,700
for these wonderful dancers
as we wait for the results.

1608
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:34,700
Numbers 111

1609
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:38,100
and 213 stay.

1610
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,900
All others,
please clear the floor.

1611
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:44,300
Couple 111 took home
the $5,000 grand prize

1612
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,600
last year in this category.

1613
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,200
Morgan Fisher
and Travis Drake.

1614
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,900
Danjou, I don't think
we can beat them.

1615
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I'm sorry, but I don't
know what else to bring.

1616
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,100
Listen, you need to stop
worrying about what they got

1617
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,700
and bring to the floor
what we got.

1618
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,200
Joining them is couple 213...

1619
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,600
Mr. Danjou Epps
and Miss Sasha Keane.

1620
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,500
This is their first appearance
at this competition

1621
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,400
and we wish them well.

1622
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,600
And now let's turn it over to
Frank Laurence and the orchestra

1623
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:14,100
with our tango selection
this evening..."La Cumparsita."

1624
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,400
What?!

1625
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,700
# How much I'd like
to take you home #

1626
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:24,200
# How much I'd like
to take you home... #

1627
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,500
## Introducing
the best of the best #

1628
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,000
# And when the kick drum kick
and it's in your chest #

1629
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:12,200
# And then it gets
real deep within it #

1630
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:14,800
# We gonna get 'em, we shake
and vibrate, and take the rhythm #

1631
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,600
# Work-work-work-work
work-work-work-work. #

1632
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,500
Whoa!

1633
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,300
Now that's
what I'm talking about.

1634
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,600
Thank you.

1635
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,600
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
- Bravo!

1636
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,600
Well! Wasn't that exciting?

1637
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,100
Let's see what
the judges have to say.

1638
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,800
The judges have awarded
Miss Fisher and Mr. Drake

1639
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:18,000
straight 10s
in all categories.

1640
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,600
Unfortunately, as this is a competition
for couples and not teams,

1641
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,400
Miss Keane, Mr. Epps
and Mr. Ramos could not score.

1642
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,200
What?!

1643
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,900
The round, therefore, goes to
Morgan Fisher and Travis Drake.

1644
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,100
- That's a bunch of bull!
- This perfect score

1645
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:40,900
puts them firmly in the lead

1646
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:44,700
for the grand prize
again this year.

1647
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,700
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

1648
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:52,000
Miss Fisher, if you please.

1649
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,400
Let's call this round
a tie.

1650
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,700
- It better be a tie.
- A tie!

1651
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,600
I've never seen anybody move
like that in my life.

1652
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,300
I'm sure.

1653
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,700
That was a very
convincing performance.

1654
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:19,700
I'm a pro.

1655
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,400
- That's a very unexpected development.
- Yes!

1656
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,600
So, ladies and gentlemen,
a tie.

1657
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,300
The grand prize may be
shared this evening.

1658
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,900
Never a dull moment
in ballroom dancing

1659
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:34,100
as you can see.

1660
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:41,700
Our final competitive dance
is the waltz.

1661
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,900
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1662
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:14,400
I've really got to get in here.
I'm in the competition.

1663
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,200
Excuse me, sir, look, sir,

1664
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,000
I'll deal with it, okay?
Thank you.

1665
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,900
- Where's LaRhette?
- Where's LaRhette?

1666
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:24,000
Oh, Mr. D, I already know what
you're thinking, man, but I showed up.

1667
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,100
I'm here, you know
what I'm saying?

1668
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,600
Mr. D, look, sometimes you talk
about making choices

1669
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:33,600
and everything and tonight I probably
made a real wrong choice,

1670
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,500
- but...
- Here.

1671
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,700
Thank you, Pierre.

1672
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,500
You ready?

1673
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,400
Pierre, I never thought
it was possible.

1674
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,600
Honestly, Augustine,
I had my doubts.

1675
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:53,600
It took a lot of work.

1676
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:56,000
But it was worth it.

1677
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,200
I have to thank you
for allowing me to do this...

1678
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:01,100
Oh, don't start your thank-you speech
just yet, Dulaine.

1679
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,300
We need to make
your program permanent.

1680
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,100
And it's going to take
even more work.

1681
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:09,100
I'll see you in my office
Monday morning at 9:00.

1682
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:16,700
# It was fascination #

1683
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,400
# I know #

1684
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,500
# Seeing you alone #

1685
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:27,500
# With the moonlight above #

1686
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,600
# Then I touch your hand #

1687
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,100
# And next moment #

1688
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,000
# I kiss you #

1689
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:40,500
# Fascination turned... #

1690
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:44,000
# To... #

1691
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,600
# Lo-o-o-ve. #

1692
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:28,000
That's it
for the competition, folks.

1693
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,200
It's been a wonderful evening
and while we wait for the waltz scores

1694
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,900
and the grand prize results...

1695
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,900
- Miss James.
...let's relax and have some fun...

1696
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,300
- Hey Rock, are you enjoying yourself?
...with one more dance.

1697
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:39,800
Yeah, yes I am, uh...

1698
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,500
about your car...

1699
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:44,300
you know something
about my car.

1700
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,400
As you make your way to the floor,
ladies and gentlemen...

1701
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,800
I'm real sorry, Miss James.

1702
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,600
...let's take a moment to thank
our hosts again this year:

1703
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,900
- Let's not spoil tonight.
- the beautiful Lamont Hotel.

1704
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:54,100
- It's okay.
- As always, it gives me great pleasure

1705
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:55,900
- to introduce our fine musicians...
- For now.

1706
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,600
...led by the incomparable
Frank...

1707
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,800
Oh, shut up.

1708
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,800
It's time
for the tie-breaker.

1709
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:06,700
# Put your hands up #

1710
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,000
# Go! #

1711
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,300
- # Baby wanna ride? #
- # You know she'll get it #

1712
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:13,400
- # Hey baby, wanna ride? #
- # You know you're fated #

1713
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,400
# Hey baby, wanna ride?
Let's ride #

1714
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,600
# Sure you can dance,
I'm-a chill, I'm-a smoke #

1715
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,100
# But you know how they think when they
drink from that Hennessy and cokes #

1716
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,200
# When they drip on my kicks,
man, they got me like, uh! #

1717
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:23,800
# She act like she
couldn't hear me right #

1718
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:26,200
# When I came in the club,
all the people go good #

1719
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,500
# I just came in the club
just to leave with her #

1720
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,700
# Swizz got to calm me down
like, yeah #

1721
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,600
# Money frontin'
in the back, say #

1722
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,500
# Found Thunder,
what does Shiggy say? #

1723
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,200
# He said he didn't care,
then he called her a... #

1724
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,300
# Drag back
in the swing of things #

1725
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,800
# I'm back up in the club
but I ain't got to bring my things #

1726
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,700
# And I like the way
she shake that thing, yeah #

1727
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:45,100
# Might be easy for you
to break that thing, yeah #

1728
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,800
# And I stay in a New York
state of mind #

1729
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,500
# Let me see you dance
one more time #

1730
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,800
# We about to party,
hands in the air #

1731
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,900
Care to dance,
Mr. Dulaine?

1732
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,800
Uh...

1733
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,400
let them have this one.
I'll sit it out.

1734
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,600
# Yes, I love to dance #

1735
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:15,000
# I don't wanna stop #

1736
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:16,900
# I can feel the heat #

1737
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,500
# Ooh, it makes me hot... #

1738
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,700
What if we just...

1739
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,200
walk?

1740
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,100
- # Hey baby, wanna ride? #
- # You know she'll get it #

1741
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,400
- # Hey baby, wanna ride? #
- # You know you're fated #

1742
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,900
# Hey baby, wanna ride?
Let's ride... #

1743
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
# I can do that,
I can do that #

1744
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
# I can do that, I can do that #

1745
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,200
# I can do that,
I can do that #

1746
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:51,600
- # Hey baby, wanna ride? #
- # You know she'll get it #

1747
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:53,700
- # Hey baby, wanna ride? #
- # You know you're fated #

1748
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:56,200
# Hey baby, wanna ride?
Let's ride... #

1749
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,800
# Throw your hands up #

1750
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,100
# What? #

1751
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,900
# What? #

1752
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,000
# What? #

1753
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:05,400
# Yes, I love to dance,
I don't wanna stop #

1754
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,100
# I can feel the heat #

1755
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,200
# Ooh, it makes me hot #

1756
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,500
# Yes, I wanna let go #

1757
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,500
# But I'm in control #

1758
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,700
# I'm ready to ride #

1759
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:18,100
# Watch my body go #

1760
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:20,100
# Ooh-ooh, ah-ha #

1761
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,100
# I know you wanna see me
do my dance #

1762
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,200
# Ooh-ooh, ah-ha #

1763
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:26,400
# Come and check me out
as I do my dance #

1764
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,300
# Ooh-ooh, ah-ha #

1765
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,700
# I know you like the way
I do my dance #

1766
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,300
# Ooh-ooh, ah-ha #

1767
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,500
# Watch me
as I work it, Wisin #

1768
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,200
- # Hey baby, wanna ride? #
- # You know she'll get it #

1769
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:46,200
- # Hey baby, wanna ride? #
- # You know you're fated #

1770
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:48,900
# Hey baby, wanna ride?
Let's ride #

1771
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:50,800
# I can do that,
I can do that #

1772
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,800
# I can do that, I can do that #

1773
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,000
# I can do that,
I can do that #

1774
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,700
# I can do that, I can do that... ##

1775
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:59,400
## Yeah, that's right...
oh, you gotta show me that #

1776
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,600
# Could you... could you...
could you teach me? #

1777
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,300
# Show me that again? #

1778
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:07,500
# Could you... could you...
could you teach me? #

1779
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,300
# You take the lead #

1780
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,500
# Straight up, do you have rhythm
underneath your feet? #

1781
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,500
# Does the beat flow through
that fine body? #

1782
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,900
# Do you enjoy
sweating all on me? #

1783
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,700
# Did you just bust
that move freestylin'? #

1784
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:21,800
# Do you do much
choreographin'? #

1785
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:24,000
# You're widenin' out, boy,
great timin' #

1786
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,500
# I like a man
who can dance #

1787
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:29,600
# Shake it, shake it,
twist it like you're breakin' #

1788
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,700
# Pop it like your bones
are dislocated #

1789
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:33,600
# Ride me like you hold me,
turn me around slowly #

1790
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:35,500
# Drop me to the floor,
pull me up again #

1791
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,800
# Shake it, shake it,
twist it like you're breakin' #

1792
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,800
# Pop it like your bones
are dislocated #

1793
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,800
# Ride me like you hold me,
turn me around slowly #

1794
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,900
# Drop me to the floor,
pull me up again #

1795
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,100
# You rock me, swing me,
bang me #

1796
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:50,100
# Teach me how to... how to
how to flow, how to roll #

1797
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,900
# What have you got? #

1798
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,600
# Teach me how to...
how to... #

1799
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,200
# Could you... could you...
could you teach me? #

1800
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,800
# Teach me how to dance #

1801
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,300
# I can do that,
I can do that #

1802
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,300
# I can do that, I can do that #

1803
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,300

1804
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,400
# I can do that, I can do that #

1805
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,800
# Excuse me
while I check out your style #

1806
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:10,000
# You move so good,
all I can do is sigh #

1807
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,500
# You're making me
start to fantasize #

1808
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,500
# Shake it, shake it,
twist it like you're breakin' #

1809
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,400
# Pop it like your bones
are dislocated #

1810
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,600
# Ride me like you hold me,

1812

# Shake it, shake it,
twist it like you're breakin' #

1813
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,000
# Pop it like your bones
are dislocated #

1814
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,900
# Ride me like you hold me,
turn me around slowly #

1815

1816

# Straight up, do you have rhythm
underneath your feet? #

1817
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,600
# Does the beat
flow through that fine body? #

1818
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,800
# Do you enjoy sweating
all on me? #

1819
