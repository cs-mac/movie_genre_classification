1
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,890
In the 16th century,
Martin Luther appeared.

2
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:41,258
He criticized the Roman Church,

3
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:46,096
savagely attacking the
Church and clergy.

4
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:52,563
The resultant break of
the protestants produced...

5
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:56,235
...a serious religious
crisis in Europe.

6
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:05,684
In 1534, in Spain, Loyola
founded the Society of Jesus.

7
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:09,483
It reflected the crisis
in Catholicism.

8
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,056
They fought to rebuild
the Church...

9
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:18,222
...and widened their work
beyond Europe.

10
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,228
In 1549, along with the gun,

11
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:31,608
Francisco Xavier landed on
the southern shores of Japan.

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,810
30 years later, more
than 200 churches,

13
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:42,479
75 priests and 300.000
believers appeared.

14
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,188
Japan's rulers were

15
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,954
worried about the new
religion's rapid spread,

16
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:55,694
since it came with the gun.

17
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:59,198
Both examples of
Western culture...

18
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:03,002
...put fear into the hearts
of the rulers.

19
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,768
Suppression!

20
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:11,343
The latter half of
the 16th century was...

21
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:16,354
...a bitter time for
Japan's Christians.

22
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,218
Countless Padres and
believers were killed.

23
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:25,297
Some disappeared.

24
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:29,824
Padre Ferreira also disappeared.

25
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:39,848

Directed by
Masahiro Shinoda

38
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,536
Padre...

39
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,842
In Macao, you promised
to pay me...

40
00:04:55,945 --> 00:05:00,609
...as soon as we reached
Japan, with some extra.

41
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,207
Remember?

42
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,147
I've wanted to ask you...

43
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:11,693
Are you a Christian, Kichijiro?

44
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:14,728
Are you really Japanese?

45
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:16,157
Of course.

46
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:18,460
I am Japanese.

47
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:51,762
If the officials come,
you don't know me.

48
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,528
Don't forget.

49
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:54,994
We understand.

50
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:58,571
Be sure. I'm going now.

51
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:39,604
Padre! Padre!

52
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:48,442
Padre! Our hearts are
the same as yours.

53
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:08,700
You must change into
these quickly.

54
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,049
You must not be seen.

55
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,948
Please hurry!

56
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,284
Padre!

57
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,267
Shut the door!

58
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,397
Rest here tonight.

59
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:19,333
At dawn we'll take you
to the mountains.

60
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,961
You'll be safe here.
No one comes here.

61
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:07,240
Are there no priests?

62
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:12,506
No monks?

63
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,741
No priests or monks
have come for years.

64
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:25,819
If we were caught,
all would be killed.

65
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,460
We only trust our own village.

66
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:35,430
Strangers would turn us in
right away.

67
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,638
What about prayers?

68
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,875
Baptism and teaching?

69
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,541
We do it all.

70
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:51,617
We do the best we can,
each taking a part.

71
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:57,423
We've hid and kept on
for all these years.

72
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:04,194
The Padres and monks all
left us. They went away.

73
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:31,115
That sound?

74
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:33,292
It's rain.

75
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:38,625
The rainy season has
started and it's long.

76
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:49,597
"Let's be on our way

77
00:12:50,676 --> 00:13:00,745
"To a temple in heaven.

78
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:13,457
"It is called the
Temple of Paradise.

79
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:25,210
"It is known as
the great temple.

80
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:40,047
"That temple exists
in our hearts."

81
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,840
Please listen to me.

82
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:41,750
Does anybody know where
Padre Ferreira has gone?

83
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:50,350
He came to Japan
twenty years ago.

84
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:54,795
And he preached here.

85
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:59,332
He went to the capital
and to Edo.

86
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:06,236
We know only he was
captured five years ago.

87
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:10,678
Since that, nothing.

88
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:17,346
Has anybody here heard
anything about him?

89
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:25,351
In Portugal, when Garrpe
and I were children,

90
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:29,693
he taught us about the lord.

91
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:37,565
We decided to come here
to teach...

92
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:40,574
Padre Ferreira's teachings.

93
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:46,471
So we want to know
what has happened:

94
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:56,689
Whether he is alive
or has died bravely...

95
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,191
...and gone on to Paradise.

96
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:03,790
Do you know anything?

97
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,333
How about you?

98
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,977
We warned you.

99
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,379
You must never go outside.

100
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:26,046
Don't be angry. We just
wanted a little sun.

101
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:30,122
Never go out of here again!

102
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:35,391
Get in here
if something happens.

103
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:45,100
Please open the door.
Don't be afraid.

104
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:51,272
We, fishermen, haven't
seen a Padre for years.

105
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:24,000
Won't you trust us?

106
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:27,507
Five days ago...

107
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:31,882
We watched you from
the other mountain.

108
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:35,252
We heard Padres were
in Tomogi Village.

109
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:36,483
From who?

110
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:41,392
From Kichijiro, a
Christian among us.

111
00:21:41,997 --> 00:21:44,261
Yes, Padre.

112
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:55,307
But is he a Christian?

113
00:21:55,443 --> 00:22:00,608
He surely is a Christian.

114
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:09,355
Eight years ago a man
reported his family.

115
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:12,654
They were told to
step on a medallion.

116
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,254
The Lord's image was
carved on it.

117
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:18,832
The fumi-e?

118
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:24,228
His brother and sister refused.

119
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:28,965
But Kichijiro was terrified.

120
00:22:29,176 --> 00:22:32,737
He said he'd give up the faith.

121
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:37,077
His brother and sister
were burned alive...

122
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:43,284
...at the stake, the very next day.

123
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,390
And Kichijiro disappeared.

124
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:56,299
And he showed up again?

125
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:58,028
And told about us?

126
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:04,141
He's boasting he brought
Padres to Japan.

127
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:08,537
He's popular in our village.

128
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:13,747
We don't have Mass
or Confessions.

129
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:17,949
We just say our prayers.

130
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:20,453
Come to us, Padre!

131
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:34,463
Please come.

132
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:48,304
That day the wind
was very strong.

133
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:55,002
They were thrown into
the crater of a volcano.

134
00:25:55,177 --> 00:26:00,615
The place was called
Hell Valley of Mt. Unzen.

135
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:08,045
Fathers Ludovico.
Johann. Antonio...

136
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:12,287
Julian, Marta, Michael...

137
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:15,955
Thomas, and Ignatius.

138
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:22,995
I remember it all very well.

139
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:30,807
The pagans cheered
as each one fell.

140
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:36,941
Uneme Takenaka was
a real demon.

141
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:41,289
And Matsukura, too.

142
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:46,691
They caught Fathers
Dominico and John.

143
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:50,855
Their hands were tied
behind them.

144
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:56,164
Straw mats were wrapped
about them and set afire.

145
00:26:57,005 --> 00:27:04,275
As the fire spread, they
began to hop around.

146
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:13,978
The pagans laughed
at the mat dancers.

147
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:16,847
They enjoyed it.

148
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:23,921
And things have gotten worse.

149
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:29,970
Being a Christian is even
more difficult today.

150
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:37,507
And Magistrate Inoue
is all to blame.

151
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:44,342
He's the king of the demons.

152
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:50,623
The leader of the demons.

153
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:01,827
The islanders were very
happy to see you.

154
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:07,100
They waited a long time
for a Padre to come.

155
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:11,744
Girls even smile at me
since I brought you.

156
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:14,075
Listen to me.

157
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:17,912
I know what you want to say.

158
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:20,987
But I've reformed.

159
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:24,148
So I'm showing you around.

160
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:28,785
Why did you say you'd
give up the faith?

161
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:31,761
Just a momentary confusion.

162
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:34,560
I don't feel that way now.

163
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:38,362
Can you swear that to me?

164
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:43,568
That you'll keep the faith
under any pressure?

165
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:45,871
I swear!

166
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:49,470
So please forgive
what I've done.

167
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:55,986
But, Padre, you don't know
how they torture us.

168
00:28:56,122 --> 00:29:00,024
That's why you're so angry now.

169
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:10,700
Some people are strong;
others are weak.

170
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:15,965
The strong bear up
and go to heaven.

171
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:18,634
But a weak man like me...

172
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:49,439
Padre!

173
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:54,907
The officials!

174
00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:56,474
In the village?

175
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,510
They've found us.

176
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:02,942
Us, too?

177
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:06,750
They don't know about you.

178
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,686
Garrpe?

179
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:10,919
I'll take you to him.

180
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:09,183
No time for talk!

181
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:14,989
It's been reported that
there are Christians.

182
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:19,326
Now give me their names.

183
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:22,920
For 100 pieces of silver.

184
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:28,797
Take him!

185
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:50,686
We'll take him as hostage
till you talk!

186
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:55,790
We'll come back in three
days for more hostages.

187
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,557
Think it over.

188
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:20,479
We didn't tell them
about you Padres.

189
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:23,820
And we never will.

190
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,620
No matter what!

191
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:33,256
But that means you'll
all be taken hostage.

192
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:38,302
Yes, but we still won't talk.

193
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:44,605
Rather than that, we
should leave Tomogi.

194
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:48,238
We'll go to Kichijiro's island.

195
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:54,982
But since they came here,
they'll go there, too.

196
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:57,180
Go farther away.

197
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:02,729
I'd like to go along,
but it's dangerous.

198
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:26,414
Since you still say no,
we must believe you.

199
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:32,149
But we must find out
who is lying.

200
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:34,556
You all or the informer.

201
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:38,429
The hostages will then return.

202
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:49,004
Today we must take three
more to Nagasaki.

203
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:54,068
We won't harm them.
Those three are...

204
00:33:55,582 --> 00:33:58,847
You... you...

205
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,891
And you!

206
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:21,572
The magistrate will see
you're not Christians.

207
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:27,810
Then I'll send all
of you back here.

208
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,286
You know Christianity
is heresy, don't you?

209
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:21,662
It was reported that
you believe that heresy.

210
00:35:21,832 --> 00:35:24,266
How do you plead?

211
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:27,801
We always pay our taxes.

212
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:31,268
We have Buddhist funerals.

213
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:36,142
Then you claim you are
really not Christians?

214
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:37,111
Yes, sir.

215
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:42,481
Well, that makes the
Magistrate happy.

216
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,958
Do you know what this is?

217
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:56,992
A Christian carving.

218
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,533
Exactly.

219
00:35:58,635 --> 00:36:04,904
It's Virgin Mary
whom they praise.

220
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:11,205
But it has no value to
you non-Christians.

221
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,673
Step on it!

222
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:19,252
You must step on this!

223
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:27,661
What's wrong?

224
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:33,199
Non-Christians should
not mind stepping on it.

225
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:57,188
So you think you've fooled us?

226
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,919
I saw your heavy breathing.

227
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:05,329
You're wrong.
We're not Christians.

228
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:09,198
Then spit on this!

229
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:13,206
And say Virgin Mary is a whore!

230
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:16,135
No?

231
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,472
How about you?

232
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,051
And how about you?

233
00:37:32,494 --> 00:37:33,892
Spit!

234
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:38,709
We hear you!

235
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:47,787
"Let us be on our way

236
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:53,525
"To a temple in heaven.

237
00:39:54,233 --> 00:40:07,305
"It is called the
Temple of Paradise."

238
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:32,892
Padre!

239
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,107
Padre!

240
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,766
Been a long time!

241
00:45:47,379 --> 00:45:49,210
Don't go alone.

242
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:52,771
The officials are
on this island, too.

243
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:11,950
Eat it!

244
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,582
Eat it!

245
00:50:07,432 --> 00:50:11,960
We use these snakes
for medicine.

246
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:15,637
Is there a river?

247
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:18,072
You want some water?

248
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:22,277
You sure gobbled that
dried fish down.

249
00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:27,815
Isn't there a river? A river...

250
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:39,580
Padre!

251
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:57,270
Why did you run off?

252
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:05,309
Don't you trust me?

253
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:10,717
Don't feel bad.
I'm just very tired.

254
00:52:11,154 --> 00:52:15,420
Won't you just leave me alone?

255
00:52:15,525 --> 00:52:18,323
Alone? What for?

256
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:22,592
I know a village with
Christians and Padres.

257
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:23,663
Padres?

258
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,463
And they're not
Japanese priests.

259
00:52:29,072 --> 00:52:35,135
Padre, you don't
trust me anymore.

260
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:49,989
Mokichi was strong,
like a paddy we plant.

261
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:55,663
But a weak paddy stays weak
no matter what.

262
00:52:57,266 --> 00:53:04,172
I was born weak, Padre,
like this paddy.

263
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,940
Kichijiro, kneel!

264
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:26,421
Our Lord was crucified.

265
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:29,993
Our Lord was crucified.

266
00:53:30,965 --> 00:53:37,302
Our Lord was crowned
with thorns.

267
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,040
Our Lord was crowned
with thorns.

268
00:53:54,021 --> 00:53:57,047
Padre, forgive me!

269
00:53:57,492 --> 00:54:01,485
Forgive me!

270
00:54:02,396 --> 00:54:07,459
I'm weak, not strong
like Mokichi or Ichizo.

271
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:46,068
Here they come!

272
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:23,801
Look how big he is!

273
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:02,058
Nagasaki Magistrate sent us...

274
00:58:02,164 --> 00:58:06,328
...to take custody of
Padre Rodrigues.

275
00:58:06,602 --> 00:58:10,038
Thanks for your trouble.

276
00:58:14,176 --> 00:58:16,906
I can speak Japanese.

277
00:58:17,113 --> 00:58:21,606
Then I don't need to use
the foreign tongue.

278
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:24,344
I learned it at seminary.

279
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,521
I went to seminary, but
I'm not a Christian.

280
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:33,420
Why did you study then?

281
00:58:33,828 --> 00:58:35,523
To succeed in life.

282
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:39,964
A samurai can take up
arms or education.

283
00:58:40,068 --> 00:58:41,933
I chose education.

284
00:58:42,337 --> 00:58:46,171
You knew Christianity is heresy.

285
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:49,072
Still you came. Why?

286
00:58:49,711 --> 00:58:53,340
I'm ready for martyrdom.

287
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:58,283
Blind bravery like yours
is a bother to others.

288
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:10,294
Christianity is like
an unwelcome gift...

289
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:15,096
...that is forced on the receiver.

290
00:59:16,336 --> 00:59:19,396
We have our own religion.

291
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:23,206
We don't need yours.

292
00:59:23,544 --> 00:59:30,450
Things taught to us at
seminary are useless.

293
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:37,721
Silly bickering!

294
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,292
Bickering?

295
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:20,746
Change!

296
01:02:21,585 --> 01:02:23,780
They're clean.

297
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:28,085
They're Buddhist priest's
sacred garments.

298
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:30,553
I don't need them.

299
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:38,394
Change quickly.
The officials are coming.

300
01:02:54,384 --> 01:03:01,119
It's a Padre! I didn't know
we had a Padre here.

301
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:10,865
I've been here for
five days. Have you...

302
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:14,801
He speaks Japanese well.

303
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:16,901
It's amazing.

304
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:18,735
You mustn't talk.

305
01:04:03,485 --> 01:04:07,216
Lord Chikugo is
concerned about you.

306
01:04:07,322 --> 01:04:09,415
Be comfortable.

307
01:04:12,126 --> 01:04:14,924
Rodrigues from Portugal.

308
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:19,056
Came from Macao.
Is that right?

309
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:21,566
We are moved by
your determination...

310
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:27,471
...in traveling the great
distance to our shores.

311
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:30,774
You must have suffered.

312
01:04:31,145 --> 01:04:36,583
We are sorry to have to
give you more trouble.

313
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:41,486
Your beliefs are all right.

314
01:04:42,022 --> 01:04:43,785
They are valid...

315
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:48,988
...in Spain, Portugal and
other Western countries.

316
01:04:49,997 --> 01:04:54,457
But we ban Christianity
here because...

317
01:04:54,568 --> 01:04:57,696
...it's of no value to Japan.

318
01:05:15,021 --> 01:05:18,821
Truth should be universal.

319
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:25,261
Why else would we teach it?

320
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:28,527
If it's not truth in Japan...

321
01:05:28,635 --> 01:05:31,502
...then neither is it truth
anywhere else.

322
01:05:31,938 --> 01:05:34,702
AII Padres say that.

323
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:40,269
But even a tree chooses
its place to grow.

324
01:05:40,613 --> 01:05:45,482
Christianity may grow
in other lands, but...

325
01:05:45,585 --> 01:05:48,713
...not here in Japan.

326
01:05:48,955 --> 01:05:52,117
Have you ever thought of that?

327
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:56,450
It should grow and bloom here!

328
01:05:56,662 --> 01:06:00,723
It was well known
even in Europe...

329
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:06,237
...how Padres were activated
in Japan.

330
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:11,238
When permission
was given here,

331
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:17,213
the believers numbered
three hundred thousand.

332
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:21,642
If Christianity
doesn't grow here,

333
01:06:21,753 --> 01:06:25,382
it is due to lack of cultivation.

334
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:32,062
Why do we talk this way?

335
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:39,094
My words won't be able
to change your minds.

336
01:06:39,438 --> 01:06:43,635
Neither can yours change mine.

337
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:51,140
No matter what I say,
I will be executed.

338
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:56,580
We don't execute you
without reason.

339
01:06:57,088 --> 01:07:00,524
That's not Inoue's way.

340
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:04,493
He would do so immediately.

341
01:07:07,331 --> 01:07:08,958
Why do you laugh?

342
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:14,504
That is Inoue, Lord of
Chikugo, sitting there.

343
01:07:58,782 --> 01:08:00,340
It's 300 mon.

344
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:01,747
What is?

345
01:08:02,118 --> 01:08:06,578
You want to have me, don't you?

346
01:08:09,759 --> 01:08:11,522
You're funny.

347
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,862
Where are you from?

348
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:18,059
Why ask that?

349
01:08:18,802 --> 01:08:21,827
It doesn't matter
where one is from.

350
01:08:25,574 --> 01:08:30,102
Are you crying?

351
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:31,770
No!

352
01:08:32,548 --> 01:08:38,009
Whatever it is, just forget it.

353
01:08:38,587 --> 01:08:42,421
Such painful things
aren't easy to forget.

354
01:08:44,827 --> 01:08:50,459
You go as low as you can,
and nothing is shocking.

355
01:08:50,633 --> 01:08:56,299
You aren't near as far
down as I am.

356
01:08:59,008 --> 01:09:03,968
What did you do, kill somebody?

357
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:06,809
I did something worse!

358
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:11,014
You want me or not?

359
01:09:15,056 --> 01:09:16,489
You have money?

360
01:09:17,258 --> 01:09:22,696
Money? Sure I've got some.

361
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,864
Did you steal it?

362
01:09:25,233 --> 01:09:27,861
I sold for it.

363
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:36,840
Fine! Nobody enjoys
taking stolen money.

364
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:40,911
Hurry up!

365
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:57,662
What's wrong?

366
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,490
Spit in my face!

367
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:08,265
You're really weird!
What do you mean?

368
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:14,644
If you spit on me,
I'll give you all my money.

369
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:17,808
Or I can't forgive myself.

370
01:10:17,918 --> 01:10:19,749
Spit on me!

371
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:43,302
You must be bored, but
you'll see something.

372
01:10:49,116 --> 01:10:52,983
You'll be interested.

373
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:39,595
Sanemon Okada and Kiku!

374
01:11:40,698 --> 01:11:42,427
Your last chance!

375
01:11:43,468 --> 01:11:48,667
I ask you again:
Will you not apostatize?

376
01:11:53,077 --> 01:11:54,601
And you?

377
01:13:13,023 --> 01:13:18,222
Hey, you! What are you
doing here?

378
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,797
Get away from here!

379
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,699
Don't loiter here!

380
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:55,959
Sanemon Okada,
do you still refuse?

381
01:13:56,632 --> 01:14:01,126
They're coming for us
from Paradise.

382
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,629
It won't be long.

383
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:57,553
Padre, please listen!

384
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,422
I want to confess!

385
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:05,321
Oh, Padre! Padre!

386
01:15:05,532 --> 01:15:08,763
I have deceived you.

387
01:15:09,536 --> 01:15:11,367
Won't you listen?

388
01:15:12,373 --> 01:15:15,308
You made fun of me.

389
01:15:15,409 --> 01:15:19,573
So I hated you and the believers.

390
01:15:20,547 --> 01:15:25,507
I stepped on the fumi-e. I did!

391
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:31,789
Mokichi and Ichizo were
strong, but I'm not.

392
01:15:35,796 --> 01:15:38,788
Are you drunk?!

393
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:42,960
What should a weak man
like me do?

394
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:47,070
I didn't betray you
for the money.

395
01:15:47,174 --> 01:15:49,801
Because they threatened me.

396
01:15:50,009 --> 01:15:51,442
Get out!

397
01:15:51,811 --> 01:15:55,941
Padre, listen!
I couldn't help it!

398
01:15:56,049 --> 01:15:57,448
Get out!

399
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:01,213
I'm a Christian!

400
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,288
Throw me in jail!

401
01:16:22,175 --> 01:16:26,737
Padres! Listen to my confession!

402
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:32,541
I want to repent and
start all over again.

403
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:35,879
Please, listen, Padre!

404
01:16:36,122 --> 01:16:38,056
I apostatized.

405
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:42,886
But if I had been born sooner...

406
01:16:43,095 --> 01:16:47,156
I'd have lived and died
a good Christian.

407
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:51,133
But I was born when
Christianity is banned.

408
01:16:53,004 --> 01:16:57,464
How I regret it!

409
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:04,846
Been a long time.

410
01:17:05,383 --> 01:17:08,375
I've been to Hirado.

411
01:17:12,557 --> 01:17:16,960
You should visit
there sometimes.

412
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:22,261
It has a castle and
faces a peaceful bay.

413
01:17:22,734 --> 01:17:28,070
I heard in Macao that
it is a beautiful town.

414
01:17:28,173 --> 01:17:32,131
Not beautiful, but
most interesting.

415
01:17:32,877 --> 01:17:37,246
I heard an interesting
story there.

416
01:17:37,982 --> 01:17:42,419
Lord of Hirado once had
four concubines.

417
01:17:43,154 --> 01:17:44,587
Concubines?

418
01:17:48,259 --> 01:17:52,628
The four women always
fought each other.

419
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:55,865
The lord was troubled.

420
01:17:57,101 --> 01:17:59,899
What do you think he did?

421
01:18:00,004 --> 01:18:01,767
I don't know.

422
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:05,031
He threw all of them out.

423
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:10,402
Are you not interested
in a story about women?

424
01:18:14,385 --> 01:18:19,151
I'm glad to know
you agree with him.

425
01:18:20,924 --> 01:18:27,887
Don't you think Japan is
in the same position?

426
01:18:28,164 --> 01:18:32,931
Spain, Portugal,
Holland, England...

427
01:18:33,036 --> 01:18:37,496
They fight for Japan's
favor like women.

428
01:18:38,374 --> 01:18:41,343
If you think the lord was wise,

429
01:18:41,444 --> 01:18:47,349
you must understand why
Japan bans Christianity.

430
01:18:58,795 --> 01:19:03,596
We believe a man should
have one wife.

431
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:08,830
And a married man must
get rid of other women.

432
01:19:17,813 --> 01:19:23,649
Japan too should choose
his wife out of the four.

433
01:19:23,752 --> 01:19:27,051
You mean it should be Portugal?

434
01:19:34,663 --> 01:19:36,426
But, Padre...

435
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:40,627
Why should Japan choose
a foreigner?

436
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:46,504
A woman of his country
is best suited for him.

437
01:19:51,446 --> 01:19:54,574
A woman's heart is
more important...

438
01:19:54,683 --> 01:19:56,913
...than her nationality.

439
01:19:57,953 --> 01:20:02,912
But if it were only
the heart that matters...

440
01:20:03,024 --> 01:20:05,492
...there'd be no infidelity.

441
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:09,261
The love of an unwanted woman...

442
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:15,093
...is most troublesome to any man.

443
01:20:16,837 --> 01:20:21,206
And such a marriage will
produce no offspring.

444
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:24,938
And she is barren.

445
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:44,887
If she's barren, it's not
the fault of the Church.

446
01:20:45,099 --> 01:20:49,330
It is the fault of you
and your people...

447
01:20:49,436 --> 01:20:53,634
...who try to separate the
believers from the Church.

448
01:20:58,244 --> 01:21:04,843
It seems you don't know
Japan very well, Padre.

449
01:21:05,418 --> 01:21:09,855
And it seems you don't
know Christianity well.

450
01:21:19,999 --> 01:21:25,869
Thirty years ago, I too
was taught by Padres.

451
01:21:27,774 --> 01:21:30,971
Still I have to forbid it.

452
01:21:31,077 --> 01:21:34,342
I have my own reason.

453
01:21:34,881 --> 01:21:39,010
It's not that I think
it is heresy.

454
01:21:56,535 --> 01:21:58,833
Do it quickly.

455
01:22:01,707 --> 01:22:03,971
Your heart is free.

456
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:08,108
It is only a formality.

457
01:22:08,213 --> 01:22:11,580
It will not harm your beliefs.

458
01:22:11,683 --> 01:22:16,780
Step on it, and your
troubles are over.

459
01:23:01,566 --> 01:23:04,501
A samurai Christian!

460
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:07,833
Who cares about him?

461
01:24:37,293 --> 01:24:42,390
Stop! Please stop!

462
01:24:47,503 --> 01:24:49,494
Apostatize!

463
01:24:50,072 --> 01:24:53,940
If you do, we'll stop the horse.

464
01:24:54,443 --> 01:24:59,903
You mustn't, Kiku! You mustn't!

465
01:25:06,154 --> 01:25:08,918
Don't look at me!

466
01:25:09,023 --> 01:25:13,619
Get a hold of yourself.
Don't step on it!

467
01:27:03,569 --> 01:27:05,503
Pull him out!

468
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:42,804
Kiku!

469
01:27:56,855 --> 01:28:00,120
I apostatize too!

470
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:05,919
Listen to me!
Give me a fumi-e!

471
01:28:06,097 --> 01:28:07,530
Take him away!

472
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,831
I apostatize!

473
01:28:48,672 --> 01:28:52,073
Think carefully!

474
01:28:52,876 --> 01:28:57,677
The sooner you step on it,
the sooner you get out.

475
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:04,619
I tell you again.
It is just a formality.

476
01:29:04,955 --> 01:29:07,684
It won't hurt your beliefs.

477
01:29:10,226 --> 01:29:14,663
You want the horse's hoofs, too?

478
01:29:15,965 --> 01:29:18,365
I'll step on it!

479
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:27,005
Get out.

480
01:31:48,982 --> 01:31:51,610
Get up!

481
01:32:05,031 --> 01:32:07,158
You're leaving.

482
01:32:24,517 --> 01:32:26,485
Where is everyone?

483
01:32:26,586 --> 01:32:29,349
At the Magistrate's.

484
01:32:45,904 --> 01:32:48,873
You're going to see a man.

485
01:32:48,974 --> 01:32:54,742
He'll be here.
The Magistrate's order.

486
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,279
Do you know who?

487
01:32:58,517 --> 01:33:00,109
Really?

488
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:01,311
Can you guess what's next?

489
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:20,388
The Magistrate says that
if Garrpe apostatizes,

490
01:34:20,497 --> 01:34:23,523
the farmers will be set free.

491
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:25,857
You see, Padre.

492
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:31,666
We're not after a few
nameless people.

493
01:34:32,108 --> 01:34:38,274
Many Christian farmers are
hiding all over Japan.

494
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:43,417
If you Padres apostatize,
they'll be saved, too.

495
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:41,004
You force your own dreams
on us thoughtlessly.

496
01:35:41,109 --> 01:35:48,014
You never think of the
blood that must be shed.

497
01:35:48,349 --> 01:35:51,443
Like those innocent farmers.

498
01:35:53,854 --> 01:35:56,118
Garrpe was pure.

499
01:35:56,524 --> 01:36:00,460
But you're just a coward.

500
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:02,791
Not a "Padre".

501
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:23,946
Your name?

502
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:31,024
It was Monica, but
it isn't any longer.

503
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:35,688
How will you live on?

504
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:38,623
I don't know.

505
01:36:44,404 --> 01:36:50,832
What would you do,
if you were me, Padre?

506
01:36:51,278 --> 01:36:55,442
You did all you could.

507
01:36:56,049 --> 01:37:00,713
The Lord will forgive you.

508
01:37:06,059 --> 01:37:10,689
There are no gods or Buddhas.

509
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,930
There is nothing at all anymore.

510
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:44,525
Did you hear? Another body
was found on the beach.

511
01:37:46,665 --> 01:37:52,126
It was a Christian
woman all tied up.

512
01:37:52,271 --> 01:37:54,796
How cruel!

513
01:37:55,774 --> 01:37:59,676
The officials dumped her.

514
01:38:00,979 --> 01:38:03,675
Even under treatment like that,

515
01:38:03,882 --> 01:38:11,345
they believe in their God.
How pitiful!

516
01:38:11,457 --> 01:38:14,824
They are idiots!
Duped by Padres!

517
01:38:14,927 --> 01:38:16,951
They asked for it.

518
01:38:17,862 --> 01:38:22,959
Are you crying?

519
01:38:23,935 --> 01:38:25,402
No!

520
01:38:37,849 --> 01:38:40,977
Drink! Why the tears?

521
01:38:47,458 --> 01:38:50,723
Were you a Christian before?

522
01:38:50,828 --> 01:38:51,624
No!

523
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:56,098
I don't care, whether
you are or not.

524
01:38:58,603 --> 01:39:00,571
Where are you from?

525
01:39:01,572 --> 01:39:04,040
What's it to you?

526
01:39:05,376 --> 01:39:07,843
Sold, weren't you?

527
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:15,646
Yes, during the drought.

528
01:39:16,553 --> 01:39:20,956
It was the only way
we could eat then.

529
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,755
Want to see your folks?

530
01:39:25,862 --> 01:39:28,660
What for? Silly!

531
01:39:29,099 --> 01:39:30,828
Any brothers?

532
01:39:31,301 --> 01:39:37,001
Yes, a little one about this big.

533
01:39:41,178 --> 01:39:46,115
I wonder how he's getting along.

534
01:39:49,019 --> 01:39:52,011
It's a tough world!

535
01:39:52,289 --> 01:39:56,123
Really tough! Too tough!

536
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:24,246
Do you know who you're to see?

537
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:30,518
The Magistrate thinks
it's time you see him.

538
01:40:30,693 --> 01:40:31,853
Mr. Inoue?

539
01:40:31,961 --> 01:40:36,762
Right. And the man
wants to see you too.

540
01:42:56,569 --> 01:42:59,868
Don't call him Ferreira.

541
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:06,506
He has taken a Japanese
name: Chuan Sawano.

542
01:43:06,612 --> 01:43:08,705
Right, Sawano?

543
01:43:12,218 --> 01:43:16,984
He is working on another book.

544
01:43:17,422 --> 01:43:23,258
It tells of the errors in
Christian teachings.

545
01:43:23,361 --> 01:43:26,990
The title is
"Falsehoods Revealed."

546
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:35,530
I'm useful here.

547
01:43:37,542 --> 01:43:40,477
I help the people of Japan.

548
01:43:42,947 --> 01:43:46,041
I introduced astronomy.

549
01:43:47,085 --> 01:43:52,682
I got telescopes from
a Dutch ship's captain.

550
01:43:55,493 --> 01:44:00,556
I am of use here
in this country.

551
01:44:13,677 --> 01:44:18,239
Sawano, we didn't bring
Rodrigues here...

552
01:44:18,348 --> 01:44:20,908
...for long discussions.

553
01:44:21,085 --> 01:44:26,614
Give him the old
priest's message.

554
01:44:28,425 --> 01:44:36,799
They told me to urge you
to apostatize.

555
01:44:50,581 --> 01:44:54,347
Look at this.

556
01:45:00,623 --> 01:45:03,023
He was tied up.

557
01:45:03,126 --> 01:45:06,618
He was hung by the ankles.

558
01:45:06,729 --> 01:45:09,857
They cut holes behind his ears.

559
01:45:09,966 --> 01:45:15,927
His blood trickled out
and kept him alive.

560
01:45:16,105 --> 01:45:21,099
It was an idea of
Magistrate Inoue's.

561
01:46:02,918 --> 01:46:10,484
I preached in this nation
for twenty years.

562
01:46:12,394 --> 01:46:16,262
I know Japan better than you.

563
01:46:18,033 --> 01:46:24,165
Our religion does not
take root here.

564
01:46:34,282 --> 01:46:39,344
This country is a swamp.

565
01:46:41,555 --> 01:46:44,080
You will learn that.

566
01:46:45,726 --> 01:46:50,322
A swamp more terrible
than we considered.

567
01:46:52,700 --> 01:47:00,232
A swamp where any
seedling planted rots.

568
01:47:01,141 --> 01:47:09,105
The leaves wither
and the plant dies.

569
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:22,285
We sowed the seeds of
Christianity in it.

570
01:47:28,968 --> 01:47:34,099
That is not our God.

571
01:47:39,512 --> 01:47:45,212
It is not our God, but
their own gods...

572
01:47:45,852 --> 01:47:50,721
...that the people of this
country believe in.

573
01:47:52,325 --> 01:48:00,232
We didn't realize that
for a very long time.

574
01:48:02,268 --> 01:48:04,600
Maybe you know...

575
01:48:05,805 --> 01:48:11,038
The farmers worship
the Kannon as Mary.

576
01:48:13,813 --> 01:48:17,373
They love that pagan
figure more...

577
01:48:19,017 --> 01:48:21,781
...than the teachings of our Lord.

578
01:48:22,955 --> 01:48:28,484
Probably no one will
believe what I say.

579
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:36,564
Not only you, but no one
in all Christendom...

580
01:48:37,536 --> 01:48:43,304
Neither will our friends
in Macao and Rome.

581
01:48:52,551 --> 01:48:57,352
The saint never noticed the fact.

582
01:48:59,324 --> 01:49:02,885
He taught them about Zeus.

583
01:49:03,762 --> 01:49:09,631
The Japanese changed it
into their own sun god.

584
01:49:13,204 --> 01:49:20,235
They call it Dainichi,
and it became their god.

585
01:49:20,878 --> 01:49:27,647
They bend and change our
God into something else...

586
01:49:28,919 --> 01:49:30,978
Something quite different.

587
01:49:40,131 --> 01:49:41,723
That is all.

588
01:50:16,533 --> 01:50:19,991
Has anyone come to save you?

589
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:22,764
Jeers from all sides.

590
01:50:22,872 --> 01:50:25,670
No one needs you!

591
01:50:32,582 --> 01:50:36,484
Come on, just say you apostatize.

592
01:50:36,586 --> 01:50:38,520
And you'll never go back there.

593
01:50:40,924 --> 01:50:42,323
To the Magistrate's.

594
01:50:42,759 --> 01:50:45,352
I don't want you to suffer.

595
01:50:45,461 --> 01:50:47,691
Just apostatize!

596
01:51:12,588 --> 01:51:14,419
Get out of here!

597
01:51:14,523 --> 01:51:17,151
I'm a Christian.

598
01:51:17,259 --> 01:51:20,456
I'll beat you!

599
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:22,961
Who's there?

600
01:51:23,732 --> 01:51:25,131
A crazy one.

601
01:51:25,234 --> 01:51:28,294
He says he's a Christian.

602
01:51:28,637 --> 01:51:32,971
Padre, forgive me!

603
01:51:33,075 --> 01:51:37,841
I came to confess.
Please forgive me!

604
01:51:38,079 --> 01:51:39,376
Get out!

605
01:56:45,847 --> 01:56:49,874
Well, are you frightened?

606
01:56:50,051 --> 01:56:52,576
Stop being stubborn.

607
01:56:52,687 --> 01:56:54,587
Take the easy way.

608
01:57:02,063 --> 01:57:05,999
Sawano, he thinks
that's snoring.

609
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:10,560
You must tell him
what it really is.

610
01:57:13,107 --> 01:57:17,066
That is not snoring.

611
01:57:18,346 --> 01:57:22,749
It is the voices of
believers in the pit.

612
01:57:23,985 --> 01:57:26,851
You were brought up
immediately, but...

613
01:57:27,654 --> 01:57:32,557
...they've been there
for six hours already.

614
01:58:05,759 --> 01:58:09,320
Listen to me.

615
01:58:14,001 --> 01:58:20,405
Somewhere on that wall
I carved some letters.

616
01:58:22,675 --> 01:58:24,336
"LAUDATE EUM."

617
01:58:27,213 --> 01:58:32,879
It should be on the wall
to the right...

618
01:58:33,452 --> 01:58:36,012
Near the post...

619
01:58:38,157 --> 01:58:39,920
Try to touch it.

620
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:52,102
I heard the voices here
as you do now.

621
01:58:53,739 --> 01:58:59,371
I did not apostatize
because I was hung.

622
01:59:00,046 --> 01:59:07,349
I was hung upside down
in the pit for two days.

623
01:59:07,786 --> 01:59:16,660
But I did not speak
a word against God.

624
01:59:19,631 --> 01:59:28,039
I apostatized because
God had done nothing.

625
01:59:30,642 --> 01:59:34,669
I prayed desperately,
but He did nothing.

626
01:59:37,983 --> 01:59:39,848
He kept silent.

627
01:59:51,229 --> 01:59:53,789
Pray as you like.

628
01:59:56,533 --> 01:59:58,728
Those believers are
suffering terribly...

629
01:59:59,803 --> 02:00:04,035
Harder than you can
ever imagine.

630
02:00:05,309 --> 02:00:12,147
They hung all day yesterday.
Today, too.

631
02:00:14,151 --> 02:00:17,712
Why do they have to suffer?

632
02:00:18,188 --> 02:00:21,123
You can do nothing for them.

633
02:00:21,291 --> 02:00:23,691
God, either.

634
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:38,369
The night I was here,
five hung in that pit.

635
02:00:40,244 --> 02:00:48,343
Their voices came in
together with the wind.

636
02:00:51,888 --> 02:00:53,947
The official said...

637
02:00:55,425 --> 02:01:01,853
"If you apostatize,
they will be pulled out.

638
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:06,025
"They will get medical
treatment too."

639
02:03:16,095 --> 02:03:20,794
Sawano, is he ready
for the fumi-e?

640
02:04:23,495 --> 02:04:26,726
It's a mere formality.

641
02:05:28,326 --> 02:05:34,231
Christianity is a
forbidden heresy.

642
02:05:39,904 --> 02:05:45,637
Today three ships entered
Nagasaki Harbor.

643
02:05:45,742 --> 02:05:50,441
They were loaded with silks,

644
02:05:50,547 --> 02:05:55,610
other cloths and
two boxes of jars.

645
02:05:56,586 --> 02:06:04,493
We found these in the
cargo of one of them.

646
02:06:04,627 --> 02:06:08,028
Are these forbidden
Christian objects?

647
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:18,838
The Magistrate has ordered
you investigate these.

648
02:06:20,944 --> 02:06:25,881
This is not a Christian object.

649
02:06:28,084 --> 02:06:30,245
What do you think?

650
02:06:36,759 --> 02:06:40,559
I'm of the same opinion
as Mr. Sawano's.

651
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:47,462
The Christian chalice
looks different here.

652
02:06:48,303 --> 02:06:49,861
Are you sure?

653
02:06:51,807 --> 02:06:53,138
Yes, sir.

654
02:06:59,148 --> 02:07:04,017
Thanks for your advice.
You're dismissed.

655
02:09:24,023 --> 02:09:27,652
From this day forward,
Sebastian Rodrigues...

656
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:31,523
received the name
Sanemon Okada.
