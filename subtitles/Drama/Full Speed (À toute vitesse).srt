1
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,594
Hey, this area's restricted.

2
00:03:56,595 --> 00:04:00,973
Hi. Yeah, I know. They called me down here.
Some of this wiring got screwed up.

3
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,477
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

4
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,312
Yeah. Just a second.

5
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:11,692
There you are.

6
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,738
Nothing personal.

7
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,495
Well, I guess that wraps it up.
Good work, everybody.

8
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:27,666
Marty, I couldn't be happier
with the way this worked out.

9
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,505
Congratulations.

10
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,385
- Hold that.
- Whoa.

11
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,431
Gee, thanks.

12
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:55,027
Thanks for pushing that, Bob. The light's on,
but you never know, it might be broken.

13
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,821
Shut up.

14
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,838
Remember, honey...

15
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:56,255
Jesus. Bob, what button did you push?

16
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:47,389
Mr Bagwell, make sure these other elevators
remain locked down and empty.

17
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,311
There's no doors, no other way in or out,
except through access panels, correct?

18
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:57,524
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

19
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:02,988
Bomb's taken out cables. Bomber wants
$3 million or he blows the brakes.

20
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,699
- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour.

21
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,370
That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.

22
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:12,790
- Anything to keep this elevator from falling?
- The basement.

23
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,875
We'd like to avoid that, Traven.

24
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:18,379
- We can't unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator.

25
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,424
The only way in is through access panels.
The bomber's wired the hatch,

26
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:25,678
which seats him
in the "crazy but not stupid" section.

27
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,139
Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device.

28
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,102
- Yeah, right.
- Fine. The two of you check it out.

29
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:36,188
The nearest access panel's
on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

30
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,026
I want reports only. We're in a holding
pattern. Worthy, Briggs, secure the base area.

31
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,113
Everyone else,
I want you to affirm building evac. Move!

32
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,157
Looks like we're walkin'.

33
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,619
- Hurry, but watch your step!
- 29.

34
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,248
All the way down to the lobby! Let's go, folks!

35
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:55,708
30.

36
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,003
31.

37
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:02,631
32.

38
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:25,821
Hello?

39
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:30,784
- Come on! Get us outta here!
- Hello! Hello!

40
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,987
Help! Please, get us out of here!

41
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,406
Please!

42
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,724
Please! Get us out of here!

43
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:42,981
Who's up there?
Who's up there? What's going on?

44
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,442
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD.

45
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:47,903
- Thank God.
- What are you doing up there?

46
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:52,241
There's been
an elevator malfunction, so just relax.

47
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,953
Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?

48
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:59,915
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

49
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,084
Am I lying?

50
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:07,506
How come they sent cops here?
Shouldn't they send repair guys?

51
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:17,391
What do you think?

52
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,688
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

53
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,525
- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognise the work, but he's a pro.

54
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:31,029
- He's cutting it close.
- I don't like it.

55
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,949
Well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold.

56
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,921
All right, pop quiz.
The airport. Gunman with one hostage.

57
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:51,258
He's using her for cover.
He's almost to a plane.

58
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,886
You're 100 feet away.

59
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,226
Jack.

60
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,813
Shoot the hostage.

61
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:07,733
- What?
- Take her out of the equation.

62
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,987
Go for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear shot.

63
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:15,699
You're deeply nuts, you know that?
"Shoot the hostage. "

64
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,248
Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

65
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:28,170
- Why?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

66
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:30,923
Right now Mac outranks your gut, so we sit.

67
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:35,469
This is taking way too long.

68
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,888
How much d'you think that elevator weighs?

69
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,932
Jack, come on.

70
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:45,979
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

71
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,482
We're not gonna shoot 'em, right?

72
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,903
Hey, where you going?
What's going on?

73
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:58,325
Don't go! Don't leave us here!

74
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,968
No, we just take them out of the equation.

75
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,962
- Are you sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

76
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:55,382
Six minutes.

77
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,844
I can't get any more time. He's not talking!

78
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,096
I need the goddamn money now.

79
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:14,651
Tell me again, Harry. Why did I take this job?

80
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:18,947
Oh, come on. 30 more years of this, you get
a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

81
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,741
Cool.

82
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,242
Ho!

83
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:56,318
- God, it's hot in here.
- There's no air.

84
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,279
- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe.

85
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:06,995
Don't fuck with Daddy.

86
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,198
Usually they fall down now.

87
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,085
He's early. The son of a bitch is early!

88
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:17,441
Mac, we need more help up here now!

89
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,986
Oh, please! I don't wanna die!

90
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,320
Please save us!

91
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,705
Open the door!
Open the door, please!

92
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:39,671
- Please help me!
- We'll get you out!

93
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,134
- Give me your hands! It's OK.
- Pull me through.

94
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:54,978
Watch your head. Watch your head.

95
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:57,981
- OK, I've got you.
- Take it easy.

96
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:00,817
- You're fine. You're fine.
- Thank you.

97
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:02,611
- Take her.
- Who's next?

98
00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:06,865
Thank you.

99
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,660
We've got you, ma'am.

100
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:19,586
- What the hell is all this?
- Help us! Hurry!

101
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,134
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Go! Go!

102
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,552
Come on. Come on.

103
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:35,185
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

104
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:38,480
- Help me out! Please, help me out.
- Watch your head.

105
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,358
- Come on, lady!
- No.

106
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,069
Come on, lady! Come on! Grab my hand!

107
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:52,953
- Come on! Let's go! It's going to fall!
- No!

108
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,287
No, I can't!

109
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:57,833
Just take one step, reach out
and take my hand.

110
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,585
Come on! Come on!

111
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:07,801
- Oh, God! Don't let go of me!
- You're OK.

112
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:26,236
My shoe!

113
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:29,739
Was it good for you?

114
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,868
It was great for me.
How was it for you, honey?

115
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:35,996
- Elevator dropped.
- Good. That's good to know.

116
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,088
- Is your watch slow?
- No. He jumped the gun.

117
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,675
- We had three minutes left.
- Why does he do that?

118
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,594
He's losing his $3 million.

119
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:53,513
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad long enough.

120
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:57,934
It's a common problem among
middle-aged men. So I'm told.

121
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:07,986
- He's here.
- He could've blown that thing from Pacoima.

122
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:13,158
No. He knew we were up to something.
He's close by.

123
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,330
He's not gonna corner himself in a building
we evacuated anyway. Come on.

124
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,673
He'd... he'd wanna be here,
but he'd wanna stay mobile, right?

125
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,220
The elevators.

126
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:37,641
Passenger cars were stopped.
They checked 'em out.

127
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:40,101
What about the freight elevators?

128
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,504
- Will the mystery guest please sign in?
- What?

129
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:11,675
Jack!

130
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:13,760
Damn it.

131
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,219
Get to the side!

132
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,612
Shit! Shit! Shit!

133
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,034
Up! Get your ass up!

134
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:07,665
I don't suppose anybody'll give me
three million just for you.

135
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:14,047
Hold it!

136
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:20,303
Pop quiz, hotshot.
Terrorist holding a police hostage.

137
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:25,725
Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest to
blow a building in half. Now what do you do?

138
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:28,895
There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.

139
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,189
Standard flanking deployment, right?

140
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:38,404
Maybe we'll get off on the third floor, huh?
At least that's what they'll think.

141
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:42,659
I want location on those goddamn shots!
Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?

142
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,162
Lieutenant, we've got movement
on the freight elevator.

143
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:55,797
It's on three. Let's move!

144
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:02,846
End of the line. This day has been
real disappointing, I don't mind saying.

145
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:04,806
Because you didn't kill everyone?

146
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:08,810
There will come a time, boy,
when you'll wish you'd never met me.

147
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,937
Mister, I'm already there.

148
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:17,944
I'm in charge here. I drop this stick
and they pick your friend up with a sponge.

149
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:21,948
- Are you ready to die, friend?
- Fuck you.

150
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:26,452
In 200 years, we've come from "I regret
but I have one life to give for my country"

151
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:27,662
to "fuck you"?

152
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:30,915
- Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it.
- Shut up, Harry.

153
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,210
We've got all the balls
in the world right here, man.

154
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:37,130
Give it up. You got nowhere to go!

155
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:38,965
Shoot the hostage.

156
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,428
Say goodbye, Harry.

157
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,059
You fuck!

158
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:53,730
Freeze!

159
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,066
Freeze!

160
00:22:57,067 --> 00:23:00,028
Give it up! You're out of options!

161
00:23:23,594 --> 00:23:28,431
Through dedication and bravery,
these next two officers effected the rescue

162
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,517
of 13 citizens of this city.

163
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:36,314
And, thanks to them, the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb was his own.

164
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,816
You shot me. I can't believe it.

165
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,070
They're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little prick.

166
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:45,615
Harry, you told me to.

167
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:48,117
.. the Los Angeles Police Department.

168
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:51,996
Officer Harry Temple.

169
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:08,596
Officer Jack Traven.

170
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:29,450
Way to go, Jack. Way to go.

171
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,869
- There we go.
- Harry, my man.

172
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,999
Beautiful. A toast to me.
Make me feel good about myself.

173
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,835
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!

174
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:41,087
OK, so how we doing? Whoa, whoa.

175
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:44,132
Shit. I need a bib!

176
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:50,096
- Here we go. All right.
- You can't take me anywhere.

177
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:53,433
And here is to Harry,

178
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:56,561
for his quick thinking,

179
00:24:56,562 --> 00:25:01,065
for his grace under pressure
and for his brave and selfless act.

180
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,109
Hear! Hear!

181
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,157
And to Jack, for shooting Harry.

182
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:12,577
Something we've all wanted to do
for a very long time.

183
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,246
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

184
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,373
OK, no, no. Here it is.

185
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:22,587
Here's to you guys for doing your job
and for not getting dead.

186
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,881
Mazel tov.

187
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:36,726
We are the two luckiest guys in the world.

188
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:39,771
We got the bad guy
and we didn't lose any civilians.

189
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,106
- We're good.
- No. You were lucky.

190
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,985
No, we were lucky. You'd better understand it.

191
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:48,738
We were dealing with a total psycho.

192
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:51,866
This guy could've blown us up at any time.

193
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:55,745
And I got a bullet in me.

194
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:59,999
Six inches off the mark,
and they're giving the medal to my wife.

195
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,419
Harry, come on, man.
I mean, we won. We got him.

196
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,422
Do you listen? Do you ever?

197
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:11,594
Because I am not gonna be around
to back you up, so you better start thinking.

198
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:16,641
Guts'll get you so far,
and then they'll get you killed.

199
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,064
Luck runs out sooner or later. Right, Chief?

200
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,649
That's right.

201
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:27,402
Ho!

202
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:32,031
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm gonna go home, have some sex.

203
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:40,039
- Harry, you're gonna go home and puke.
- Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too.

204
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,417
Come on, you gimp.

205
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:08,651
- Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

206
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:11,112
- You looked fat.
- Take it easy on him, Bob.

207
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:14,490
- The boy was up late last night partying.
- Wild party, huh?

208
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:18,911
I don't remember that well.
Couldn't have been too great. Woke up alone.

209
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:24,834
Yeah? The last time I partied like that,
I woke up married, huh, Vinnie?

210
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:27,128
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffins.

211
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:30,423
- Have a good one, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack. Take care.

212
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,049
Thanks.

213
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:46,105
See you tomorrow.

214
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,585
Call 911!

215
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,934
What do you think, Jack?

216
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:09,981
You think if you pick up all the bus driver's
teeth, they'll give you another medal?

217
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,065
Jesus!

218
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,734
You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

219
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:20,324
Two years I spent setting up that elevator job.
Two years I invested myself in it.

220
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,536
You couldn't understand
the kind of commitment that I have.

221
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:26,872
You ruined a man's life's work
and you think you can walk away?

222
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:32,086
You got blinders on to the world,
but I got your attention now, didn't I, Jack?

223
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:36,882
- Why didn't you just come after me?
- This is about me. This is about my money.

224
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:40,928
This is about money due me,
which I will collect.

225
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,639
$3.7 million.

226
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,102
It's my nest egg, Jack.
At my age, you gotta think ahead.

227
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:50,813
- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hotshot.

228
00:29:50,814 --> 00:29:53,691
There's a bomb on a bus.

229
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:57,987
Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour,
the bomb is armed.

230
00:29:57,988 --> 00:30:02,575
If it drops below 50, it blows up.

231
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:05,369
What do you do? What do you do?

232
00:30:06,496 --> 00:30:11,334
- I'd wanna know what bus it was.
- You think I'm gonna tell you that?

233
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:13,669
- Yes.
- Very good.

234
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,173
There are rules, Jack,
and I want you to get this right.

235
00:30:17,174 --> 00:30:19,675
No one goes off the bus.

236
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:23,804
You try to take any passengers off the bus,
I will detonate it.

237
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:26,724
I want my money by 11 am.

238
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:32,146
- We can't pull that kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

239
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:37,860
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call. The radio's down.

240
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:43,783
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.
It's running downtown from Venice.

241
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:47,745
It is at the corner of Ocean Park and Main.

242
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:02,885
Sam!

243
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:05,471
Sam!

244
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,972
Annie.

245
00:31:06,973 --> 00:31:08,933
Sam! Tell him to stop!

246
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,061
Shit. Excuse me. Coming through! Sam!

247
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,149
- Sam!
- This ain't no bus stop.

248
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,443
- Come on.
- Get rid of your butt, Annie.

249
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,154
OK, it's gone, it's gone.

250
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:27,201
You are a good, kind man. One day
people are gonna write songs about you.

251
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:38,087
- Hi.
- Hi.

252
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:51,392
- First time in LA.
- Oh, no. I live here.

253
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:54,603
No, I mean mine. Oh, that's just funny.

254
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:57,648
- You heard me wrong. I'm sightseeing.
- Oh, really?

255
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:02,319
Yeah. I hate to use the word "tourist",
but it's not like I can hide it.

256
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,405
Not really.

257
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:12,997
Aw, jeez. You know, it took me three hours
just to get here from the airport. I got so lost.

258
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:17,334
LA is one large place. Course, you live here.
You probably don't notice.

259
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,921
I'm such a yokel. There. I said it.

260
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:24,383
You know what? I got gum on my seat.

261
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:26,469
Gum.

262
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,347
Excuse me.

263
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:32,975
- Morning.
- Hi.

264
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:39,291
I just couldn't handle the freeways any more.

265
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:41,460
I got so tense.

266
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:44,547
This way, I can just relax all the way to work.

267
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:48,342
Yeah, well, I love my car. I miss my car.

268
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,232
Oh, God. Look at that.

269
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,152
- Hey, Sam!
- Shit.

270
00:34:07,153 --> 00:34:09,071
- Sam!
- What?

271
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:13,826
- Why don't you just drive over these people?
- Don't spit on my bus, Annie.

272
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:16,078
Such a mess.

273
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,554
Stop!

274
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:43,022
- Open up!
- Get off the door. This ain't no bus stop.

275
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:46,191
- That guy really wants to get on the bus.
- Open up! Stop!

276
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:48,986
- Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!
- LAPD!

277
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:51,071
- I can't hear you!
- Stop this bus!

278
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:53,073
What?

279
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:56,118
LAPD! Stop the bus!

280
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,579
LAPD!

281
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,626
Stop! Stop!

282
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:08,422
- Stop! LAPD! Get out of the car.
- Jesus, not again.

283
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:12,468
This is my car. I own this car. It's not stolen.

284
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:14,887
- It is now. Move over.
- Fuck!

285
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:20,476
Man, you scratch this puppy, and me and you
are gonna have words, you understand?

286
00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:43,248
OK, look, man, we don't have to go so fast.
Just slow down a little bit.

287
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:47,586
Oh, shit. Come on, man.

288
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:50,631
Just... just don't tear up my car, all right?

289
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:55,344
OK, OK. Just slow down just a bit, all right?

290
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:59,098
We don't have to go so fast, do we?
We don't have to go so...

291
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,145
That was a nice move, man.

292
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:06,146
Whoo!

293
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:18,575
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

294
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,787
The least you could do is slow down.
Come on.

295
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:24,790
Oh, shit.

296
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,500
Oh, shit!

297
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:29,586
Move! Move!

298
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,758
Is that that guy?

299
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,219
Man sure has a hard-on for this bus.

300
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:55,738
Hey! I'm a cop!

301
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,781
What?

302
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,324
I'm a cop!

303
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:04,246
LAPD! There's a bomb on your bus!

304
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:06,915
- What?
- There's a bomb on your bus!

305
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:10,169
There's a... What? Fuck!

306
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,298
- There's a bomb on your bus!
- Watch the road!

307
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,717
Grab that. I want you to write on it.

308
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:19,636
I want you to write on the back:
"Bomb on bus. "

309
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:22,973
Write it, write it, write it!

310
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,491
Watch the road. Oh, shit.

311
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,214
Oh, shit!

312
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:56,757
No!

313
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:58,926
Don't slow down!

314
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,433
No! No, no, no, no, no!

315
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:09,103
Speed up!

316
00:38:09,104 --> 00:38:10,354
Op...

317
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,564
Open your door!

318
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:14,942
Open the doors!

319
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:20,489
50! Stay above 50!

320
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,783
All right?

321
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:30,332
470 8000. Ask for Detective Harry Temple.

322
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,045
Harry.

323
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,131
Harry, it's Jack.

324
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:43,887
You better not be calling in sick,
cos I dragged my ass...

325
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,807
- Harry, he's alive.
- What?

326
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:49,143
The bomber. He's back.

327
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:52,479
He hit one in Venice already.
?There's nothing left.

328
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,066
We got a ransom demand from your
dead terrorist. Says he's rigged a bus.

329
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,318
- Where's Jack?
- Where do you think?

330
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:01,405
- I gotta get on that bus.
- You gotta get...

331
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,657
Yeah, yeah. You get on the bus.

332
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:05,993
Drive straight!

333
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:08,871
Stay in this lane!

334
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:09,997
Watch the road.

335
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:16,336
Wait a minute. What are you doin'?

336
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,672
- Are you insured?
- Yeah! Why?

337
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:21,550
No! No!

338
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:27,931
You broke my... my door.

339
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:32,644
- Sir, I need to take your phone.
- Take the phone.

340
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:36,523
- Take the wheel.
- What are you... What?

341
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,860
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

342
00:39:45,658 --> 00:39:46,909
Drive straight.

343
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

344
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,173
Oh, shit!

345
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:06,720
Whoa! Shit!

346
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:22,110
This guy's out of his mind.

347
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:25,155
OK, listen, you gotta stay above 50.

348
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,324
OK, listen, you gotta stay above 50.

349
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:31,286
- Excuse me, are you out of your mind?
- Whatever it takes.

350
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:35,624
Everybody, I'm Jack Traven, LAPD.

351
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,961
We have a slight situation on the bus.
If you'll please sit down.

352
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:42,881
- You're scaring the shit out of these people.
- Ma'am, please!

353
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:50,555
If everybody will stay in your seats
and remain calm,

354
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:53,392
we should be able to defuse the problem...

355
00:40:53,393 --> 00:40:55,769
Get away from me!

356
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:04,027
I don't know you, man.
I'm not here for you. Let's not do this.

357
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,696
- Stop the bus!
- He can't.

358
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,907
Shut up! Stop the bus! Stop it!

359
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:10,993
Listen!

360
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:14,413
Look, I'm putting my gun away, OK?

361
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,834
OK?

362
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:25,549
Now, listen. I don't care about your crime.

363
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:31,930
Whatever you did, I'm sure that you're sorry,
so it's cool now. It's over.

364
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:39,479
And I'm not a cop right now.

365
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,402
See? We're just two cool guys,
just hanging out...

366
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,907
Sam!

367
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:58,999
I've got the wheel! I've got it!
Sam! Oh God, Sam!

368
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:08,675
You've gotta move your legs.
Can somebody move his legs?

369
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:14,264
Sam, get your foot...
Sam, get your foot off the pedal!

370
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:18,268
- I gotta stop this thing!
- No! Don't! Stay above 50!

371
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:24,149
- Sam's been shot! We gotta get him off!
- You slow down and this bus'll explode!

372
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,948
There is a bomb on this bus.

373
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,659
If we slow down, it'll blow.

374
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:40,248
If anyone tries to get off, it'll explode.

375
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:42,834
Bullshit! Yeah, there's a bomb.

376
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:46,088
- Some funny joke, man.
- Are we gonna have a problem now?

377
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:49,257
He's bleeding so much.
I don't know what to do.

378
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:54,805
Put pressure front and back, keep
his legs up and put this under his head.

379
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:57,808
- Hold on, man.
- Sam, lift your head.

380
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:01,478
- Can you handle this bus?
- Sure. It's like driving a really big Pinto.

381
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:07,067
- I need to know! Can you handle it?
- I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is.

382
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:09,945
- Is there a plan?
- For you to drive. We're OK for now.

383
00:43:09,946 --> 00:43:12,239
- Just keep us above 50.
- Good plan.

384
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,412
- So, you're a cop, right?
- That's right.

385
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:22,791
Well, I should probably tell you that
I had my driver's licence revoked.

386
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:26,169
- What for?
- Speeding.

387
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:34,136
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.
If anything changes, let us know.

388
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:37,013
Anything we haven't seen
should be in here.

389
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,506
.. wrong with the driver,
but at least one car, a Jaguar,

390
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:15,719
has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.

391
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,222
The bus came onto the freeway
at the Lincoln onramp.

392
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:23,143
It began picking up speed, swerving,
and hasn't slowed down since.

393
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:28,523
Minutes ago a police officer boarded the bus
by jumping onto it from a moving car.

394
00:44:28,524 --> 00:44:32,152
Would that be you, Jack?

395
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,321
- Where do we start?
- The speedometer.

396
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:38,950
Has it been fucked with or loosened?
See any wires or anything?

397
00:44:38,951 --> 00:44:40,952
Excuse me, ma'am.

398
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:43,121
No, it's clean.

399
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:46,708
Then it's gonna be under the bus.
Probably rigged to one of the axles.

400
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:50,086
I can't get under the bus right now.
It's kind of in motion.

401
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,422
Excuse me! Excuse me!

402
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,591
Hold on.

403
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:57,385
Access panel... in the floor.

404
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:00,597
Underneath you, man.

405
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:08,897
All right, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay.
Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see.

406
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:12,567
OK.

407
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:15,570
We got a wad! Pretty big!

408
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:18,198
- There's a pretty big wad.
- Brass fittings!

409
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,660
- Brass fittings.
- I think I can reach the circuit wire.

410
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:26,164
- He can reach the circuit wire.
- No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic.

411
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:28,250
- Classic decoy.
- What else?

412
00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:30,502
- What else?
- Hold on.

413
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:32,629
Hold on.

414
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,806
Fuck me!

415
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:46,393
Oh, darn.

416
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,191
Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing
to put a hole in the world.

417
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:56,278
OK, all right. Just stay calm. What else?

418
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:59,823
Three triggers - one on the axle
I can't really see, a cellular remote

419
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:03,660
and a timer running off a wristwatch.

420
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:06,162
- A watch? What kind of watch?
- Gold.

421
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,456
Gold band. Fairly cheesy.

422
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:10,834
Officer!

423
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:13,336
- Officer!
- What's on your mind, Harry?

424
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,381
Shit. What do I do? Officer!

425
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:17,841
- What do I do?
- Oh, shit.

426
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:20,594
- Which way? Which way?!
- Get on the shoulder.

427
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:21,720
OK.

428
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:35,775
Watch it!

429
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:46,995
Stay on or get off? Stay on or get off?

430
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:49,998
Off! Off! Hold on!

431
00:47:07,475 --> 00:47:09,142
Oh, God.

432
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:17,150
- Keep going.
- It's red!

433
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:19,694
Go! Go!

434
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:36,086
This is much better.

435
00:47:38,506 --> 00:47:43,468
.. city streets. The bus is on Western,
heading in a southbound direction.

436
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:47,722
Now, where the bus did exit here,
it had a couple of close calls.

437
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:50,433
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

438
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,687
We don't know what authorities plan to do.

439
00:48:02,697 --> 00:48:05,240
I don't get it.

440
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:08,952
The watch is a shitty timer.
Why use it? What's he saying?

441
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:12,330
- Lots of people have watches, Harry.
- This guy has no MO.

442
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:16,251
A bomber falls in love with one kind
of bomb and they're very monogamous.

443
00:48:16,252 --> 00:48:21,673
This guy uses C4, dynamite, different trigger
every time, and now he throws in this watch.

444
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:24,676
He's an encyclopaedia of bombs.
He knows every kind.

445
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:27,804
Yeah, and everything we do to dismantle it.

446
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:32,016
Wait a minute.

447
00:48:33,018 --> 00:48:35,854
I wanna look at the files for the last 10 years.

448
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:41,025
- We did the mug shots. It's not gonna help.
- No. I wanna look at cops.

449
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:43,069
Come on. Let's go.

450
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:52,162
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

451
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:55,081
I had to bail on the freeway.
We're in the city.

452
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:58,376
I can see you. Just keep going straight.

453
00:48:58,377 --> 00:49:02,255
I'm gonna try to clear the roads for you.
Just stay on line.

454
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,386
Shit! Oh, Jesus! God! No!

455
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:09,471
Go left!

456
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,475
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God!

457
00:49:21,817 --> 00:49:22,984
Oh, jeez!

458
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:28,907
People, stay out of my way!
Stay out of my way!

459
00:49:28,908 --> 00:49:32,744
- Ma'am, up to the right.
- OK, OK, OK. I see it, I see it.

460
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:42,796
Mac! Mac, you've gotta get me outta here!

461
00:49:45,966 --> 00:49:50,303
A few more blocks,
you're gonna come up to a soft turn. Right.

462
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:53,556
Then hold straight. I've got
some units waiting for you there.

463
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:58,645
They're gonna lead you to the 105 freeway.
It's not in use. It'll be empty.

464
00:49:58,646 --> 00:50:01,397
- You'll be totally clear.
- Got it.

465
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,613
In a few blocks,
we take the soft turn to the right.

466
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,286
OK. Wait a minute. Escort to where?
Where do we get an escort to?

467
00:50:15,287 --> 00:50:17,330
Look out!

468
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,542
Oh, God!

469
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:27,757
Son of a bitch!

470
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,301
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

471
00:50:32,137 --> 00:50:36,099
- Oh, God! I just hit the baby!
- Cans!

472
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,228
- There was no baby. It was full of cans.
- Are you sure?

473
00:51:00,332 --> 00:51:02,208
Oh, jeez. No! No! No!

474
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:14,637
- Why aren't they at school?
- Mac, we're boned.

475
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,472
I'll get you out, Jack.

476
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:29,235
All right, listen.
You got an entrance coming up, Jack.

477
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:32,071
It's gonna be a real ugly turn, though.

478
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:34,699
- How ugly?
- What's ugly?

479
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,912
We got a hard right coming up
at the construction site.

480
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:41,831
- This should be it.
- That is a dead end.

481
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:46,336
- I can't make that turn.
- You can make it. Keep left. Make it wide.

482
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,714
Oh, God. We're gonna tip over.
We're gonna tip over.

483
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:53,676
You're right. We're gonna tip over.
Everyone on this side of the bus now!

484
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,596
On this side of the bus!
As far as you can, please.

485
00:51:56,597 --> 00:51:58,806
Hold on!

486
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:04,062
Over here. Over here. As far as you can! Now!
Mac, you better clear this site out.

487
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:13,738
- Everybody hold on!
- This side of the bus!

488
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:15,907
Hold on!

489
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,663
Hold on! Oh, God! Here we go! Here we go!

490
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:26,376
Here we go!

491
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:41,307
Whoo!

492
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:44,310
Oh, my God! Oh, God! Is everybody all right?

493
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:46,604
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.

494
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:49,273
Take me to that interchange at the 105.

495
00:52:59,827 --> 00:53:04,163
Oh, my God. We might've died. I can't think.

496
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:07,792
It's OK. If you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.

497
00:53:26,395 --> 00:53:30,690
Frank, get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.

498
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:34,777
Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.
No obstructions in the freeway.

499
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:38,364
We have a window here.
I wanna make sure it stays open.

500
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:00,636
Shoot.

501
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:05,600
Could you do me a favour
and hold the wheel for me for a second?

502
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:08,102
Hold the wheel? Thank you.

503
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:14,358
Ma'am, you did very well. Actually, you were
incredible. I've never seen driving like that.

504
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:16,152
- Annie.
- What?

505
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,571
It's my name. Annie.

506
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:21,824
- Annie.
- As opposed to "ma'am".

507
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,409
OK.

508
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:30,416
So, why is all this happening?

509
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:35,171
I mean, what did we do?
Bomb the guy's country or something?

510
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:37,882
No. It's just a guy who wants money.

511
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:42,637
I don't buy that.
It's not a very good way to make money.

512
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:47,517
So, um... what is this guy's deal?

513
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:52,146
A while back,
he held some people for ransom.

514
00:54:52,147 --> 00:54:55,399
It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.

515
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,612
- What does that have to do with us?
- Nothing. It's a game.

516
00:54:59,613 --> 00:55:03,241
If he gets the money, he wins.
If the bus blows up, he wins.

517
00:55:03,242 --> 00:55:05,993
- What if you win?
- Tomorrow we'll play another one.

518
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:09,080
But I'm not available
to drive tomorrow. Busy.

519
00:55:13,252 --> 00:55:15,753
We got no match for that description.

520
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:18,548
No one's lost a thumb
for at least the last 10 years.

521
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:21,926
- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.

522
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:25,221
Forget the files.
Start going through the pension fund.

523
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:29,142
This guy's drawing disability. He may not
be LAPD, but he's living here now.

524
00:55:29,143 --> 00:55:32,395
I want pictures! I've seen this asshole.

525
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:51,289
- Hey! Let's get these passengers off the bus!
- We can't do it, sir!

526
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:55,334
There's no time for any stunts.
We gotta get these people out of harm's way.

527
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:58,671
I got orders. We move these people, he'll see.

528
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:03,634
Remember: crazy, not stupid.

529
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:08,139
Harry's trying to find out who this guy is.
We think maybe he's a cop.

530
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,892
Lieutenant, it's him.

531
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:14,395
- He wants to talk to Jack.
- He's on the line for you.

532
00:56:14,396 --> 00:56:18,316
- OK, give him the number.
- Give him the number.

533
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:23,487
- How's he doing?
- The bleeding is less, but...

534
00:56:23,488 --> 00:56:27,241
- Are they going to help us?
- Sure they are. They're the police.

535
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:31,996
Hey, your taxes are paying their salary.
If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.

536
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,500
I mean, you know.

537
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,047
Yeah.

538
00:56:41,048 --> 00:56:46,886
I think we have trust, but it looks on TV
like you're trying to get those passengers off.

539
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:50,389
- Look, you've gotta let me have one.
- We went over the rules.

540
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:54,435
As an act of faith. We have
an injured man here. The driver's been shot.

541
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:57,230
Tell me you haven't
been shooting the passengers.

542
00:56:57,231 --> 00:57:02,318
I thought it was customary
for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.

543
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,239
- This man has no time.
- No one gets off.

544
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,452
It'll grease the wheels with the money men.
There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.

545
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,706
OK, son, you can try and unload the driver.

546
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:20,127
You tell that wildcat behind the wheel
not to slow down, though,

547
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:24,715
or he won't even get a chance
to bleed to death. And, Jack, don't slip.

548
00:57:26,134 --> 00:57:30,471
- He's letting us unload the driver.
- Norwood! Get us closer!

549
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,267
- We're gonna get the driver off.
- Just him?

550
00:57:34,268 --> 00:57:36,602
- For now. Gigantor.
- Ortiz.

551
00:57:36,603 --> 00:57:40,648
Ortiz, we're gonna need your help.
I need you to pass him to me.

552
00:57:40,649 --> 00:57:43,150
Keep him straight, or the wound'll tear.

553
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:46,862
- What about the rest of us?
- Hey, hey, hey! Lady!

554
00:57:48,615 --> 00:57:50,700
I can't stay!

555
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,954
- How are you feeling?
- Like I've been shot.

556
00:57:54,955 --> 00:57:57,039
- Take care, Sam.
- OK, Annie.

557
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,584
Drive straight!

558
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:07,758
- Get as close as you can, OK?
- All right.

559
00:58:07,759 --> 00:58:11,262
Closer. A little closer, Annie.

560
00:58:12,973 --> 00:58:15,057
- Annie, a little closer.
- OK.

561
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:19,770
OK, how's this?

562
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,691
Sorry. Sorry.

563
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:27,236
OK, Annie. No problem.
Let's try it one more time.

564
00:58:28,322 --> 00:58:29,947
A little more!

565
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:33,075
OK! OK! Right there! Steady! Hold it steady!

566
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:36,912
You got him? You got him?

567
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:43,794
All right.

568
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:46,339
I'm all right. Thanks.

569
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,758
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

570
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,686
He's gonna be OK.

571
00:59:03,523 --> 00:59:05,900
Come on! Come on, lady. Give me your hand.

572
00:59:05,901 --> 00:59:08,736
- I have to, Annie.
- No, Helen!

573
00:59:08,737 --> 00:59:11,030
- No, Helen, no!
- Come on!

574
00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:12,198
Helen, no! No!

575
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:17,661
I'm here at the 105 Freeway, where the police
have successfully led the runaway bus...

576
00:59:20,374 --> 00:59:21,832
No, Helen!

577
00:59:37,224 --> 00:59:40,643
Goddamn it, Mac!
Get those fucking choppers outta here!

578
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:44,021
.. was driving the bus.
Well, I couldn't tell how old...

579
00:59:44,022 --> 00:59:46,982
An explosion. Some kind of an explosion.

580
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,194
The bus hasn't exploded, but... Oh, my God.

581
00:59:50,195 --> 00:59:54,698
A woman caught in the blast fell. She was
pulled under the wheels. This is terrible.

582
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:58,953
Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future, huh?

583
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,810
I can't be here.

584
01:00:24,396 --> 01:00:27,022
I can't, you know...

585
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,608
This is the wrong bus.

586
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:31,652
I mean, for me to...

587
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:35,531
I can't die here.

588
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,616
Hey, shut up, man.

589
01:00:38,827 --> 01:00:41,287
- I got a wife.
- Oh, you do?

590
01:00:41,288 --> 01:00:45,958
Hey! So if you have a wife and I don't,
does that mean I'm expendable?

591
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:48,335
What are you talking about, man?

592
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:50,629
The guy's just talking crazy.

593
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,674
He gets on my nerves.
He gets on everybody's nerves.

594
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:59,346
- I think I have the right to be a little upset.
- What are you staring at, anyway?

595
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:02,266
Why don't you let us all die in peace,
if it has to happen?

596
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:07,229
Oh, so you're a really tough guy, huh?
Why don't we just step outside?

597
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,315
Hey!

598
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:25,789
How are you doing? You all right?

599
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,792
What can I do?

600
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,047
When that bomb went off...

601
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:35,049
I know.

602
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:39,929
I thought that was it.
I thought that was the bomb, and I was dead.

603
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:44,350
And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

604
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:46,852
You were glad you were still alive.

605
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:51,774
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

606
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:54,276
You should be glad. We all are.

607
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,573
- It doesn't mean you don't care.
- I know, but she was so scared.

608
01:01:59,574 --> 01:02:02,910
?She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed,

609
01:02:02,911 --> 01:02:06,038
but if she'd gotten off,
it would have killed us all.

610
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:10,626
He's the asshole, Annie. The guy
who put us here. Remember that, OK?

611
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:14,129
Big asshole.

612
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,215
OK.

613
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:20,844
Are you sure?

614
01:02:20,845 --> 01:02:22,930
Well, how far?

615
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:28,018
Sir, we have a serious problem.

616
01:02:29,437 --> 01:02:30,646
What?

617
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:34,817
- This freeway isn't finished.
- What are you talking about?

618
01:02:34,818 --> 01:02:40,322
The aerial unit caught it. About three miles
ahead there's a section missing.

619
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,366
A section missing?

620
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:51,375
But it's on the map.
It's finished on the goddamn map!

621
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:53,460
I guess they fell behind.

622
01:02:54,963 --> 01:02:58,507
Fuck! You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!

623
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,219
Get me closer!

624
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,806
Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror.

625
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:07,933
Jack!

626
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,814
- How big is the section?
- 50 feet... at least.

627
01:03:19,154 --> 01:03:22,948
There's a gap in the road up ahead. It's big.

628
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:26,994
- You're kidding. How big?
- 50 feet.

629
01:03:26,995 --> 01:03:28,537
What?

630
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,040
We gotta get these people
off the bus somehow.

631
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:34,209
You know I can't.

632
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,712
What did he say? Jack?

633
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:40,466
Jack, what did he say?

634
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:44,303
What's the matter?

635
01:03:49,309 --> 01:03:53,354
- There's a gap in the freeway.
- What?

636
01:03:53,355 --> 01:03:56,357
- What do you mean?
- How big is a gap?

637
01:03:56,358 --> 01:03:59,568
50 feet. A couple of miles ahead.

638
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,654
This is crazy.

639
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:08,661
- Jeez.
- Jack.

640
01:04:08,662 --> 01:04:12,539
Jack. What if I shift into neutral
and just keep the engine revving?

641
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:17,002
- No, he'd have thought of that.
- What, then? What? What?

642
01:04:17,003 --> 01:04:19,672
What? Jack?

643
01:04:19,673 --> 01:04:21,340
- Floor it.
- What?

644
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:24,718
Floor it. It's an interchange.
There might be an incline.

645
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:26,470
Fine.

646
01:04:29,307 --> 01:04:33,143
Everybody hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.

647
01:04:33,144 --> 01:04:36,313
When we hit the gap, heads down.

648
01:04:36,314 --> 01:04:38,732
That's it? That's it?

649
01:04:38,733 --> 01:04:43,904
That's all we can do. Let's put these
underneath your seat, all right?

650
01:04:43,905 --> 01:04:46,407
Put your bags underneath the seat.

651
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:54,581
- Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy.
- Hold on.

652
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,669
Is this really gonna work?

653
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,003
Jack.

654
01:05:02,173 --> 01:05:04,508
Yeah?

655
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:06,593
Jack.

656
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:30,451
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

657
01:05:30,452 --> 01:05:32,745
- Come on!
- Oh, God.

658
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:43,172
Oh, shit.

659
01:05:56,603 --> 01:05:59,313
Everybody hold on!

660
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:18,582
Oh, God. Jack.

661
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,965
Shit!

662
01:06:48,363 --> 01:06:52,741
Yes! We are way out of control!

663
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:01,625
- You OK?
- Yeah.

664
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,335
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

665
01:07:03,336 --> 01:07:06,672
All right! Norwood, let's go!

666
01:07:06,673 --> 01:07:09,466
- Is everybody OK?
- Yes!

667
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,763
We did it!

668
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,057
We made it.

669
01:07:17,058 --> 01:07:20,352
You're the man. You are the man!

670
01:07:20,353 --> 01:07:22,479
Thank you. Thank you very much.

671
01:07:24,482 --> 01:07:26,066
Oh, shit.

672
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:30,237
- I think you missed your calling.
- Yeah? What was it?

673
01:07:30,238 --> 01:07:33,031
Watch the road.
You should have been a pilot.

674
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:34,074
Ow.

675
01:07:41,124 --> 01:07:42,499
- Get off.
- What?

676
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,585
Get off this. Now. Get off this.

677
01:07:50,758 --> 01:07:52,509
In there.

678
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,511
- Where? Right here?
- Yeah.

679
01:07:54,512 --> 01:07:55,929
- Right here?
- Yeah.

680
01:08:00,268 --> 01:08:01,768
Hey! Hey! Hey, stop!

681
01:08:11,946 --> 01:08:15,657
- He's just entered the airport.
- There's thousands of people there.

682
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:19,077
That's my boy Jack. He can circle
the runways and buy us some time.

683
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:23,999
- Choppers can't fly there. It's restricted.
- He's headed for the end of the field.

684
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,295
- Bravo Tango, an emergency runway.
- Let's hope it's built. Let's move!

685
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:44,186
We're at the airport.

686
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:46,271
Yeah? So?

687
01:08:47,273 --> 01:08:49,399
I already seen the airport.

688
01:09:10,421 --> 01:09:14,299
- Yeah?
- Very, very exciting, Jack.

689
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,679
Some close calls, huh?
But you've done all right for yourself.

690
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,974
- What do you want?
- I want money, Jack.

691
01:09:21,975 --> 01:09:28,230
I wish I had some loftier purpose, but
I'm afraid in the end it's just the money, Jack.

692
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:35,445
I would like large non-sequential bills
in two clear plastic bags, unmarked.

693
01:09:35,446 --> 01:09:39,366
- Can you remember all that?
- What are you telling me for?

694
01:09:39,367 --> 01:09:42,703
Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.

695
01:09:42,704 --> 01:09:46,623
I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you
like they're your best friend

696
01:09:46,624 --> 01:09:48,792
and they don't even know you.

697
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:53,338
Why are they messing with me, huh?
Do they think I'm doing this for fun?

698
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:56,800
- Aren't you?
- Oh, that's unfair, Jack.

699
01:09:56,801 --> 01:10:01,304
You don't know how I feel about this.
You don't even know me.

700
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:03,807
You want a shitload of money
you didn't earn.

701
01:10:03,808 --> 01:10:06,101
Oh, I earned it.

702
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:08,437
I spent my life earning it.

703
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:14,109
I got a medal, too, Jack, a medal and
a pink slip and a "sorry about your hand".

704
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,404
- You have to let me off.
- Oh, no.

705
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:20,365
- That's not good.
- You want me to help you?

706
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:24,161
I need to talk to these people face to face.
They think you're bullshit.

707
01:10:24,162 --> 01:10:26,371
They don't think that.

708
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:31,168
Look, you want the money, I don't want
anyone else to die. Let me get on the ground.

709
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:34,337
Just me. That's not against the rules.

710
01:10:34,338 --> 01:10:36,423
All right. I want you back real fast.

711
01:10:37,759 --> 01:10:39,217
Fine.

712
01:10:39,218 --> 01:10:43,096
Jack, nothing tricky now.
You know that I'm on top of you.

713
01:10:43,097 --> 01:10:46,016
Do not attempt to grow a brain.

714
01:10:55,276 --> 01:10:59,112
- So I guess there's a plan now?
- Could be.

715
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:01,364
- Yeah?
- He's letting me off.

716
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:04,618
- What?
- Just keep circling. You'll be fine.

717
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:10,248
- Sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.
- Do you think that's a good idea?

718
01:11:10,249 --> 01:11:13,043
- It'll be OK.
- Are you just gonna leave us here?

719
01:11:13,044 --> 01:11:16,379
- I would.
- Don't worry. I won't go far.

720
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,883
Hey. Don't forget about us.

721
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,901
The choppers are gone.
Let's dump the passengers.

722
01:11:37,902 --> 01:11:40,403
- He's ready for that.
- How is that possible?

723
01:11:40,404 --> 01:11:44,658
I don't know how. I just know he is.
He's been a step ahead every time.

724
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:47,994
- If we unload, he'll take them out.
- So where does that put us?

725
01:11:47,995 --> 01:11:50,205
I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

726
01:11:50,748 --> 01:11:53,458
After an incredible ride on the 10 freeway,

727
01:11:53,459 --> 01:11:56,128
the streets of Los Angeles
and the 105 freeway,

728
01:11:56,129 --> 01:12:01,716
this bus has ended up here at Los Angeles
International Airport, circling the runway.

729
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:16,273
I'm telling you, he's somewhere jerking off.

730
01:12:16,274 --> 01:12:20,152
He didn't have to get
on the bus in the first place, Ortiz.

731
01:12:20,153 --> 01:12:22,362
Get your ass behind the yellow line.

732
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:28,285
What is that?

733
01:12:31,622 --> 01:12:33,707
I have no idea.

734
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:39,671
We won't be able to hold this steady for long.

735
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:44,217
I just need a few minutes.
If I can't do it by then, I can't do it at all.

736
01:12:44,218 --> 01:12:47,554
- Harry, you with me?
- Yeah. You be careful, Jack.

737
01:12:52,185 --> 01:12:56,021
What's he doing? Oh, my God. He is insane.

738
01:13:02,028 --> 01:13:05,864
OK, Jack, this is it. Don't get dead.

739
01:13:20,171 --> 01:13:22,964
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

740
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:23,924
Oh, Christ.

741
01:13:34,393 --> 01:13:36,603
Just keep it steady.

742
01:13:36,604 --> 01:13:39,105
Thank you for the tip, Ortiz.

743
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,954
This guy is nuts!

744
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:57,249
We'll try to bypass the remote current
with the battery.

745
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:01,962
- Can you find the tripwire for the remote?
- I don't know. I got a few choices here.

746
01:14:01,963 --> 01:14:04,798
- Black and red?
- And green.

747
01:14:04,799 --> 01:14:09,261
OK, I'm gonna guess he's not gonna go
with standard copper for the remote.

748
01:14:09,262 --> 01:14:11,721
That'd be too weak. I'd use a fibre alloy.

749
01:14:11,722 --> 01:14:14,849
Jack, I'm gonna need you to look at the wire.

750
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,520
Harry, it's covered.

751
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:22,983
I know. You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

752
01:14:22,984 --> 01:14:25,026
Right.

753
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,124
Fuck me!

754
01:14:40,459 --> 01:14:42,544
Shit!

755
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:49,009
- Bull's-eye!
- Great.

756
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:52,679
OK. I want you to clip on the battery
and then run it to the lead wire.

757
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,680
Copy.

758
01:15:10,948 --> 01:15:13,033
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

759
01:15:13,034 --> 01:15:15,493
Oh, shit! It's a collapsible circuit.

760
01:15:16,996 --> 01:15:22,876
Howard Payne, Atlanta PD Bomb Squad.
Retired in Sun Valley in 1989

761
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:26,338
when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine.

762
01:15:26,339 --> 01:15:29,841
That's our scumbag!
We got him. Jack, we found him.

763
01:15:29,842 --> 01:15:33,720
- We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.
- Jack, get out of there.

764
01:15:33,721 --> 01:15:36,348
- We're going after the source.
- Watch your back.

765
01:15:38,351 --> 01:15:39,351
Wait for me!

766
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,604
Mac, get me outta here.

767
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:58,828
Somebody go to the back and check
and see if he came out the back. Go!

768
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,801
- Can you see him?
- He's not behind us.

769
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:15,011
- What?
- He's not back here.

770
01:16:15,012 --> 01:16:16,513
Oh, my God. Go look!

771
01:16:16,514 --> 01:16:20,850
Lay down and look under the bus
and see if you can see him down there.

772
01:16:22,103 --> 01:16:23,770
- Can you see him?
- No.

773
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:26,773
You don't see him
back by the tyre or something?

774
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:29,067
- I can't see him.
- Are you sure?

775
01:16:29,068 --> 01:16:30,485
I can't see him.

776
01:16:52,883 --> 01:16:56,678
Oh, my God! We hit him!
Oh, my God! Do you see him?

777
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:59,597
- Did we hit him?
- Look out the sides.

778
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:10,108
- My tools!
- Will somebody get him his tools?!

779
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:25,290
Please help him! Hurry!

780
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:28,793
God, we're dragging him. Do you see him?

781
01:17:28,794 --> 01:17:31,004
Where is he? Is he there?

782
01:17:32,673 --> 01:17:36,843
- Do you see him?
- Jack! Jack!

783
01:17:36,844 --> 01:17:38,887
- I see him!
- What?

784
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:41,347
- I see him!
- You do? Is he OK?

785
01:17:41,348 --> 01:17:45,059
He's all right! He's all right!

786
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,521
Hold my legs. Hold my legs.
Somebody hold my legs.

787
01:17:48,522 --> 01:17:50,982
Hold his legs.

788
01:17:50,983 --> 01:17:53,151
- Hold his legs!
- Come on!

789
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,280
Come on! I got ya!

790
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:06,372
- Is he hurt? Is he OK?
- Pull! Pull!

791
01:18:06,373 --> 01:18:08,541
Come on! Come on!

792
01:18:08,542 --> 01:18:10,919
We got him now. Come on, pull!

793
01:18:12,046 --> 01:18:14,005
Jesus. I can't believe it.

794
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,260
You are a complete jerk. You know that?

795
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:24,766
- Did you have any luck with the bomb?
- Yeah. It didn't go off.

796
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:27,602
Ortiz, thanks.

797
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:31,272
How many lives you got, man?

798
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:36,778
You're not too bright, man,
but you got some big, round, hairy cojones.

799
01:18:38,405 --> 01:18:41,908
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

800
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:45,787
Can't even pay him a compliment.

801
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:50,208
- How you doing?
- You scared the shit out of me, Jack!

802
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:52,544
Other than that, I'm fine.

803
01:18:52,545 --> 01:18:56,214
- What is that smell?
- It's gas.

804
01:18:56,215 --> 01:18:58,633
- We're leaking gas?
- We are now.

805
01:19:03,013 --> 01:19:05,932
You felt you needed
another challenge or something?

806
01:19:05,933 --> 01:19:08,935
- Mac.
- Mac here. Go ahead.

807
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:11,688
Can you get a fuel truck to pace us?
We're losing gas.

808
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:17,318
- I'll see what I can find. How much time?
- 10 minutes? It doesn't look good.

809
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:21,489
Gotcha. Norwood, get a fuel car
out here on the double.

810
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,367
Is that gonna work?

811
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:26,869
I don't know.

812
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,416
Harry, save my life.

813
01:21:04,802 --> 01:21:07,637
Harry, tell me good news, man.

814
01:21:07,638 --> 01:21:10,473
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make it.

815
01:21:12,851 --> 01:21:14,477
You fuck!

816
01:21:16,313 --> 01:21:20,650
It was the watch that led him
to me, wasn't it? Huh?

817
01:21:20,651 --> 01:21:25,238
It seemed a little hammy to me to build
the bomb out of my precious retirement gift,

818
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:30,952
but, you know, I figured a sign that said
"Howard Payne" would be pushing it.

819
01:21:33,163 --> 01:21:36,457
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine out,
I swear to God.

820
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,460
You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

821
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,631
Jack, we both know that he was the brains
of your particular operation.

822
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:46,592
You can't beat me.
You're gonna pay me every dollar.

823
01:21:46,593 --> 01:21:51,389
Otherwise, you, the wildcat
and every innocent person on that bus

824
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:54,308
are gonna end up just like your friend.

825
01:21:55,185 --> 01:21:59,147
Are you paying attention?
Jack, are you listening to me?

826
01:22:00,607 --> 01:22:03,651
- Jack? Jack?
- Yeah.

827
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:08,614
Good. You tell them that
the drop point is Pershing Square.

828
01:22:10,075 --> 01:22:13,202
There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner.

829
01:22:13,203 --> 01:22:15,830
You drop the bags and leave.

830
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:18,708
I don't show until all your people are gone.

831
01:22:19,626 --> 01:22:27,133
It's getting on to 11 am, Jack, and I think
it's gonna be a very pretty day.

832
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:40,646
Jack.

833
01:22:40,647 --> 01:22:45,318
Come on. Don't give up on me, Jack!
Jack, stop it! Jack, come on!

834
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:48,529
Stop it, OK? Don't give up
on me right now, all right?

835
01:22:51,158 --> 01:22:56,579
We're really scared and we need you
right now. I can't do this by myself. Please?

836
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,664
Jack, please.

837
01:23:03,003 --> 01:23:06,088
OK? Please. All right?

838
01:23:12,054 --> 01:23:15,640
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not. We got this far, OK?

839
01:23:38,288 --> 01:23:40,373
I'll be damned.

840
01:23:44,127 --> 01:23:47,672
Did you go to the University of Arizona?

841
01:23:47,673 --> 01:23:50,007
- Yeah? So?
- Good football team.

842
01:23:51,009 --> 01:23:53,886
Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know.

843
01:23:53,887 --> 01:23:55,721
Arizona Wildcats.

844
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,393
- Right.
- He can see you.

845
01:24:00,394 --> 01:24:04,397
- What?
- He can see you.

846
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:07,275
Just keep looking straight ahead.

847
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:27,003
He called you a wildcat before.
Bastard's got a camera right in your face.

848
01:24:27,004 --> 01:24:30,298
He can see the whole bus.
He's been playing me from minute one.

849
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:34,719
- Well, he can see me, but can he hear me?
- Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.

850
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:40,141
We are following the progress
of what is turning out to be a harrowing story,

851
01:24:40,142 --> 01:24:43,227
as a city bus,
rigged to explode if it slows down,

852
01:24:43,228 --> 01:24:46,564
races around literally in circles
at the Los Angeles airport.

853
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:51,527
The dead are a female passenger and a driver
of another bus, both blown up by the bomber.

854
01:24:51,528 --> 01:24:57,366
Others in jeopardy are the passengers of the
bus, held hostage at the whim of a madman.

855
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:02,246
"The whim of a madman. "

856
01:25:02,247 --> 01:25:04,415
I like that.

857
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:07,835
There's a camera on the bus
just over my left shoulder.

858
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,922
I want you to stare straight ahead.

859
01:25:10,923 --> 01:25:14,383
Don't make any big movements, OK?

860
01:25:15,928 --> 01:25:17,887
It's Jack.

861
01:25:17,888 --> 01:25:19,931
Yeah, I know about Harry.

862
01:25:22,476 --> 01:25:24,810
Is that news van still around?

863
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:27,730
- Get those cameras to stop taping.
- Right.

864
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:32,234
LAPD. I need this unit.
You can broadcast UHF, right?

865
01:25:32,235 --> 01:25:35,780
There's a signal going to that bus.
I want you to find it.

866
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:38,783
We're gonna have to
take you off the air.

867
01:25:38,784 --> 01:25:41,118
Please, sir, stop taping.

868
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:44,413
Come on, hurry up. Good! Tape off of that.

869
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,587
Remember, no big movements.
Just look whipped.

870
01:25:51,588 --> 01:25:54,298
That ain't gonna be too hard.

871
01:26:05,686 --> 01:26:08,562
- Tape it. Good. Come on, tape it.
- It's taping!

872
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,491
- Jack.
- Yeah?

873
01:26:20,492 --> 01:26:22,576
Look.

874
01:26:26,081 --> 01:26:29,500
- Mac, fuel.
- Jack, five minutes.

875
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:32,378
Not enough time. Run the tape.
We have to unload.

876
01:26:32,379 --> 01:26:35,131
- I only have a minute of tape.
- Do it now.

877
01:26:35,132 --> 01:26:38,968
I want you to make a tape and loop it
so that it runs over and over, OK?

878
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:46,684
- All right, run it. Run it!
- All right. Tape's rolling.

879
01:26:46,685 --> 01:26:51,981
We still have no live picture, but reports
are that the bus continues to circle...

880
01:26:53,734 --> 01:26:57,153
Everyone is safe for the moment.

881
01:26:57,154 --> 01:27:00,990
Hard to imagine what's going
through their thoughts at this time.

882
01:27:00,991 --> 01:27:03,284
Certainly, a sense of community...

883
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,930
Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.

884
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:30,186
All right, let's get 'em off.

885
01:27:30,187 --> 01:27:32,188
OK, you, you, and you.

886
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:38,611
Police have just issued a general
statement, which doesn't tell us much more...

887
01:27:38,612 --> 01:27:42,156
Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.

888
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:44,658
Come on. Look straight ahead.

889
01:28:03,595 --> 01:28:07,181
- That's good, that's good.
- Grab my wrist.

890
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:09,433
Put your hand out. Take his hand.

891
01:28:21,988 --> 01:28:24,073
Come on, buddy. I got ya.

892
01:28:24,074 --> 01:28:26,909
Give me your hand. Your hand.

893
01:28:28,662 --> 01:28:31,497
Grab my hand. Don't look down.

894
01:28:34,334 --> 01:28:36,627
Shit!

895
01:28:36,628 --> 01:28:38,963
Jack!

896
01:28:40,841 --> 01:28:43,843
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

897
01:28:51,768 --> 01:28:54,770
Jack! Jack, I can't hold this any more.

898
01:28:54,771 --> 01:28:56,647
Annie!

899
01:28:56,648 --> 01:28:57,940
You... hold on!

900
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,946
No! No! No!

901
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:07,324
Hold it.

902
01:29:14,374 --> 01:29:18,085
- Oh, God.
- Wedge down the gas pedal.

903
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:23,674
OK, I got it.

904
01:29:34,227 --> 01:29:36,937
- You got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

905
01:29:45,697 --> 01:29:48,699
- OK, Annie, get on.
- Jack, I can't do this.

906
01:29:49,826 --> 01:29:53,245
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Shit. Shit.

907
01:29:55,207 --> 01:29:56,790
- Jack.
- Shit!

908
01:29:58,376 --> 01:29:59,960
Hold on.

909
01:31:25,672 --> 01:31:28,299
Shit!

910
01:31:34,139 --> 01:31:36,307
Are you all right?

911
01:31:37,309 --> 01:31:39,810
No.

912
01:31:39,811 --> 01:31:43,772
It's OK. It's OK. It's over.

913
01:31:43,773 --> 01:31:47,735
It's over. You did it. You did it.

914
01:31:52,782 --> 01:31:55,284
I hate the airport.

915
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:04,501
You're not gonna get mushy on me, are you?

916
01:32:04,502 --> 01:32:07,880
Maybe. I might.

917
01:32:10,216 --> 01:32:14,928
I hope not, cos relationships that start
under intense circumstances never last.

918
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:18,140
- Oh, yeah?
- I've done extensive studying on this.

919
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,101
Here comes the cavalry.

920
01:32:37,202 --> 01:32:39,703
- How ya doing?
- We're OK.

921
01:32:41,831 --> 01:32:45,459
I just might be a nice guy
and let you have the rest of the day off.

922
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,628
Oh, boy.

923
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:50,464
Mac, this is Annie.

924
01:32:50,465 --> 01:32:53,675
Annie, meet Lieutenant McMahon.

925
01:32:53,676 --> 01:32:55,677
- How you doing?
- OK.

926
01:32:56,471 --> 01:32:59,723
- This should take care of it.
- Ow!

927
01:32:59,724 --> 01:33:02,893
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

928
01:33:02,894 --> 01:33:06,230
- We're gonna have you guys checked out.
- Lieutenant!

929
01:33:07,857 --> 01:33:10,776
It's him. He wants to know
when he's gonna get his money.

930
01:33:10,777 --> 01:33:13,821
I'll tell him what to do
with his goddamn money.

931
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:16,323
He doesn't know it blew up.

932
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:21,078
30 minutes.

933
01:34:01,161 --> 01:34:03,245
I'll be right back.

934
01:34:06,166 --> 01:34:12,129
All right, here's our target. Fox, I want you
in 4-1, you in 1-2. You're in 3. Let's move it.

935
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:15,424
- Is the paint bomb in with the money?
- It's done, sir.

936
01:35:15,652 --> 01:35:18,529
Too bad, Jack.
You could've made a good cop.

937
01:35:21,157 --> 01:35:23,242
OK.

938
01:35:24,827 --> 01:35:31,416
We still have no live picture. Reports are
that the bus continues to circle inside LAX.

939
01:35:39,175 --> 01:35:41,927
No! No!

940
01:36:05,785 --> 01:36:08,954
Miss, you can't be this close.
You need to move back.

941
01:36:08,955 --> 01:36:10,539
No. Jack Traven said...

942
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:14,960
Jack Traven asked that you be brought
out of harm's way. Just move right over here.

943
01:36:15,837 --> 01:36:18,922
- He's running a little late.
- He's not late.

944
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:23,385
- What?
- He's never late.

945
01:36:23,386 --> 01:36:25,929
Well, that money hasn't moved.

946
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:30,934
We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog
in the bag. I'd say he's covered.

947
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:37,941
- Turn it on.
- What for? It hasn't moved.

948
01:36:37,942 --> 01:36:40,027
Just do it.

949
01:36:47,452 --> 01:36:50,495
Shit. It's moving.
He's got the money.

950
01:36:50,496 --> 01:36:52,539
Jack!

951
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:03,592
Shit!

952
01:37:20,777 --> 01:37:23,028
Freeze!

953
01:37:23,029 --> 01:37:26,740
Pop quiz, asshole.
You have a hair trigger aimed at your head.

954
01:37:26,741 --> 01:37:30,494
What do you do? What do you do?

955
01:37:31,829 --> 01:37:35,749
Turn around. Turn around!

956
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,646
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

957
01:37:59,899 --> 01:38:01,983
Be prepared.

958
01:38:01,984 --> 01:38:04,820
It's the Boy Scout marching song.

959
01:38:04,821 --> 01:38:09,282
What are you gonna do, Jack?
I don't think you can shoot her.

960
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:10,534
Let her go.

961
01:38:11,994 --> 01:38:14,705
No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

962
01:38:14,706 --> 01:38:17,332
Fill it. Now.

963
01:38:21,337 --> 01:38:26,758
I think Harry would be very disappointed,
feeling that we're right back where we started.

964
01:38:26,759 --> 01:38:30,554
Let her go. You don't need her.
You have the money. Take it and walk.

965
01:38:30,555 --> 01:38:34,141
Come on. Just take it and walk.
You don't need her.

966
01:38:34,142 --> 01:38:37,477
- Just take your goddamn money and walk!
- Stay right there.

967
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:40,731
I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go.

968
01:38:40,732 --> 01:38:42,816
Oh, yeah.

969
01:38:42,817 --> 01:38:47,404
You still don't get it, do you, Jack? Huh?
The beauty of it.

970
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:53,410
A bomb is made to explode.
That's its meaning, its purpose.

971
01:38:53,411 --> 01:38:59,958
Your life is empty because you spend it
trying to stop the bomb from becoming.

972
01:38:59,959 --> 01:39:02,085
And for who? For what?

973
01:39:03,254 --> 01:39:07,007
Do you know what a bomb is, Jack,
that doesn't explode?

974
01:39:07,008 --> 01:39:10,427
It is a cheap gold watch, buddy.

975
01:39:11,596 --> 01:39:16,016
You're crazy. You're fucking crazy.

976
01:39:16,017 --> 01:39:19,269
No. Poor people are crazy, Jack.

977
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:22,063
I'm eccentric. Get the money. Let's go.

978
01:39:22,064 --> 01:39:24,775
Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

979
01:39:24,776 --> 01:39:27,152
You stay! Move it! Move it!

980
01:39:27,153 --> 01:39:29,654
In the door. In that door! Now!

981
01:39:31,574 --> 01:39:34,576
Bye, Jack. Punk.

982
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:39,831
All right!

983
01:39:41,626 --> 01:39:45,253
Get in there. Go on, get in.

984
01:39:45,254 --> 01:39:49,007
You get back in there!
You get this train moving! Go on!

985
01:39:49,842 --> 01:39:52,636
Are these seats taken?

986
01:39:52,637 --> 01:39:53,970
No. Go.

987
01:39:57,099 --> 01:40:00,560
Come on. Back over here.
Hands around the pole.

988
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:23,750
Damn.

989
01:40:42,353 --> 01:40:44,271
Come on, come on, come on!

990
01:40:50,236 --> 01:40:53,405
Please report, Westbound 501.
What is your position?

991
01:40:58,286 --> 01:41:01,288
Westbound 501, please check in.

992
01:41:01,289 --> 01:41:08,712
Westbound 501. We have police orders
to return to the station. Do you copy?

993
01:41:08,713 --> 01:41:13,258
You have to hold this. It's like a grenade.
You have to help me now. Come on, hold it.

994
01:41:13,259 --> 01:41:16,928
Don't let it go. Huh? I'm counting on you.

995
01:41:16,929 --> 01:41:18,388
Do you copy?

996
01:41:18,389 --> 01:41:20,891
Hey! I'll take it from here.

997
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,819
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

998
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:37,324
Maybe you'd better let me have this after all.
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical

999
01:41:37,325 --> 01:41:39,868
and you might let this go a mite early.

1000
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:46,166
Hey! Hey, buckaroo!

1001
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:48,668
It's not cos you're a woman, all right?

1002
01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:53,089
Hey, it's all right. Looks like we're all alone.

1003
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:58,637
You won. You beat Jack. You beat everybody.
Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

1004
01:41:58,638 --> 01:42:02,015
This stick works on a remote.

1005
01:42:02,016 --> 01:42:06,353
When you explode, that's where they'll come,
but it's not where I'll be.

1006
01:42:06,354 --> 01:42:12,442
I have a different plan. Mess like that,
they don't even count body parts.

1007
01:42:12,443 --> 01:42:15,695
Gives me more time.

1008
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:18,239
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

1009
01:42:31,212 --> 01:42:33,713
Hey, Jack, is that you?

1010
01:42:35,841 --> 01:42:39,344
He's so persistent. He always gets his man.

1011
01:42:39,345 --> 01:42:43,223
Wouldn't be able
to interest you in a bribe, would I?

1012
01:42:43,224 --> 01:42:46,768
I've got plenty to go around.

1013
01:42:50,815 --> 01:42:52,691
My money!

1014
01:42:57,697 --> 01:43:01,074
You bastard! How does that feel?

1015
01:43:03,035 --> 01:43:06,663
You like that, huh? You like it, you bastard?

1016
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,919
My money!

1017
01:43:19,927 --> 01:43:21,594
Shit!

1018
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:24,848
You! I'm coming for you, Jack!

1019
01:43:54,587 --> 01:43:57,714
Hey, I'll drop the stick, boy. You want that?

1020
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:01,801
I'm gonna get you.

1021
01:44:01,802 --> 01:44:03,053
Oh, yes!

1022
01:44:16,358 --> 01:44:20,695
What do you do, Jack? What do you do?
You're so smart, right, Jack?

1023
01:44:20,696 --> 01:44:26,076
You piece of shit! I'm the guy
with the plan cos I'm smarter than you.

1024
01:44:26,077 --> 01:44:28,161
I'm smarter than you.

1025
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:43,510
Yeah.

1026
01:44:45,012 --> 01:44:46,721
But I'm taller.

1027
01:44:48,516 --> 01:44:49,724
Jack.

1028
01:44:50,601 --> 01:44:51,726
Jack!

1029
01:44:51,727 --> 01:44:54,479
Oh, God! I thought you were dead. Jack.

1030
01:44:57,066 --> 01:45:00,151
- Turn around.
- Where's Payne?

1031
01:45:00,152 --> 01:45:02,695
He lost his head.

1032
01:45:04,156 --> 01:45:06,658
Oh, God.

1033
01:45:06,659 --> 01:45:10,578
- Let's take this off, shall we?
- Yes. Let's take this off.

1034
01:45:13,415 --> 01:45:17,043
- Take it off.
- Hello? Hello?

1035
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:21,297
Does anyone copy?
Jack, this is Mac. Can you hear me?

1036
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:28,096
Jack, if you're there, you've got to stop
the train. The track isn't finished.

1037
01:45:28,097 --> 01:45:31,558
Mac, I copy.

1038
01:45:31,559 --> 01:45:34,018
- Mac.
- If someone can hear me...

1039
01:45:34,019 --> 01:45:39,357
- Mac, can you hear me?
- Try the emergency brake. Do you copy?

1040
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:44,946
Nothing works! Annie, you won't believe this.

1041
01:45:44,947 --> 01:45:47,115
What?

1042
01:45:47,116 --> 01:45:49,284
We have to jump.

1043
01:45:49,285 --> 01:45:51,369
You can't stop it?

1044
01:45:53,873 --> 01:45:58,501
Well, OK, undo me,
and I'd love to go with you. Come on.

1045
01:46:00,129 --> 01:46:02,380
- I don't have a key.
- What?

1046
01:46:02,381 --> 01:46:04,424
I don't have the key.

1047
01:46:25,446 --> 01:46:26,571
Shit.

1048
01:46:44,089 --> 01:46:47,050
You gotta get off... You gotta get off the train.

1049
01:46:47,051 --> 01:46:51,471
Jack, please! This track dead-ends.
You gotta get off this train. This is crazy.

1050
01:46:51,472 --> 01:46:53,806
There's a curve ahead.

1051
01:46:53,807 --> 01:46:57,477
I'm gonna speed it up, make it jump the track.

1052
01:46:57,478 --> 01:47:01,397
This is really stupid.
Jack, please. You can still jump.

1053
01:47:01,398 --> 01:47:04,525
Jack, please. Please, Jack?

1054
01:49:44,895 --> 01:49:49,565
I can't believe he hit my van.
Come on. It's all right.

1055
01:49:49,566 --> 01:49:50,525
Unreal.

1056
01:49:53,278 --> 01:49:55,571
You didn't leave me.

1057
01:49:55,572 --> 01:49:58,241
I can't believe it.

1058
01:49:59,993 --> 01:50:02,620
You didn't leave me.

1059
01:50:02,621 --> 01:50:04,872
Didn't have anywhere to be just then.

1060
01:50:11,130 --> 01:50:13,172
Check it out.

1061
01:50:18,804 --> 01:50:21,347
I have to warn you.

1062
01:50:21,348 --> 01:50:25,768
I've heard relationships
based on intense experiences never work.

1063
01:50:25,769 --> 01:50:28,187
OK.

1064
01:50:28,188 --> 01:50:31,232
We'll have to base it on sex, then.

1065
01:50:31,233 --> 01:50:33,734
Whatever you say, ma'am.

1066
01:51:30,584 --> 01:51:32,919
* Running from the nightmare

1067
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,922
* In the middle of the road

1068
01:51:35,923 --> 01:51:38,341
* Hell's no place for sleepin'
