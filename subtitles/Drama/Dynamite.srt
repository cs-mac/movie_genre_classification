1
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:43,607
- Bye.
- Bye, Shruti.

2
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:03,218
Hey old man,
send some snacks and cold drinks.

3
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:07,363
I don't know who this crazy man is.
Must be a son of a politician.

4
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,269
What happened? The skirt tore.

5
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:22,961
I know a tailor nearby.

6
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,789
- Let me go, brother. - If you take my
name then he will stitch it for free.

7
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:26,714
Understood.

8
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,512
- Leave me.
- Get lost.

9
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:32,404
Did you see Vani,
all are cowards here.

10
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:33,956
There is no one who would save her.

11
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,662
What is it? Did you get scared?

12
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,025
Now you will be scared.

13
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,177
I think he heard what your heart felt.

14
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:27,255
A cobbler sits near the temple
and he will stitch your wound.

15
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,805
Take my name and he
will stitch it for free.

16
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,951
Hey, you repeated my words to me.

17
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:35,215
A hero speaks the dialogue
and not the villain.

18
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:37,323
Just wait here and
I will not spare you.

19
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:41,383
Leave your plan and
even I shall not spare you.

20
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:43,194
Go and get whoever you want to bring.

21
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,030
Come on.

22
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:48,714
- Hey, what was this?
- All this continues friends..

23
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,713
- Go and get something to eat.
- I shall get it.

24
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,638
Hey hero, nice job.

25
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:00,618
Thank you.

26
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:02,510
I am Anamika. What is your name?

27
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,170
Shivaji. Friends call me Shiv.

28
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:08,874
934934111. What is yours?

29
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:13,071
9260667771

30
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:14,776
This is from my side.

31
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:21,775
Interesting.

32
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,337
You take the entry and
send me to get thrashed.

33
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,761
Look, if you want to become hero..

34
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,819
..then you will have to do little
practice of taking entry and fighting.

35
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:32,652
Otherwise anyone would take
you to corner and thrash you.

36
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,462
You can fight if he comes back.

37
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:36,416
- You mean he will be back again.
- Yes, he will surely come.

38
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,709
It will take him one hour to get
the stitches so let's go till then.

39
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:42,252
- If he comes then you sit
on him and he will die. - Let's go.

40
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,618
Hey wait. I had told
you that he would surly come.

41
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:52,434
Please give me the way to go.

42
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:55,347
We will not give
you the way but death.

43
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,605
You are gone. Finish.

44
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:04,701
The matter has worsened.

45
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:08,814
The chain will remove the skin.

46
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:15,476
The hammer will break the head.

47
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:23,331
The knife will cut through.

48
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:26,095
Interesting.

49
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:29,986
Axe, this will tear open.

50
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,688
So you have made all
arrangements to kill me.

51
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:35,791
Good.

52
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,437
Listen to me carefully.

53
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,701
If I saved the first
attack that you made..

54
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:49,607
..then no one will be
able to save you from me.

55
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:15,797
Let's go.

56
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,650
He does not seem to be ordinary.
There is something definitely in him.

57
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:24,170
- Go and hit him.
- I do not agree to his challenge.

58
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:28,355
Will you all fight or just waste time?

59
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,537
Come on.

60
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,507
Hey, no fight took place.

61
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:51,931
There was no fight and still you won.
You are great.

62
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:53,778
Famous actress Neha Sharma died by..

63
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:56,114
..getting burnt in fire
that broke in her house.

64
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:59,195
Many popular film stars
reached the prayer meeting.

65
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:02,341
Neha Sharma is no more
so for whom should I exercise.

66
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,661
Stop paying attention to useless
things and concentrate on exercise.

67
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:05,666
Understood.

68
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,272
Stupid fellow.

69
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,863
I don't know where Anamika
would be at this time.

70
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:15,835
If you are so concerned then
why don't you call and ask her.

71
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:18,041
People remain in
touch without touching.

72
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:20,361
Hello. How are you?
How was the last night?

73
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,447
Can we catch up today?

74
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,268
Boys do so many things
to remain connected with girls.

75
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:25,525
And you cannot do this much.

76
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,068
Oh God, looking at your face
does not seem that you are so smart.

77
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,860
You keep giving advice
without anyone asking for it.

78
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,004
Call center..

79
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:35,514
Hey, you bumper..foul smell..

80
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,831
You did a great job last night.

81
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,899
Hey, a message has come from Anamika.

82
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,050
Great. Now the hearts
have got connected..

83
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,653
..so you too connect with the girl.

84
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:47,928
It was just my responsibility.

85
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:51,237
Hey, what nonsense are
you writing in the reply.

86
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:52,363
What are you doing?

87
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:54,747
- Give the phone to me.
- Hey, give me my phone.

88
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:55,805
Hey fatty, give my phone back to me.

89
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:57,735
- Your fingers will break the phone.
- Give me the phone..

90
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:00,036
Hey, she will feel that
I am desperate to meet her.

91
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,998
So what is the problem?

92
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,349
Hey wait. Did you send?

93
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:09,181
Hey, if there is no positive
reply for this message..

94
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,103
..then I shall get you both married.

95
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,772
Hey, she agreed to meet.

96
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:20,582
Didn't I say that she
is really interested in you?

97
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,544
Just meet up.

98
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:28,050
- Hey, listen..
- What is it?

99
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,890
To which restaurant shall I take her?

100
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,074
- Hi.
- Hi.

101
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:57,093
- How are you?
- I am fine. Thank you.

102
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,582
For last two days I
am waiting for your arrival.

103
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,747
How rude? Am I late?

104
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,050
Good things are not easily gettable.

105
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,768
- Please.
- Thanks.

106
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,192
So, is this your first date?

107
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:21,359
No. 31st and yours.

108
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,972
2nd.

109
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:27,148
Actually this is my first date.

110
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:32,346
Actually even I lied.
You said 31st so I got scared.

111
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,297
I thought as how I could say zero.
Actually this is my first date.

112
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,713
Oh, so you are my types.

113
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,082
Which type?

114
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:42,804
Formal, sensitive and boring types.

115
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,598
You are very shy types
and show just your goodness..

116
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,066
..in front of others
and hide your bad qualities.

117
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:52,142
Oh Wow! In just two
minutes you recognized me.

118
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:53,660
So why this drama? Let's go.

119
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,052
Hey wait.
I do not like loitering around.

120
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,389
Keep sitting here.

121
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:01,306
I thought you are
traveler type like me.

122
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,149
Let's order otherwise
we will get late.

123
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,992
I thought they have just come to talk.

124
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,505
- One red wine.
- Okay.

125
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:11,103
- Make that two please.
- Look, you hid your quality.

126
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,739
You do not seem to be wine
types but look to be vodka types.

127
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,948
- Go for it.
- Thanks.

128
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,978
- Give me vodka please.
- Okay sir.

129
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:23,619
Tattoos, muscles..you
seem to do a lot of work out.

130
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,028
Oh, you noticed it.

131
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,713
You removed the jacket
so that I could notice.

132
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,943
- I am caught.
- What work do you do?

133
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,460
I am into digital marketing.
Self employed.

134
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,447
Wow!

135
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,440
And what do you do?

136
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,834
According to record
I am already in Goa.

137
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,742
But will reach there tomorrow.

138
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:42,000
Bill please.

139
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,452
Hey come on, what is this?

140
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,356
Why should I waste time with
a girl who is going to Goa tomorrow?

141
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:49,309
I unnecessarily got trapped.

142
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,766
Hey, we had come only for dinner
and not for doing life time planning.

143
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:56,386
Look, you have come here to pass time
and I have come here to invest time.

144
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:59,111
- Bill please.
- Come on, I am not going to Goa.

145
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,752
- I was just joking.
- Oh, I still have a chance.

146
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:03,686
- Cheers..
- Cheers..

147
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:32,739
What does beauty mean to you?

148
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:35,786
For a middle class man like
me anyone whom I get is beautiful.

149
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:36,909
Hey..

150
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,635
Honesty, fitness and hygiene.

151
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:42,554
If your wife becomes fat after
marriage then will you leave her?

152
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:44,208
Is this a question to ask?

153
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,270
Is it wrong to expect
the girl to remain..

154
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,203
..same all her life
as I first saw her?

155
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:50,727
How is this possible?

156
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:53,954
Okay, just imagine that
tomorrow we get married.

157
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:55,958
After two years because
of excess drinking..

158
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,420
..if my stomach becomes big
then will you be okay with that.

159
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,658
Once marriage takes place
then you have to adjust.

160
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:03,149
Bill please.

161
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,355
I have kept the bill
for last half an hour..

162
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,908
..and the restaurant
closed one hour back.

163
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:15,845
Please.

164
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,518
Shall I drop you somewhere?

165
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:23,021
- No, I will take a taxi.
- I will drop you.

166
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,581
- What if I drop you?
- But how?

167
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,902
What if we walk together?

168
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,016
- Will you come along?
- Okay.

169
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,467
- You go home and I will come.
- Okay madam.

170
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,466
- Come, let's go.
- Okay.

171
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:42,737
We really had a nice time today.

172
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,586
- Campaign of clean India.
- Social responsibility.

173
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:50,864
The weather is too good.

174
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:54,016
Slight music,
beautiful girl by the side..

175
00:12:54,136 --> 00:12:55,931
..will really make
the weather pleasant.

176
00:12:57,348 --> 00:13:00,091
- Do you play drums as well?
- Not at all.

177
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,633
Sometimes in college I used
to play with plates in canteen.

178
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:09,346
Okay Anamika,
so I will take cab from here.

179
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:11,525
Wait at home till the cab comes.

180
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,335
Sure.

181
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:17,024
Why did I invite him?
What if his intentions are wrong?

182
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:20,204
Actually my parents are at
home so I hope it is okay with you.

183
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,435
So what? I will greet them and leave.

184
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:24,834
His intentions seem to be good.

185
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,671
- Madam..
- Hide.

186
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,682
What is the matter Ram Krishna?

187
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:33,180
Driver has given the car keys.

188
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,232
Thanks.

189
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,021
Why are you so scared?

190
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:42,774
What will he think
if he sees me with..

191
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:44,855
..a stranger boy in
the middle of the night?

192
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,452
But your parents are there at home.

193
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,080
No, they are not there.

194
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,130
Then why did you say so to me.

195
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:53,106
I was checking if you
had any bad intentions.

196
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:55,888
I feel not mine but
your intentions are bad.

197
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:57,135
Hey..

198
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:01,569
- Hello, Meru cabs..
- Yes sir, tell me.

199
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,489
I want a pick up
from Kothakoda junction.

200
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,664
- It will reach in half an hour, sir.
- Okay.

201
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,263
Make yourself at home.

202
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,259
Wow! Nice home.

203
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,918
Thank you.
Hey, do you need another drink?

204
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:15,734
- Sure.
- Okay.

205
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,641
- Will you have something to eat?
- No, thank you.

206
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:30,641
Hey, take it.

207
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:31,543
Thanks.

208
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,936
That's enough. Thank you.

209
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,183
Nice. Where are your parents?

210
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:43,189
When I was four my mother passed away.

211
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,957
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

212
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,573
In Gangadham my father
is a landlord and money lender.

213
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,436
This apartment is near to the college
so father bought this flat for me.

214
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,344
He believes in responsible freedom.

215
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:57,027
Hey, what happened?

216
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:58,895
I remembered father.

217
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,204
When I asked for money
from father for bus pass..

218
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,555
..for going to college
then he bought me a bike.

219
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,969
And he repaid its value by working
hard day and night for four years.

220
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:10,371
What does your father do?

221
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:11,218
He is a taxi driver.

222
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:13,432
Then why didn't you call him?

223
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:16,561
He would have thrashed
me seeing me drunk.

224
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:21,585
By the way I think
you are rich and too dumb.

225
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:25,700
Hey, since long I am seeing
that you are becoming harsh.

226
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,774
Tell me one thing.

227
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,400
Is it intelligence to
get a stranger to your home..

228
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,637
..in the middle of
the night on first date?

229
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:36,171
You passed in the date
so that is why I called you here.

230
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,991
I will tell you how?
Point number one.

231
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,230
Whenever a boy goes to
a restaurant with a girl..

232
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,163
..then he opens the door for her.

233
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:47,041
And 30% failed in this.

234
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,896
Oh.

235
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,097
Point number 2.

236
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:54,965
It is okay to stare at a girl
but some do not just stop watching.

237
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,170
And 40% fail in this.

238
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:02,898
But your behavior was
quite different from others.

239
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:08,839
Point number 3 some boys just
keep talking and do not listen to you.

240
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,558
There should be a conversation.
It should be free flow.

241
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,175
You passed all the tests
so that is why you are here.

242
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:26,413
Thank you, thank you..

243
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:30,084
Actually the real people who
deserve this award are my father..

244
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,077
..grandfather,
maternal grandfather, mother..

245
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:35,401
You stop your thank you
speech and I will get the album.

246
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,934
- You know what?
- What?

247
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:51,768
I want to confess something.

248
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,401
For the first time in
life I am feeling so safe.

249
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:59,137
- That means I am no more a stranger.
- No.

250
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:12,748
Can I use the bathroom, please?

251
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,438
Do you want me to play some music?

252
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,525
- Yes, sure.
- Okay.

253
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:25,892
Shiva, you are so lucky.

254
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,110
In first date the girl is ready.

255
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,783
What a chance it is?
Now there should not be any problem.

256
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:34,468
I will clearly tell
her that you are my life.

257
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:41,277
Look brother, listen to me carefully.
Do not kiss at all.

258
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:43,750
Do whatever you wish
to peacefully. Focus..

259
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,980
Bad odor..

260
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,412
I will impress her with mouth wash.

261
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,906
Hey, who are you and
what are you doing here?

262
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:40,007
Sir, I had called the police.

263
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:42,893
A girl has been
kidnapped from her home.

264
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:45,137
I reached here following them.

265
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,362
I do not know where
they took them from here.

266
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,812
Swami, just check in
which zone does this area com?

267
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:54,166
Hello, hello control room..
Swami calling from Garcharauli.

268
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,569
Who is that girl? Is she your wife?

269
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:00,833
- No sir.
- Sister..

270
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:02,857
- No sir.
- Lover.

271
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,414
No, sir.

272
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:07,357
Call girl.

273
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:10,251
- Hey, talk with respect.
- Then answer my question.

274
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,454
She was not a call girl, sir.

275
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:16,860
- Tell me her name.
- Anamika, sir.

276
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,780
Not her name but your name.

277
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,252
Shivaji.

278
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:22,945
What do you do?

279
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,436
Digital marketing. I am self employed.

280
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:26,466
And father?

281
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:28,809
What has he to do with it?
Ask the details of the girl.

282
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:31,119
I am worried as to
where they took the girl.

283
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:33,603
Tell me what your father does.

284
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:37,599
He is a taxi driver.
Has the marriage taken place?

285
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:39,862
Mine or my father's?

286
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,952
Intelligent fellow.

287
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:46,330
Swami, check him.

288
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,924
- What is the name of the girl?
- Anamika, sir.

289
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,053
Full name.

290
00:20:58,947 --> 00:20:59,873
Don't you know?

291
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,963
Didn't you ask her
or you don't remember?

292
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,132
Dasari..
Anamika Dasari.

293
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:08,216
Where is the house?

294
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:09,987
Kothakoda junction.

295
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:11,796
Tell me the address.

296
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:15,066
Sir, I do not know the address.
I can show you the apartment.

297
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:16,745
Will you keep
questioning till morning?

298
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:19,665
- Won't you take action?
- Shut up. I will thrash you.

299
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,467
Will you teach me how to take action?

300
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:23,952
After drinking you are
doing drama on the road.

301
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:26,755
Drugs, alcohol,
rape is everyday's matter.

302
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:30,485
The long beard and tattoo
has troubled us a lot.

303
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:31,867
Come on tell me the number.

304
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:36,453
9160252521

305
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,975
The number you have
dialed is switched off.

306
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:42,706
The number is switched off, sir.

307
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:45,022
Tell me your number.

308
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:48,025
9260667771

309
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:49,989
Will you recognize the kidnappers?

310
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,320
Yes, I will recognize them.

311
00:21:52,488 --> 00:21:54,711
Swami, go and check in the apartment.

312
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,905
Sir.

313
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:03,676
It often happens like this
after 10 on duty. Don't feel bad.

314
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,765
Take left from ahead, sir.

315
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,908
Do you remember the car number?

316
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,567
It is a black color car.
AP-03 AF 1234

317
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:16,154
Gharchirauli control
room..hello, hello..

318
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:17,679
Hello, Gharchirauli control room.

319
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:19,397
Gharchirauli, SI Swami here.

320
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:22,556
Black color Skoda AP-03 AF 1234.

321
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,295
Seize the car wherever you see it.

322
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,305
Female kidnap suspect. Over.

323
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:29,222
Do you both stay together?

324
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,327
We are just friends, sir.

325
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,036
Sir, the apartment
is here on the right.

326
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,507
Security..

327
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,897
What happened, sir?

328
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:46,564
Does a girl by name
Anamika Dasari stay here?

329
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:47,513
On the third floor.

330
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:48,811
Yes sir, 301

331
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:50,662
- Ram Krishna, one hour ago..
- Keep quiet..

332
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,455
That girl has been kidnapped
and we have the report.

333
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:54,337
Kidnapped..

334
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,983
She came to the flat four days ago.
She is in Goa.

335
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:59,084
You just gave her the car keys..

336
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:00,556
..and said that driver has given it.

337
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,106
Why will I speak lies? Who is he sir?

338
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,651
Haven't you seen him here before?

339
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:07,641
He did not get a
chance to see me, sir.

340
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,411
Tell me whether you
came here with her or not.

341
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,996
I had come here and
hid before he came.

342
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:14,043
Who are you?

343
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,847
I opened the gate last at 11'oclock..

344
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:17,947
..and after that I have opened now.

345
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,037
Since then the gate was closed.

346
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:20,391
Do you have the number of her driver?

347
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:22,696
So many drivers come here.

348
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,481
How can I remember
number of so many drivers?

349
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:26,456
- What is your name?
- Ram Krishna, sir.

350
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,151
- Since when are you here?
- I am here since last six years.

351
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:30,936
Sir, there is CCTV camera there..

352
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,665
..so it would have recording
of my arrival and kidnapping.

353
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:35,383
If you check the footage
you will find it.

354
00:23:35,503 --> 00:23:36,888
Where is the CCTV footage?

355
00:23:37,008 --> 00:23:38,201
- In the office, sir.
- Open it.

356
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:40,406
Sir, the secretary of the
society is sleeping right now.

357
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:42,617
I cannot show without his permission.

358
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:45,044
This is police enquiry. Open it.

359
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,308
What time did you come here?

360
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:03,451
Maybe around 12 or 12:15

361
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:46,357
It was 12:45 when she kidnapped.

362
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,108
Please watch that footage as well.

363
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:05,018
Sir, someone has tampered the video.

364
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,478
The footage has been changed.

365
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:10,310
Sir, when he will be thrashed in the
lock up then he will speak the truth.

366
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,113
Sir, I am here since last 6 years.

367
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,819
You can ask about
my honesty to anyone.

368
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:15,700
Sir, he is creating
scene after drinking.

369
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,134
You seem to be a part
of this kidnapping as well.

370
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:18,568
Hey, stop it.

371
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:20,961
He is speaking lies sir.

372
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,402
I came here with that girl.

373
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:26,261
Otherwise how would I know
about her flat, lift and his name?

374
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:28,837
Check her flat and you
will come to know the reality.

375
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:30,016
Are the keys with you?

376
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:33,033
For cleaning purpose it is
there but without her permission..

377
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:34,202
Hey, open the door.

378
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:20,052
Someone has set right
everything here, sir.

379
00:26:42,888 --> 00:26:45,282
Sir, my jacket was kept here.

380
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,548
Ram Krishna, close it.

381
00:26:58,455 --> 00:26:59,850
Don't sleep on duty.

382
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:02,307
Anyone can come to do
enquiry from police station.

383
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:03,353
Okay sir.

384
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:11,346
Look, this is the father of that girl.

385
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:15,173
Ranganath Dasari.
Channel 24 CEO.

386
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:19,828
Hello, is this Ranganath Dasari?

387
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:21,197
Yes, speaking.

388
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:24,342
Sir, I am SI Swami
speaking of Gharchaurali.

389
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,196
- Tell me.
- Sir, there is some emergency.

390
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:29,434
There has been theft
in your daughter's apartment.

391
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:31,543
Theft? In her flat?

392
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,078
Not in her flat but
the in the next door flat.

393
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:37,003
That is why I have to ask
some questions to your daughter.

394
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,570
But where is she now?

395
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:42,000
Please don't disturb her.
Anyways she is in Goa right now.

396
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,284
If you want to ask anything
else then come to office tomorrow.

397
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:45,919
Sorry for disturbing you.

398
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:52,741
- Sir..
- What happened there, Swami?

399
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,603
Sir, everything was fine in the flat.

400
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:57,315
We came to know that the
girl is in Goa for last four days.

401
00:27:57,574 --> 00:28:00,415
Shivaji was arguing that
the security was speaking lies.

402
00:28:01,168 --> 00:28:02,841
As it is many cases are pending.

403
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:04,792
Call the girl tomorrow morning.

404
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:06,297
If there is no answer
then he is speaking the truth.

405
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,024
And if the answer
comes then he is drunk.

406
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:09,872
Okay, I am going.

407
00:28:10,027 --> 00:28:12,101
Don't waste time Swami.
Now you go home.

408
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:14,385
Just remember tomorrow it
is your daughter's career counseling.

409
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,943
Okay sir goodnight.

410
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,762
I will do one thing.
I will drop you to your house.

411
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:22,643
Just think as to what happened
there in the meanwhile.

412
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:25,102
At this moment you
are not in your senses.

413
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:27,909
In this situation you
will never believe me.

414
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,349
Drop me home.

415
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:30,239
Where?

416
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:32,787
- Here, to the left.
- Okay.

417
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,925
Listen, as an elder
I am suggesting you..

418
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:50,571
..to drink in limits so
that you do lose your senses.

419
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:52,489
Drink four glasses of water and sleep.

420
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,158
Everything will be clear till morning.

421
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:22,384
She came to the flat four days ago.
She is in Goa.

422
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:24,344
He gave the car keys and
said that driver has given.

423
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:25,848
Someone has tampered the video, sir.

424
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,463
He is unnecessarily creating
a scene after drinking.

425
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,454
Sir, someone has set
right everything here.

426
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:30,830
My jacket was kept here sir.

427
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,471
- What is your name?
- Ram Krishna..

428
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:33,382
Ram Krishna, sir.

429
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:35,433
- Ram Krishna..
- Ram Krishna, sir.

430
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,258
Hello. What did you say?

431
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:00,558
- What happened?
- He is somewhere close by.

432
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,410
Look, he is hiding there. Hey, wait.

433
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:13,066
So, you will complain to the police.

434
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,802
You will tell my
identity to the police.

435
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,910
Hey, put the silencer and kill him.

436
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:33,064
Her father says that
his daughter is in Goa.

437
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,992
If you call up the daughter
then you come to know..

438
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:36,976
..from the operator
that she is in this city.

439
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,570
You are lucky that you are saved.

440
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,845
Dasari, will you
show everything in news?

441
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:56,275
Your daughter is with me.

442
00:31:56,395 --> 00:32:00,430
If I tell my boys then do you
know what kind of movie will be made?

443
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:02,368
Then show her movie on your channel.

444
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,213
I will do whatever you say.
Leave my daughter.

445
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:06,981
- Please.
- How many copies do you have?

446
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:09,405
I just have one copy.
In the memory card.

447
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:13,970
We shoot rave parties of
celebrities with a secret camera.

448
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,819
But we had no hope.

449
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:19,256
No one else except I and senior
journalist Rajesh know about it.

450
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:21,040
So many things keep
happening in the country.

451
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,180
If the police are not
worried then why are you?

452
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,154
If you have such videos
then earn money through it.

453
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:30,486
By showing it in breaking
news will you win noble prize.

454
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:32,125
Where is the memory card?

455
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:35,798
It is kept safely in chief
editor Rajesh's locker in the office.

456
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:39,624
Call him and tell that a person by
the name Jagga will collect from him.

457
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,413
- Hello..
- Rajesh, where are you?

458
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:50,783
I am on my way back from Delhi.

459
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,798
- Anything urgent. - I urgently want
that 21GB memory card.

460
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:56,052
That card. What happened sir.

461
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:57,658
Any problem.

462
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:02,238
There is no problem.
Till when will you reach?

463
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:04,347
I will reach by 4:30
or 5 in the morning.

464
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,049
Then reach the studio directly.

465
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:07,995
Jagga will come and
collect from there.

466
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:10,711
- Are you sure, sir?
- Do as I say Rajesh.

467
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:14,059
Keep a watch on him
till we get the memory card.

468
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,641
Where is Raghu? Does he
need so much time to shoot once?

469
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:20,708
I'll do one thing. I will go and see.

470
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:53,442
Sir..

471
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,273
I think this is some
high level matter.

472
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:14,754
You do not go to the police.

473
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:19,668
No one knows who all
are involved in this case.

474
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:24,664
Save yourself from
these hooligans somehow.

475
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:27,166
Leave this city for few days.

476
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:30,255
Otherwise they will surely kill you.

477
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:29,576
Sir..

478
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:34,373
Hello control room.

479
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:36,671
SI Swami has met
with an accident here.

480
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,810
On road number 36 near Padampur tekdi.

481
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,198
Send the ambulance quickly.

482
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:44,638
Look at me, sir.
Don't close your eyes but talk to me.

483
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:46,188
Sir, sir..

484
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:48,347
Look, I am feeling dizzy.

485
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:51,083
I think because of excessive bleeding.

486
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:52,128
Sir..

487
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:56,921
You throw your sim
card from your cell phone.

488
00:36:57,904 --> 00:37:00,499
Otherwise they will trace you.

489
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:05,018
- You are their target.
- Sir.

490
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:09,852
Sir.

491
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:13,328
Do you love her?

492
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:14,717
I don't know, sir.

493
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:16,784
Then why are you taking so much risk?

494
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:20,867
She was kidnapped in front
of me and I could not do anything.

495
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:23,007
If I do not save her
then I will not be at peace.

496
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,026
It is my duty to save her.

497
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:28,822
Father says that it is our
duty to help a person in trouble.

498
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:31,466
Sir, sir..

499
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:35,057
Instead of messing up with
those hooligans and kidnappers..

500
00:37:36,144 --> 00:37:39,095
..it is better you
stay away from them.

501
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:42,590
They can kill you
with knife or shoot you.

502
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:44,357
You will not be able
to escape from them.

503
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:46,781
You will not be able to catch them.

504
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,903
You will have to become
strong and have patience.

505
00:37:51,314 --> 00:37:55,093
Otherwise they will not spare you.

506
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:57,599
Remember what I have said.
All the best.

507
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,003
Sir, look at me.
Open your eyes sir and look at me.

508
00:38:01,123 --> 00:38:02,015
Sir..

509
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:04,060
Sir..

510
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:06,362
My daughter does not have a mother.

511
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:11,155
I am afraid that after my
death how she will live her life.

512
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:12,160
Sir..

513
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:16,643
Call up my daughter once.

514
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:18,613
Sir..

515
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:21,159
Sir..tell me the number..

516
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:25,926
9843

517
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,187
9843..sir..

518
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:32,179
Sir, sir..

519
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:43,982
- He hasn't come yet.
- He must be on his way, boss.

520
00:39:44,102 --> 00:39:46,293
Okay. Is he the one?

521
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:47,509
Yes, he is the one.

522
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:50,281
- Are you Jagga? Come with me.
- Yes I am Jagga.

523
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:52,729
You go inside.

524
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,954
There seems to be no network.

525
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:25,900
Boss, tea.

526
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,221
Not reachable.

527
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:30,220
- Take this, boss.
- Yes.

528
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:33,239
Aren't you able to
get through Kabir's number?

529
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,169
The phone is switched off.
I don't know where he is.

530
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:36,823
This was also his work.

531
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:42,587
The card is with us. Where will he go?

532
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:44,453
He will call us when he has money.

533
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:46,545
Go and give money for
tea and sit in the car.

534
00:41:04,486 --> 00:41:06,043
Yes, Kabir.

535
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,981
The memory card is with me.

536
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:09,692
Good.
And witness.

537
00:41:09,812 --> 00:41:12,165
We have killed Shivaji
and Ranganathan.

538
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:14,662
After reaching the lodge
we will kill the girl as well.

539
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:19,778
I will come at 10 to
the lodge and take the card.

540
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:22,186
And the money..

541
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:25,357
In just a minute 25lakhs
will be transferred to your account.

542
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:28,470
And the balance once
I get the card. Okay.

543
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,969
Okay, brother.

544
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,824
He is going to transfer
25lakhs in the account..

545
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,113
..and remaining after
he gets the card.

546
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:35,832
Boss, where do we need
to give the delivery?

547
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,267
Why are you worried?

548
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:39,490
We will withdraw 25lakhs
from the bank first..

549
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,500
..and he will come to
the lodge to take the card.

550
00:42:28,332 --> 00:42:31,997
Take this.
You remain here till I get the money.

551
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:33,741
Boss, I will also com along with you.

552
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:35,922
Do you think I will
run away with money?

553
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,892
That is not the case, brother.

554
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:39,311
Come.

555
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:00,278
Sir..

556
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:01,907
That car is parked in no parking area.

557
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:03,026
Look whom does it belong to.

558
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:13,219
Today I will get my daily
expenses from this fellow.

559
00:43:24,149 --> 00:43:25,713
Sir, there is gun in
the dashboard of that car.

560
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,358
- What? There is a gun?
- Yes sir.

561
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:30,489
- Is there anyone in the car?
- No, sir.

562
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:39,254
- What do you want?
- Give me a cup of tea.

563
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:40,494
Look sir.

564
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:45,377
This is traffic police SI Rao.

565
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,866
Film nagar. Jubille hills.
Please respond.

566
00:43:50,387 --> 00:43:52,188
Hey, have you seen
who was there in the car?

567
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:54,295
No I did not see.
You can go in the bank and check.

568
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:55,697
Maybe you will come to know there.

569
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,413
If they both are caught then how
will I be able to reach to Anamika.

570
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:03,189
This is the car, sir.

571
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:04,997
I am doubtful there would
be a license to the gun.

572
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:07,924
Check everyone and
tell the bank security.

573
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:09,351
Note down the number of the car.

574
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:10,568
For how long is it standing here?

575
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:11,776
For last 10 minutes sir.

576
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:12,798
- Kartik..
- Sir..

577
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:14,362
Immediately inform the bank manager.

578
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:15,833
- Okay sir.
- No one should be able to escape.

579
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:16,514
Okay sir.

580
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,752
Giri, check everyone who
is coming out from the bank.

581
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:20,809
If you doubt anyone then
take him into custody. Okay.

582
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:21,796
Okay sir.

583
00:44:31,176 --> 00:44:33,485
Hey, my veil..
Security..

584
00:44:33,745 --> 00:44:34,621
Hands up.

585
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,819
Everybody down.

586
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:38,240
No one will move.

587
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:43,279
- Hey, put this money in
the bag. Quick. - Okay, okay..

588
00:44:46,671 --> 00:44:47,637
Come on.

589
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:49,304
Hurry up.

590
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:51,632
- Drop the gun.
- You drop the gun.

591
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:52,871
Don't shoot.

592
00:45:02,563 --> 00:45:03,160
Hey..

593
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:05,847
Open, open..

594
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:12,686
Hurry up and sit in the car.

595
00:45:13,553 --> 00:45:14,362
Come on.

596
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:22,635
Drive the car.

597
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:27,804
Come on, hurry up.

598
00:45:30,786 --> 00:45:32,293
I am inspector Shinde
speaking from Film nagar.

599
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:33,719
There has been theft in Andhra Bank..

600
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,530
..and the thief has
escaped in grey Innova.

601
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,652
AP-07 BK 0077

602
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,736
Stop the car. Stop the car.

603
00:46:11,077 --> 00:46:13,126
- Who was he?
- I don't know, brother.

604
00:46:13,246 --> 00:46:15,183
We will have to change
the car before the police arrive.

605
00:46:19,258 --> 00:46:21,294
- Hey.
- Hey, come out..

606
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,055
Hey, my car.

607
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,437
Hello, What happened there, bro?

608
00:46:33,606 --> 00:46:36,297
Suddenly two criminals
came and stole the car, bro.

609
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:38,205
I am extremely sorry, bro.

610
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,819
- Bro..
- Buy a new bike.

611
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:43,013
My bike..hey you..

612
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,277
Greetings, brother.

613
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,060
What are you doing my dear?

614
00:47:27,498 --> 00:47:28,645
Why is the fan switched off?
Switch it on.

615
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:29,651
Switch it on.

616
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:48,954
Greetings brother.

617
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,808
- Is this the time to play cards?
- We just sat after finishing work.

618
00:47:51,928 --> 00:47:53,943
Throw the queen and the game is over.

619
00:47:56,717 --> 00:47:58,689
- Look, I won.
- What..

620
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,126
- Hey, where were you yesterday?
- Leave me.

621
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:08,488
You should at least given me a call.

622
00:48:08,608 --> 00:48:09,108
Hey.

623
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:11,103
Brother,
I will just come in 10 minutes.

624
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:13,516
- Because of you I denied so
many customers. - Get inside. Come on.

625
00:49:02,452 --> 00:49:03,560
- Brother..
- What is it?

626
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,240
There is an urgent
call from our old area.

627
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,686
- I will talk later.
- Police has done raid there.

628
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,756
What is the problem?

629
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:10,664
Give it to me.

630
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:11,786
Hello..

631
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:21,580
Anamika, Anamika..get up.

632
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:26,881
Let's go.

633
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:40,114
What are you talking?
You are getting money on time.

634
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,774
Then why did you do this raid?
Did you ask me?

635
00:49:43,007 --> 00:49:44,369
Give the phone to SI.

636
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,392
- Don't shout. We have
to leave from here.. - Okay..

637
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:06,645
- Can't you see?
- Sorry..

638
00:50:06,765 --> 00:50:07,712
- You made my loss..
- I'm very sorry.

639
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:09,473
Hey, catch him..

640
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:37,844
Sit in the car.

641
00:52:49,576 --> 00:52:50,354
He escaped, brother.

642
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:55,026
Hey, next time if there is a raid then
talk directly to the commissioner.

643
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:55,845
Okay brother.

644
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,085
Memory card?
Hey, where has the girl gone?

645
00:53:00,593 --> 00:53:01,449
Brother..

646
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,956
Brother, Shiva is still alive..

647
00:53:07,076 --> 00:53:07,966
..and escaped with the girl.

648
00:53:08,086 --> 00:53:09,871
What? Shiva? But we had killed him.

649
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,044
I do not know how he escaped, brother.

650
00:53:11,164 --> 00:53:12,168
You do not do any work properly.

651
00:53:13,154 --> 00:53:14,571
Brother Kabir has come.

652
00:53:22,754 --> 00:53:23,527
Memory card.

653
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:26,334
Where is the memory card?

654
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:29,099
Shiva escaped with the
memory card and the girl.

655
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:30,448
Damn!

656
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,602
He escaped.

657
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,550
We had given money to party fund..

658
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,140
..so that we need not
run for license again.

659
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,620
We developed the infrastructure
having faith on you.

660
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,044
I have come here to talk
about increasing 4G business.

661
00:53:56,164 --> 00:53:58,144
Think over it once again.

662
00:53:58,274 --> 00:54:01,906
Your popularity is
increasing in the party and..

663
00:54:02,088 --> 00:54:04,918
..tomorrow you can be prime
ministerial candidate of the party.

664
00:54:05,038 --> 00:54:07,989
If this work is not done now..

665
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:11,029
..then later it would be
difficult for you to do this work.

666
00:54:11,149 --> 00:54:14,693
And then opposition
would be after your life.

667
00:54:14,813 --> 00:54:17,521
What will happen
if anything goes wrong?

668
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,202
Then we will also
have to run to foreign.

669
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,480
If not you then who will
give security to us in business.

670
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:36,466
Gentlemen, excuse me. I will be back.

671
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,699
- Tell me.
- Memory card is lost.

672
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,587
A man named Shiva ran away
with the card as well as girl.

673
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:57,858
I am sorry sir.

674
00:54:58,107 --> 00:54:59,617
No explanations.

675
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:02,949
In next three hours
I will reach Hyderabad.

676
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,788
In the meanwhile find
the card at any cost.

677
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:09,757
No proof should be left behind.

678
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,040
Kill that boy as well as that girl.

679
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:32,566
Till I could do
anything he was shot at.

680
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,957
I did not think that after getting
the information they would kill him.

681
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:40,544
His body is in police custody.

682
00:55:41,356 --> 00:55:42,964
But at this moment
it is risky to go there.

683
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:44,599
Their men would be present there.

684
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:50,982
He gave me independence,
freedom whenever he could.

685
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:54,608
He taught me how to
live alone in this life.

686
00:55:56,592 --> 00:55:59,627
First I used to think
that h is ignoring me.

687
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:05,920
But now when father is
not alive then how will I live.

688
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:16,339
Look Anamika, someone's support
and loneliness is in our mind.

689
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:19,174
People are never separated from heart.

690
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:22,910
Relationships do not get
over if someone is not there.

691
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:25,382
Their memories always remain with us.

692
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,352
My mother is always with me.

693
00:56:33,795 --> 00:56:35,527
She died three years ago.

694
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:41,476
Do you know Anamika she was not just
my mother but my good friend as well.

695
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:46,894
She fought against suffering
and learnt and then taught me as well.

696
00:56:48,275 --> 00:56:50,591
When she was at the death bed..

697
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,685
..she assured me that she
would be present in my dreams.

698
00:56:54,022 --> 00:56:55,320
That is why I shouldn't be sad.

699
00:56:56,488 --> 00:57:00,165
It is not important to
cry to show love to her, Anamika.

700
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:04,096
But to fulfill their wishes..

701
00:57:04,705 --> 00:57:06,807
..would be our true love towards them.

702
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:12,917
He never hurt anyone.

703
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:17,211
I will all of them who have done this.

704
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,806
Shiva, I really want
to kill that man who did this.

705
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,010
There is only one
way to reach that person.

706
00:57:23,601 --> 00:57:24,866
This memory card.

707
00:57:25,852 --> 00:57:29,115
This is our weapon
as well as our support.

708
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:43,375
This is asking for password.

709
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:46,651
But your father did
not tell any password.

710
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,730
Usually he wrote his passwords
and bank details in a diary.

711
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:52,777
Where will we get that diary?

712
00:57:52,897 --> 00:57:54,338
In office of Channel 24

713
00:57:55,983 --> 00:57:59,108
CEO Dasari and senior journalist..

714
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:02,009
..Rajesh have been mercilessly killed.

715
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:04,846
We will keep you updated
about police enquiry.

716
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:10,593
Why is there so much police here?

717
00:58:10,713 --> 00:58:13,528
Senior journalist Rajesh
has also been killed today morning.

718
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:17,030
- What? Oh my God..
- Which side is your dad's cabin?

719
00:58:17,336 --> 00:58:19,402
- I will go.
- People will recognize you.

720
00:58:19,552 --> 00:58:21,858
No one knows me.
Where is dad's cabin?

721
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:26,387
On the first floor. After leaving 2-3
sections his cabin is in the corner.

722
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:48,911
As soon as you reach the
lobby you will see staircase.

723
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:50,743
Then you go up.

724
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,644
On that floor on the left side you
will find a corridor of staff room.

725
00:58:59,065 --> 00:59:00,950
Once you cross staff
room and after turning left..

726
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,593
..you will be able to see board rooms.

727
00:59:13,577 --> 00:59:16,196
Cross that area and then turn left.

728
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:19,920
In that room you will see
a painting of Gautama Buddha.

729
00:59:21,033 --> 00:59:22,727
That is my father's cabin.

730
00:59:24,536 --> 00:59:27,025
You will see a locker in book shelf.

731
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,674
Its password is 01234

732
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,214
Hey, who are you and
what are you doing here?

733
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,492
So you are a staff member.

734
01:00:14,884 --> 01:00:15,511
Yes sir.

735
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:17,137
But we had asked everyone to stay out.

736
01:00:17,257 --> 01:00:18,765
I had come to take the camera sir.

737
01:00:18,885 --> 01:00:20,167
Today there is interview
of Sunny Leone.

738
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:22,777
Are you mad? Your journalist
and CEO have been murdered..

739
01:00:22,897 --> 01:00:24,314
..and you want to take
interview of Sunny Leone.

740
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:25,385
Get lost from here.

741
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:26,362
Okay sir.

742
01:00:33,322 --> 01:00:34,449
Black day.

743
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:38,014
Wrong.

744
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:41,677
But this password is
written next to memory card.

745
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:45,451
Maybe Rajesh would have changed
the password before giving it.

746
01:00:47,474 --> 01:00:49,168
Okay try my birth date.

747
01:00:52,745 --> 01:00:53,737
This is also wrong.

748
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,392
Okay, there is a website to open this.

749
01:00:57,512 --> 01:00:58,489
Unlocksmith.com

750
01:00:58,609 --> 01:00:59,524
It is a hacker site.

751
01:00:59,644 --> 01:01:02,346
If we upload this video on that site
then it will be unlocked in 30 minutes.

752
01:01:02,691 --> 01:01:05,834
But for that we need high
speed internet connection.

753
01:01:06,391 --> 01:01:07,630
Where will we get that?

754
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:23,812
May I help you?

755
01:01:23,932 --> 01:01:25,583
I want a suite with internet access.

756
01:01:25,703 --> 01:01:26,688
Business or pleasure.

757
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,045
- Business..
- Pleasure..

758
01:01:30,431 --> 01:01:31,847
- Pleasure.
- Business.

759
01:01:33,345 --> 01:01:34,545
Business with pleasure.

760
01:01:34,665 --> 01:01:35,658
Are you married?

761
01:01:35,778 --> 01:01:36,934
- No.
- Yes.

762
01:01:38,537 --> 01:01:40,287
- Yes.
- No.

763
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:42,519
- Will you keep quiet?
- We are trapped now.

764
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:43,938
Have you decided?

765
01:01:44,346 --> 01:01:46,228
About whether to get married or no.

766
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:48,594
Your fight shows that you are married.

767
01:01:48,714 --> 01:01:50,801
Give me age proof sir
so that I can give room.

768
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,938
Shivaji, age 25

769
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,266
Cash or credit.

770
01:01:56,386 --> 01:01:57,671
First tell me the rate.

771
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:03,394
5,000/- for a single person and 10,000/
-for those who fight among themselves.

772
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:04,749
Because you never know
what they would break.

773
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:07,711
And loot the boy who
comes with his girlfriend.

774
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:10,410
Think as you want.

775
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:14,914
There is nothing of that sort so give
the room without asking any questions.

776
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,405
Okay. Tell me how much do you want?

777
01:02:17,765 --> 01:02:18,574
20

778
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:26,178
Sometimes you feel
hot in AC lift also.

779
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:28,364
It depends on the customers.

780
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:31,250
Sorry.

781
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,848
Laundry, madam.

782
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:48,941
Actually sir,
this is our most expensive..

783
01:02:51,716 --> 01:02:53,861
I think I will have
to put do not disturb board.

784
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:18,021
Here, I have brought some clothes.

785
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:19,038
Thank you.

786
01:03:20,691 --> 01:03:21,445
What is this?

787
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,504
Button camera.
Wireless with 3G transmission.

788
01:03:24,624 --> 01:03:27,725
One click and after that
going to button camera site..

789
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,211
..and inserting serial
number..look at this.

790
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:33,982
Whatever is recorded in
camera can be seen online as well.

791
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:35,110
This is cool.

792
01:04:01,048 --> 01:04:02,141
It will take half an hour.

793
01:04:03,497 --> 01:04:04,487
I will just be back.

794
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,266
You put your life
in danger because of me.

795
01:05:22,303 --> 01:05:25,175
If I do not take risk
then how shall I take revenge?

796
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:29,070
This is not for you but for me.

797
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,900
I have to save my love.

798
01:05:50,345 --> 01:05:51,037
You wait.

799
01:06:00,572 --> 01:06:01,458
What are you doing here?

800
01:06:01,578 --> 01:06:04,889
I came here for office meeting. I
saw you coming upstairs so I came up.

801
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,390
What are you doing here?

802
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,786
- Hi.
- Hi.

803
01:06:15,697 --> 01:06:17,018
Stupid..

804
01:06:29,094 --> 01:06:30,049
What is there in this?

805
01:06:30,637 --> 01:06:32,478
I am unlocking a very important video.

806
01:06:32,678 --> 01:06:35,784
Kabir and his men kidnapped Anamika.

807
01:06:35,904 --> 01:06:38,199
They killed her father
and a senior journalist.

808
01:06:38,386 --> 01:06:40,047
And they did all that for this video.

809
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:42,282
A great personality is behind this.

810
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:44,579
- We need to crack this.
- Have you gone mad?

811
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:46,821
Will they spare you after watching it?

812
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:48,876
I do not know about them
but I will not spare them.

813
01:06:49,235 --> 01:06:50,979
They will track you
by your cell number.

814
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:53,031
They will even find you in this hotel.

815
01:06:54,722 --> 01:06:57,268
I did not tell you
that someone is after me.

816
01:06:59,397 --> 01:07:00,649
How did you come to know?

817
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:04,116
That means you had given my number.

818
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,219
Leave all this and give me this video.

819
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,015
- Get back. What are you doing?
- Listen to me.

820
01:07:09,135 --> 01:07:11,575
You went at night but those people
came to the house in the morning.

821
01:07:12,592 --> 01:07:14,315
Hey, where is Shiva?

822
01:07:14,435 --> 01:07:15,595
Tell us where Shiva is?

823
01:07:16,046 --> 01:07:18,597
Wait. Sit down.

824
01:07:22,273 --> 01:07:24,669
So you really do
not know where Shiva is.

825
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:27,254
I called him up many times at
night but h did not pick up the phone.

826
01:07:27,374 --> 01:07:29,313
Who are you all?
What do you want from me?

827
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:31,406
Your friend has an important video.

828
01:07:31,526 --> 01:07:33,188
I want that at all cost.

829
01:07:33,308 --> 01:07:36,198
Take this 1crore as advance.

830
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,988
Get that memory card.

831
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:40,402
If you get it then
I shall give more money.

832
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:42,615
If you cannot bring
then I will kill you.

833
01:07:45,513 --> 01:07:48,107
You sold yourself. Aren't you ashamed?

834
01:07:48,227 --> 01:07:51,359
From poor people to politicians
do scams worth millions.

835
01:07:51,479 --> 01:07:53,297
If they are not ashamed
then why should I be ashamed?

836
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:56,618
Even you will get that money.
I am taking this memory card.

837
01:07:57,578 --> 01:07:59,939
- Should I leave this girl for money?
- Which girl?

838
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:01,583
As if you have not seen a girl before.

839
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,847
If you have money with you then
you will get such a girl every hour.

840
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
Understood.

841
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:06,458
Now give this memory card to me.

842
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:09,841
Agree to me. We will not be able
to earn so much money all our life.

843
01:08:17,307 --> 01:08:19,238
Hey, catch hold of both of them.

844
01:10:27,174 --> 01:10:31,865
Where is the memory card?

845
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,615
Remove the memory card.

846
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,986
Where is the memory card?

847
01:10:57,309 --> 01:11:01,321
Tell me. Won't you tell me or not?

848
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,424
Shiva..

849
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:18,328
Take this. Go..

850
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,369
Hey, kill him.

851
01:12:20,184 --> 01:12:21,801
Take out the memory card.

852
01:13:03,548 --> 01:13:04,406
Shiva..

853
01:14:29,764 --> 01:14:30,552
Okay.

854
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:33,348
Sir, before Kabir
could reach the hotel..

855
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:36,039
..they tried to upload
the video on a hacker site.

856
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,920
It is not known whether
it has been uploaded or not.

857
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,363
Shiva and Anamika both have
escaped with memory card from our men.

858
01:14:41,483 --> 01:14:43,732
Kabir is not answering.
I do not know what has happened, sir.

859
01:14:43,852 --> 01:14:46,676
We will have to be alert
till we get the memory card.

860
01:14:46,796 --> 01:14:51,518
So block all social network sites,
email, whats app, youtube access

861
01:14:51,638 --> 01:14:54,608
Till this problem is solved
internet should be completely stopped.

862
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:55,516
Okay sir.

863
01:14:55,726 --> 01:14:58,161
Hello. Sir wants network
to be totally stopped.

864
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:02,197
Okay, wait for a minute.

865
01:15:03,036 --> 01:15:04,685
- What?
- Sir, he is on the speaker.

866
01:15:05,277 --> 01:15:05,745
Yes.

867
01:15:05,745 --> 01:15:08,532
Sir, only one server links Hyderabad.

868
01:15:08,652 --> 01:15:10,211
It is difficult to stop internet.

869
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:12,815
But if by using your password
some complications can be..

870
01:15:12,935 --> 01:15:15,546
..created in satellite then
I will reboot the main server.

871
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:19,830
It will take 45 minutes to reboot it.

872
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,146
Other than government internet
no other network will work.

873
01:15:22,266 --> 01:15:23,413
- But..
- Go on..

874
01:15:23,533 --> 01:15:26,121
Home broadband, mobile
data connections will b stopped..

875
01:15:26,241 --> 01:15:28,699
..online transactions,
stock exchange and everything..

876
01:15:28,819 --> 01:15:30,215
It would cause huge loss, sir.

877
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:34,062
Do you know the loss incurred
if electricity goes for an hour?

878
01:15:34,182 --> 01:15:38,738
The entire city will not be destroyed
if internet is topped for 45 minutes.

879
01:15:38,858 --> 01:15:43,893
Do as I say. My access code is EQEPA53

880
01:15:44,013 --> 01:15:44,852
Yes sir.

881
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,244
- Rakesh..
- Sir..

882
01:15:51,609 --> 01:15:54,925
You know very well what will
happen if this video become viral.

883
01:15:55,654 --> 01:16:00,332
This problem will not be solved without
taking help of police department.

884
01:16:03,953 --> 01:16:05,309
Call up Arun Raj.

885
01:16:05,608 --> 01:16:07,003
What happened of that Rabdi case?

886
01:16:07,123 --> 01:16:09,229
We have sent the team
to Vijaywada for investigation.

887
01:16:09,349 --> 01:16:11,503
We will surely get some
information by evening.

888
01:16:13,784 --> 01:16:14,487
Tell me, sir.

889
01:16:14,607 --> 01:16:16,203
Arun, we have lost the memory card.

890
01:16:16,474 --> 01:16:18,378
They both have escaped
with the memory card.

891
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,076
What is the order for me?

892
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:25,544
You just have 45 minutes
of time to catch them.

893
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:29,870
File a report that Anamika killed
her father and eloped with Shivaji.

894
01:16:30,547 --> 01:16:33,868
Shoot them at sight wherever
they are seen in Hyderabad.

895
01:16:33,988 --> 01:16:36,887
Tell the department that
the matter is of national security.

896
01:16:37,007 --> 01:16:39,548
You will get any
permission that you want.

897
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:40,473
Yes sir.

898
01:16:40,753 --> 01:16:42,401
- I am reaching.
- Okay sir.

899
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,579
Let's go to police headquarter.

900
01:16:47,511 --> 01:16:49,180
Okay, everyone listen carefully.

901
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:51,234
This is matter of national security.

902
01:16:51,424 --> 01:16:52,142
Look.

903
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:58,266
Shivaji Shankar and Anamika Dasari
are lovers as well as murderers.

904
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:01,808
The one who has been killed is
Ranganathan Dasari, father of the girl.

905
01:17:01,928 --> 01:17:04,709
He is a big shot. CEO of channel 24

906
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:06,886
The one who had gone
to save Ranganathan..

907
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:08,556
..was sub inspector Swaminathan.

908
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,512
Double murder on the run.

909
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,049
Ranganathan Dasari was
media's national figure..

910
01:17:13,169 --> 01:17:15,728
..so that is why the
case has been sent to centre.

911
01:17:16,313 --> 01:17:19,545
It is high commands order
to catch them at any cost.

912
01:17:20,245 --> 01:17:24,877
Public has seen them last in Madhopur
with gun walking openly on the roads.

913
01:17:24,997 --> 01:17:26,406
I need that area covered.

914
01:17:26,526 --> 01:17:31,082
Keep a watch on friends and
co workers of the boy and the girl.

915
01:17:31,202 --> 01:17:36,125
I want their phone list,
debit card, credit card..

916
01:17:36,245 --> 01:17:42,063
..bank statements, phone bills,
friends list and everything else.

917
01:17:42,346 --> 01:17:44,208
I need everything.

918
01:17:44,849 --> 01:17:45,866
What are they going to do?

919
01:17:45,986 --> 01:17:48,613
We have to think before them
as to what they are going to do.

920
01:18:03,316 --> 01:18:06,228
Seeing the police arrangements
it seems they are in search of us.

921
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,161
If they can search
us from cell phone..

922
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:11,097
..then they can find us
from debit as well as credit card.

923
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,888
Before they catch us we have
to find out who is behind this.

924
01:18:15,127 --> 01:18:17,245
How much time will it
take to activate data card?

925
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:19,632
Madam, I am trying.
There is no internet.

926
01:18:19,752 --> 01:18:20,995
Please wait for some time.

927
01:18:21,423 --> 01:18:23,596
Even my data card is not working.
There is no signal here.

928
01:18:23,716 --> 01:18:25,263
Neither of 3G or 4G.

929
01:18:25,383 --> 01:18:29,117
Sir, router is rebooting. I
think there is some problem in server.

930
01:18:29,782 --> 01:18:32,113
I think the network has been stopped.

931
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:34,417
There is definitely something wrong.

932
01:18:34,604 --> 01:18:36,597
I think police is also with them.

933
01:18:36,922 --> 01:18:38,015
Maybe.

934
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:39,828
Listen to me carefully.

935
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,648
Now we just have one way out.

936
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:44,748
This diary has phone
numbers of top journalists.

937
01:18:44,868 --> 01:18:47,432
Tell them we are going to
give breaking news in Manjira Mall.

938
01:18:47,552 --> 01:18:50,223
Then take them along
and give this memory card..

939
01:18:50,343 --> 01:18:52,289
..only in the hands of governor.

940
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:54,224
Take it and be careful.

941
01:18:54,344 --> 01:18:56,777
- But password..
- We shall find the password later.

942
01:18:57,136 --> 01:18:58,450
- First save this card.
- Okay.

943
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,790
Only this will save us
from people who are following us.

944
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:02,319
But how will this happen.

945
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:04,990
I shall call, people will gather,
police is everywhere.

946
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:08,207
Cameras are installed. If there is some
confusion then we both will be caught.

947
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,512
I will divert the police.
You don't worry.

948
01:19:10,632 --> 01:19:13,598
Call from that PCO. Be safe.

949
01:19:13,718 --> 01:19:17,305
If I do not reach by 4 then hand
over this memory card to governor.

950
01:19:17,425 --> 01:19:20,771
- Shiv..
- Please do as I say.

951
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:31,125
What is the status?

952
01:19:31,245 --> 01:19:33,270
Sir, all roads to
Madhopur has been blocked.

953
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:34,530
There is no chance for them to escape.

954
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,454
Yes, that's okay.

955
01:19:35,574 --> 01:19:37,076
- Call them up and tell me..
- Okay sir.

956
01:19:40,978 --> 01:19:44,824
Sir, Madhopur area has been
blocked and the search is on.

957
01:19:44,944 --> 01:19:46,665
Guys, report.

958
01:19:46,969 --> 01:19:49,141

used twice last time.

01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:57,386
Then he removed the
sim from his phone.

01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:59,122

Out of them 8 are in Madhopur.

966
01:20:02,321 --> 01:20:03,094
We are keeping a watch on them.

01:20:03,214 --> 01:20:06,657
He has 143followers on twitter, 43
contacts of skype and 3 email accounts.

968
01:20:06,777 --> 01:20:10,012
The websites that he has often used

969
01:20:10,132 --> 01:20:13,105
Saturday night he drank with

01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,766
One of them was killed in shoot out.

971
01:20:14,886 --> 01:20:16,634
Rest of the two work in IT park.

972
01:20:16,754 --> 01:20:19,027
His 12 friends live

973
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:22,022
Out of which 7 are college, 3 are
school and 2 are martial art friends.

974
01:20:22,142 --> 01:20:23,551
How many times did he go to toilet?

975
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:24,354
What sir?

976
01:20:24,915 --> 01:20:27,454
This is about Madhopur.

977
01:20:27,574 --> 01:20:29,557
What is the guarantee
that they will still be there.

978
01:20:29,677 --> 01:20:33,003
No sir. After getting the news within
five minutes we blocked the roads.

979
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,190
They must be within
a range of two kms.

980
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,393
There is no doubt about it.

981
01:20:37,889 --> 01:20:41,016
How many public places
are there in Madhopur area?

982
01:20:47,818 --> 01:20:51,111
Keep tracking their
debit and credit cards.

983
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,104
We have already sent
photos to the hotels, sir.

984
01:20:55,224 --> 01:20:56,986
The moment they book a room or pay a..

985

..bill in the restaurant
they will be caught.

986
01:21:03,543 --> 01:21:07,011
Now they will not go to the hotel.
Remove hotels from this list.

01:21:07,131 --> 01:21:07,936
Yes sir.

988
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:12,009
They will take advantage
of crowd and try to hide.

01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:29,299
I don't know where has he gone?
He did not even take his card.

1011
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:32,905
Sir, Shiva is not there in the café.
He has left his card here and escaped.

1012
01:22:35,215 --> 01:22:37,290
Search. They must be there.

1013
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:41,883

01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,732
Walking like a hero.

Vijay, Shiva speaking.
There is an important matter.

1017
01:22:55,153 --> 01:22:56,961
Sir, his friend has received a call.

1018
01:22:57,081 --> 01:22:58,344
Everyone quiet.

01:23:01,446 --> 01:23:02,308
Listen to this.

1021
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:05,187

- Why is the delay?
- Note down the details.

1029
01:23:17,484 --> 01:23:20,940
Sir, this is BSNL number and is
registered in the name of Kadam Babu.

1030
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,050
Track that phone.
He should not escape from there.

1031
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,489
No, everything is waste.

1032
01:23:24,696 --> 01:23:28,501
Do one thing. Match his voice frequency
with all the calls in this area.

1033
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,847
He knows that policies tracking him.

1034
01:23:30,967 --> 01:23:34,216
After this Shivaji
will not use this phone.

1035
01:23:45,617 --> 01:23:48,179
I want two flight tickets to Mumbai.

1036
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,993

1044
01:24:06,422 --> 01:24:08,118
Ask the airport security to be alert.

1045
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:09,779
Fax his photo id's.

1046
01:24:10,142 --> 01:24:11,923
He should not be able
to catch Mumbai flight.

1047
01:24:12,183 --> 01:24:14,207
Arun, they will not go to airport.

1048
01:24:14,327 --> 01:24:17,311
Ask the search team
to surround the booth area.

1049
01:24:18,323 --> 01:24:21,895
Search each and every transport.
Bike, car..

1050
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,420
At any cost he should not
be able to go out of Madhopur.

1051
01:24:50,788 --> 01:24:53,002
Sir, money has been withdrawn.

It is near the station.

1054
01:24:55,821 --> 01:24:56,661
Money..

1055
01:25:00,866 --> 01:25:02,950
Sir someone else has withdrawn
the money with Shivaji's card.

1056
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,360
He must be a friend. Search him.

1057
01:25:04,723 --> 01:25:06,245
Dos not seem to be a friend.

1058
01:25:06,365 --> 01:25:07,889
He can be a facebook friend.

1059
01:25:08,009 --> 01:25:10,821
Sir, face is not in shape.

1060
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,314
- Show the CCTV camera footage.
- Sir..

1061
01:25:14,678 --> 01:25:15,543
Move..

1062
01:25:26,015 --> 01:25:27,529
Why is he alone at this time?

1063
01:25:27,649 --> 01:25:30,210
Why didn't anyone
inform me about the girl?

1064
01:25:30,656 --> 01:25:32,007
Where is the girl?

1065
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:38,958
He knows we are watching him.

1066
01:25:39,078 --> 01:25:41,607
Sir footage outside Manjira
mall has been recorded.

1067
01:25:41,727 --> 01:25:42,710
Look at this.

1068
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,991
Stop.

1069
01:25:45,111 --> 01:25:47,304
He seems to be similar one. Zoom in.

1070
01:25:49,174 --> 01:25:50,612
Show me the footage
of CCTV camera outside.

1071
01:25:50,732 --> 01:25:51,996
- Yes sir.
- Quick.

1072
01:25:56,946 --> 01:25:59,087
- Zoom in.
- Sir.

1073
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:05,576
Pay attention.

01:26:08,138 --> 01:26:09,684
Team R5 Manjira Mall.

1075
01:26:09,804 --> 01:26:11,846
- Go for Arun Raj.
- Yes sir.

1076
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,371
R5 Ram Krishna responding.

1077
01:26:13,491 --> 01:26:15,447
Why are media vans standing
outside Mnajira Mall?

1078
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:16,863
I will check and tell you.

1079
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:25,664
Sir, 15 OP vans and 30 media reporters
are present outside Manjira Mall.

1080
01:26:25,784 --> 01:26:28,096
They have come to know
about some breaking news.

1081
01:26:30,345 --> 01:26:32,139
Send the entire police
force to Manjira Mall.

1082
01:26:32,259 --> 01:26:33,772
- Sir..
- He is playing with us.

1083
01:26:33,892 --> 01:26:36,150
Before media reaches
there I want them dead.

1084
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,264
DEAD

1085
01:26:37,384 --> 01:26:38,464
- Got it.
- Okay sir.

1086
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:41,296
Surround Manjira Mall.
All the teams now.

1087
01:26:51,533 --> 01:26:53,727
We will come to know
now whether it is a prank..

1088
01:26:53,847 --> 01:26:56,009
..call or really there
is some breaking news.

1089
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:12,009
Sir, we have reached the mall.

1090
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,896
We have seen Shiva
so we are going behind him.

1091
01:27:15,404 --> 01:27:16,745
Get him. Keep a watch on him.

1092
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:18,172
He should not be able to escape.

1093
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,118
Anamika, policies coming. Come on.

1094
01:27:28,215 --> 01:27:30,398
Sir, I have seen him.
He is on the first floor.

1095
01:27:30,518 --> 01:27:31,858
I am running behind him.

1096
01:27:52,733 --> 01:27:53,495
I am sorry, Shiva.

1097
01:27:53,615 --> 01:27:55,536
Shiva is in pink
T-shirt and blue jeans.

1098
01:28:06,952 --> 01:28:08,674
He is going towards back exit.

1099
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,658
All teams reach the back exit.

1100
01:28:15,778 --> 01:28:18,386
I repeat Shivaji is in
pink T-shirt and blue jeans.

1101
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:19,992
In pink t-shirt and blue jeans.

1102
01:28:26,658 --> 01:28:28,025
Sir, we are at the back door.

1103
01:28:28,145 --> 01:28:29,458
Your target is Shivaji.

1104
01:28:29,578 --> 01:28:30,582
There is lot of rush here.

1105
01:28:30,702 --> 01:28:32,137
It is difficult to target Shivaji.

1106
01:28:32,257 --> 01:28:34,357
No problem. Keep looking and finding.

1107
01:28:35,224 --> 01:28:36,658
Pink t-shirt and blue jeans.

1108
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:38,064
Pink t-shirt and blue jeans.

1109
01:28:38,184 --> 01:28:39,554
The target is in front of us, sir.

1110
01:28:39,674 --> 01:28:40,384
Shoot him down.

1111
01:28:40,504 --> 01:28:41,901
Are you sure, sir?

1112
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:43,523
I said shoot him.

1113
01:28:43,643 --> 01:28:46,191
There are many people her.
If someone else is shot at then..

1114
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:48,737
Stupid, shoot him now

1115
01:29:06,302 --> 01:29:07,724
This man is not Shivaji, sir.

1116
01:29:09,274 --> 01:29:11,438
I repeat, this man is not Shivaji.

1117
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:15,124
I had not thought
that they would shoot.

1118
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:18,807
Luckily, he has been
shot just on his hand.

1119
01:29:19,216 --> 01:29:22,161
Police and goons are behind us, Shiv.

1120
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:24,304
Just calm down. Keep walking with me.

1121
01:29:25,707 --> 01:29:28,988
Sir media is present here and are
asking us questions one after another.

1122
01:29:29,108 --> 01:29:30,197
There is lot of tension.

1123
01:29:30,788 --> 01:29:32,918
The media is upset
as public was shot at.

1124
01:29:34,013 --> 01:29:36,045
- This is central minister Rishidev.
- Sir.

1125
01:29:36,165 --> 01:29:37,383
- Can you hear me?
- Yes sir.

1126
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,067
Do as I say.

1127
01:29:41,095 --> 01:29:41,830
Yes sir.

1128
01:29:42,394 --> 01:29:45,002
Yes sir. Okay sir. Sure sir.

1129
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:49,133
Sir, why did police shoot? Tell us.

1130
01:29:49,253 --> 01:29:51,778
- Sir, please we want to know.
- Calm down please.

1131
01:29:53,836 --> 01:29:56,892
Wrong calls were made
to you for the breaking news.

1132
01:29:57,521 --> 01:30:01,196
We had come here to find
Shivaji Shankar and Anamikla Dasari.

1133
01:30:01,316 --> 01:30:04,798
They have murdered someone
for money and have escaped.

1134
01:30:05,102 --> 01:30:07,172
The girl's father has been murdered.

1135
01:30:07,292 --> 01:30:08,728
He was CEO of channel 24

1136
01:30:08,848 --> 01:30:09,962
Mr. Ranganath Dasari.

1137
01:30:10,082 --> 01:30:11,003
What?

1138
01:30:11,346 --> 01:30:13,544
Shivaji used to supply
drugs to that girl.

1139
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:14,810
We had received such information.

1140
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:18,127
Not only this,
but he killed a sub inspector as well.

1141
01:30:18,415 --> 01:30:20,199
They have weapons
and they are dangerous.

1142
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:23,595
To catch them we shot once
and a man has been injured.

1143
01:30:24,329 --> 01:30:26,218
Whosoever will give information
about will be given..

1144
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:29,425
..a reward of 5lakhs
from police department.

1145
01:30:29,545 --> 01:30:32,594
- That's all for now. Thank you.
- Sir..

1146
01:30:35,546 --> 01:30:38,083
Anamika, don't cry. Stop it.

1147
01:30:40,576 --> 01:30:44,561
Let's go and surrender to the police.
Then everything will be fine.

1148
01:30:44,681 --> 01:30:46,971
Don't even think
of surrendering, please.

1149
01:30:55,942 --> 01:30:57,137
Excuse me, is internet working?

1150
01:30:57,257 --> 01:30:59,418
Of course with great speed
because I have taken 25,000/- pack.

1151
01:30:59,684 --> 01:31:00,437
What happened?

1152
01:31:00,942 --> 01:31:02,624
Can I use your laptop for 5 minutes?

1153
01:31:02,744 --> 01:31:05,734
My laptop is worth 3,75,000/- so
you will have to pay 5,000/-to use it.

1154
01:31:05,854 --> 01:31:09,405
Sir it is matter of life and death for
someone. I just have to see the clip.

1155
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:10,928
What kind of clip?

1156
01:31:12,155 --> 01:31:16,047
Sir, I am not at all in that mood.
Please help.

1157
01:31:16,822 --> 01:31:17,646
Take it for free.

1158
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:24,408
Let's hope that the video we were
trying to upload has been uploaded.

1159
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:25,505
Let's see.

1160
01:31:30,763 --> 01:31:33,171
Divert people's attention
from shootout to Shivaji.

1161
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:34,775
Tell this thing to all units.

1162
01:31:34,895 --> 01:31:37,936
Inform all units and no
mistake should be made this time.

1163
01:31:38,056 --> 01:31:39,425
- Sir..
- Divert their attention.

1164
01:31:39,618 --> 01:31:40,748
- Follow my orders.
- Shall I say something to you?

1165
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:41,931
Let's work on it.

1166
01:31:43,354 --> 01:31:44,278
Come with me, sir.

1167
01:31:56,162 --> 01:31:58,342
I have almost cracked this case, sir.

1168
01:31:58,462 --> 01:32:00,639
This case is going
on the wrong track sir.

1169
01:32:01,636 --> 01:32:04,044
All this problem
is because of a video.

1170
01:32:05,443 --> 01:32:09,235
My seniors do not listen to me.
They think I am a junior.

1171
01:32:09,355 --> 01:32:10,829
They do not let me speak.

1172
01:32:11,488 --> 01:32:13,780
That is why I came
directly to tell you sir.

1173
01:32:14,537 --> 01:32:15,871
Think something about me, sir.

1174
01:32:15,991 --> 01:32:17,482
Sure. Go on.

1175
01:32:23,553 --> 01:32:28,700
Look at this. 50 news channels were
called to share the breaking news.

1176
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,517
Do you know who made these calls?

1177
01:32:30,637 --> 01:32:33,002
The one whom we are searching.
Shivaji and Anamika.

1178
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:39,036
If they had committed murder then..

1179
01:32:39,567 --> 01:32:41,831
..why would they call
so many news channels sir?

1180
01:32:42,335 --> 01:32:45,734
I have done some deep investigations
to get answer to this.

1181
01:32:46,587 --> 01:32:48,289
When they had gone to hotel to stay..

1182
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:51,153
..they had paid extra
250/- to buy internet access.

1183
01:32:51,273 --> 01:32:54,235
After one hour of staying
there they uploaded..

1184
01:32:54,355 --> 01:32:56,670
..a video on unlocksmith.com
which is a hacker site.

1185
01:32:59,285 --> 01:33:02,960
To unlock this video
they had checked in the hotel.

1186
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:05,592
By hacking their mail id,
debit card and credit..

1187
01:33:05,712 --> 01:33:08,751
..card I had kept the
video to download sir.

1188
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:10,363
That has been downloaded.

1189
01:33:10,557 --> 01:33:12,311
We can see it together sir.

1190
01:33:15,553 --> 01:33:17,802
Thank God. Yes.

1191
01:33:17,922 --> 01:33:19,445
Video has been uploaded.

1192
01:33:30,524 --> 01:33:32,828
Choco, Choco..

1193
01:33:32,948 --> 01:33:34,025
Choco..

1194
01:33:36,262 --> 01:33:39,699
- Nice.
- He loves you more than me.

1195
01:33:40,026 --> 01:33:41,915
She is actress Neha Sharma.

1196
01:33:42,035 --> 01:33:44,745
And he is IB minister Rishidev.

1197
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:49,706
Today it is too late and tomorrow
I have to go for shoot also.

1198
01:33:49,826 --> 01:33:54,370
Choco..you had given the [party
yesterday because the shoot is over.

1199
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:56,432
That was a different movie
and this is a different movie.

1200
01:33:56,552 --> 01:34:02,002
Don't the director and hero
of that movie flirt with you?

1201
01:34:02,589 --> 01:34:04,948
Everyone knows about
our affair in the industry.

1202
01:34:05,068 --> 01:34:08,622
After knowing this no one
would dare to misbehave with me.

1203
01:34:12,664 --> 01:34:14,843
People should have this fear.

1204
01:34:18,081 --> 01:34:24,343
You are so beautiful that
anyone can fall in love with you.

1205
01:34:24,764 --> 01:34:28,120
At least today your wife..

1206
01:34:28,798 --> 01:34:31,337
My dear why are you
reminding me of that.

1207
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:34,506
- You do not understand.
- What?

1208
01:34:36,117 --> 01:34:38,318
For how many days
will we met like this?

1209
01:34:38,438 --> 01:34:39,902
We will have to tell her.

1210
01:34:41,271 --> 01:34:43,782
I can't do this.
This matter cannot be hidden.

1211
01:34:43,902 --> 01:34:45,671
Forget it, sweetheart.

1212
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:49,768
This is the time to make love.

1213
01:34:50,973 --> 01:34:53,505
You are so hot, baby.

1214
01:34:53,625 --> 01:34:54,598
No, Rishi.

1215
01:34:54,909 --> 01:34:56,667
Today you will have to tell her.

1216
01:34:56,787 --> 01:35:00,667
So what if you are married but we
love each other and this is not wrong.

1217
01:35:01,393 --> 01:35:03,690
When will you divorce your wife?

1218
01:35:06,444 --> 01:35:10,582
So many times I have told
you not to start this topic.

1219
01:35:13,225 --> 01:35:14,512
I will tell her.

1220
01:35:21,071 --> 01:35:23,776
- My dear..
- Rishi, I am pregnant.

1221
01:35:24,966 --> 01:35:25,824
What?

1222
01:35:27,492 --> 01:35:30,239
Seven months from now
you will become a father.

1223
01:35:30,993 --> 01:35:32,466
Doctor has confirmed.

1224
01:35:33,961 --> 01:35:37,075
This is the only matter
so why are you worried for this.

1225
01:35:37,434 --> 01:35:41,987
We will go and get abortion
done tomorrow. Okay.

1226
01:35:49,434 --> 01:35:50,832
What has happened to you?

1227
01:35:50,952 --> 01:35:52,146
What's wrong with you?

1228
01:35:52,266 --> 01:35:55,489
- What do you think I am?
- What is there to think in this, Neha?

1229
01:35:55,609 --> 01:35:58,436
You very well know that I am
married and still you slept with me.

1230
01:35:58,556 --> 01:36:01,729
Will every woman who
sleeps with me become my wife?

1231
01:36:02,685 --> 01:36:04,650
Neha, I said stop it.

1232
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:06,974
Don't be crazy, Neha.

1233
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:13,824
Neha, what's wrong with you?

1234
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:16,003
What has happened to you?

1235
01:36:18,929 --> 01:36:20,520
Bloody, what's wrong with you?

1236
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:21,924
Every time..

1237
01:36:44,008 --> 01:36:46,616
Neha, come on get up.

1238
01:36:50,194 --> 01:36:52,269
Oh my God..

1239
01:37:04,529 --> 01:37:05,221
Kabir..

1240
01:37:17,307 --> 01:37:19,417
Sit in the car. I will do something.

1241
01:37:39,662 --> 01:37:40,478
Let's go sir.

1242
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:43,398
Neha was pregnant.

1243
01:37:44,075 --> 01:37:46,711
I will take care of
postmortem and police.

1244
01:37:46,831 --> 01:37:47,887
You go.

1245
01:38:12,435 --> 01:38:13,549
Oh God..

1246
01:38:14,109 --> 01:38:16,531
Buddy, can I use your pen drive?

1247
01:38:25,463 --> 01:38:29,905
Sir, I did not come
to the office today.

1248
01:38:30,679 --> 01:38:32,202
I did not see this video, sir.

1249
01:38:32,768 --> 01:38:34,844
I did not search anything. Please sir.

1250
01:38:35,197 --> 01:38:37,092
Let me go out from here.

1251
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:41,100
No one will see me.
I have applied for US visa, sir.

1252
01:38:42,636 --> 01:38:45,486
Promise sir. Spare me.

1253
01:39:13,433 --> 01:39:14,506
What happened?

1254
01:39:29,412 --> 01:39:30,170
Damn it.

1255
01:39:34,536 --> 01:39:36,640
Sorry friend,
I will buy you a new laptop.

1256
01:39:40,812 --> 01:39:42,489
I lost 3,75,000/-

1257
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:45,955
Believe me Shiv, let us surrender.

1258
01:39:46,075 --> 01:39:49,105
Why are you again and again
thinking of surrendering, Anamika?

1259
01:39:49,225 --> 01:39:52,122
Surrender would mean death.
Does look fine to you?

1260
01:39:52,242 --> 01:39:56,223
We do not have any proof
that he has killed Neha, Shiva.

1261
01:39:56,343 --> 01:39:58,996
We know this but he does not know it.

1262
01:39:59,699 --> 01:40:01,121
Even if we say he will not agree.

1263
01:40:01,304 --> 01:40:03,346
The fear with which
he has hidden this truth..

1264
01:40:03,585 --> 01:40:06,075
..the same fear will now
force him to speak the truth.

1265
01:40:06,812 --> 01:40:08,428
Listen to my plan carefully.

1266
01:40:18,326 --> 01:40:19,167
Okay.

1267
01:40:19,914 --> 01:40:24,287
Anamika..this is our last fight.

1268
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:28,145
Maybe we never meet again.

1269
01:40:29,291 --> 01:40:31,948
- And even if we meet then also..
- I love you Shiva.

1270
01:40:34,316 --> 01:40:35,390
I love you too.

1271
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:48,255
- Hello..
- Yes police control room.

1272
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:51,603
Is this the number if information
of Shivaji and Anamika is to be given?

1273
01:40:51,723 --> 01:40:53,554
Yes, this is the number.
Tell me what the information is.

1274
01:40:53,674 --> 01:40:56,417
I am Shivaji whom you are finding.

1275
01:40:57,114 --> 01:41:00,297
I want to talk to chief investigating
officer of this case.

1276
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:01,856
Connect the line to ADG.

1277
01:41:11,809 --> 01:41:14,151
Assistant director general
of police Arun Raj here.

1278
01:41:14,271 --> 01:41:15,867
Shivaji, now listen to me.

1279
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:18,916
No, now you listen
to me and don't interrupt.

1280
01:41:19,036 --> 01:41:20,955
Turn off the speaker
and give the phone to..

1281
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,885
..the minister Rishi
who is standing next to you.

1282
01:41:25,957 --> 01:41:26,457
Yes.

1283
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,647
Shall we now stop
playing hide and seek?

1284
01:41:30,623 --> 01:41:31,813
Why? Are you tired?

1285
01:41:32,898 --> 01:41:35,057
I know. This had to happen.

1286
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:39,026
Will you come or shall I come?

1287
01:41:39,146 --> 01:41:42,093
There are rules even in
the video games of small children.

1288
01:41:42,712 --> 01:41:44,467
Let's play by the rules.

1289
01:41:44,587 --> 01:41:46,774
Yup. I love games.

1290
01:41:46,894 --> 01:41:50,555
Kachiguda railway station.
Platform number 1, 9pm

1291
01:41:50,932 --> 01:41:53,611
Bring the cash and
take the memory card.

1292
01:41:53,811 --> 01:41:56,343
At 9:15 I will change
my appearance and reach there.

1293
01:41:56,869 --> 01:41:59,886
By the way tell the commissioner
standing next to you..

1294
01:42:00,635 --> 01:42:03,603
..that there are 600 contacts
present in my phone at present.

1295
01:42:03,902 --> 01:42:07,216
If I see any policeman
on railway station..

1296
01:42:07,644 --> 01:42:12,052
..then by just pressing the
finger I will destroy your future.

1297
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:17,227
By the way Amrican Tourister bag,
2crores cash.

1298
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:24,083
Sir, you are a prime
ministerial candidate.

1299
01:42:24,203 --> 01:42:26,200
It is a risk. Just think over it once.

1300
01:42:26,622 --> 01:42:27,302
No.

1301
01:42:30,162 --> 01:42:34,094
If anything wrong happens
then the risk would be his.

1302
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:36,719
Not mine.

1303
01:42:38,837 --> 01:42:43,348
Because I am prime
ministerial candidate.

1304
01:42:54,378 --> 01:42:56,482
Okay boys, tell me your positions.

1305
01:42:56,602 --> 01:42:58,668
- Porter..
- I am in position, sir.

1306
01:42:59,762 --> 01:43:02,675
- TC..
- I am in position, sir.

1307
01:43:03,852 --> 01:43:06,301
- Passenger.
- I am in position, sir.

1308
01:43:10,591 --> 01:43:11,352
Sir..

1309
01:43:11,472 --> 01:43:13,144
- Is everything fine?
- Yes sir.

1310
01:43:13,372 --> 01:43:15,607
Everything is fine. You can enter.

1311
01:43:15,727 --> 01:43:16,603
I trust you.

1312
01:44:13,809 --> 01:44:16,673
If you remove the muffler then
the video will be on every mobile.

1313
01:44:19,566 --> 01:44:22,942
He has gone without giving
the memory card. He is in red muffler.

1314
01:44:26,243 --> 01:44:28,706
Red muffler, red muffler.
Has anyone been able to see him?

1315
01:44:28,826 --> 01:44:29,799
Sir, I can see him.

1316
01:44:29,919 --> 01:44:31,218
Give me order to shoot.

1317
01:44:31,338 --> 01:44:32,594
That's him. It is confirmed now.

1318
01:44:32,714 --> 01:44:33,957
Come on boys, let's get him.

1319
01:44:42,336 --> 01:44:43,159
Hello.

1320
01:44:46,163 --> 01:44:49,337
If you remove the muffler then
I will spread the video everywhere.

1321
01:44:50,643 --> 01:44:52,304
It is time for your train to leave.

1322
01:44:55,131 --> 01:44:56,091
Move, move..

1323
01:45:05,484 --> 01:45:06,297
Come on surrender.

1324
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:07,603
No, no..

1325
01:45:07,723 --> 01:45:08,762
Surrender..

1326
01:45:09,464 --> 01:45:11,055
Hey. It's me.

1327
01:45:16,123 --> 01:45:19,176
Who called the press?
Who called the press?

1328
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:34,174
- Hello?
- Were you able to see the bomb?

1329
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:38,672
You do not have much time.
That bomb will explode in 30 seconds.

1330
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:43,344
If you throw the bag then
I will explode the bomb right away.

1331
01:45:43,638 --> 01:45:46,931
Decide yourself whether you
want to die now or after 30 seconds.

1332
01:45:47,662 --> 01:45:50,220
You enjoyed a lot troubling me.

1333
01:45:50,475 --> 01:45:52,052
Your time starts now.

1334
01:45:53,015 --> 01:45:56,048
The bomb has been placed in
this and will explode in 30 seconds.

1335
01:45:59,211 --> 01:45:59,953
Run..

1336
01:46:25,728 --> 01:46:27,472
I cannot understand
as to what is happening?

1337
01:46:27,592 --> 01:46:28,658
Everyone get alert.

1338
01:46:28,778 --> 01:46:30,527
Stop Cars..

1339
01:46:30,647 --> 01:46:31,700
Be alert.

1340
01:46:33,982 --> 01:46:36,462
Unit 1 report. Did you stop the train?

1341
01:46:36,582 --> 01:46:38,298
Yes sir, we are trying.

1342
01:46:38,615 --> 01:46:39,500
Sir, the train has stopped.

1343
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:43,612
Good. Unit 1 search the train and unit
2 surround the station from all sides.

1344
01:46:44,251 --> 01:46:46,299
Sir, we searched the entire
train but he was not found anywhere.

1345
01:46:46,419 --> 01:46:47,949
Oh no. then where has he gone?

1346
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:49,615
- Search properly..
- Sir..

1347
01:46:49,735 --> 01:46:51,331
- Listen..
- Look at this sir.

1348
01:46:51,801 --> 01:46:52,969
His phone has been traced.

1349
01:46:53,089 --> 01:46:54,646
They are going towards Vijaynagar.

1350
01:46:57,945 --> 01:46:59,412
Go straight.

1351
01:47:00,481 --> 01:47:01,510
This is the place.

1352
01:47:01,787 --> 01:47:04,527
All units, they have stopped
at Vijaynagar junction.

1353
01:47:04,647 --> 01:47:06,499
Reach there, quickly.
Vijaynagar junction.

1354
01:47:06,619 --> 01:47:08,197
Note it and quickly reach there.

1355
01:47:11,712 --> 01:47:13,074
50meters from here.

1356
01:47:13,194 --> 01:47:14,065
Come on fast, fast..

1357
01:47:14,185 --> 01:47:15,521
- Search..
- Okay sir.

1358
01:47:15,641 --> 01:47:17,784
This is showing 50meters
but where is he.

1359
01:47:18,918 --> 01:47:21,569
Why does it show 50 meters
even when there is no one nearby.

1360
01:47:27,988 --> 01:47:32,881
Shiv, I am asking you once again
as to why you have brought me here.

1361
01:47:33,001 --> 01:47:34,043
I will give you whatever you want.

1362
01:47:34,163 --> 01:47:37,331
Money, position..tell me.

1363
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:39,965
You will get nothing by keeping quiet.

1364
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:45,660
Where is the memory card?
Why don't you tell me?

1365
01:47:51,349 --> 01:47:53,187
Memory card is already broken.

1366
01:47:54,017 --> 01:47:56,093
But you will have
to confess everything.

1367
01:47:56,708 --> 01:47:59,022
- Oh..
- This is my only demand.

1368
01:48:26,753 --> 01:48:29,749
Already this news is being
telecast on all other news channels.

1369
01:48:29,869 --> 01:48:30,699
What should we do?

1370
01:48:32,677 --> 01:48:36,469
Cancel all the programs of our
channel and do live telecast of this.

1371
01:48:36,589 --> 01:48:37,237
Okay sir.

1372
01:48:44,378 --> 01:48:47,014
We searched the entire
building but he is not here, sir.

1373
01:48:47,134 --> 01:48:47,954
Oh..

1374
01:48:53,129 --> 01:48:57,073
You all know him.
He is Rishi Dev, central IB minister.

1375
01:48:57,495 --> 01:48:59,502
But other than that
he is a murderer too.

1376
01:49:00,061 --> 01:49:03,901
A dictator who took power
from public and destroyed the public.

1377
01:49:04,234 --> 01:49:06,175
A rascal who killed
actress Neha Sharma..

1378
01:49:06,295 --> 01:49:08,323
..and then converted
it into gas accident.

1379
01:49:08,443 --> 01:49:10,523
What? I..

1380
01:49:10,788 --> 01:49:12,063
We can see badminton net.

1381
01:49:12,183 --> 01:49:13,512
This looks to be a stadium.
Where is this stadium?

1382
01:49:13,632 --> 01:49:15,743
Sir 2kms from here
is an indoor stadium.

1383
01:49:15,863 --> 01:49:17,317
Then why is it showing 1metrer.

1384
01:49:17,537 --> 01:49:19,339
Call all the units. Immediately.

1385
01:49:26,027 --> 01:49:29,976
To get the CCTC footage
of Neha Sharma murder case..

1386
01:49:30,096 --> 01:49:32,927
..he killed the CEO of
channel 24 Ranganathan Dasari..

1387
01:49:33,402 --> 01:49:35,229
..senior journalist Rajesh..

1388
01:49:35,349 --> 01:49:40,581
..and SI Swami in last 24
hours for his political benefit.

1389
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:46,595
As I hadthat memory card he made
Anamika and me declared as murderers.

1390
01:49:46,983 --> 01:49:51,024
He got the internet of the city stopped
so that the video does not spread.

1391
01:49:51,451 --> 01:49:53,875
He used police like his puppet.

1392
01:49:54,568 --> 01:49:57,070
Because of this commotion
that memory card broke.

1393
01:49:57,247 --> 01:49:59,465
But now he will accept
his crime in front of everyone..

1394
01:49:59,585 --> 01:50:01,924
..or will die in front of everyone.

1395
01:50:02,044 --> 01:50:03,307
Speak, speak..

1396
01:50:04,704 --> 01:50:05,528
What should I speak?

1397
01:50:09,021 --> 01:50:10,809
That what you are saying is right.

1398
01:50:10,929 --> 01:50:16,798
Okay fine but first
you answer my question.

1399
01:50:17,309 --> 01:50:22,152
What is your aim? Has the
opposition party instigated you?

1400
01:50:23,071 --> 01:50:25,119
Or you have the habit of taking drug.

1401
01:50:25,916 --> 01:50:31,723
Shiv, you are young and young people
like you are the future of this country.

1402
01:50:34,062 --> 01:50:36,592
Is it that you have
link with Pakistan?

1403
01:50:37,272 --> 01:50:41,889
Mr. Shiv, my country does
not negotiate with terrorist.

1404
01:50:42,476 --> 01:50:45,271
There is no place for
terrorist in my country.

1405
01:50:45,464 --> 01:50:49,034
I am ready to die
for my country as well.

1406
01:50:49,814 --> 01:50:53,512
Kill me. In fact I
will be thankful to you.

1407
01:50:53,738 --> 01:50:56,295
It is my good luck that
I am dying for my country.

1408
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:59,405
My country is dear
to me than my family.

1409
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:02,195
I just love my country, man.

1410
01:51:02,959 --> 01:51:03,459
Kill me.

1411
01:51:03,511 --> 01:51:07,309
Enough of it. You start your
drama the moment you see the camera.

1412
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:12,893
How many coverings you have? From
morning to night just acting and lies.

1413
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:15,513
You cannot see the progress of others.

1414
01:51:16,194 --> 01:51:18,391
You are the one who cheat people.

1415
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:20,539
You have so much property
and still you are greedy.

1416
01:51:20,738 --> 01:51:22,502
There is selfishness
in everything that you talk.

1417
01:51:22,622 --> 01:51:24,046
There is cheating in every step.

1418
01:51:24,273 --> 01:51:26,371
You have even cheated
your wife and children.

1419
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,945
There is no place for faith and truth.

1420
01:51:30,464 --> 01:51:34,701
You have changed for the people,
of the people..

1421
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:38,896
..by the people to for my property,
for my pleasure and for my position.

1422
01:51:39,543 --> 01:51:43,646
People like you are spreading
like cancer in the society.

1423
01:51:43,917 --> 01:51:47,664
Forget it.
Stop the drama and come to the point.

1424
01:51:48,464 --> 01:51:53,570
I am ready to die but you decide
whether you want to live or die.

1425
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:55,210
Now there will be no countdown.

1426
01:51:55,411 --> 01:51:59,839
Now only my bullet
or your mouth will speak.

1427
01:51:59,959 --> 01:52:01,777
Now public will decide.

1428
01:52:02,586 --> 01:52:03,880
What is happening?

1429
01:52:41,507 --> 01:52:44,392
I am a dictator. Yes I am a dictator.

1430
01:52:44,966 --> 01:52:47,921
I killed Neha Sharma.
I killed Neha Sharma..

1431
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:50,251
I killed Neha Sharma.

1432
01:52:51,496 --> 01:52:54,582
I am saying it in front of police.
Now say what you will do.

1433
01:52:54,702 --> 01:52:56,941
I killed Neha Sharma.

1434
01:52:57,061 --> 01:52:58,304
I killed Neha Sharma.

1435
01:52:58,424 --> 01:53:01,321
This young man will scare me?

1436
01:53:01,585 --> 01:53:03,397
Will he teach the future PM?

1437
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:06,573
This is called political power.

1438
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:11,705
And in front of a powerful man like me
a common man like you has no status.

1439
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:12,750
- Arun..
- Sir.

1440
01:53:13,179 --> 01:53:17,365
Don't kill him.
Don't kill him but kill the girl.

1441
01:53:17,485 --> 01:53:19,315
And then show that video to him.

1442
01:53:19,435 --> 01:53:22,920
So that he flutters in her
memory and die wretchedly in the jail.

1443
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,581
He should die there.
He should die there.

1444
01:53:29,009 --> 01:53:29,943
Take him.

1445
01:53:51,857 --> 01:53:52,957
He had come to kill me.

1446
01:53:58,106 --> 01:53:59,668
But why did he smile looking at me?

1447
01:54:04,136 --> 01:54:07,899
I killed Neha Sharma.
I killed Neha Sharma..

1448
01:54:09,216 --> 01:54:12,586
I am saying it in front of police.
Now say what you will do.

1449
01:54:12,772 --> 01:54:15,194
Don't kill him.
Don't kill him but kill the girl.

1450
01:54:15,314 --> 01:54:16,847
And then show that video to him.

1451
01:54:16,967 --> 01:54:20,200
So that he flutters in her
memory and die wretchedly in the jail.

1452
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:24,154
I killed Neha Sharma.
I killed Neha Sharma..

1453
01:54:24,656 --> 01:54:25,253
Yes..

1454
01:54:25,373 --> 01:54:27,640
So that he flutters in her
memory and die wretchedly in the jail.

1455
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,096
- Sir, home minister is on line.
- I killed Neha Sharma.

1456
01:54:30,216 --> 01:54:32,120
- I killed Neha Sharma..
- Arrest him.

1457
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,204
Yes sir.
I will inform the security chief.

1458
01:54:34,324 --> 01:54:37,110
- This is called political power.
- Yes, tell me.

1459
01:54:41,064 --> 01:54:42,293
Sir, there is a phone for you.

1460
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:46,217
Yes, this is security chief Malcolm.

1461
01:54:49,687 --> 01:54:50,694
Are you sure sir?

1462
01:54:53,629 --> 01:54:54,609
Okay right sir.

1463
01:54:55,153 --> 01:54:56,028
Stop the car.

1464
01:55:02,937 --> 01:55:04,803
Yes, I am going towards his car.

1465
01:55:06,407 --> 01:55:07,611
- Sir..
- Yes..

1466
01:55:07,731 --> 01:55:08,431
Please.

1467
01:55:29,295 --> 01:55:31,869
Button camera with
wireless 3G transmission.

1468
01:55:31,989 --> 01:55:35,997
One click and by going to button
camera.com putting serial number..

1469
01:55:36,117 --> 01:55:38,729
..whatever will be recorded
in camera will be seen online.

1470
01:55:44,617 --> 01:55:48,138
High walls of jail
are not for me but for you.

1471
01:55:48,443 --> 01:55:50,719
The one who starts
the war does not win.

1472
01:55:50,906 --> 01:55:52,802
The one who ends the war wins.

1473
01:55:53,653 --> 01:55:55,480
Enjoy your time in jail.

1474
01:56:07,489 --> 01:56:08,230
Shiva..

1475
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,461
Sir, sir please tell us how..

1476
01:56:12,581 --> 01:56:13,418
Sir.. sir..

1477
01:56:13,538 --> 01:56:15,137
Why he did that?

1478
01:56:15,257 --> 01:56:16,477
Sir please tell something..

1479
01:56:16,597 --> 01:56:18,391
Sir.. sir..

1480
01:56:29,358 --> 01:56:31,555
I should be giving these
2crores to government.

1481
01:56:31,843 --> 01:56:33,920
But I saw only your
father really working..

1482
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,723
..for the government
in the last two days.

1483
01:56:36,815 --> 01:56:37,894
Who are you?

1484
01:56:40,076 --> 01:56:41,493
From today think of
m as your elder brother.

1485
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,683
So where should we go.

1486
01:56:49,164 --> 01:56:49,972
To our home.

1487
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,817
Where? My home. I will not go.

1488
01:56:52,937 --> 01:56:54,710
Okay then let's go to my place.

1489
01:56:55,447 --> 01:56:57,440
Your and my house is the same.

1490
01:56:59,791 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then let's go.
