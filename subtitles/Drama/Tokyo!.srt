1
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,385
It rained for months on end.

2
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,198
The whole of Tokyo was flooded.

3
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,235
The damage
ran to billions of yen,

4
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,400
and the dead and missing
numbered in their millions.

5
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,600
The survivors

6
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:26,509
all mutated into
strange amphibian monsters,

7
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:31,778
adapting quickly to the
suddenly changing climate.

8
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,784
We're all going to die!

9
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:37,483
No, we'll mutate.

10
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:40,127
We mustn't breed!

11
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:43,130
Think what the children
would look like.

12
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,632
No, actually,

13
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:47,500
the horniness is
part of the mutation.

14
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:48,899
That's why the species
is so successful

15
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:54,704
from an evolutionary
point of view.

16
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:58,407
<i>- Hello?
- Hiroko, where are you?</i>

17
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:00,549
No, we're not lost,

18
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,351
just stuck in traffic.

19
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,377
<i>- Where are you?
- Right now...</i>

20
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:09,625
<i>- We've just passed Shinsencho.
- You're almost here.</i>

21
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,927
<i>- OK, talk to you in a bit.
- OK.</i>

22
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:13,929
Yeah, see you.

23
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:17,133
Are we going the right way?

24
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:20,196
Look at the map.

25
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:25,809
Sorry.

26
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:27,711
Sorry.

27
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:42,483
We're already... there,
I think.

28
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,892
<i>Really?</i>

29
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,191
<i>Where? What color is your car?</i>

30
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,996
It's silver.

31
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:52,398
A Honda.

32
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:55,103
Well,
more like gray, really.

33
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:59,207
<i>I've got a red umbrella.</i>

34
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,408
A red umbrella?

35
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:03,811
Spin it round.

36
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:05,809
<i>I'll try.</i>

37
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:09,683
<i>I'm spinning it, I'm spinning it.
Can't you see me?</i>

38
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:12,007
Now jump.

39
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:15,988
<i>Jump? OK, here I go...</i>

40
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,394
Now on one leg.

41
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,404
- Akemi!
- Hiroko!

42
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,012
- Here, towels.
- Thanks.

43
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,486
In Tokyo...

44
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:48,892
the bigger the
company you work for...

45
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,592
the smaller
the flat you get.

46
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:54,801
You should work
for a smaller company.

47
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:59,399
My company's
already pretty small.

48
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:04,108
- It's a nice place.
- You think so?

49
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:06,307
You still have Saburo, then?

50
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,017
Little Saburo!

51
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:13,411
It's raining tonight,
so your car should be OK.

52
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:15,458
But you can't leave it.

53
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,516
There's a hardware store

54
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:21,897
just over there. Park in front...
It's been closed for a while.

55
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:35,308
<i>AKEMI SHIMIZU</i>

56
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:40,006
Now for this week's episode
of 'Where Are They Now? '

57
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,813
Akira, what are you doing now?

58
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,523
Well... I'm a filmmaker.

59
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,095
He's just made a film
that he's showing around.

60
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,390
The film's about...

61
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:56,294
...is the main thing.
Please go and see it.

62
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,194
This is it.

63
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:06,403
But this is...
a porno theater.

64
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,714
It's a real theater, then!

65
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,115
It'll be dark and quiet.

66
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:18,118
You shouldn't have cut
my sex scene after all!

67
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,327
Are you making pornos?

68
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,692
No, that was a joke.

69
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:29,998
I had a part for Hiroko,
but she turned it down.

70
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:32,504
What a pity. No ambition!

71
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,303
Right!
That's her problem exactly.

72
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,413
Why did you pass up
the chance to be a star?

73
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:42,808
I don't like the sound
of my own voice.

74
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,508
It sounds like this.

75
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:47,918
I can't wait to see it.

76
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,717
- Really?
- Yes.

77
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:51,622
How about now?

78
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,628
- I've got the DVD here.
- She might be tired.

79
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:59,292
No, let's watch it now.
It's not too intellectual, is it?

80
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:04,998
<i>There are so many lives
in the future.</i>

81
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:12,313
<i>Assuming we haven't
destroyed ourselves first</i>

82
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,507
<i>we could live on
after the end of the solar system.</i>

83
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:21,318
<i>In the infinity
of new souls created</i>

84
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,626
<i>there's no reason that one
shouldn't be me again.</i>

85
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,109
Sorry.

86
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,614
I have to get up early
in the morning.

87
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,227
- Can you help me with this?
- This?

88
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:01,026
I liked the bit I saw, though.

89
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,902
You can change in
the bathroom.

90
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:07,401
Hiroko, can you pull that side?

91
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:14,447
I hope you'll be all right.
I'm sorry it's so cramped.

92
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:15,813
It's fine.

93
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,407
'A good soldier must suffer
with pride,' right?

94
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:24,514
'Enduring the unendurable.
Suffering the... '

95
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,717
Stop it, stupid!

96
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,828
Seriously, though. Thanks.

97
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:35,169
We'll start looking for
an apartment tomorrow.

98
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:40,003
My boyfriend's staying next
Sunday. He's driving from Nagoya.

99
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:45,603
His uncle works in advertising.

100
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:48,012
Shall I ask him
to come and see your film?

101
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,813
You think
he'd come from Nagoya?

102
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:54,155
Of course not!
That's my side.

103
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:56,358
His uncle lives in Tokyo.

104
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,417
I'm switching it off.

105
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,529
All that way, for your movie!

106
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:02,632
Three, two, one...

107
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,631
- Good night!
- Good night.

108
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:07,670
Don't forget
to move your car tomorrow.

109
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,298
The fines are huge.

110
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,210
I'm glad it's raining.

111
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:52,511
<i>Don't forget to move your car</i>

112
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:05,321
Look.

113
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,028
We'll be OK until Friday.

114
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:13,138
<i>CLOSED UNTIL FRIDAY
NOVEMBER 16TH</i>

115
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:19,029
What are you doing?
It'll go up if we don't pay.

116
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:22,206
We're not kids anymore.

117
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,912
Cover me!
I'm going into the safe!

118
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,614
Copy that!

119
00:10:29,556 --> 00:10:33,617
We can't make any more mistakes.
Our budget's tight as it is.

120
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:40,729
To rent an apartment...
Say the rent is 30,000...

121
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:44,738
We'd need a deposit
of two months' rent.

122
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,437
In all, we'd need...

123
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:51,511
We would need
400,000 yen in advance.

124
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:00,415
It's a good place
for young couples.

125
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:18,031
Who are you? Let me out!

126
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:21,042
It's popular with young couples.

127
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:23,010
Do you like the view?

128
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,809
Nice dead cat.

129
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,719
Something smells like shit!

130
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:32,015
I can't live in a dump like that.

131
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,426
There wasn't any soap left
in Akemi's place.

132
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,923
Do you think it's a hotel?

133
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,532
I didn't mean that.

134
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,035
My bad. Let's go and
buy some soap now.

135
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,336
What's wrong? Are you mad?

136
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,939
It's nothing.

137
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,809
Come on, what is it?

138
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,312
You said I have no ambition.

139
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,915
What?

140
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,017
Yesterday. You said
I have no ambition at all.

141
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,026
I said that?

142
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,923
It's not true.
I like photography and art.

143
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,938
I've got a boating license,
and I read a lot too.

144
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:25,639
But they're hobbies.
They're not the same as ambitions.

145
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,145
What's the difference?

146
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,208
You have to be able to define...

147
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,014
who you are in the world
by what you do.

148
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:38,218
What I like to do
defines who I am.

149
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,420
Doesn't that make me
a richer person?

150
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:43,827
You still have to be better at it
than others.

151
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,931
Something's wrong.

152
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:52,438
Something's wrong
with these buildings.

153
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:55,736
They refuse all physical contact
with each other.

154
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,039
You're always
say something clever

155
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:03,753
to avoid really talking.

156
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:08,520
Every night, flat ghosts
slide in and out of these gaps.

157
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,523
And wander about the city...

158
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:16,366
They wander about the city,

159
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,031
scaring the people shitless.

160
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,631
The authorities
fill in the gaps with concrete,

161
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:24,934
but the buildings
keep moving apart,

162
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:28,554
letting the flat creatures
take over.

163
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:34,246
I could make them
out of paper.

164
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,018
All right, what's the matter?

165
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm listening.

166
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:47,365
I'm ready
for a dramatic conversation.

167
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,425
with flashbacks
and a big climax...

168
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:51,832
You've stopped
listening already.

169
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,440
You're the one who's 'dramatic'!

170
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,837
I'm listening.

171
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:04,750
But we're talking a lot.

172
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,764
That's not true!

173
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,436
Maybe you're right.

174
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:30,035
I don't think I know
what I'm doing.

175
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,043
What, here?

176
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:36,946
No, in general.

177
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,660
You take things too seriously.

178
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:48,526
Where's your sense of humor?

179
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:58,436
There are
these two poisonous snakes.

180
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:03,143
One says to the other.

181
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:07,947
'We're poisonous, aren't we? '

182
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:11,554
So the other one says

183
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:14,749
'Of course we are.
Why do you ask? '

184
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:19,727
And the first snake says

185
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:23,731
'I've just bitten my tongue! '

186
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:41,341
<i>PART-TIME JOB AVAILABLE
WRAPPING PURCHASES</i>

187
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:42,453
A part-time job.

188
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,351
We could work here.

189
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,458
No, they'll pay peanuts!

190
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:51,062
It'd take two weeks
to pay off the parking fine!

191
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,224
Wait till you find a real job.

192
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,833
I want to keep busy.

193
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,069
Anyway, I have no ambition.

194
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,836
so it's a perfectjob for me.
Come on!

195
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,819
I did it without thinking
and got the job.

196
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,226
Only you, Akira?

197
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:27,334
But Hiroko's dog was great.

198
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:29,026
They are stupid.

199
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,536
It wasn't great.

200
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:31,933
And it was a cat.

201
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:36,176
You're better off
doing something else.

202
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:37,878
I won't work there long.

203
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,440
How long do you
plan to stay here?

204
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:47,144
- We haven't really...
- We saw a nice place today.

205
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:50,349
We have a good chance
of getting it.

206
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,361
Yes, a really good chance!

207
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,226
Where?

208
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:02,638
Tokyo...

209
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:52,390
No boyfriends, no pets.

210
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:54,653
Is there anyone
who actually checks?

211
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:06,538
Don't wrap two together.

212
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:10,642
Hello.

213
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:23,747
There seem to be some residents

217
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:53,748
So I wrap nine boxes
with just one roll of paper.

218
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:56,588
But she says I should do eleven.

219
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:59,649
How am I supposed to do that?
Even ten is impossible.

220
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:02,656
What's the matter?

221
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:06,061
The car was stolen today.

222
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,359
What?

223
00:20:09,203 --> 00:20:11,262
All our equipment was in it.

224
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:13,668
What about the screening?

225
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:16,576
I'm screwed!

226
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:18,579
No, you're not.

227
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:22,943
Yesterday, I moved everything
into the apartment.

228
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,552
I didn't like leaving it out there.

229
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:28,951
Akemi was upset
so I forgot to tell you.

230
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:32,153
Great thinking!

231
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:35,760
The smoke machine too?

232
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:43,662
I just told you.
There's the 15,000-yen fine

233
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:47,109
plus a 14,000-yen towing fee.

234
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,938
I don't have 29,000 yen. But
I need my things from the car.

235
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:57,545
Can you take me to it
so I can get my stuff?

236
00:20:57,688 --> 00:21:00,748
Not until you pay the money.

237
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:02,859
We're open until six.

238
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:04,756
It's still my car!

239
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,955
Not until you pay the money,
it's not.

240
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,358
Let's just say
there's 29,000 yen in the car.

241
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:18,108
If you just show me where it is

242
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,810
I can get
the money and pay you.

243
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,374
What do you say?

244
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,953
What'll happen to it
if I don't pay?

245
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:41,262
Make? Color?

246
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:42,864
Year?

247
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:45,660
Thank you.

248
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:48,361
I hate him. He's a cavity!

249
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:51,070
He's got bad teeth?

250
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:54,267
No, I mean he's a cavity himself.

251
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,379
Last year
he caught pneumonia.

252
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,047
Too bad,
he has a good doctor!

253
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,350
All that stuff?

254
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:13,756
Here you go!
Put it in here, please.

255
00:23:13,898 --> 00:23:16,365
Where shall I put this?

256
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,660
Look!

257
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:07,881
<i>There are so many lives

258
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:20,063
<i>Assuming we haven't

259
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:24,660

261
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,779

00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:36,577
<i>at the edge of the event horizon.</i>

263
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:44,054
<i>then tossed in

264
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,583
Great! I've never seen smoke
used like that in a film before.

265
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:15,282
No, Lucy.

266
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,696
It's the first time smoke's been
used that way 'outside' a film.

267
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:22,359
Using smoke 'inside' films
is so common.

268
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:26,162
I want to force
the audience's involvement

269
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:28,362
by breaking through
the surface of the screen.

270
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:30,974
The audience shouldn't feel safe.

271
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,971
Pleased to meet you.

272
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:36,972
It got to me, eh?

273
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:40,976
You should come
to my office sometime.

274
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,886
We usually do advertising
for medical products.

275
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:48,789
But we get more
creative sometimes.

276
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:51,358
Thanks.

277
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:55,661
I'll think about it. I'm
considering a few options right now.

278
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:00,472
Nice work! Pretty funny.

279
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,165
Really?

280
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:04,577
Being funny is the hardest.

281
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:07,774
I'm going for a beer.

282
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,083
Excuse me.

283
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:14,383
- I'll pass this on.
- Thank you.

284
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:18,091
You should be in films.

285
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:21,286
Come off it! Not me.

286
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:26,158
- Were you in the film?
- That's not me.

287
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,967
I'm more in transportation.
I helped with the editing too.

288
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:37,170
- Are you a filmmaker too?
- No, I'm just the girlfriend.

289
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,280
You must be a good one.

290
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,280
Relationships with artists
are tough.

291
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,477
They can be demanding.

292
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:48,186
I once went out with a painter.
He was always working

293
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:51,884
or talking about his work.
I felt invisible.

294
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,362
But when he had an opening,
with all those people.

295
00:26:56,499 --> 00:27:01,368
I realized his art was more
important than my problems.

296
00:27:27,432 --> 00:27:29,457
You said
they'd be out tonight.

297
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:32,468
Not so loud.

298
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:37,268
I told them you were coming.
I thought they'd understand.

299
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:42,676
Apparently not! One extra
person is bad enough, but two...

300
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:44,976
Don't say that.

301
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:48,986
They're my friends.
I have to help them.

302
00:27:49,122 --> 00:27:52,285
They're just
taking advantage of you.

303
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:56,794
You're not helping them.
All you're doing is indulging them.

304
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,992
Your 'friend' doesn't think he has
to work because he's an 'artist'.

305
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:04,468
My uncle won't hire him.

306
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:06,971
He thinks he's an idiot.

307
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:10,966
Akira's not an idiot.
He's even got a job.

308
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:12,874
Hiroko is the problem.

309
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,880
She just hangs around all day

310
00:28:16,016 --> 00:28:19,180
cutting pictures
out of my magazines.

311
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,395
Cold.

312
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:45,893
What the...

313
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:49,505
Did you see that?

314
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:41,921

is having a good time with it.</i>

324
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,297
<i>I wonder how Akemi's doing.</i>

325
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:28,202
And guys show up,
so scary...

326
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:46,018
<i>I tried to fold this letter
into an elegant yacht,</i>

327
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:49,889
<i>but I got it totally wrong.</i>

328
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:54,898
<i>You know
how useless I am at origami.</i>

329
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,705
<i>As for me.</i>

330
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:08,310
<i>living between the buildings
with the ghosts.</i>

331
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:12,413
<i>Just kidding!</i>

332
00:36:15,355 --> 00:36:19,725
<i>My life isn't that extraordinary.</i>

333
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,998
<i>I'm fine.</i>

334
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:39,603
<i>That's all
I wanted to tell you, really.</i>

335
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,193
<i>And I'm doing</i>

336
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:59,297
<i>all the things</i>

337
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:02,305
<i>I ever wanted to do.</i>

338
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,305
<i>In fact</i>

339
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:11,005
<i>I've never in all my life</i>

340
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,515
<i>felt so useful.</i>

341
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:35,425
That guy!

342
00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:06,023
- Who is that guy?
- He's 'The Creature from the Sewer. '

343
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:33,528
Hey!

344
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,429
Somebody help!

345
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:46,134
He's the Creature from the Sewer.

346
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:47,538
He's coming.

347
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:50,613
Run!

348
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:53,413
Please call the cop!

349
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,221
Call the police!

350
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,228
Get him, get him!

351
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,630
Tokyo is afraid.

352
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:28,143
Who is this creature who for
the past 2 weeks has been

353
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:32,117
terrifying citizens all over
Tokyo and then vanishing?

354
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:38,620
The media are calling him
'The Creature from the Sewers. '

355
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:41,924
A few shocked eyewitnesses

356
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:47,331
have managed to film him
on their cell phones.

357
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:51,140
Just watch, Mr. Nomoto...

358
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:53,242
His gait

359
00:42:53,377 --> 00:42:56,539
his insane beard

360
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,045
his milky eye...

361
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:07,016
<i>I wanted to run away too</i>

362
00:43:07,157 --> 00:43:10,924
<i>but I was so scared,
I couldn't move.</i>

363
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:17,330
<i>He came towards me...
and then he... he licked me.</i>

364
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:24,842
<i>He was disgusting...</i>

365
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,447
<i>Sorry.</i>

366
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,649
<i>His eye was like this</i>

367
00:43:31,783 --> 00:43:34,651
<i>his beard went like this</i>

368
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:41,716
<i>and he walked like this...</i>

369
00:43:41,861 --> 00:43:44,830
<i>I was so afraid...</i>

370
00:43:45,264 --> 00:43:48,529
<i>He was walking like this...</i>

371
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,636
<i>And smoking like that...</i>

372
00:43:51,772 --> 00:43:56,732
The police are still searching
the sewers and underground.

373
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:11,164
There.

374
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:26,545
There he is.

375
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:28,350
Don't move!

376
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:34,762
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

377

389
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:12,164
<i>Under interrogation

390

<i>All he eats is flowers,</i>

- There!
- Here! Here!

408
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:30,272
- Mr. Voland!
- Please say something!

409

Sir.

415
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:57,885
<i>I asked him if he realized
that it's likely he'll be hanged.</i>

416
00:59:04,435 --> 00:59:06,800
And what did he reply?

417
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:14,368
He said, 'No, I don't want to. '

418
00:59:15,313 --> 00:59:17,782
Did you ask him his name?

419
00:59:20,618 --> 00:59:26,489
<i>He said, 'Call me Merde. ' Which sounds
very like the French word 'merde'.</i>

<i>Merde?</i>

421
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:30,277
Shit

422
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:40,406
<i>Following the Merde case,
the Japanese government</i>

423
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:43,770
<i>to toughen
immigration regulations.</i>

424
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:47,179
<i>Inside Japan,
there have been attacks</i>

<i>Mr. Merde,

<i>will be defended

428
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:04,188
<i>one of the only
three people in the world.</i>

429
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:08,097
<i>who can speak
the same language as Mr. Merde.</i>

430
01:00:08,736 --> 01:00:15,107
<i>Mr. Voland has already declared
that he will plead insanity</i>

431
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:18,474
<i>and irresponsibility
at the time of the offense.</i>

432
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,690
Let us move on to the motive
for this heinous act

433
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:34,092
if such a motive can exist.

434
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,898
Could you tell us

435
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:43,097
why you took the lives
of so many innocent people?

436
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,686
<i>'I don't like innocent people. '</i>

437
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,386
<i>'I don't like people. '</i>

438
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:11,900
So what...
you're going to kill us all?

439
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:14,300
Wouldn't it have been simpler

440
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:19,809
since you like no one,
for you to kill yourself?

441
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:32,087
<i>'But I love life, imbecile! '</i>

442
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:35,894
What?

443
01:01:36,028 --> 01:01:37,689
Silence!

444
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:40,790
Silence!

445
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:47,806
Maitre, instruct your client
the court will not be insulted!

446
01:01:47,941 --> 01:01:52,401
At least modern terrorists
have the decency

447
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:55,410
to blow themselves up
with their victims.

448
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:03,387
<i>'And among all people,</i>

449

450
01:02:11,432 --> 01:02:13,400
Disgusting?

451
01:02:14,136 --> 01:02:18,504
I understand now.

452
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,009
You should know that in Japan,

453
01:02:21,143 --> 01:02:24,703
we don't really like
racist foreigners.

454
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:28,907
Besides,
nobody forced you to come

455
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:31,178
and live in our country!

456
01:02:45,335 --> 01:02:47,496
<i>'Yes. My god did. '</i>

457
01:02:58,948 --> 01:03:04,979
<i>'My god always places me</i>

458

<i>among the people

459
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:11,525
<i>'It's the cross I have to bear. '</i>

460
01:03:19,137 --> 01:03:21,901
So I ask you, Mr. Merde.

461
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,908
what do you have
against the Japanese?

462
01:03:43,729 --> 01:03:45,492
<i>'They live way too long. '</i>

463
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:48,293
<i>'And their eyes are shaped
like a woman's sex. '</i>

464
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:50,402
<i>'It's totally disgusting. '</i>

465
01:04:02,149 --> 01:04:05,711
Silence!

466
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:15,896
And Mr. Merde thinks
that 'he' is quite appealing?

467
01:04:31,046 --> 01:04:37,110
<i>'I don't know.
But if I knew, I'd answer yes. '</i>

468
01:04:54,238 --> 01:05:01,007
<i>I've never looked at myself.
My god forbids mirrors. '</i>

469
01:05:02,545 --> 01:05:05,913
<i>'But my mother,
who was gorgeous</i>

470
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,814
<i>used to say
I was a pretty little boy. '</i>

471
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,087
Well...

472
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:25,295
then your mother...
sorely deceived you, Mr. Merde!

473
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:50,990
<i>He won't talk to you anymore.
He says, 'It's not interesting. '</i>

474
01:06:10,251 --> 01:06:13,118
<i>'My mother was a saint! '</i>

475
01:06:13,655 --> 01:06:15,418
<i>'You all...</i>

476

01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:23,392
<i>'And I am your son! '</i>

478
01:06:30,438 --> 01:06:31,804
Warders!

479
01:06:33,242 --> 01:06:35,301
Make the defendant sit!

480
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,614
Silence!

481
01:06:44,753 --> 01:06:51,922
Defendant, do you understand
that you risk the death penalty?

482
01:07:27,866 --> 01:07:30,393
'No. 'I don't want that.
'I'm against it. '

483
01:07:35,942 --> 01:07:42,404
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

484
01:07:42,547 --> 01:07:48,817
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

485
01:07:48,955 --> 01:07:55,121
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

486
01:07:55,262 --> 01:07:59,926
Hang Merde! Hang Merde!

487
01:08:00,066 --> 01:08:06,404
Free Merde! Free Merde!

488
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:13,310
Free Merde! Free Merde!

489
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:20,012
Free Merde! Free Merde!

490
01:08:21,756 --> 01:08:28,320
<i>Today, the Pope condemned
Mr. Merde's appalling crimes.</i>

491
01:08:28,464 --> 01:08:33,925
<i>In Japan, ultra-nationalists
are violently demonstrating</i>

492
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:36,004
<i>to demand the death penalty.</i>

493
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:43,505
<i>But in the eyes of many
Mr. Merde has become a star.</i>

494
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,128
<i>The trial's outcome
will be announced tomorrow.</i>

495
01:09:00,163 --> 01:09:08,833
<i>CONDEMNED TO DEATH!</i>

496
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:18,712
<i>THREE YEARS LATER</i>

497
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:57,117
<i>He wants you to warn your client
he'll be hanged in an hour.</i>

498
01:10:04,064 --> 01:10:06,624
<i>He said, 'No. '</i>

499
01:10:13,374 --> 01:10:16,400
<i>Ask him what he wants
for his last meal.</i>

500
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,117
<i>'Flowers... and cash. '</i>

501
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:42,431
<i>He's asking for a last cigarette.</i>

502
01:10:50,047 --> 01:10:52,015
<i>Non smoking</i>

503
01:12:27,783 --> 01:12:29,614
What's he doing?

504
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:35,323
He's praying.

505
01:12:58,682 --> 01:13:00,047
Execute.

506
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,241
Dead.

507
01:14:10,457 --> 01:14:12,221
- It's over.
- Yes.

508
01:14:13,761 --> 01:14:15,126
It's over.

509
01:15:06,584 --> 01:15:10,043
<i>The sky has grown old.</i>

510
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:30,533
He's gone!

511
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:49,051
<i>Coming soon:
the adventures of Mr. Merde in NY</i>

512
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:58,331
<i>Directed by Leos Carax</i>

513
01:16:42,184 --> 01:16:46,348
<i>How long will it take
before this circle disappears?</i>

514
01:16:48,592 --> 01:16:51,959
<i>10 seconds, 10 minutes,</i>

515
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,259
<i>10 hours, 10 days,</i>

516
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:58,425
<i>10 months, 10 years...</i>

517
01:17:01,372 --> 01:17:04,829
<i>I've been living in this house
for 10 years.</i>

518
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:09,700
<i>I am a hikikomori.</i>

519
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:24,961
<i>Usually, hikikomoris live
at the expense of their parents.</i>

520
01:17:25,097 --> 01:17:27,964
<i>But I live alone.</i>

521
01:17:29,101 --> 01:17:31,536
<i>Defecating with the door open,
I don't care.</i>

522
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,934
<i>Falling asleep while defecating,</i>

523
01:17:34,072 --> 01:17:35,835
<i>I don't care.</i>

524
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:42,443
<i>Strangely,
I don't watch television.</i>

525
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:45,547
<i>When was the last time
I watched it?</i>

526
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:52,355
<i>However,
I feed myself every day.</i>

527
01:17:53,393 --> 01:17:55,157
<i>I don't need a table.</i>

528
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:03,135
<i>Those who are sensitive
would have noticed,</i>

529
01:18:03,671 --> 01:18:07,374
<i>but my own way of tidying up,
practiced for 10 years</i>

530
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,344
<i>has now reached
the level of art.</i>

531
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:17,244
<i>It's hard to believe,</i>

532
01:18:18,286 --> 01:18:21,551
<i>but I have read all these books.</i>

533
01:18:24,893 --> 01:18:31,662
<i>Lately, reading magazines about
climbing, fishing and travelling</i>

534
01:18:32,401 --> 01:18:34,369
<i>suddenly makes me miss home.</i>

535
01:18:38,074 --> 01:18:42,443
<i>I never get into the room
that my father used.</i>

536
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,943
<i>The envelope of money
my father sends.</i>

537
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:48,745
<i>I open it every month.</i>

538
01:18:49,886 --> 01:18:54,255
<i>The first year
money came with a letter.</i>

539
01:18:54,992 --> 01:18:56,755
<i>For the next 9 years</i>

540
01:18:57,894 --> 01:18:59,555
<i>only money.</i>

541
01:19:01,898 --> 01:19:04,060
<i>Brand new crisp banknotes.</i>

542
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:07,361
<i>How exciting.</i>

543
01:19:09,107 --> 01:19:12,543
<i>With money and a telephone,
everything is OK</i>

544
01:19:12,678 --> 01:19:14,646
<i>as everything
can be delivered.</i>

545
01:19:15,781 --> 01:19:18,442
<i>The bell is ringing. I open the door.</i>

546
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:20,848
<i>I take. I give.</i>

547
01:19:20,986 --> 01:19:22,247
<i>I close the door.</i>

548
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:26,956
<i>With the delivery men.</i>

549
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:29,754
<i>I never make eye contact.</i>

550
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:36,162
<i>On Saturdays, I always order a pizza.</i>

551
01:19:36,602 --> 01:19:39,765
So you never look at
people's faces?

552
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:40,964
<i>Right.</i>

553
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:46,036
<i>I hated having contact
with people.</i>

554
01:19:52,585 --> 01:19:55,749
<i>I hated having contact
with the sunlight too.</i>

555
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:10,564
<i>I like watching the sunlight.</i>

556
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,178
<i>I can see it...</i>

557
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,646
<i>The movement of the sunlight.</i>

558
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,952
<i>Others may not</i>

559
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:37,257
<i>but I can even see
the hour hand moving.</i>

560
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:46,372
<i>Everything is moving.</i>

561
01:20:52,683 --> 01:21:00,454
<i>It has been 10 years
since I last moved.</i>

562
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:21,271
<i>It has been 11 years</i>

563
01:21:22,113 --> 01:21:24,344
<i>living in the house.</i>

564
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:34,254
<i>Strictly speaking.</i>

565
01:21:36,295 --> 01:21:37,853
<i>I am a hikikomori.</i>

566
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:44,861
<i>I digest better.</i>

567
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:49,871
<i>When I fall asleep
on the toilet</i>

568
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,477
<i>I have sweet dreams.</i>

569
01:21:55,716 --> 01:21:57,945
<i>The reading continues.</i>

570
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:03,750
<i>The smell of my father...</i>

571
01:22:07,495 --> 01:22:09,053
<i>Saturday is pizza day.</i>

572
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,164
<i>With the delivery men,
I don't make any...</i>

573
01:22:26,114 --> 01:22:28,275
<i>The first eye contact in 11 years.</i>

574
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:22,263
Excuse me...

575
01:25:38,918 --> 01:25:40,180
Buttons?

576
01:25:56,904 --> 01:25:59,668
C, o, m...

577
01:26:02,509 --> 01:26:05,569
Coma.

578
01:26:33,739 --> 01:26:35,776
Did you push it?

579
01:26:38,914 --> 01:26:41,280
- Yes.
- You did?

580
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:26,998
There's a mistake.

581
01:27:30,302 --> 01:27:32,868
The eighth one from the floor.

582
01:27:34,606 --> 01:27:35,573
On the right.

583
01:27:57,831 --> 01:28:00,643
This place is really perfect.

584
01:28:22,023 --> 01:28:24,287
This smell is really awful.

585
01:28:45,415 --> 01:28:49,780
<i>Because of the shock,
for 2 days, I couldn't do anything.</i>

586
01:28:56,426 --> 01:28:59,286
<i>Even if I don't do anything
to start with.</i>

587
01:29:11,909 --> 01:29:13,069
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

588
01:29:20,019 --> 01:29:21,179
<i>It's shaking.</i>

589
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:29,089
Pizza's End?

590
01:29:54,221 --> 01:29:56,086
How dare you answer me?

591
01:29:56,223 --> 01:29:58,884
I'm notjoking, cut the crap.

592
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:02,393
A guy like you, I'll cut off
both his hands and feet

593
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,998
to make sashimi.

594
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:21,001
Bring me some water.

595
01:30:27,223 --> 01:30:28,383
It's me.

596
01:30:31,227 --> 01:30:32,592
Don't hang up.

597
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:37,394
The weather is dull
and I wasn't in a good mood.

598
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:40,499
Sorry.

599
01:30:41,738 --> 01:30:44,298
I said I'm sorry, punk!

600
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,103
You're really getting
on my nerves.

601
01:30:48,145 --> 01:30:50,875
You're not even good
at delivering

602
01:30:51,014 --> 01:30:53,881
and who do you think
you're talking to!

603
01:30:54,017 --> 01:30:58,579
I paid your two-weeks salary
you should be grateful.

604
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,223
Are you trying to say
you are hurt?

605
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:05,492
Well, I am hurt as much as you.
Cut the crap, punk!

606
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:09,998
I am much more introvert than
you are! Moron!

607
01:31:13,037 --> 01:31:14,939
Excuse me...

608
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:19,603
The girl who is working at
your place...

609
01:31:19,744 --> 01:31:23,475
Is it her day off today?

610
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:27,981
Who?

611
01:31:29,722 --> 01:31:31,383
Pale complexion...

612
01:31:33,826 --> 01:31:36,694
Garter belt...

613
01:31:39,231 --> 01:31:40,699
Buttons...

614
01:31:45,338 --> 01:31:47,203
She's my wife.

615
01:31:52,746 --> 01:31:54,706
Just kidding.

616
01:31:57,118 --> 01:31:58,779
She also quit yesterday.

617
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:02,280
She stopped delivering?

618
01:32:02,924 --> 01:32:05,482
This is really perfect...

619
01:32:12,634 --> 01:32:14,998
The little one said...

620
01:32:16,638 --> 01:32:19,096
she'd never come out again.

621
01:32:19,641 --> 01:32:22,102
You must be all crazy.

622
01:32:25,948 --> 01:32:28,409
She had been working for
some time.

623
01:32:31,221 --> 01:32:32,984
Where does she live?

624
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:38,681
3 Daizawa, I think.

625
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,431
Don't bother about the pizza.

626
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:50,907
<i>When a hikikomori</i>

627
01:32:52,342 --> 01:32:54,402
<i>wants to meet a hikikomori</i>

628
01:32:56,046 --> 01:32:57,604
<i>there is only one way.</i>

629
01:34:40,857 --> 01:34:42,358
<i>What a blinding light.</i>

630
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:45,590
<i>It's so hot.</i>

631
01:34:45,729 --> 01:34:51,895
<i>I hate sweating.</i>

632
01:34:53,136 --> 01:34:55,204
<i>Why did I come out?</i>

633
01:34:56,240 --> 01:35:00,802
<i>Right.</i>

634
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:03,047
<i>I'm going... Where?</i>

635
01:35:03,048 --> 01:35:05,311
<i>To the left.</i>

636
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:09,408
<i>The subway station...</i>

637
01:35:09,553 --> 01:35:10,955
<i>No, the bus is better.</i>

638
01:35:10,956 --> 01:35:15,825
<i>3 Daizawa...</i>

639
01:35:16,328 --> 01:35:19,388
<i>Right, I don't have any money.</i>

640
01:35:19,531 --> 01:35:23,491
<i>Nobody must see me.</i>

641
01:35:23,636 --> 01:35:26,037
<i>Where do I have to go?</i>

642
01:35:26,038 --> 01:35:29,007
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

643
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:32,305
<i>Great.</i>

644
01:35:32,445 --> 01:35:36,609
<i>This...</i>

645
01:35:36,749 --> 01:35:38,910
<i>Passing by Sangenjaya...</i>

646
01:35:39,052 --> 01:35:42,510
<i>Come on...</i>

647
01:35:42,655 --> 01:35:45,216
<i>I can ride this...</i>

648
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:52,891
<i>I can be there in 30 minutes.</i>

649
01:35:53,033 --> 01:35:56,697
<i>Whatever, Let's go.</i>

650
01:35:56,837 --> 01:36:01,001
<i>Let's walk.</i>

651
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:05,909
<i>Off we go.</i>

652
01:36:06,748 --> 01:36:09,717
<i>Good. Full steam ahead.</i>

653
01:37:29,536 --> 01:37:30,900
Excuse me. I would...

654
01:39:28,661 --> 01:39:32,120
<i>They all went back in.</i>

655
01:39:40,073 --> 01:39:41,233
<i>All of them.</i>

656
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:54,714
<i>This man...</i>

657
01:39:57,257 --> 01:40:00,126
<i>I was like him 5 years ago.</i>

658
01:40:02,963 --> 01:40:05,765
<i>For her, it must
have been 10 years...</i>

659
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:07,325
<i>15 years?</i>

660
01:40:14,276 --> 01:40:16,107
<i>This guy is a rookie.</i>

661
01:40:19,548 --> 01:40:20,708
<i>As for her...</i>

662
01:40:46,577 --> 01:40:47,941
Come out, please.

663
01:40:50,247 --> 01:40:52,511
Quick, come out.

664
01:41:04,062 --> 01:41:06,263
If you don't come out now

665
01:41:06,264 --> 01:41:08,327
you never will.

666
01:41:14,373 --> 01:41:16,637
Listen to me.

667
01:41:16,775 --> 01:41:18,641
Open the door!

668
01:41:18,777 --> 01:41:21,940
At least, tell me your name.

669
01:41:32,658 --> 01:41:34,820
It's collapsing!

670
01:41:35,461 --> 01:41:37,429
It's collapsing!

671
01:41:39,465 --> 01:41:43,129
Come out!

672
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:48,036
Everybody, come out!

673
01:41:50,377 --> 01:41:52,242
Come out!

674
01:41:55,783 --> 01:41:58,512
What is she waiting for?

675
01:43:29,682 --> 01:43:31,649
Don't go back.

676
01:43:36,757 --> 01:43:38,815
Don't touch me!

677
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,626
Don't go back in.

678
01:44:00,881 --> 01:44:02,144
I pushed it.

679
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:18,561
It's shaking.
