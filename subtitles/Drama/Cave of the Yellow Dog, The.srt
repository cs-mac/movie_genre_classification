1
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>So, even if Columbus got lost and
wasn't the first to discover America,</i>

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,877
he is still my hero.

3
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:42,465
He was really brave to sail his
tiny ship over a really big ocean.

4
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:45,176
And because of him, we get
Columbus day off from school.

5
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,932
Thank you, Heather. Ronnie?

6
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:53,017
Tell us about your hero.

7
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,115
What is he writing?

8
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:12,078
Hachiko was my grandfather
Wilson's dog.

9
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:18,250
Everyone called Hachi a mystery
dog because,

10
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,753
they never really knew
where he came from.

11
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,841
Maybe Hachi escaped from
a dog pound.

12
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:29,303
Or maybe he jumped out of
somebody's car,

13
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:32,014
from some place faraway like
Florida or New Jersey.

14
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:39,104
But no matter how, Hachi was lost.

15
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,611
No matter how it happened,

16
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:13,865
a long time ago, in a town my
grandfather lived in...

17
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:16,910
Hachi appeared at the train station.

18
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:20,330
And that's where their story begin.

19
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:58,076
<i>Six days?</i>

20
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,703
- I'll miss it.
- Yes.

21
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,997
<i>That was great, a lot of music.</i>

22
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:05,583
<i>No, no, no, I'll walk. I'll walk.</i>

23
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,628
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

24
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:15,176
Hey, buddy... you lost?

25
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,261
Come here.

26
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:18,930
Come ...

27
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,851
You lost here, bud?

28
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,605
Someone must be looking for you.

29
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,487
This guy was wandering around.

30
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,655
<i>- Really... out on the platform?</i>
- On the platform, yeah!

31
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,949
<i>Good for you for finding him.</i>

32
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,660
Yeah. Well...

33
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,808
I tell you, this little crate
out there is broken.

34
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:45,956
I don't know what's going on but,

35
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,168
Hey, someone gonna be
here for him, sorry.

36
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:50,941
- Yeah.
- You just hold him here.

37
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,713
Please hold him till they comes.

38
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,173
No, I can't... I can't do that.

39
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:56,383
- I can't do that, Professor.
- What?

40
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:59,595
Well, he was here... No one was
gonna leave this dog, this--

41
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:01,472
I... know, I know that. I know,
no one's gonna leave it there.

42
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:03,349
They'll be back for it so...

43
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:05,226
You take him with ya, and
when anyone show's up...

44
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:07,102
I'll tell them that you've it.

45
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:08,562
- Someone gonna be here.
- Yeah.

46
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:10,022
You know, you don't understand.

47
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:11,482
Someone will come for him.
Really, just --

48
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:14,401
I'm gonna have to put this in here for
like the whole night if nobody comes.

49
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,341
If they're not here,
I'll locked him in here and

50
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:18,280
he'll be safe for the night but...

51
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,909
I... I... all I can do is take him to
the pound in the morning.

52
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:37,466
Well, today's Friday.

53
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:43,305
Know where you went...
Meanwhile stay with me.

54
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:47,267
In a warm house, plenty of company,
you'll be alright.

55
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:50,479
What? Yeah, you'll like it.

56
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:53,875
Sh-sh-sh ...

57
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,545
Alright--

58
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:02,133
Here, sit right here.

59
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:05,970
Sit right there.
Okay... yeah, here you go.

60
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:11,100
Ok, come on. Stay, stay...
It's your house, it's okay.

61
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:18,608
Hello, handsome.

62
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,693
- Hi.
- Hi.

63
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:22,778
- How did it go?
- It was great.

64
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:25,698
- You good, you missed me?
- Not a bit, and you?

65
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:28,284
No, didn't think about you none.

66
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:33,289
I've a little surprise.

67
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:37,334
Yeah... well, I might have a little
surprise for you too.

68
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,459
Come on,
we've some catching up to do.

69
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,962
Yeah.

70
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,550
Catching up. Catch up!

71
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:02,067
Do you hear something?

72
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,987
That was a branch against
the window.

73
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:55,871
- Okay, okay... it's alright!
- Parker!

74
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:57,456
- We had an agreement!
- I know, I know...

75
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,958
- Or did you forget?
- No, I didn't forget!

76
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,587
No, he was at the train station.
I mean, it just...

77
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:06,715
Kind of lost. Carl was gonna send him
to the pound tomorrow and I thought...

78
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:09,843
You just thought you bring him home
and talk me into keeping him, right?

79
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:12,262
No, no, I don't want to keep him.
I don't.

80
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,659
Tomorrow morning I'm
getting up early and find

81
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,056
out exactly where he belongs,
okay. I promise.

82
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,142
I promise you, I will do that.

83
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:20,895
Alright, this was Lucas's stuff.

84
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,981
Okay... okay.

85
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,191
Okay, here we go. Get in there.

86
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:34,033
Now look, a lot of good stuffs here.

87
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,744
Keeps you warm, you get that.

88
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,498
This is pretty cool.

89
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,877
You like this?
Yep, this was Luke's favorite.

90
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:48,673
Here's your water.

91
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:53,970
Seems strange. You could tell, huh.
Could ya?

92
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,515
Okay, buddy.

93
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,522
That's better.

94
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,734
Good night, buddy.

95
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,706
<i>You know, you're the one who's
should be in the doghouse.</i>

96
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,834
<i>I promise,
I won't bite your finger.</i>

97
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,678
Puppy, puppy!

98
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,597
Here, hey... puppy.
Puppy, puppy... come on.

99
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:42,893
That's good... ohh.
Good puppy.

100
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,230
Dad, I love him.

101
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,315
Does he have a name yet?

102
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,318
Yes, he does. <i>Temporary guest!</i>

103
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,994
You'll have to keep him.
Don't the house

104
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:02,663
feel so empty since Lucas been gone.

105
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,916
Ask your mother.

106
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,376
Mom!

107
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,294
Yeah?

108
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,962
Could you come here, please?

109
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,133
Look, he even likes your music.

110
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,740
Really? I can't believe it,
he's a wonder dog.

111
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,346
I absolutely have to keep this.

112
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,599
No more dog.
Don't encourage him.

113
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,642
I won't!

114
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,893
You're so mean.

115
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,021
Dad, he's gonna jump out
of it, here.

116
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,690
Oh yeah, that's better.

117
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,112
You know what, bud?

118
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, that's good.
I like it, great!

119
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,911
So, you saw Michael last night?

120
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:48,959
Yeah, we drove over to the look-out.
Looks common but it's beautiful.

121
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,044
Very romantic.

122
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,713
It was.

123
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,803
Are you the...

124
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,846
Can I help you, pop?

125
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,265
Yeah... yeah, I just found this little
tyke at the station last night.

126
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:05,684
Can you board him till
we find his owner?

127
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,770
Board him?
We can't board him.

128
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,855
This isn't a boarding service,
it's a pound, pal!

129
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,651
Look, I just found him,
what am I going to do with him?

130
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,488
Listen...

131
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,618
He's cute. That'll help with
the adoption but...

132
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,746
We give them two weeks.

133
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,291
Two weeks?

134
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,794
We're packed!

135
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,339
Excuse me.

136
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,679
I'll call you next week then,
alright... bye-bye.

137
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,515
- Morning Mary Anne.
- How are you doing, Parker?

138
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,143
I'm doing great. I was wondering
if I could ask you for a favor?

139
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,603
Sure... anything.

140
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,570
Oh... look at this!

141
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,866
Hey little one. Hello... hello.

142
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,078
Oh... oh, he's gorgeous.
Where did you comes from?

143
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,164
Well, he was wandering
around the station last night.

144
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:11,249
- Hi, sweetheart.
- I don't know, it's pretty strange.

145
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,043
Really? He is adorable!

146
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,129
I just want to put that up.

147
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,214
- Okay, fine... fine!
- Window? - Yep, and over there.

148
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:19,614
And anyone of those.

149
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,010
Parker, this dog is just fabulous!

150
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,887
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

151
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,764
What, the puppy?

152
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,432
Fine young puppy like that.

153
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,269
What do you think, Anthonio?
New room-mate?

154
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,771
Oh no, Anthonio!

155
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,859
Sit quietly.

156
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,288
Good morning, Mr. Professor.

157
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,331
Jess!

158
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,895
Sugar, 2 creams coming up.

159
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,459
- Er-huh.
- Hey, what've you got there?

160
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,962
A new friend here, you want a dog?

161
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,713
I prefer cash.

162
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,216
It'll be a great guard dog for ya.
Look at it.

163
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,595
Guard dog to guard the hot-dogs?
I don't think so.

164
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,389
Ha-ha, I don't think so either.

165
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,017
- Sorry about that.
- Why you want a dog, eh?

166
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,145
Everyday you'll have to walk him,

167
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,230
feed him, clean him,
pick up the food...

168
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,690
How many of these gonna help him?

169
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,858
On the house.

170
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,235
Why trouble?

171
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,320
Yeah, you're right.
Thank you, Jess.

172
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,363
My pleasure.

173
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,074
Hey, any news?

174
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,410
No, nobody came, nobody show up,
nobody call.

175
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,911
Nobody?

176
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,123
Strange, really strange.

177
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,167
Just one second.

178
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:42,464
Cate made up some flyers.
Put that up for me.

179
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,466
Come on!

180
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,635
Alright, I'll put them up for you.

181
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,095
What a samaritan you are.

182
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,137
I know... I know.

183
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,891
He really likes being in the bag.

184
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:56,144
Professor, no dog's on the train.

185
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,730
- No dog's on the train
- Right!

186
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,420
Okay, hold on a second.
Let me show you something.

187
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,360
We skipped the...
repeated the first section,

188
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,299
go directly to the lyrical section.

189
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,342
Let's try that.

190
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:10,385
Okay.

191
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,762
It just mean you've got to
build up quicker.

192
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:14,847
And then when you, when we
get to the lyrical section, just...

193
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:17,683
Deep breath, deep breath.

194
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,258
Hello.

195
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:02,520
That's great.

196
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:09,811
Do you want a puppy?
You want a puppy

197
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:14,823
- Well, let's go again.
- Yes, from the start.

198
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:19,119
This was the only thing
left on the crate.

199
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,331
<i>Yamanashi,</i> it's all I can read.

200
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:25,376
- Where is that?
- It's a part of central Japan.

201
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,047
- No ordinary dog, Parker.
- I know.

202
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,717
It's a Akita. Akita, as you say.

203
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:36,428
- A very special breed.
- Yeah?

204
00:17:39,973 --> 00:17:41,934
- And what's that?
- Hachi.

205
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:45,187
- What? - Japanese, for 8,
a number of good fortune.

206
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:49,024
Good fortune, very nice.

207
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:53,403
Hachi ... Hachi, it's good name.
I like that.

208
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,489
He might have been born
the eighth in the litter.

209
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:59,993
Spiritual significant in a 8, reaches
up to heaven comes down to earth.

210
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:05,207
So, will you take him?
You want him?

211
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:09,086
Me? No, I think he made his choice.

212
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:11,171
Meaning what?

213
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:14,424
Well, meaning he's your problem,
not mine brother.

214
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,135
You are not a problem, right?

215
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:23,475
Well, wether you found
him or he found you,

216
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:27,229
who's to say. It's meant to be.

217
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:32,442
It's also said that the <i>Shoguns</i> breed
these Akita for combat and hunting.

218
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:36,946
I guess in a way,
they're a kind of dog royalty.

219
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:42,160
Did Ken give you any ideas where
you can find this royal dog a home?

220
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:50,168
I put up 10 flyers already. You
know, someone gonna claim Hachi.

221
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:52,295
Who's Hachi?

222
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:57,091
This... It was what on his collar,
there's this symbol.

223
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:58,760
You named him?

224
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,011
- No, I didn't...
- Parker, do you wanna keep...

225
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:01,804
- ...keep him?
- No, I do have...

226
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:04,098
I don't want to keep him.
I just...

227
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:05,850
Admit it! You do....
you want to keep it.

228
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,936
- I wasn't even thinking about it.
- Yes!

229
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,355
Hachi?

230
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:13,983
Where did you go?

231
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,488
Oh no...

232
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,867
Oh god... Parker,
that's months of hard work.

233
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:23,701
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

234
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,411
I want him to stay out
there all night long.

235
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:26,267
Do not let him get back in here,
you hear me?

236
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:27,121
Yes... yes, I hear you.

237
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:28,706
- End of discussion!
- I hear you!

238
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:31,834
I hear you.
I heard you alright now.

239
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:42,345
<i>- It's two months of work!
- Believe me, I'm sorry.</i>

240
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,847
<i>The work is important not only for me,
it is important for the city!</i>

241
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:45,890
<i>For...</i>

242
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,184
<i>...4 months of work.</i>

243
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:52,813
<i>No, you do not care what I do.
Yes, you just spit on it!</i>

244
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:54,774
<i>Cate, that's not true.</i>

245
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:56,650
<i>Calm down!</i>

246
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:08,245
Hachi!

247
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:13,250
Come on, buddy. Come on.

248
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,836
Yeah, come on inside.

249
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,672
And I'll take these too.

250
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,147
Okay...

251
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:38,484
...found you here.

252
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:43,280
Yeah, here you are.

253
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:49,620
Your blood line goes back at least
4000 years, maybe much more.

254
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:53,874
Yeah?
What else we've got here?

255
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,715
Look at that.

256
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:09,931
It's said the first partnership
between man and animal is with you.

257
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:13,268
Do you knew about that?
You knew that already?

258
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:15,687
You did, didn't you?
Yeah, you did.

259
00:21:17,147 --> 00:21:19,316
There you are.

260
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,820
Let's see, settle you down now.

261
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:30,368
This isn't too bad.

262
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:34,456
Alright, stay there.
Stay there now, okay.

263
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,594
Sit quietly. Now...

264
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:54,476
<i>... no idea that Stan was inside,
so they... lean out there.</i>

265
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:56,040
<i>... out there and shoot the
ball into the right field,</i>

266
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,604
<i>which's what they did in game 2.</i>

267
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:03,943
All right there,
just step a little bit closer.

268
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:06,446
<i> ... bad. Still one point in the lead</i>

269
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:14,287
Catch!

270
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:16,998
Come on.

271
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:53,159
Forgive me, please.

272
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,244
Don't move...

273
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:57,872
- I was just coming up.
- Yeah, yeah... sure.

274
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:06,630
Just one night.
One night only, okay?

275
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,424
Be a good boy.

276
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,595
Stay there, alright. You will be fine.

277
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:20,394
I can't believe it.
He loves the <i>Yankees.</i>

278
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:21,854
No.

279
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:24,148
- Yeah, honestly.
- Really?

280
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:26,567
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

281
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,652
Alright... Hachi,
this is what we gonna do.

282
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:30,946
This is ball. Ball.

283
00:23:30,946 --> 00:23:34,074
Throw, you go get it.
You bring it back, okay?

284
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:35,951
Okay, you ready?

285
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:38,871
Go get it! Go get it!

286
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:42,082
No, no, no, the ball.

287
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:45,335
Hachi, Hachi! Hachi--
Hey, Hachi!

288
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:46,781
Hachi--

289
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:50,340
I'll throw it, you bring it, okay?
Good!

290
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:53,135
Go get it!

291
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:58,265
Hachi, no, no, no.
Get the ball!

292
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:01,894
Hachi, come here.
Hachi, come here!

293
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:06,481
Go get it. Wait... wait.
Hachi... Hachi.

294
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:09,943
Come on, this ball.
See this ball, come here.

295
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:14,114
Come here, Hachi. Hachi, come here.
You can do this. I know you can.

296
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,742
I just think that you're being
a little tough about that dog.

297
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:19,745
That dog's in a fix and dad just
trying to do the right thing.

298
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,081
<i> Okay, let's see. </i>

299
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:24,040
Mom!

300
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:28,628
<i>Ball, ball, ball, ball!
Get the ball!</i>

301
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:30,380
Hey, come on.

302
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,011
He has lost it.

303
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:41,224
Hello?

304
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:45,312
Oh, the puppy flyer, yes?
Are you the dog's owner?

305
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:50,421
No, no one comes forward yet.

306
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,819
We just want to make sure
the dog has a good home.

307
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,281
Could I get your number?

308
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:58,032
I'm sure my husband
would want to call you.

309
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:01,244
One second, I need to find a pen,
hold on.

310
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:28,354
Hello.

311
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:33,359
The dog's already been taken.

312
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:39,365
I'm really sorry.

313
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:08,978
Ow! No, no, no, Hachi!

314
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:11,063
Hachi Hachi Hachi Hachi!

315
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:15,443
Come on! Take it in. Take it in!

316
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:19,321
No, you can't go. Can't go.
Gotta work.

317
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,615
See you back here tonight, bye.

318
00:26:58,193 --> 00:27:01,029
Good morning, Professor.
You are late today.

319
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:04,366
- I'm already working.
- One sugar, two creams.

320
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:10,497
<i>Last call for Amtrak Express. Final
boarding call for Amtrak Express.</i>

321
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,429
Excuse me! Excuse me!

322
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:29,266
Hachi!

323
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,021
What're you doing here? What are
you doing? What're you doing.

324
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,524
You gotta go home, okay.
Go... No!

325
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:39,276
Yes, I know. Go, go home,
go on.

326
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:43,029
Go home! Go on!
I gotta get on the train. Go... go!

327
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,948
Okay, come on... gotta go.
Come on!

328
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:47,117
Ho-oh... Professor, you want
me to hold him?

329
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:48,159
Yeah... could you?

330
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,202
<i>30 seconds.</i>

331
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:50,245
Thanks.

332
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,166
Go home... go home, okay.
Go... go on, gotta go home.

333
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,209
Go home.

334
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,252
Hey Chuck, hold that up for
a moment, alright.

335
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:02,882
Go home! Go home!
Go, go, go, go... go on home.

336
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:07,262
You really got him train, doesn't it?

337
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:08,805
Good boy!

338
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,142
<i>Er... professor.</i>

339
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,561
Oh, no.

340
00:28:15,186 --> 00:28:16,855
Okay.

341
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,943
- Okay, thanks. Yeah, yeah.
- Are you sure?

342
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:24,028
- Alright, let her go.
- Let her go!

343
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:26,739
You want me to call you a cab?

344
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,285
No, I'll walk him home.
It's all right.

345
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:41,129
Oh, God.

346
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,887
Parker? I thought you left for work.

347
00:28:49,887 --> 00:28:52,515
- I didn't go.
- You're gardening now?

348
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:54,600
He ran out, missed the train.

349
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,271
Don't say it.
I know what you're going to say.

350
00:28:58,271 --> 00:28:59,877
No, let me do this.
You're gonna get filthy.

351
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:01,482
I'll fill it, get the next train.

352
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:03,734
- Okay.
- Thanks!

353
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:09,073
And you - you stay.

354
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:11,242
- He will.
- See you tonight.

355
00:29:58,372 --> 00:29:59,832
Here's your treat!

356
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,708
Here's your treat!

00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:09,758
Alright, okay... just one more.
Just one more, that's it.

358
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:10,801
Hold on! Hold on!

359
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:19,351
Well... you're okay?

360
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:23,522
Alright, alright... this's the last.

361
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:27,150
Here you go. Good boy, Hachi!

362
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,369
Okay, one last one.

363
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:41,122
Take it.

364
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:01,267
That's great... that's really great
everybody. I'm proud of ya.

365
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,813
<i>- Finally.
- And the ending to be repeated.</i>

366
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:06,898
- Sorry, I'm running late.
- No problem.

367
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,067
- Off the hook?
<i>- Yeah!</i>

368
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,110
Good, thank you.

369
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,941
Hey, Hachi!
What are you doing here?

370
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,818
<i>Sugar in your drink.</i>

371
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:24,892
- Chuck.
- Good bye.

372
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,572
Hey... hey Hachi.

373
00:32:41,158 --> 00:32:42,701
What're you doing here?

374
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:44,787
Bedridge Station!

375
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:50,334
Yes, yes, ma'am,
we've got one at 7:30.

376
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:55,339
He's been here all day?

377
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,424
No... no, he's just rode up 2 minutes
ago. He went right there.

378
00:32:57,424 --> 00:32:59,802
You're kidding. You seen Cate?

379
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:01,595
I haven't seen her.

380
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:03,889
Okay.

381
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:07,100
Ok... come on.
Guess we'll go home.

382
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:11,188
That son of a gun.

383
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:16,902
Come on, come on, boy.
Come on... come on.

384
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:20,447
Mom!

385
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:22,532
Yeah sweetie, I'm in here.

386
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:25,786
- Hey... hi!
- Hi!

387
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,454
- I got the chips.
- Oh, thanks.

388
00:33:27,454 --> 00:33:28,997
 Hi...Mrs. Wilson, good to see you.

389
00:33:28,997 --> 00:33:31,083
Oh, Michael, nice to see you!
Call me Cate.

390
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,125
Ok. Thank you... thank you.

391
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:34,836
Everything looks delicious.

392
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:37,130
- It's a great spread.
- Why don't you take this to dad?

393
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,715
- You sure?
- Yeah, he's out back.

394
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,258
Okay, the grill's ready?

395
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:42,469
It's getting there, yeah.
Yeah, nice to see you.

396
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,512
Nice to meet you.

397
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,597
- Cut? And where is...
- Yeah, that would be great, honey.

398
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:51,228
You know, I actually took
the dialog when I was a kid.

399
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:52,270
You do?

400
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,065
Yeah, when I was nine
or ten years old.

401
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:58,526
I had to stop because my brother
slammed my fingers in the car door.

402
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:01,947
I mean he always said that
it was an accident but

403
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:04,032
after that, I don't know...
I stopped practising.

404
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:07,577
I wish I didn't though cause
I really loved music,

405
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:12,082
and I've so much respect for
musicians and people playing...

406
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:14,459
Michael, do you love my daughter?

407
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:19,047
Yes, sir... Yes, I do.

408
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:21,654
You know... that's good.
Cause that's what

409
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:24,260
you want to remember
on a bad days.

410
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:28,014
Right.

411
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:33,561
Hachi, this is Michael.
<i>Michael, Hachi.</i>

412
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:35,313
Pleased to meet you.

413
00:34:39,692 --> 00:34:42,612
Hachi, hey... you wanna play
a little catch, huh?

414
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:45,448
Yeah... ready?
Okay, go get the ball.

415
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:49,410
Go get it... there it is.
Go get the ball, right there.

416
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:54,082
Go Hachi, go get it.
Go... go get the ball.

417
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,897
Go get it.

418
00:34:56,898 --> 00:34:57,888
Micheal, you want to get
that ball back,

419
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:58,878
you gonna have to get it yourself.
Hachi doesn't fetch.

420
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:01,088
He doesn't do it!?

421
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:04,634
Okay!

422
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:07,762
Are you alright... are you okay?

423
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:08,804
- All is good.
- Honey, are you okay?

424
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:09,847
Honey, are you okay?

425
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:10,890
Keep playing.

426
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,933
- Totally, I'm gonna get the ball.
- Are you sure?

427
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:12,975
Okay!

428
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:16,187
I'm good. Look at that.

429
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,898
- Everything okay?
- Don't let me distrupt the game.

430
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:19,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:26,822
Look, I'll throw the ball,
just one foot. Go get it, okay?

432
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:30,159
Really, if I... even if I just tossed
it right here, he's not gonna get it?

433
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,012
Argh!

434
00:35:52,097 --> 00:35:53,140
Ball?

435
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,934
Fetch, right. I throw it,
he brings it back. He won't do it.

436
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,020
Not Akita, Parker.

437
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,314
They have something
against fetching?

438
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:02,650
No, if you wants a dog
that fetches,

439
00:36:02,651 --> 00:36:04,985
you get a collie,
you get a sprinter-spaniel.

440
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:06,862
Alright, Hachi fine with me.
I'm okay.

441
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:10,824
Well good, because Akita's
are not into people pleasing.

442
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,284
What are they up to?

443
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:15,829
It comes with the training because
of your special connection.

444
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:19,791
Hey buddy, go get that ball.
Why would you do that?

445
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:24,171
Well, for fun. For a cookies.

446
00:36:24,171 --> 00:36:26,256
Because it made me happy, basically.

447
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:30,344
They can't be bought.
They're Japanese not Americans.

448
00:36:30,344 --> 00:36:31,887
- Yeah, American...
- I know.

449
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:36,892
Well, if he's gonna fetch, it'll
be for a very special reason.

450
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,854
I'll find a reason.

451
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:44,941
No, no, no, no...
Hac, come on.

452
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,235
You can't go. I'm sorry.
You can't go, come on.

453
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:52,240
No, stay.

454
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,544
Okay! Come on... come on.

455
00:37:04,544 --> 00:37:05,587
It's alright... come on.

456
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:08,316
Come on. Good boy.

457
00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:12,685
Hey...Hac Hac Hac Hac!
Come on, come on!

458
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:19,931
Hey...Hac--
Hey...

459
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:23,404
Let's go!
Come on. Come here.

460
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,401
- Good morning, Milton.
- Good morning.

461
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,444
How're you doing today?

462
00:37:29,444 --> 00:37:31,863
- Myra.
- Morning Parker.

463
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,865
Stayed out of the sun.

464
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:39,370
Careful.

465
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,190
Good morning, Mr. Professor.

466
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:47,587
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning, Parker!

467
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:49,672
He won't bite, eh?

468
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:51,758
Oh no, he's doing really good.

469
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:52,800
Come on, boy!

470
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:55,741
Alright, I want you to go
straight home.

471
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:58,139
Go straight home,
you understand me?

472
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,476
I'll see you here tonight.
So go ahead... go on home.

473
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,313
Good boy. Good boy!

474
00:38:11,777 --> 00:38:14,488
- Great day Carl, isn't it?
- Have a good one, professor.

475
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:24,832
Hachi!

476
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:30,755
There... yeah, sh-sh-sh ...
Don't tell Milton, okay?

477
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:06,623
Hey... Hachi.

478
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,041
Oh, what a good boy.

479
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:20,242
You've been waiting for me all
day and thinking...

480
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:22,598
<i>Oh, how good I am, how good I am!</i>

481
00:39:27,895 --> 00:39:29,146
Hey, Hac!

482
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,489
More champagne!
Bring more champagne.

483
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:41,867
I could, well... I don't know.

484
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:42,909
Should be in the kitchen.

485
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:45,746
<i>Seems like no one else at
the wedding other than us.</i>

486
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,166
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

487
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:57,632
You love the snow, huh?

488
00:40:04,806 --> 00:40:07,309
Let's take a walk, you and me.

489
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:10,020
Only the two of us, let's go.

490
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,022
Tell me about something.

491
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:36,629
Hachi!

492
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,557
That's great, Jake.

493
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:48,600
<i>Thanks.</i>

494
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,644
Cate! Have you seen Hachi?
He wasn't at the station.

495
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:54,606
No, I haven't seen him since
this morning.

496
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,649
- Hmm.
- Here!

497
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,863
Look at her.

498
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,910
Can you believe they had
her cover for 30 years?

499
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:11,122
It's beautiful.

500
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,332
Yes, yes.

501
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:19,255
- I'm falling behind schedule.
- Aww, you'll catch up.

502
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:21,966
Just think about opening night,
that will freak you out?

503
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:27,597
The young soloist step down stage
sings from La Bohème.

504
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:31,830
And then dance, of course.
Following that,

505
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:36,063
rock, rap, hip-hop, jazz and...
Hamlet!

506
00:41:37,106 --> 00:41:42,054
Then, of course, the entire town is
going to rise up, standing ovation,

507
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:43,321
the whole place going crazy.

508
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:45,803
Mayor seize you down,
he pulls you up on stage,

509
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:48,868
put you center stage and thank
you for making it all possible.

510
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:49,910
Yeah?

511
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,953
Yeah!

512
00:41:50,953 --> 00:41:52,830
I like it.

513
00:41:55,332 --> 00:41:56,709
Hachi!

514
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,546
Come on boy.

515
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:07,428
Hachi?

516
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:14,309
Hachi!

517
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,106
What are you doing?

518
00:42:26,864 --> 00:42:28,407
Alright!

519
00:42:32,744 --> 00:42:35,080
Stay, stay Hachi.

520
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:38,709
Sh-sh-sh, don't bother it.

521
00:42:42,045 --> 00:42:45,590
Okay, go on, go away.
Go on, get out!

522
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:54,055
Get...  get, get out of here.
Get out! Get out!

523
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:11,366
Well, okay.

524
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:14,202
Come on... come on.

525
00:43:16,045 --> 00:43:16,905
Wooh!

526
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,140
Ugh!

527
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:33,179
Parker!

528
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:50,154
We got skunk!

529
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:53,408
You want to come in with us?

530
00:43:53,408 --> 00:43:55,076
No, I'm going to pass.

531
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,621
Well, okay.

532
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,920
Better open the window
before you go to sleep.

533
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:09,257
You really think we smell
that bad?

534
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,928
Perhaps you're right.

535
00:44:19,684 --> 00:44:21,018
Mom!

536
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:24,355
Oh, hi honey.

537
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:26,857
What's up?

538
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:31,237
Hey, can I tell you something?

539
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,073
Guess what?

540
00:44:34,073 --> 00:44:35,116
What?

541
00:44:35,116 --> 00:44:37,076
- Okay, wait... that's right.
- What?

542
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:42,832
See anything different?

543
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:44,583
No.

544
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:45,626
Yes!

545
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:49,797
Oh... it's so sweet.

546
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,050
Oh, it's so wonderful!

547
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,678
I've to call grandma right away.

548
00:44:56,554 --> 00:44:57,638
Where is dad?

549
00:44:57,638 --> 00:44:59,306
Out there, as usual.

550
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:01,976
Daddy!

551
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,355
Dad!

552
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:11,360
Dad, what're you doing?

553
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,739
It's a full body massage,
following the book, see it?

554
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:17,533
You're gonna be a grandfather.

555
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:18,784
You gotta get really deep
down into the muscle...

556
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,869
Dad, dad!

557
00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:26,166
Micheal and I are having a baby.
I am pregnant.

558
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:28,585
You...

559
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:33,799
Really?

560
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:34,842
Yes.

561
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:36,593
You're having a baby?

562
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:44,643
- I'm going to be a grandpa.
- Yes.

563
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:48,480
Cathy, I can't believe this!

564
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:52,389
This is terrific news.
I'm so happy for you.

565
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:55,362
Hi sweetie.

566
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:57,155
- Mom.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

567
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,741
Oh, what you got?

568
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:01,618
All kinds of healthy things for you.

569
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:05,914
Fresh vegetables, raspberries,
pita with cholesterol-less sprouts...

570
00:46:05,914 --> 00:46:08,876
You know, when I was carrying you,

571
00:46:08,877 --> 00:46:10,357
I was sending out your
father for pizza with red pepper

572
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:11,837
and double anchovies for
a week straight.

573
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:13,839
He couldn't even watch when I eat it.

574
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,426
You and dad have been
together for 25 years.

575
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:20,720
We've been longer together
than we've been apart.

576
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,763
Wow.

577
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,063
Dad said after your first date,
by the time he got back...

578
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:33,441
to the car, he miss you so much,
he went back for you.

579
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,653
I know, I was watching
from the window.

580
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:39,843
And when I saw him come
up the walk again,

581
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:42,408
I almost ran out the door
and jumps into his arm.

582
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,369
- Should have.
- I know.

583
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:46,454
But I always stop and
think too much.

584
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:48,873
That's true... you do.

585
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,208
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

586
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,251
Okay!

587
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:55,630
Hey, Hachi!
Come on... Hachi, come on.

588
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,341
He always greets him there?

589
00:46:58,341 --> 00:46:59,384
Look.

590
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,806
- Isn't it strange?
- Come on, let's go home.

591
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,267
Hey, Mr. Professor.

592
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:09,727
Good night, Parker!

593
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:10,770
Good night, Mary Anne.

594
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,021
How do you taught your
dog to do that?

595
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:14,107
That's amazing, everyday.

596
00:47:25,785 --> 00:47:26,911
Parker!

597
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:33,918
Parker!

598
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:54,063
You're all dress.

599
00:47:57,149 --> 00:48:01,570
Well, that might be something
I'll be able to do without.

600
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,698
Thank you.

601
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:09,161
Anything else you required, madam?

602
00:48:10,537 --> 00:48:12,498
It depends on what you've got.

603
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,834
Everything.

604
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:16,877
Everything?

605
00:48:29,098 --> 00:48:31,475
Yeah... everything.

606
00:48:45,113 --> 00:48:48,325
You've to put up with a lot,
I know that.

607
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:52,204
I don't remember ever
thanking you.

608
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:02,339
You know how much I love you.

609
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,552
And I love you.

610
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:10,138
Strange.

611
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:16,812
Especially when you do smell
like a dog or a skunk.

612
00:49:18,897 --> 00:49:21,733
That doesn't happen very often,
actually you should worried about...

613
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:24,027
It happens, just don't know when.

614
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:42,045
- I love you. Call you later.
- And I love you too, bye-bye.

615
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:48,301
Okay, Hachi... come on.

616
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,682
Hachi... come on.

617
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,896
Come on now, what's wrong
with you... come on.

618
00:50:02,273 --> 00:50:03,733
What's it?

619
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:10,823
Come here Come here!
Come here...

620
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:16,245
Come here, what's with you?
Come here now, you've got a problem?

621
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:21,793
Alright, what's going on?

622
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:27,298
Alright... okay.
Alright now, okay.

623
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:29,123
Come on! Come on!

624
00:50:32,637 --> 00:50:34,180
What's wrong with him?

625
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,848
I don't know.

626
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:38,894
Hachi, you wanna come because
I've got to go, it's a work day.

627
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:40,682
Come on, buddy.
Come on!

628
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:43,689
I've got to go.

629
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:47,234
- Love you, honey.
- Love you too. See you tonight.

630
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:50,863
Last chance.

631
00:50:52,865 --> 00:50:54,408
Bye!

632
00:51:21,936 --> 00:51:24,647
- Hi, Mary Anne.
- Hey Jess, how're you?

633
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:28,400
- I already've your coffee and donuts.
- Oh yeah, thank you. - Alright.

634
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,540
Where's Hachi?

635
00:51:51,548 --> 00:51:53,842
Hey, Hachi.

636
00:51:53,842 --> 00:51:56,261
Ah, here he comes.

637
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,806
Oh, I'm happy to see you.

638
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:01,892
Why did you bring the ball for?

639
00:52:01,892 --> 00:52:03,977
<i>Why you giving me the ball?</i>

640
00:52:03,977 --> 00:52:06,897
You want to play catch?
Here, here... here.

641
00:52:06,945 --> 00:52:07,565
Wait... wait!

642
00:52:07,814 --> 00:52:10,233
Here boy. Go get it!

643
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:13,445
Go get it. Go get it!

644
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:16,573
Quite good. Now, bring it back.

645
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:20,952
Oh... that's it.
That's what I wanted.

646
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:23,997
Try another one. Big one.
Big long one.

647
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,216
Okay, go get it. Go on!

648
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:32,130
Good boy!
Oh yeah, now bring it back.

649
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:34,407
Okay, come on... come on.
Come on!

650
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:37,969
Come on. Oh, what a good boy.
What a good boy.

651
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:41,222
Aren't you the good boy?
You see that.

652
00:52:41,222 --> 00:52:42,265
Hmm.

653
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:46,019
Threw the ball, he brought it back.
First time he fetch. A real fetch.

654
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:48,396
Congratulations.

655
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:51,107
Thanks you. Good boy!

656
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:54,652
Okay, gotta go work.
Come on, take the ball.

657
00:52:56,446 --> 00:52:58,198
First time!

658
00:52:58,198 --> 00:52:59,991
Heh, first time!

659
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:04,579
<i>No... wait, Mr. Professor! Wait!
I'll make you a coffee right now.</i>

660
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:05,622
Alright.

661
00:53:05,622 --> 00:53:06,664
Sorry, I'm late today.

662
00:53:06,664 --> 00:53:08,228
Did you see what he did?

663
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:09,792
I threw the ball, he brought it back.
It was a fetch.

664
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,252
No, no, no.

665
00:53:11,252 --> 00:53:13,338
You keep the ball.

666
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,341
Do you want me to have that?
I can't play now.

667
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:18,551
I've got to go to work.
I've got to go to work.

668
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:20,720
I'll take the ball, alright.

669
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,472
- Okay.
- Here you go.

670
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:24,140
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

671
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,225
- See you at 5.
- I will be here.

672
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:28,728
Okay! Go home Hac... go home.

673
00:53:37,403 --> 00:53:40,198
Alright... come here!
Come here... come here.

674
00:53:40,198 --> 00:53:43,117
Okay, it's alright.

675
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:48,331
See you at 5 o' clock, alright.
Here you go. Hey, go home, go on.

676
00:54:46,722 --> 00:54:48,307
You think it was better that time?

677
00:54:48,307 --> 00:54:49,349
<i> Laughter.</i>

678
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:52,477
<i>(Inaudible)</i>

679
00:54:52,477 --> 00:54:58,400
Alright, you remember we were
talking about John Philip Sousa,

680
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,279
a great <i>March</i> composer
at the turn of the century?

681
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:08,535
He... very famous man but he
had a huge thing about...

682
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:11,663
... recorded music. He never
allowed his music to be recorded.

683
00:55:11,663 --> 00:55:14,208
Even when Thomas Edison
came to him

684
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:16,752
with his brand new invention
- the phonograph.

685
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:20,777
But Edison's didn't care, he
went ahead and did it anyhow.

686
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:24,176
He secretly recorded his
marching band in a parade.

687
00:55:25,218 --> 00:55:27,596
I guess makes it the very
first boot-leg.

688
00:55:31,975 --> 00:55:35,437
So what do you think about that?
Do you think Sousa was right?

689
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:37,356
Do you think it's okay now?

690
00:55:37,357 --> 00:55:39,274
What about today's performance,
will you be able to just walk up...

691
00:55:39,274 --> 00:55:40,673
to the middle of the stage,

692
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:46,072
plug in your CD player to a <i>Marshall
Stack</i> and that's it, good enough?

693
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:49,117
I don't know.

694
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,538
I am a lot older than you but

695
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:56,916
I tend to think that
there's an element of music...

696
00:55:56,916 --> 00:56:00,481
... that cannot be capture.
Life cannot be capture.

697
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,046
The human heart cannot
be captured.

698
00:56:02,046 --> 00:56:05,383
The moment of creation
itself is fleeting.

699
00:56:39,584 --> 00:56:41,669
<i>Oh my God!</i>

700
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:43,629
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

701
00:56:43,629 --> 00:56:45,715
<i>It looks like a heart attack.</i>

702
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,267
Hey Hachi... how're you doing?

703
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,061
Hey Hachi.

704
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:03,149
See you tomorrow, Hachi.

705
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:47,651
Good night, Hachi.

706
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,960
Hey, buddy.

707
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:07,796
You ready to go home?

708
00:58:10,275 --> 00:58:10,775
Yeah.

709
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:47,627
Hey, Hachi.

710
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:51,047
Are you alright?

711
00:59:01,891 --> 00:59:05,019
And that's how he did it?

712
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:07,105
Sorry, I'm learning.

713
00:59:15,947 --> 00:59:20,159
Andy! Time to go... sweetheart.

714
00:59:21,578 --> 00:59:25,373
Good boy. You stay here, okay.
We'll be back.

715
00:59:54,735 --> 00:59:57,905
I've said that the soul is
not more than the body.

716
00:59:57,905 --> 01:00:01,534
And I have said, that the body
is not more than the soul.

717
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:06,872
And nothing, not God is greater
to one than one self is.

718
01:00:06,872 --> 01:00:09,959
I hear,
behold God in every object

719
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,045
that understand God not
in the least.

720
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:17,716
Nor do I understand who's there
can be more wonderful than myself.

721
01:00:17,716 --> 01:00:20,740
In the faces of men and women,

722
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:23,764
I see God and in my own face
in a glance.

723
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:26,684
I find letters from God
dropped in the street

724
01:00:26,685 --> 01:00:29,603
and everyone signed by
God's name.

725
01:00:29,603 --> 01:00:32,523
But I leave them where there are

726
01:00:32,523 --> 01:00:37,861
for I know that wherever I go,
others will constant comes.

727
01:00:37,861 --> 01:00:41,073
Forever and ever.

728
01:01:36,461 --> 01:01:40,841
Look, you don't have
to wait anymore.

729
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:44,803
He's not coming back.

730
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:01,361
Alright Hachi,
you do what you've to do.

731
01:02:46,447 --> 01:02:49,033
Come on... buddy.
Come on... let's go.

732
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:50,993
Come on boy, come on.

733
01:02:53,955 --> 01:02:56,958
Come on Hachi.
Come on Hachi.

734
01:02:56,959 --> 01:02:59,961
You're gonna be with us now.
Let's go... come on.

735
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:03,714
Alright, time to go, Ronnie's waiting.
Come on.

736
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:08,032
Let me get that for you, sweetie.

737
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:15,768
Come on, Hac, up, up up.
Here we go.

738
01:03:15,768 --> 01:03:19,939
What a good boy.
Come on Hachi.

739
01:03:24,172 --> 01:03:25,375
Watch your head.
Watch your head!

740
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:26,938
Good boy!

741
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,877
Hey, there's my guy!
Andy!

742
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:24,920
- Yeah?
- Hachi!

743
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,963
Hachi!

744
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:28,340
- Andy!
- What, dear?

745
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,927
Hachi! Hachi! Come back here.

746
01:04:33,243 --> 01:04:33,777
Hachi!

747
01:04:35,759 --> 01:04:36,959
Hachi...come on!

748
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:41,291
<i>Hachi!</i>

749
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:44,985
<i>Hachi!</i>

750
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:01,784
<i>Inaudible dialog</i>

751
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:04,912
Hey, looks like we got the
first visitor.

752
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:09,291
Hey there buddy! Come to
welcome us to our new home?

753
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:12,628
<i>We started from the top,
where almost everything is ready.</i>

754
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,505
<i>Yeah, but something
with the basement too?</i>

755
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:16,465
<i>The cellar has long
been ready.</i>

756
01:07:21,678 --> 01:07:23,972
<i>Donut with chocolate icing.</i>

757
01:07:23,972 --> 01:07:26,683
<i>No, I don't like chocolate.</i>

758
01:07:26,683 --> 01:07:30,020
Hey Hachi,
what are you doing here?

759
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,648
Look it... look it!

760
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:38,487
He's staying right in the
same spot.

761
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,490
<i>- I thought he moved away.
- He did.</i>

762
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:47,077
- He looks hungry, huh.
- You're a softie, Jess.

763
01:07:47,078 --> 01:07:48,497
<i>We must give him a little.</i>

764
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:54,263
<i>Hey, Hachi! Want a hotdog, bud?
Come on, boy.</i>

765
01:07:57,057 --> 01:07:57,497
Hachi!

766
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:00,425
<i>Maybe he don't likes your
cooking, Jess.</i>

767
01:08:00,425 --> 01:08:03,970
This is Jess special. Come on, lick it.
You'll like it. It's good for you.

768
01:08:11,061 --> 01:08:12,937
Where did he comes from?

769
01:08:12,937 --> 01:08:16,066
Just show up.
Come on boy! Eat it.

770
01:08:16,066 --> 01:08:21,279
Oh... you better be careful. Hachi
got hotdogs in there older than you.

771
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,615
Don't listen to them.

772
01:08:38,504 --> 01:08:39,672
Hachi.

773
01:08:39,672 --> 01:08:40,965
Oh, God.

774
01:08:41,007 --> 01:08:44,010
Hi! Oh... hi, I was so worried
about you...

775
01:08:46,804 --> 01:08:48,389
<i>I need you.</i>

776
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:50,683
And why does she just
hanging around him for?

777
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:54,645
<i>This the professor's daughter.
He probably lived with them.</i>

778
01:08:54,645 --> 01:08:56,731
<i>And Hachi ran out?</i>

779
01:08:56,731 --> 01:08:57,774
<i>Disappeared?</i>

780
01:08:57,774 --> 01:08:59,150
<i>Oh, dear God...</i>

781
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,235
Will you come home with me?

782
01:09:02,153 --> 01:09:03,196
Hey, hey, hey, hey, she took it.

783
01:09:03,197 --> 01:09:04,238
It's alright. It's okay.

784
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:05,615
It's okay.

785
01:09:06,324 --> 01:09:08,712
- Come on, come on
- Let's go, buddy.

786
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:10,477
Thank you very much.

787
01:09:11,182 --> 01:09:11,882
Thank you!

788
01:09:17,585 --> 01:09:21,464
- That's the best stuff.
- Alright, get me a coffee.

789
01:09:23,132 --> 01:09:25,426
Jess, come on, pour me a coffee.

790
01:09:39,482 --> 01:09:43,235
I think of him too, everyday.

791
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:12,765
Hey.

792
01:10:12,765 --> 01:10:19,438
You know we love you Hachi.
We want you to stay here with us.

793
01:10:22,774 --> 01:10:27,779

I don't know. Sounds like
it could make a good story.

So Carl... where does he live?

Well... we're not really sure.
He comes and goes.

819
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:38,719
- Nobody bothers him?
- No, we put up with him.

820
01:13:39,678 --> 01:13:41,430
He just does what's he is doing.

821
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:46,435
Mind if I take a picture?
For the newspaper.
