1
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:17,063
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,565
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:24,446
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:28,617
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:32,330
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

6
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:34,832
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,586
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:41,548
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,595
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:48,264
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:52,311
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,772
- Illness?
- John.

13
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,108
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:57,275 --> 00:02:01,071
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,574
Of course.

16
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,244
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:19,258
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:33,399
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:37,112
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:40,491
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:44,746
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,351
Oh, Charles.

23
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,562
I like this one.

24
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,191
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:13,070
The question is, will you control that power?

26
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:18,034
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:41,812
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,442
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

29
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,112
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

30
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,367
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:55,744
One second!

32
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,999
Open this door.

33
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,834
Warren.

34
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:06,715
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

35
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:23,776
Oh, God.

36
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,569
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:27,239
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:54,463 --> 00:06:00,261
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:11,525
Bobby!

40
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,451
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:31,673
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:35,927
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,433
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,268
Logan.

45
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,858
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,529
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:55,407
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,578
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:01,957
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,479
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,860
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:32,075
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:38,707
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,668
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,880
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,092
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,013
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:55,184
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,648
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,836
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:08:18,962 --> 00:08:21,339
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:23,509
Scott.

63
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,844
Scott.

64
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,015
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:33,686
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:37,900
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,403
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:46,159
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,124
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?

70
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,420
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:57,547
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:57,673 --> 00:09:01,260
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

73
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:03,388
Hey, look.

74
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:08,644
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

75
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:13,607
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:20,573
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,935
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

78
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:50,483
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,658
Mr. President.

80
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:59,826
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:04,332
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:08,087
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,258
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:16,012
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:19,641
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,812
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:26,983
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,695
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:33,032
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,743
Raven?

91
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:40,457
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:43,669
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:47,298
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:51,427
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:55,432
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

96
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:01,231
In here with us.

97
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:05,401
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,030
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:12,702
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:16,039
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,051
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,727
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,814
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:41,819
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

105
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:46,324
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

106
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:50,036
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

107
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,915
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,966
Dear Lord.

109
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:05,388
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

110
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,102
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

111
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:17,150
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:23,658
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:27,621
the use or misuse of that power is everything.

114
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:34,379
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,256
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,010
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,971
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

118
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:47,560
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:50,313
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,360
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:56,821
without any superhuman authority behind it.

122
00:12:56,946 --> 00:13:00,534
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

123
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:07,708
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:11,713
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

125
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:16,551
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:20,473
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:23,685
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

128
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:26,313
into the body of this man?

129
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:32,278
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,836
Professor?

131
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:52,968
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

132
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,687
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:06,359
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:20,208
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

135
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,295
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,424
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

137
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:32,389
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,600
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:38,771
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

140
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:44,402
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:50,785
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,454
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:55,749
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:59,878
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

145
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:03,549
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:14,436
Hank?

147
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,564
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,154
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,116
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

150
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,871
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

151
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,207
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

152
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,378
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:40,091
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

154
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:42,678
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:45,555
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:48,351
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

157
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:51,813
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

158
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:53,940
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:57,903
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:58,028 --> 00:16:01,491
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:04,494
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:07,706
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

163
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,584
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:16,758
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:20,095
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

166
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,348
Storm.

167
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,934
They're announcing it now.

168
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:33,276
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:36,489
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

170
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:39,617
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

171
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:43,121
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:46,458
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

173
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:50,546
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,757
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:57,137
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

176
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,642
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,943
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:13,448
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

179
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,617
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,623
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

181
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,168
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

182
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:29,091
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.

183
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,388
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

184
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,808
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,480
No. Professor.

186
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:43,649
They can't cure us.

187
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,823
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:52,409
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:58,332
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

190
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:03,546
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

191
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:09,178
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:13,392
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:19,440
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:25,405
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

195
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,117
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

196
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:31,704
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:34,582
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,629
They just do it.

199
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:44,886
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:50,767
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,730
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:57,024
the extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:57,108 --> 00:19:01,738
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:04,784
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:10,539
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:13,919
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:17,130
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:20,760
Or us?

209
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:32,857
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

210
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:35,151
Back off.

211
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:39,490
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

212
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:44,162
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

213
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:47,165
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

214
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:50,126
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,296
Do you?

216
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:57,052
And what can you do?

217
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:00,389
So you have talents?

218
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:03,601
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:07,772
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

220
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,899
Other than you two.

221
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,864
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

222
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,786
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:42,896
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

224
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:46,608
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

225
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,527
Oh, Mr. President.

226
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,696
Shut up.

227
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:58,580
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:00,374
Please.

229
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:04,254
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

230
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:10,260
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

231
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,388
Yeah, right.

232
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,882
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

233
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,301
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

234
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:51,182
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:54,685
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

236
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:59,358
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:03,363
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,907
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,034
You'll see.

240
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,707
Jimmy.

241
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,379
There's someone I would like you to meet.

242
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,506
Hello there, son.

243
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,510
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,728
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,774
It's OK.

246
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:47,580
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:59,677
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:02,889
Yes, he is.

249
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:41,809
Scott.

250
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:53,447
Scott.

251
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,908
Scott.

252
00:23:56,033 --> 00:24:00,080
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

253
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:02,707
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

254
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,502
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

255
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,047
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

256
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,967
Stop!

257
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:09,826
Jean?

258
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,996
Scott.

259
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:17,501
How?

260
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:23,508
I don't know.

261
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:40,319
I wanna see your eyes.

262
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:44,533
- Take these off.
- No.

263
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:48,578
No.

264
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:51,332
Trust me. I can control it now.

265
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:02,219
Open them. You can't hurt me.

266
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:40,930
- What happened?
- No clue.

267
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:44,726
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

268
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,513
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

269
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,958
I can't see a damn thing.

270
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,378
I can take care of that.

271
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,774
What the...

272
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:39,190
Logan!

273
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:46,949
She's alive.

274
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:53,540
Jean.

275
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,299
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

276
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:03,593
The only explanation of Jean's survival

277
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:09,475
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

278
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,311
Is she gonna be OK?

279
00:29:12,478 --> 00:29:18,151
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.

280
00:29:18,235 --> 00:29:22,990
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

281
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:27,579
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

282
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:30,249
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

283
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:36,381
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

284
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:42,471
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

285
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:48,645
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

286
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:55,027
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

287
00:29:56,445 --> 00:30:00,450
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

288
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:05,789
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

289
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:09,335
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.

290
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:12,380
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

291
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:18,011
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

292
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:20,431
What have you done to her?

293
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:24,060
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

294
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:27,189
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

295
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:30,776
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

296
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:35,073
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

297
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:38,117
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

298
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:42,039
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

299
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:46,001
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.

300
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:50,465
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

301
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,186
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

302
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:04,606
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

303
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:08,069
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

304
00:31:08,152 --> 00:31:14,409
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.

305
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:29,760
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

306
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:35,100
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

307
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:38,144
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

308
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,856
Good. Bring him in.

309
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:43,150
Are you sure you want to start with him?

310
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:45,737
I think it's important. Yes.

311
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,658
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

312
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,286
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,164
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

314
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,794
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

315
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,423
You ready?

316
00:32:31,873 --> 00:32:35,669
The transformation can be a little jarring.

317
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:43,386
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

318
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:45,472
It'll all be over soon.

319
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:52,438
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

320
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:54,482
Warren, calm down.

321
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:56,651
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

322
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:59,863
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

323
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:03,784
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

324
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,963
Warren, it's a better life.

325
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:17,634
- It's what we all want.
- No.

326
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:21,137
It's what you want.

327
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:25,726
Warren, no!

328
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:41,437
Told you so.

329
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:58,541
About time.

330
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:02,170
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

331
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:06,049
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

332
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:08,928
Without him, they have nothing.

333
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,055
Read off the guest list.

334
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:16,478
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

335
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:18,688
This one robbed seven banks.

336
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,700
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

337
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:32,496
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

338
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,171
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

339
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:44,218
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

340
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,763
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

341
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,475
How fascinating.

342
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:54,855
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

343
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:59,068
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

344
00:36:11,374 --> 00:36:14,127
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

345
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:19,341
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.

346
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:21,469
No!

347
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:48,833
You saved me.

348
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:54,465
Eric.

349
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:59,512
I'm sorry, my dear.

350
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:02,265
You're not one of us any more.

351
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:10,942
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

352
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:20,954
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

353
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:23,665
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

354
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,919
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

355
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:30,798
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

356
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:36,096
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

357
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:40,518
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

358
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:42,770
I have.

359
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:49,444
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

360
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:51,571
As do I.

361
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,537
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

362
00:37:57,703 --> 00:38:01,875
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

363
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,450
Jean.

364
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,668
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

365
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:47,594
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:50,389
Are you OK?

367
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:54,185
Yeah.

368
00:38:56,437 --> 00:38:58,440
More than OK.

369
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,290
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,921
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

371
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:23,510
It's OK.

372
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:39,904
It's OK.

373
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:21,201
- Wait.
- No.

374
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:28,334
Jean.

375
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:31,505
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

376
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:34,591
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

377
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:40,848
The professor said you might be different.

378
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:45,104
He would know, wouldn't he?

379
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:48,982
What? You think he's not in your head too?

380
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:53,655
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

381
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:00,079
Where's Scott?

382
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,544
Jean?

383
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:09,924
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

384
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:14,553
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

385
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,018
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

386
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,617
Oh, God.

387
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,879
Look at me.

388
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:49,803
Stay with me. Talk to me.

389
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:51,721
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

390
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:53,682
Focus. Focus, Jean.

391
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:58,229
Kill me.

392
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:01,107
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

393
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,818
- Don't say that.
- Please.

394
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:05,487
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

395
00:42:07,697 --> 00:42:09,909
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

396
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:12,787
It'll be all right. We can help you.

397
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,333
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

398
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,377
I don't want to fix it.

399
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:33,352
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

400
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:37,023
I told you they would draw first blood.

401
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,692
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

402
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:45,783
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

403
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,954
Come. We have an army to build.

404
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:54,335
I picked something up.

405
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:57,588
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

406
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:00,216
It's a mutant.

407
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:04,388
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

408
00:43:04,513 --> 00:43:06,890
More powerful than you.

409
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:11,771
Where is she?

410
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,902
Logan.

411
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,071
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

412
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,241
What have you done?

413
00:43:25,787 --> 00:43:28,666
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

414
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:33,755
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

415
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:45,559
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

416
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:48,688
It may be too late.

417
00:43:53,528 --> 00:43:55,279
- Wait for me here.
- What?

418
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:57,406
I need to see Jean alone.

419
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:00,327
You were right, Charles.

420
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:03,830
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

421
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:06,960
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.

422
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:09,295
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

423
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:11,422
So, shall we go inside?

424
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:16,261
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

425
00:44:16,428 --> 00:44:21,476
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

426
00:44:21,643 --> 00:44:25,397
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

427
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:27,525
Nobody gets inside.

428
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:17,873
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

429
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:21,836
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

430
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,466
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:29,512
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:45:29,637 --> 00:45:32,432
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

433
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,643
No. I want to help you.

434
00:45:35,394 --> 00:45:38,940
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:40,942
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

436
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:44,070
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:45:44,195 --> 00:45:46,740
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:49,743
Stay out of my head.

439
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:56,543
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

440
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,763
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.

441
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:08,890
Get out of my head.

442
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,439
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,902
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

444
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:23,198
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,701
No! Stop it!

446
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:30,457
That's it.

447
00:47:12,338 --> 00:47:14,924
Jean, let me in.

448
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:19,248
No, Jean.

449
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:21,375
Jean!

450
00:49:20,192 --> 00:49:22,654
Don't let it control you.

451
00:49:31,622 --> 00:49:33,415
Charles.

452
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:03,033
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:19,718
No.

454
00:50:22,973 --> 00:50:24,557
God!

455
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,643
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:07,482
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

457
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,655
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

458
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:16,492
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

459
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:20,497
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:24,417
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:30,174
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:51:30,341 --> 00:51:35,639
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:39,310
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

464
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:43,314
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

465
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:51,490
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:51:51,615 --> 00:51:55,119
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

467
00:51:55,203 --> 00:51:59,124
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,196
Kitty.

469
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,282
Bobby.

470
00:52:31,245 --> 00:52:33,247
- You OK?
- Yeah.

471
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:41,422
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:52:42,924 --> 00:52:45,719
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

473
00:52:45,803 --> 00:52:47,846
Yeah, me too.

474
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:52,143
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:54,437
You have Rogue and I have...

476
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:58,484
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,446
The first snow and all that.

478
00:53:04,991 --> 00:53:08,286
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:10,915
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,626
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

481
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:15,503
Come on.

482
00:53:27,392 --> 00:53:29,644
This place can be home too.

483
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,943
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:54:28,294 --> 00:54:30,381
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:54:30,506 --> 00:54:32,549
No.

486
00:54:34,593 --> 00:54:36,638
Where are you going?

487
00:54:38,181 --> 00:54:42,853
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

488
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:45,356
Yeah, I do.

489
00:54:46,524 --> 00:54:50,153
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

490
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:53,740
A hug. A handshake.

491
00:54:53,865 --> 00:54:55,785
A kiss.

492
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:59,413
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

493
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,627
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

494
00:55:04,503 --> 00:55:07,172
Just be sure it's what you want.

495
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:11,386
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

496
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:13,513
To go upstairs and unpack?

497
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

498
00:55:19,103 --> 00:55:22,065
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

499
00:55:22,148 --> 00:55:23,691
Marie.

500
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:27,112
Marie.

501
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:11,412
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

502
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:17,545
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

503
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:25,470
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

504
00:56:29,892 --> 00:56:33,814
I can manipulate the metal in this,

505
00:56:33,897 --> 00:56:37,401
but you, you can do anything.

506
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:39,778
Anything you can think of.

507
00:56:50,415 --> 00:56:52,501
Jean.

508
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,629
Enough.

509
00:56:56,589 --> 00:56:58,132
Enough.

510
00:57:00,511 --> 00:57:02,721
You sound just like him.

511
00:57:02,846 --> 00:57:05,766
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:09,979
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

513
00:57:10,855 --> 00:57:13,024
As nature intended.

514
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:20,992
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:24,538
And that fight begins now.

516
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:35,926
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:39,806
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:43,393
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

519
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:49,358
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:53,530
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

521
00:57:53,655 --> 00:57:59,453
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:58:15,388 --> 00:58:18,307
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:21,978
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

524
00:58:22,104 --> 00:58:27,985
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:33,951
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:58:38,957 --> 00:58:41,584
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:46,048
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:48,217
It was, son.

529
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:56,101
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:58:56,184 --> 00:59:00,147
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:16,249
Rogue.

532
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:19,253
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:59:28,429 --> 00:59:32,726
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

534
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:48,327
Logan.

535
00:59:48,452 --> 00:59:49,995
Logan.

536
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,873
- Logan.
- Jean?

537
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:54,793
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

538
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:56,836
Logan. Logan.

539
00:59:56,962 --> 00:59:59,257
- Logan.
- Stop.

540
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:01,717
Logan. Logan. Logan.

541
01:00:22,574 --> 01:00:25,245
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

542
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:29,249
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

543
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:31,752
She killed the professor.

544
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:35,214
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

545
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:39,511
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

546
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,349
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

547
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,518
Because you love her.

548
01:00:55,404 --> 01:00:58,116
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

549
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:01,410
So if you're with us, then be with us.

550
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:17,680
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

551
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:21,350
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

552
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,312
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

553
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:28,358
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

554
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:35,116
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

555
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:37,911
I'm looking for someone.

556
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:42,124
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

557
01:01:43,543 --> 01:01:47,547
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.

558
01:01:51,718 --> 01:01:53,762
Come on, Iceman.

559
01:01:55,515 --> 01:01:57,517
Make a move.

560
01:02:02,898 --> 01:02:06,610
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

561
01:02:18,874 --> 01:02:22,128
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

562
01:02:22,212 --> 01:02:26,132
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.

563
01:02:26,216 --> 01:02:32,640
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

564
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:36,645
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

565
01:02:36,728 --> 01:02:39,564
Join us or stay out of our way.

566
01:02:39,648 --> 01:02:43,611
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

567
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:49,576
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

568
01:02:50,577 --> 01:02:54,582
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

569
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:58,836
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

570
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,591
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

571
01:03:02,716 --> 01:03:08,932
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

572
01:03:09,015 --> 01:03:12,268
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

573
01:03:12,352 --> 01:03:14,980
Let's go. Keep it moving.

574
01:03:15,106 --> 01:03:18,734
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

575
01:03:18,859 --> 01:03:22,406
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

576
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:26,618
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

577
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:28,830
Absolutely no metal.

578
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,346
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

579
01:03:43,638 --> 01:03:48,227
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

580
01:03:50,771 --> 01:03:54,651
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

581
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:18,190
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

582
01:06:21,276 --> 01:06:26,449
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

583
01:06:28,535 --> 01:06:30,621
They have their weapons.

584
01:06:31,622 --> 01:06:33,666
We have ours.

585
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:42,133
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

586
01:06:43,385 --> 01:06:49,850
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

587
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,230
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

588
01:06:53,355 --> 01:06:55,524
take control of the cure,

589
01:06:55,649 --> 01:06:58,027
and destroy its source.

590
01:06:58,152 --> 01:07:01,823
And then nothing can stop us.

591
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:18,842
Jean.

592
01:07:31,399 --> 01:07:34,568
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.

593
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:37,572
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

594
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:43,246
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

595
01:07:52,047 --> 01:07:55,885
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

596
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:59,597
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

597
01:07:59,764 --> 01:08:03,227
And you stood there and let him die?

598
01:08:03,352 --> 01:08:06,939
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

599
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:22,415
OK.

600
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:27,170
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

601
01:08:28,296 --> 01:08:33,261
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

602
01:08:35,264 --> 01:08:39,893
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

603
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:44,315
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

604
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:23,068
Approaching target dead ahead.

605
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:25,654
Set for 360-degree incursion.

606
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:41,798
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

607
01:09:46,261 --> 01:09:48,472
OK, send them in.

608
01:09:48,555 --> 01:09:49,765
OK.

609
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:54,312
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

610
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,498
OK. I give up.

611
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:14,752
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

612
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,880
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

613
01:10:26,098 --> 01:10:30,228
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

614
01:10:30,395 --> 01:10:33,732
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

615
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:37,569
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

616
01:10:38,195 --> 01:10:40,240
Leave that to me.

617
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:48,499
Storm. Storm.

618
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:51,377
What are you doing back here?

619
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,505
I need help.

620
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:56,424
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

621
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,387
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

622
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:04,809
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

623
01:11:04,892 --> 01:11:08,355
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

624
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,524
Let's suit up.

625
01:11:14,695 --> 01:11:18,825
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

626
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:21,912
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

627
01:11:22,037 --> 01:11:27,710
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

628
01:11:29,337 --> 01:11:31,756
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

629
01:11:31,881 --> 01:11:34,426
I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:36,887
But we lost Scott.

631
01:11:37,012 --> 01:11:39,140
We lost the professor.

632
01:11:39,265 --> 01:11:44,229
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.

633
01:11:44,896 --> 01:11:47,108
I'm not gonna let that happen.

634
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:49,276
Are you?

635
01:11:50,444 --> 01:11:52,489
Then we stand together.

636
01:11:53,782 --> 01:11:56,201
X-Men.

637
01:11:56,284 --> 01:11:58,329
All of us.

638
01:12:04,878 --> 01:12:07,214
We're in.

639
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:09,424
Let's go.

640
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:16,391
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

641
01:12:17,558 --> 01:12:22,731
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

642
01:13:49,832 --> 01:13:52,292
Dad, what's going on?

643
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:55,629
It's an earthquake.

644
01:13:59,217 --> 01:14:01,678
We're trapped.

645
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:08,824
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

646
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:26,218
My God.

647
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:54,251
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

648
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:13,690
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

649
01:17:13,815 --> 01:17:17,110
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

650
01:17:33,921 --> 01:17:36,799
In chess, the pawns go first.

651
01:17:39,427 --> 01:17:42,013
Humans and their guns.

652
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:53,777
Plastic. They've learned.

653
01:17:59,951 --> 01:18:02,787
That's why the pawns go first.

654
01:18:12,298 --> 01:18:15,009
Target the bridge.

655
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,435
Fire!

656
01:18:30,193 --> 01:18:34,990
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

657
01:18:54,846 --> 01:18:59,018
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

658
01:19:01,396 --> 01:19:05,442
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

659
01:19:05,567 --> 01:19:09,363
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

660
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,242
Then God help us.

661
01:19:22,086 --> 01:19:24,129
They're coming for him.

662
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:01,214
Don't ever do that again.

663
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:09,139
You men cover the doors!

664
01:20:09,265 --> 01:20:12,519
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

665
01:20:28,286 --> 01:20:31,040
Traitors to their own cause.

666
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:39,800
Finish them!

667
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,759
Not yet.

668
01:21:31,526 --> 01:21:34,237
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

669
01:21:34,362 --> 01:21:36,407
With pleasure.

670
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,874
Hold it!

671
01:21:46,793 --> 01:21:48,838
He's going for the boy!

672
01:21:48,921 --> 01:21:51,173
Not if I get there first.

673
01:21:51,298 --> 01:21:53,342
Kitty!

674
01:22:03,688 --> 01:22:05,731
Come on.

675
01:22:08,902 --> 01:22:10,821
Grow those back.

676
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,544
Don't you know who I am?

677
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:27,130
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

678
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,087
Going somewhere?

679
01:23:04,632 --> 01:23:07,261
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?

680
01:23:07,344 --> 01:23:09,388
Yes, I am.

681
01:23:10,264 --> 01:23:11,932
Girls.

682
01:23:12,099 --> 01:23:14,394
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

683
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:17,730
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

684
01:23:17,814 --> 01:23:20,066
Calm down. Calm down.

685
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:22,444
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:23:40,465 --> 01:23:46,429
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

687
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:49,141
Oh, you get the point.

688
01:23:49,267 --> 01:23:52,353
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

689
01:23:52,478 --> 01:23:53,689
No.

690
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:04,659
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

691
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:08,372
This way.

692
01:24:08,455 --> 01:24:13,419
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

693
01:24:17,131 --> 01:24:19,468
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

694
01:24:22,888 --> 01:24:25,140
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.

695
01:24:25,224 --> 01:24:27,769
Who's hiding, dickhead?

696
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,118
Don't. No.

697
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:43,745
Don't.

698
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:47,750
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

699
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:50,795
Do we look like we need your help?

700
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,998
It's time to end this war.

701
01:25:33,803 --> 01:25:36,764
Take cover.

702
01:25:38,183 --> 01:25:40,102
Get out of the way.

703
01:25:51,323 --> 01:25:54,952
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

704
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:56,662
Go! Go! Go!

705
01:26:45,301 --> 01:26:48,221
We work as a team.

706
01:26:48,346 --> 01:26:51,350
Best defense is a good offence.

707
01:26:57,065 --> 01:27:01,027
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

708
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,377
Go ahead.

709
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:19,173
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

710
01:27:19,298 --> 01:27:21,342
Right.

711
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:12,984
You're in over your head, Bobby.

712
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,072
Maybe you should go back to school.

713
01:28:26,959 --> 01:28:29,212
You never should have left.

714
01:28:30,421 --> 01:28:32,590
This is it.

715
01:28:32,715 --> 01:28:34,676
Hey.

716
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,763
Make it a strike.

717
01:28:48,442 --> 01:28:50,986
You never learn, do you?

718
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:56,034
Actually, I do.

719
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:11,760
I'm...

720
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:14,514
One of them?

721
01:29:24,608 --> 01:29:27,946
This is what they want for all of us.

722
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:50,888
It's over, Jean.

723
01:29:53,391 --> 01:29:55,394
It's over.

724
01:29:58,605 --> 01:30:00,608
No! Don't shoot!

725
01:30:14,124 --> 01:30:16,459
No!

726
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,606
Everybody get out of there!

727
01:30:44,157 --> 01:30:46,202
Bobby!

728
01:30:56,338 --> 01:30:58,382
What have I done?

729
01:31:09,186 --> 01:31:13,525
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

730
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:16,111
Go.

731
01:31:19,698 --> 01:31:21,409
Jean!

732
01:32:06,627 --> 01:32:08,712
Jean!

733
01:32:08,838 --> 01:32:11,257
I know you're still there!

734
01:32:57,769 --> 01:33:00,438
You would die for them?

735
01:33:01,523 --> 01:33:03,608
No, not for them.

736
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:06,821
For you.

737
01:33:08,823 --> 01:33:10,826
For you.

738
01:33:15,831 --> 01:33:17,917
Save me.

739
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:21,462
I love you.

740
01:35:00,784 --> 01:35:03,412
You're back.

741
01:35:09,795 --> 01:35:12,256
I'm sorry.

742
01:35:12,422 --> 01:35:14,424
I had to.

743
01:35:15,301 --> 01:35:18,304
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

744
01:35:19,389 --> 01:35:21,850
It's what I want.

745
01:35:34,155 --> 01:35:35,783
Hey.

746
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,994
Good to see you, buddy.

747
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,790
With the thanks of a grateful nation

748
01:35:41,915 --> 01:35:45,043
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

749
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:49,382
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

750
01:35:49,507 --> 01:35:52,343
human and mutant alike,

751
01:35:52,426 --> 01:35:54,471
Dr. Hank McCoy.

752
01:35:57,683 --> 01:35:59,935
Way to go, fur ball.
