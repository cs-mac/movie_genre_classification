1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,471
? Love's too mysterious

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,479
? A fly girl like me needs security

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,392
? 'Cause nothin' goin' on but the rent

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,309
? You got to have a J-O-B
if you want to be with me?

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,430
? Shake, baby, shake, whoo

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,273
? Shake, baby, shake,
whoo

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,390
? Shake, baby, shake, whoo

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,513
? Come on over, baby
whole lotta shakin' goin' on, let's go...?

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,308
? I like it, I like it

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,512
? I like the funny feeling being here with you

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,438
? And I like it more with every day

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,392
? And I like it always hearin' you say

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,352
? You're likin' it too

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,436
? You're likin' it too...?

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,512
? I say love

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,352
? It is a flower

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,392
? And you

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,359
? It's only seed

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,319
? It's a heart

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,478
? Afraid of breaking

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,308
? That never

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,436
? Learns to dance

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,433
? It's a dream

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,349
? Afraid of waking

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,437
? That never

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,352
? Takes the chance

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,399
? Just remember

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,476
? In the wintertime

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,472
? Far beneath

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,439
? The bitter snow

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,274
? Lies a seed

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,438
? That with the sun's love

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,392
? In the spring

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,309
? Becomes a rose?

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,472
Thank you, Maggie.
We're gonna take a break.

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,313
- Your voice is beautiful.
- Sorry?

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,510
- Your voice is beautiful.
- Oh, yeah? Ta.

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,316
- Um, so you want a drink?
- Sorry?

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,478
- Would you like a drink?
- No, it's all right, I'm with me mates.

40
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,389
Well, I, er, I would like to talk to you
and, er... Why don't we have one?

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,359
Just five minutes?
And it won't be long. I mean...

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,392
- I tell you what, one drink. Just one.
- OK.

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,356
- I'll just get me bag.
- What would you like?

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,273
- Half a lager.
- Can we have it on the other side?

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,311
It's quieter there. OK?

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,472
Oh, my God! I think I've tacked off
with Julio Inglesias.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,432
Hey, take it easy and keep your knickers on.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,471
I will.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,432
- Where're you sitting?
- We sit over here?

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,399
- What's your name anyway?
- My name is Jorge.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,273
- Who? Who-hey?
- Jorge.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,357
- Who?
- J-O-R-G-E.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,436
- Jorge.
- Who-hey. I can't say it.

54
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,278
- Come on, it's easy.
- I can't say it.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,312
J- O-R-G-E. Jorge.

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,432
- It sounds like George, doesn't it?
- It is George.

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,477
- Well, is it all right if I call you George?
- That's nice.

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,313
- My name's Maggie.
- Hello, Maggie.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,279
- Where are you from?
- Um... I'm from Paraguay.

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,515
- Paraguay?
- A little country in South America.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,477
- Here y'are, have one of these.
- OK, thank you. Thank you.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,511
Oh, here y'are.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,398
I think your song was beautiful.

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,470
My song? Oh, thanks, George.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,476
But, ...

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,398
I thought you were a bit sad though.

67
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,318
Sad, me? No, I'm not sad.

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,351
Well, you looked sad.

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,397
Maybe I've got a lot to be sad about.
You never know.

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,432
- You have worries?
- God, we all have worries.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,471
Well, maybe I can help you?

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,471
You help me?

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,268
That'd be a laugh.
I don't think you could help me.

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,311
Well, perhaps I could, you know?

75
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,514
No.

76
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,511
You got kids, have you, George?

77
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,271
No, I don't.

78
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,311
I have. Four.

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,359
Four lovely little babies
but they're not with me at the moment.

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,476
Social Services have got them.

81
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,309
? I Saw the light on that night
as I passed by her window

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,430
? La la la, la la!

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,355
? I saw the flickering shadows
of love on her blind

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,516
? La la la...?

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,311
I travel a lot. I've been in Spain,
United States, Manchester, Liverpool...

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,477
- Liverpool? I was born in Liverpool.
- Really?

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,399
But I haven't been back for years.
God, I don't half miss it.

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,313
- I've been living up here years.
- Oh, right.

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,430
I haven't been there for years, God.

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,392
You must have been a pretty little girl.

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,275
God, that was a long time ago, wasn't it?
When I was little.

92
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,398
Come on!

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,433
- You're not jumping high enough!
- I don't remember being little.

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,399
I don't remember much till I was about five.

95
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,353
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?!

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,392
You fucking twat!

97
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,357
Fucking bitch! I fucking hate you!

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,476
I'll bash the fuck out of you, bitch!

99
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,476
Fucking twat!

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,354
Tell her to pick the fucking toys
up off the floor!

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,312
Don't cry. Get in and pick the toys up.

102
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,311
Maggie, come on, love...

103
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,477
I'll fuckin' batter you! Fucking cunt!
I'll fuckin' kill you!

104
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,471
- Mummy!
- Fuckin' bitch!

105
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,393
Anyway, I'd really not like to talk about it.
To be honest.

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,399
- I would like to know, you know.
- You'd like to know about me? Why?

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,476
Well...

108
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,353
Why would they take your kids from you?

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,392
As I say... They like to keep busy.

110
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,315
Like to keep interferin'.
Do you know what social workers are?

111
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,351
- No.
- No?

112
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,518
Well... social workers is what's got my kids.

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,510
Maybe I'll get them back, maybe I won't.

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,353
? Love lift us up where we belong

115
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,510
? Where the eagles cry

116
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,432
? On a mountain high

117
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,479
? Love lift us up where we belong...?

118
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,470
There's Sean, with Mary.

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,471
There's Serena.

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,271
And there's Mickey.
Four different kids to four different dads.

121
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,472
You think I should get it on a t-shirt?
Save everyone asking questions.

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,438
- I think you have been unlucky.
- Unlucky?

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,359
Mairead wouldn't say that.
Mairead said I was stupid.

124
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,352
She says I smell trouble
and I go to bed with it.

125
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,439
- Hey, what's that?
- That's made by the children, for tourists.

126
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,517
- Is it? Ah, it's lovely, isn't it?
- It's nice.

127
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,399
- Maggie! We're goin'!
- Shit, that's Mairead.

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,470
- We'll miss the bus!
- I'm comin'!

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,399
- Don't go yet.
- Nice meeting you. Thanks for the lager.

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,352
- Ta-ra! Coming!
- Maggie, wait!

131
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,436
- ¿Qué pasó con la niña?
- Se fue.

132
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,311
¿Otra vez?

133
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,436
Yo tengo dos,
tengo dos esperándome afuera.

134
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,274
- Puta, y dejó la...
- ¿Dejársela?

135
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,311
- Se la voy a dejar.
- Te espero aquí.

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,316
- Sí, espérame aquí.
- Bueno.

137
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,470
Maggie! Maggie!

138
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,311
Maggie, stop!

139
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,391
Oh, here it is.

140
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,359
Are you enjoying that?
Oh... it's OK.

141
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,470
- Let me tell you something.
- Go on.

142
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,353
Do you know where is the best pizza
in the world?

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,470
What, where you get the best pizza?

144
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,432
Lake Ypacari in Paraguay.

145
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,278
- Go away!
- Listen...

146
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,312
...you have some wine, you see pretty lake...

147
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,311
- Yeah.
- Complete paradise.

148
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,472
You have the trees, the birds,
the mountains.

149
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,471
Not even in Italy you get that.

150
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,512
Are you a travel agent, George?

151
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,511
I'm not. I'm a poet.

152
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,511
- A what?
- A poet.

153
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,353
Go on then, tell me a poem.

154
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,431
Let's see.

155
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,510
Candelas encendidas
encienden candelas.

156
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,352
Candelas que fueron apagadas
encenderán nuevas candelas.

157
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,279
Así es la lucha.
Candelas que se encienden y apagan.

158
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,517
What the bloody hell was that about?

159
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,399
That means... Candles light new candles.

160
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,433
Candles that die... still you can
light another one from them.

161
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,358
That's a struggle, and that's hope.

162
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,392
Candles that light and die.

163
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,390
- Oh, that was lovely that.
- Yeah.

164
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,352
Really nice. Was that one of your poems?

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,436
No, it's not mine. Do you like it?

166
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,309
It was lovely. You're winding me up,
you're not a bloody poet at all!

167
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,476
- You're just winding me up.
- Well...

168
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,353
- now I travel.
- Mm?

169
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,437
I've been in Mexico, USA, Spain

170
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,352
and I want to do
the same work I did at home.

171
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,358
To have a home for people
who need shelter.

172
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,436
Now I'm here, it's difficult.

173
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,315
I've got no one. I have to start from nothing,
so I take any job.

174
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,351
Any job I can get.

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,517
Ohh... That's dead sad, that.

176
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,390
Will you come home with me tonight?

177
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,430
Get it down here!

178
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,472
Come in.
Oh, I'm freezin'!

179
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,511
Close the door.

180
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,391
All right?

181
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,437
- Jesus, it's freezin'.
- I'm sorry it's so...

182
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,517
so messy here. Sit somewhere.

183
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,395
I'll tell you what, I'll get off
because it's dead late and everything.

184
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,273
I should have gone back to the refuge.

185
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,393
- You don't have to go now.
- Sorry if you think I've messed you about.

186
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,319
- I just don't want to be here.
- I don't understand.

187
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,392
Look, you've missed the bus,
it's dark, it's late.

188
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,479
It's dangerous, it's wet.
I mean, what are you going to do there?

189
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,395
Let's have a coffee and see...
what more minutes... four, five minutes.

190
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,432
All right, one coffee,
and then I'll get off.

191
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,513
- OK. I'll help you with your coat.
- No, you make the coffee.

192
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,510
It's freezing.

193
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,279
What are all these pictures?
Are these of all of your family?

194
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,356
Yes, yes.

195
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,319
- You've got it nice here, haven't you?
- Yeah, it is... I like it.

196
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,397
You wanna see where I live.
It's like a cupboard.

197
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,432
- Milk and sugar?
- Yeah, love. Ta.

198
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,476
- Here's the coffee.
- Oh, ta.

199
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,350
You don't realise how much sound goes
round your head until there's nothing there.

200
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,517
Tell me... why they would
take your kids away from you?

201
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,436
Because...

202
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,471
I went out with this fella...

203
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,275
and... when I first met him it was brilliant.

204
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,312
We used to have a laugh.
Everything was great.

205
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,477
Used to follow me down the supermarket
and chat me up.

206
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,432
I used to be dead flattered
but I'd pretend I wasn't.

207
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,519
Mickey, don't hang on to the trolley.
Get some jelly for us, eh?

208
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,511
Just round there.

209
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,438
Can you're?

210
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,436
- Here you go.
- Go on.

211
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,353
What one do you want?
Is that the one you want? What is it?

212
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,436
- Orange.
- That's my favourite.

213
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,471
- One of yours?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,512
- Where were you last night?
- What do you mean?

215
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,511
I was gonna buy you a drink.

216
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,271
- Who's the man of the house then?
- Sean here.

217
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,356
He's the man of my house, aren't you, love?

218
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,517
Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Sean.

219
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,274
You'd have liked the kids.

220
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,348
<i>Mary, the baby, she's always laughing.
Very charming. Then there's Serena.</i>

221
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,474
She's dead temperamental. You've only got
to look at her the wrong way and she cries.

222
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,438
<i>And then there's Mickey.
He was dead funny.</i>

223
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,471
<i>Brilliant sense of humour.</i>

224
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,469
I once asked him what he wanted to be
and he said, I want to be everything.

225
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,270
That's brilliant - someone who's got nothing
wants to be everything -

226
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,436
imagine what's going on in his brain.

227
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,319
He was always last, always toddled behind.

228
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,391
And then there was Sean.

229
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,431
He was the eldest.

230
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,359
He was like a little crutch to us.
He kept me going.

231
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,433
Sean, will you get the baby
out of the pram while I... Hi, love!

232
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,313
Put these things away.

233
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,352
Simon, do you want a cup of tea?

234
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,476
Simon?

235
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,471
The cups are in 'ere.

236
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,471
Did you get left behind?

237
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,477
- Are you having a laugh or what?
- What?

238
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,513
- What's the matter?
- Where the fuckin' hell have you been?

239
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,512
- Two hours I've been waitin' here.
- I know...

240
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,352
- Am I some sort of cunt?
- No, I'm sorry about being late but...

241
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,437
Two fuckin' hours.
Two hours waiting for you.

242
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,510
I'm sorry, I was at the shops...

243
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,479
- I don't know how I fucking stand it.
- I've got that...

244
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,277
- Shut up.
- The tea...

245
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,357
- Shut up. Shut up.
- I'll make...

246
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,430
- You cunt. You cunt!
- Uh!

247
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,314
You're fucking driving me mad!
Two fuckin' hours!

248
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,311
I've been two fuckin' hours!

249
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
- Simon, don't!
- Cunt!

250
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,432
Fucking Irish slag. Fuckin' two hours.
Two fuckin' hours.

251
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,358
Two hours! Two hours!

252
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,437
Two fucking hours! Every fucking time!

253
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,509
Cunt!

254
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,268
Two fuckin' hours!
Two fuckin' hours you've been!

255
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,436
Two fucking... fucking cunting hours...

256
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,471
I've waited for you to get back!

257
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,478
Fuck ya! Fuck you, fuck the kids!

258
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,513
I was in hospital about two or three days,
and then I came back

259
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,431
and that's when
they started interfering more then.

260
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,359
They started coming round
making stupid accusations

261
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,477
like if he'd hit me like that
what's he done to the kids?

262
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,478
For all that he was,
he never touched the kids.

263
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,476
You've got to give him that.

264
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,319
The stupidest thing is... I loved him.

265
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,430
I couldn't help it. I did love him.

266
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,398
So if I loved him,
what did that make me, eh?

267
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,352
Do you want to go and play
out with... the kids?

268
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,389
No?

269
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,351
Sean, this is it.

270
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,359
We're in. Come on, Serena.
Mickey, come on, hurry up.

271
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,352
The one
right in front of you, Sean.

272
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,517
Just up there, yeah?
This is new, isn't it?

273
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,396
Yeah.
Yeah.

274
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,276
It's not bad. When they said a women's
refuge I thought it would be terrible.

275
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,357
- Well, you've got a bed each.
- It's not too bad.

276
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,273
Oh, let's get this in.

277
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,311
I can too!

278
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,394
Hey, hey, hey, come on, stop fighting.
You sleep there, Sean, Mickey over there.

279
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,352
Do you want to sleep there then, Serena?

280
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,394
My bed's much bouncier than yours.
Anyway, you've got an extra job to do -

281
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,319
- shut the curtains.
- The roof leaks in here though.

282
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,515
Where I lived, the walls leaked.

283
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,399
Compared to the flat,
this is like a bloody palace.

284
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,432
Watch the lights and all, the wiring's dodgy.

285
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,476
And... Oi!

286
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,478
- What are you doing?
- Has Gary been in 'ere?

287
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,359
Out! I've told you about
barging into people's rooms!

288
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,318
- Gary!
- Watch your kids in here.

289
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,276
There's some right little sods around.

290
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,471
Kids are kids, aren't they?

291
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,310
Social services was asking after you.
They thought you'd be here this morning.

292
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,348
I don't want nothing to do with them.
They've done nothing for me.

293
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,392
I don't think we need them anymore,
do you, son?

294
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,358
They've done nothin' for us whatsoever.

295
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,432
George, I really shouldn't be here.
I have to go.

296
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,433
What is it? You're up and down,
up and down like... like a flea.

297
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,471
Sit down, it's OK, tell you.

298
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,439
Look, whatever you're after,
you're not getting it off me.

299
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,393
- I just want to know you.
- Right, I'm the Queen Mother.

300
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,436
I'll see you around. Goodbye.

301
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,476
Stop it, stop it.

302
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,429
Stop.

303
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,391
It just opens like this.

304
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,278
Just leave me alone.

305
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,511
Just leave me alone.

306
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,352
I think you have too much pain.
I've seen it before.

307
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,319
Oh, yeah? Is that how
you get your kicks, is it?

308
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,478
There's a job at the Samaritans.
Why don't you go after it?

309
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,315
It just goes round and round and round
every fucking day in my head

310
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,430
and it won't leave. It won't stop!

311
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,313
Don't do that. Don't do that.

312
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,311
You won't help yourself.

313
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,437
They're my kids!
Why won't they give me my kids back?

314
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,271
They're not that woman's kids, they're mine!
I only let them once -just once!

315
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,312
And they've taken them away! My kids...

316
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,396
I love my kids.

317
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,319
? So smile for a while and let's be jolly

318
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,357
? Love shouldn't be so melancholy

319
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,428
? Come along
and share the good times while we can

320
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,436
? I beg your pardon

321
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,308
? I never promised you a rose garden

322
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,476
? Along with the sunshine

323
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,517
? There's gotta be a little rain sometimes?

324
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,478
Whoo! Thank you!

325
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,313
Maggie! Maggie!

326
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,316
Maggie, hey!

327
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,470
Geezer on the phone!
Trouble at home, love!

328
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,479
- Who was it?
- I don't know. You'd better go quick!

329
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,356
Stop! Stop!

330
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,429
Stop!

331
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,277
Stop!

332
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,470
- Sean!
- Maggie! It's all right!

333
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,431
Oh, what have I done?!

334
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,431
They're safe.

335
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,392
Who is she?
You're the mother?

336
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,319
OK, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the hospital.

337
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,390
They're not in there.
They're not in there.

338
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,273
I'll take you to the hospital
to see your children.

339
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,476
Are you all right? Maggie?

340
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,270
- Yeah, yeah. Are we nearly there now?
- Don't worry, love.

341
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,433
- Can I help you?
- Please... I need to see my children.

342
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,471
- What's the name?
- Conlan.

343
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,314
OK, just hang on a minute. Sister? Sister.

344
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,319
- You've gotta help me to find them...
- We'll let you see them.

345
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,311
They're fine, they're fine.

346
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,392
What's happened to them?
What's happened?

347
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,312
They're going to be all right.

348
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,477
Oh, no! Oh, no!

349
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,478
Oh, my God, what's happened to him?!

350
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,393
- Oh, what's he...
- He's fine, he's fine.

351
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,432
So, you let the children alone in the room.

352
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,314
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- You locked the door...

353
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,470
and gave the key to Sarah
who lives there.

354
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,433
No, no, I did not give the key to Sarah.

355
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,392
I gave the key to Jill.

356
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,431
Jill! With a J.

357
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,431
Not Sarah.

358
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,472
Jill doesn't recall you giving her the key.

359
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,351
God...

360
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,351
Do you not fucking listen!

361
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,470
I gave the key to Jill.

362
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,479
Oh! I gave the key to Jill!

363
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,471
Not Sarah!

364
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,354
OK, Maggie, come
and sit down. You've had an awful shock.

365
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,275
I know I shouldn't have let the kids alone!
I've never done it before!

366
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,398
I gave the key to Jill.

367
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,399
- Why did you lock the door?
- I wasn't locking the kids in,

368
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,392
I was locking the other kids out.

369
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,390
That's when I started to lose 'em.

370
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,273
He let the hospital
and he's gone to the foster mother,

371
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,472
and each time I'm just losing them
more and more.

372
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,314
And it's not gonna be like it was before.

373
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,274
Oh, hello, Maggie.
Nearly given up on you. Come in.

374
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,393
I've got three other kids to look after,
and I have to get two buses here.

375
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,352
I thought you were coming this afternoon.

376
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,470
Oh, Sean's coming on quite well now.

377
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,511
He's made friends with Kevin down the road

378
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,469
and been in Kevin's house a few times.
They're getting on well.

379
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,273
Oh, yeah? Where is Sean anyway?

380
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,312
- Oh, he's up in bed.
- Bed?! This time of night?

381
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,318
- It's only half eight.
- Look...

382
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,433
Have your cup of coffee, get your
breath back and you can see him.

383
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,517
- You don't mind if I smoke?
- No, I'll get an ashtray.

384
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,511
Here you go.

385
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,514
There's something I've been meaning
to say, it's been playing on my mind.

386
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,275
Sean's been mentioning
he wants to put sauce on his chips.

387
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,392
- What?
- You know, sauce? Tomato sauce.

388
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,352
I don't like them having that on their food.

389
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,428
It's hard enough for me as it is, Mary,
to put a meal together on not a lot of money

390
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,275
I don't want it spoilt with all that.
It's full of additives and crap.

391
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,518
Besides, if he starts getting used to it
the other three will want it.

392
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,511
OK, fine.

393
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,396
Anyway, how's his skin?
Them burns healing?

394
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,477
- He's coming on nicely.
- You put the ointment on?

395
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,512
- Of course, yeah.
- Put it on yet? Tonight?

396
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,353
No, I was gonna go up in a minute but...

397
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,315
- I do it before he goes to sleep normally.
- Well, I might as well do it.

398
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,399
Yeah, that's OK with me.
But have your coffee first. No rush.

399
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,512
No rush? No rush?
Mary, no disrespect to you

400
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,511
but I'm not here
to drink your fucking coffee.

401
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,317
I'm here to see my son.

402
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,318
Just... Just calm down a bit first, Maggie.

403
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,512
Calm down? How can I calm down?
And what's all this crap on the wall here?

404
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,271
Calm down? He's my son.

405
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,390
And what's all this? Fires?

406
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,318
It'd be better if you didn't upset him.

407
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,319
Upset him? What's this doing?
Look where Sean is, Mary.

408
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,517
He's stuck right in the middle.
And where am I? Outside!

409
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,271
- I know what you're feeling...
- You don't!

410
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,359
- I'm a mother too.
- You're not my fucking son's mother!

411
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,359
And let me tell you, I know your little games,
all your little twists.

412
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,433
Block mummy out.
Well, it won't fucking work cos he's my son!

413
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,430
You're not keeping him! He's not yours.
I know what your little games are like.

414
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,353
I'm not here to drink fucking coffee with you,
I'm here to see him.

415
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,472
If you haven't put the ointment on,
I might as well do it

416
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,398
cos I'm not sitting here with you.

417
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,308
Hello, son. How you doing, eh?

418
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,318
Ooh, I've missed you.

419
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,312
How are you? Eh?

420
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,352
Ohh, God.

421
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,511
- How's Mickey?
- He's great.

422
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,273
Let's see how you are though.

423
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,357
- Has he been borrowing my roller skates?
- He has.

424
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,518
Tonight, as a special treat, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna learn to do this.

425
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,352
You'd rather have your mum changing it
than Mary.

426
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,315
Keep still, keep still, keep still.
I know it's sore, I know it's sore but...

427
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,353
- Ow!
- Sorry if I'm hurting you but let me do it.

428
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,430
- Come on, let me do it.
- Ah!

429
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,313
Shit. I'm sorry.

430
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,279
I'm sorry, Sean.

431
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,311
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

432
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,476
Oh, what are they doing to us?

433
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,432
What are they doing to us, Sean?

434
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,435
Here. Please.

435
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,311
Oh, don't.

436
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,351
We explained this. You can only
get Sean home under certain conditions.

437
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,389
Under the circumstances you're lucky
we haven't started care proceedings.

438
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,437
I'm not going into no detention centre. OK?

439
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,472
- I'm not going.
- It's not a detention centre.

440
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,356
It's called a family centre.
It's to help you rehabilitate and cope.

441
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,358
We're not trying to punish you or anything.

442
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,392
We'd be able to help you there.

443
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,312
And to assess how you're getting on.

444
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,354
I'm not going to the detention centre.
If you want to help me, get me a flat,

445
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,354
- not stick me in a doss house.
- We just want to assess how you're coping.

446
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,476
I'll cope much better if my son's home.

447
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,512
Last week he didn't even
want to come to me

448
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,354
because you're trying to
turn him against me.

449
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,472
The thing is, Maggie, Sean nearly died.

450
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,436
I know Sean nearly died. How do you think
that makes me feel? Let's all rub it in, eh?

451
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,273
Maggie, listen to me, please.

452
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,515
Your children are on the at risk register.

453
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,397
We need some reassurance
that you're working with us.

454
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,319
They're only on there
because of you!

455
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,471
Why don't you just leave me alone
and give me my son back?

456
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,310
- But no, you can't do that.
- No, it's our statutory duty

457
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,437
to provide safe accommodation
for you and your kids.

458
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,393
And your kids' best interest
is what we are concerned with.

459
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,358
My kids' best interest
is to have their brother back.

460
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,392
My best interest is to have my son back!

461
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,468
My son's best interest is to be home with us!
Not playing fucking happy families!

462
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,392
Maggie, please listen,
we want you to have Sean back

463
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,353
but unfortunately, the law says
that we have to send you to this place.

464
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,428
If you don't cooperate, then we will
have to take all your children into care.

465
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,309
There are just a couple of rules -
no alcohol on the premises

466
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,478
and no visitors in the rooms.
We lock the door at night for security.

467
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,513
Have you got any baby milk?
I never had a chance to get any.

468
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:29,356
Oh, no, we haven't got any formula at all.
We haven't had any little ones for ages.

469
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,516
I've fucking had enough!

470
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,510
Maggie, I'm sorry, I've got to sort this out.

471
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,317
I don't care,
just bring him in here!

472
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,269
They're driving me fucking mad!
Get in here now!

473
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,356
- Now! Come on.
- Come on, kids.

474
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,517
We're not putting up with this.
Come on, come on.

475
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,308
Come on, love. Come on.

476
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,309
- I should take you to the refuge.
- Mairead, I've done a runner.

477
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,471
The refuge is the first place
they're gonna look for me.

478
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,399
You can't stay at ours.
You two don't get on, you know that.

479
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,428
I just can't take no more. I really can't.
You just don't know what it's like.

480
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,473
Where am I gonna go with the kids?
I can't sleep in the street.

481
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,278
Hold the door, Mickey.

482
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,311
Come on.

483
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,431
Keep up, Mickey.

484
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,311
Go on. Leave the bags, go in.

485
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,431
Leave the bags.

486
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,316
Give us a kiss.

487
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,351
Hello, boy.

488
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,511
- Hello, Mags.
- Hello.

489
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,311
- Are you back?
- Yeah.

490
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,356
Hello, Mary. Hello, darling.

491
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,351
Hello, precious.

492
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,358
I missed you. Come here.

493
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,358
Mickey, come on, you must keep up.
Quickly.

494
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,273
Mum, these bags are heavy!

495
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,477
Have we got everything?
Have we got the baby's bottle?

496
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,471
We shouldn't have slept in.

497
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,352
- Maggie!
- Oh! Mickey! Run!

498
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,318
Get away from him! Get away!

499
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,399
Maggie... Maggie...
Fuck off! Get in the van!

500
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,318
- Don't be a fool, Maggie!
- Whoa! Whoa!

501
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,396
- Maggie!
- No, no, no, calm down.

502
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,278
- We're only going shopping.
- Maggie!

503
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,470
Lock the door.
We're only going shopping.

504
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,355
If you go now you'll lose the kids forever!
I'm trying to help you!

505
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,312
- Go!
- You'll lose the children forever!

506
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,355
Shit, Simon, watch the road!

507
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,437
She's gonna help us!
She couldn't do shit.

508
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,514
I don't know if I'm right but ain't today
the day you get paid your money?

509
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,273
Yeah, why?

510
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,515
Well, we could go and pick it up, that's all.

511
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,308
We can't stop now,
what about them after us?

512
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,470
We'll be at your sister's soon, anyway.

513
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,318
Mags, just go and get it now.

514
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,356
How can I get it now? We'll be there before
you know it. Please, don't stop now.

515
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,352
- Maggie... now.
- Oh, please, we've gotta go...

516
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,391
Get out.

517
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,513
What is the matter with you?
You're starting again, ain't ya?

518
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,512
You're gonna fucking start again.
I don't...

519
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,273
You're fucking starting.
What is the matter with you? Why do you?

520
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,437
Why do you have to fucking start?!
You start every fucking time!

521
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,432
You prat! Why do you fucking start?!

522
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,477
Why do you do it, eh? Why do you do it?
Why do you fucking do it?

523
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,518
Go up the fucking Post Office. Get up!

524
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,432
Get up the Post Office now!

525
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,398
Get up now! Get up there!

526
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,431
I never saw them again.

527
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,351
I went into town...

528
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,396
phoned the police

529
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,433
told them that my ex had the kids,
I couldn't get them off him.

530
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,358
They came along and took them.

531
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,469
I never saw them again.

532
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,398
But, Maggie, you will get them back.

533
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,476
No.

534
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,431
I go to court next month though.

535
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,477
See? I told you, you will get them back.

536
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:57,310
And now they're trying to say
my ex fella was interfering with the kids.

537
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,476
Well, that I wouldn't have let happen.

538
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,511
I'd have killed him first.

539
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,353
Listen, I'd better get off anyway.

540
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,432
- Can you lend us a fiver for the taxi?
- Listen...

541
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,516
- I have a cake.
- A what?!

542
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,358
- I have a cake.
- A cake?

543
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,312
- Yeah.
- Cake at this time of the morning?

544
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,471
Well, we eat it.
Come on, don't say no to a cake.

545
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,432
- Come on.
- Cake!

546
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,511
- A cake.
- And coffee.

547
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,511
- And coffee. All right.
- OK?

548
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,359
We used to have a... a piece of land,
not very big.

549
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,430
And, er, we had all this maize planted,
and pumpkin and other vegetables.

550
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,477
And who are all these?
Are they all your family?

551
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,476
Yeah, that's my uncles.

552
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,513
One died in bed, the other one
was hung somewhere in the farm.

553
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,398
Hung? What was he hung for?

554
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,437
Well, what happened
is that they owned the land

555
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,316
and it's a good land but these...
other people, rich and powerful,

556
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,436
they... they want that land.

557
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,436
So what happened is that in all
these situation, they... killed some of them.

558
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,355
There are some people in my country
that... would kill me, you know?

559
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,311
- Kill you?
- Yeah.

560
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,278
You know, I have, er, political problems.

561
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,278
I don't understand what that means.

562
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,311
It is dangerous to...

563
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,356
alleviate the suffering.

564
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,394
Because suffering has a job to do
for the government.

565
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,313
So you leave these things quiet
and you don't touch them.

566
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,351
But I did.

567
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,438
Then I look after children
whose parents had been killed.

568
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,476
- And then I wrote about it...
- Mm.

569
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,513
...an article for a magazine,
and then more problem.

570
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,396
Is that why they wanna kill you now?

571
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,359
- Well, yes.
- And who's that? Is that you up there?

572
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,392
- Yeah, that's me.
- Is that your sister with you?

573
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,431
- No, that's my wife.
- Your wife?

574
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,359
- Yeah.
- Fucking tell me now you're married.

575
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,397
- Are you divorced?
- I don't know. Now, maybe...

576
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,431
It's been too long time.

577
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,511
Sometime...

578
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,399
Sometimes I find
I don't want to belong to my country.

579
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,479
Don't want to miss it. I don't want to love it...

580
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,517
because I have no hope let.

581
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,399
But... you have to love something...

582
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,436
or you are empty.

583
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,470
But anyway... none of that is here.

584
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,437
It's you and I, and we know each other.

585
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,515
- We talk a lot tonight, didn't we?
- Yeah.

586
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,471
- We did.
- We can...

587
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,393
We can be close, you and I.
And understand each other and...

588
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,273
- Don't you think so?
- Yeah.

589
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,351
We can.

590
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,470
Anyway, I have to be going.

591
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,478
Do you wanna give us that fiver for the taxi?

592
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,438
We can show that you're trying
to get out of the refuge.

593
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,313
- Yeah.
- And you're living quietly.

594
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,311
- Yeah.
- There are no men in your life?

595
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,429
No.

596
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,435
I said no.

597
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,435
Dr Marsden, if you could just wait there,
please. My friend may have some questions.

598
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,473
Dr Marsden, yes, I've read your
supplementary report as well.

599
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,433
Are you not, in fact, saying
that my client is a good mother?

600
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,438
I don't think anyone could doubt
her love for her children

601
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,479
but I have serious doubts
about her ability to care for them.

602
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,355
- Isn't that statement contradictory?
- No.

603
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:25,276
But you don't deny that she has
an obvious and deep love for her children?

604
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,815
Yes. But children need more than love.
They need support and they need security.

605
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:36,310
Is there any evidence to show
that my client is unable to provide this?

606
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,309
Mr Anderson, there's been an abundance
of such evidence brought before us.

607
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,476
Madam, my point is
that my client is not of herself

608
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,354
incapable of being a supportive parent

609
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,512
once she's removed from an inadequate
home and an abusive relationship.

610
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,518
Dr Marsden, can you be certain that
Maggie Conlan's deficiencies as a parent

611
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,355
aren't due to circumstances
entirely outside her control?

612
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,358
Her choice of partner is in her control.

613
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,509
I'm not with anyone now!

614
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,435
The children have been subjected to scenes
of violence and abuse from an early age.

615
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,309
Ms Conlan seems likely to continue
her pattern of abusive relationships.

616
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,354
- I'm not with anyone else!
- I would like to remind you of the fire...

617
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,391
Maggie!

618
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,351
George? George?

619
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,476
- Maggie...
- You lied to me, Liz!

620
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,519
- I'm sorry.
- You said I'd get kids back and I never!

621
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,317
You never know for sure.
You lied! George!

622
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,309
George! They took all the kids
and they're not going to give them back!

623
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,273
- Maggie, what happened?
- They took all the kids!

624
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,312
Oh, Maggie. Oh, God.

625
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,311
Some tea and some Jaffa Cakes.

626
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,430
- No, thanks.
- You should eat.

627
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,311
You should eat.

628
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,510
It's only a month since you lost your kids.

629
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,310
And I know the pain is still there,
you cannot think straight...

630
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,471
but you have to eat.

631
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,278
Eat a little bit and drink a little bit.

632
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,359
In another month,
you will be a little bit better.

633
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,313
And in another month
you will be a little bit better.

634
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,319
And one day you will be able to smile again.

635
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,511
And I'll be here.

636
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,510
Come, eat something.

637
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,479
You know, my visa expired this week.

638
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,511
No, I didn't know.

639
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,517
If I stay I will be an illegal alien.

640
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,318
Well, don't let me hold you back.

641
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,393
If you don't want me here, just say.
Gi' us the taxi money and I'll go home.

642
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,351
You know what this?

643
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,510
This is a ticket from Heathrow to Madrid.

644
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,308
This is the bloody ticket
from Madrid to South America.

645
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,435
Come... Sit.

646
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,351
That's your ticket.

647
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,356
Look...

648
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,392
if you don't want me... I'm here.

649
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,431
If you want me, I'm here anyway.

650
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,318
I want to stay with you, so I'm staying.

651
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,476
If you don't want to see me, it's OK.

652
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,511
Fine. Just fine.

653
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,399
And I'll leave you alone.
But I'll still be here.

654
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,431
But why?

655
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,431
Because I love you.

656
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,352
Because I want to help you.
I can help you.

657
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,430
And because you are a reason to love.

658
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,358
And I need that. I need you.

659
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,391
Here...

660
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,431
Here's your fare for the taxi.

661
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,396
I don't want your money, George.

662
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,271
I never wanted your money.

663
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,437
Just for once I just wanted to be
the one who didn't lose.

664
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,311
You do believe I love you?

665
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,353
Love isn't for me.
Love's for fuckin' fairy tales.

666
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,516
Well, I do.

667
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,399
You believe it or not, I do.
And I'll still be here.

668
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,510
But I'm not worth it anyway.

669
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,396
I'm just not worth it.

670
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,309
Here's the baby - head, body...
little heart beating away. See?

671
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,311
Yeah.

672
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,510
It's got it's spine at the top,
just there.

673
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,274
Little legs down here.
That's the bottom end.

674
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,511
It's about 14 weeks.

675
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,312
Look, she's gonna be a girl. See?

676
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,312
How do you know, Dr Spock?

677
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,275
You can't tell whether it's a girl yet.
Can you, nurse? Tell him.

678
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,470
That's the head we're looking at there.

679
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,392
See? That's it's head, not it's bum.

680
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,510
Just going to measure the head now.

681
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,511
Is this your first baby?

682
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,511
- It's our first.
- It is?

683
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,350
Just measuring the baby's head now.

684
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,357
Its just here.
Stop complaining anyhow.

685
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,391
What's the point in that?

686
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,278
Hey, hey, can't you stop that?

687
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,470
Come on, stop it. Leave him alone.

688
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,278
- Come on.
- What do you want?

689
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,357
- Give him to me. What are you doing?
- It's the old bag's dog.

690
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,436
- He wants his food.
- You want me to put you in there?

691
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,471
- Shut up!
- Mind your own business.

692
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,270
- Why don't you get lost?
- Why don't you go back home?

693
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,470
- OK, boy?
- What you doing with my dog?

694
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,516
- Give me my dog.
- They were...

695
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,430
What do you think you're doing with my
dog? Don't know who you are.

696
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,359
- They were trying to...
- Go and play with the traffic.

697
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,392
- Listen...
- I don't know who you are. Go away.

698
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,352
You leave my dog alone,
don't ever touch him again.

699
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,352
? Neighbours...?
Come on, get in.

700
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,312
What a nice way of meeting the neighbours.

701
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,276
Oh, get in.

702
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,511
Eh, it's not bad, is it?

703
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,308
Is that the kitchen?

704
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,392
It's like a palace
compared to what we've had.

705
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,358
Ohh. I thought it was too good.
Look, damp.

706
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,518
- Had to be something, didn't there?
- We can do something about that.

707
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,476
But will it come back?

708
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,311
Big enough for a family?

709
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,311
Well, it's possible.

710
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,352
- What's out there?
- Let's see.

711
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,272
Look at this.

712
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,356
Look at this, it's massive.

713
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,476
We can have a lot of plants here.

714
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,397
Hi, Peter. This is my friend I told you about.

715
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,273
- Oh, and you are?
- I-I'm Jorge.

716
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,470
Pleased to meet you. When can you start?

717
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,471
- Er, straight away.
- Right.

718
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,398
- Any experience?
- Some, yeah.

719
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,399
All right, start today.
I'll stick you on the payroll tomorrow.

720
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,512
- You got any papers?
- No... I don't.

721
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:58,390
Tell you what, I'll do a deal with you - I ask
no questions, you get two quid an hour.

722
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,432
- Two quid an hour?
- Take it or leave it.

723
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,471
Look at this one.

724
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,511
You like it?

725
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,351
Maggie?

726
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,391
Bastards.

727
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,471
I think it's quite nice.

728
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,511
Just feel.

729
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,469
It's the right size. And I feel like
dancing with my baby already.

730
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,318
You like it?

731
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,356
Let's see, here's the baby.

732
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,431
That's the baby.

733
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,472
- Give it a fuckin' rest, George.
- What's wrong?

734
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,516
Something you read in the paper?

735
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,351
Oh, shit.

736
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,356
Oh, shit.

737
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,273
I can't believe this.
I've really had enough this time.

738
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,270
George, take these clothes
and get them the fuck out of my sight!

739
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,516
I'm sick of it! I'm fucking sick of it!

740
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,475
They won't leave me alone for five minutes!

741
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,432
They won't be happy until I'm fucking dead!

742
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:31,311
You must live in cuckoo fucking land!
Everything's brilliant, isn't it, George?!

743
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,477
What makes you mad?!
What makes you tick up there?!

744
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,318
Anger is going to kill you too.

745
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,393
How can it kill me, George? How?!
Because I can't cope anymore!

746
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,355
Look at them, George, smiling down at me!
And what can I do?! Nothing!

747
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,391
Maggie, please...

748
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,469
Please...

749
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:58,311
You want me to build my hopes up again,
that this is gonna be different! It's not!

750
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,435
Maggie...

751
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,438
I'm not angry any more, George,
I'm not angry!

752
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,519
I'm frightened! I want these back!
I want this baby! I want you!

753
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,511
- Come...
- Get off!

754
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,397
- I'm just fright...
- Please, Maggie, please...

755
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,434
- I'm not taking any fucking more of this.
- You're not alone, you know that.

756
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,516
You know I'm staying here for you.

757
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,311
I know...

758
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,471
- Oi!
- Oi, you bitch!

759
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,391
Oi, bitch!

760
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,478
What the hell's going on? Hey!

761
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,398
- I've had enough of you!
- Shut up!

762
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,391
- George?
- Yeah?

763
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,437
I'm going down with the washing.
I won't be long.

764
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,473
- Don't worry, I'll go later.
- I'm going round the bend in there.

765
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,432
I might as well go. I've only got a bit.

766
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,431
Is that her going on again?

767
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,274
She's always going on with the kids,
isn't she?

768
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,355
Don't worry about this, OK?
Just leave her alone, don't get involved.

769
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,515
- Terrible
- Especially her.

770
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,432
What you lookin' at, you old cow? You.

771
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,393
Who you talkin' to?
I can stand on my own balcony, if I want.

772
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,312
I fucking can! You gonna stop me?!

773
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,314
Every night we hear your business -
the fighting, with a foreign git like him.

774
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,436
- Hey!
- How can you let him touch you?

775
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,391
He speaks better fucking English than you!

776
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,434
- You can't speak English without F-ing!
- I only know two words - piss off!

777
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,398
- Don't get involved
- What?! Listen to him!

778
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,432
I'm talking to the organ grinder,
not the monkey!

779
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,473
At least I pay my rent.
Social Security don't pay my rent!

780
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,359
Go back to Liverpool!
And take that git with you!

781
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,393
- Don't let her talk to you...
- Come on, listen, she's angry

782
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,470
she's happy making you play her game.

783
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,433
Scampy's indoors, all right?
And he's all right, thanks.

784
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,316
- Did he get through the window all right?
- Was it you did that? You bastards.

785
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,278
We have our... our life here, just let...

786
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,359
- No, I'm not saying nothing, just...
- Don't get involved, OK?

787
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,353
All we ever got is trouble from you.
Nothing but trouble.

788
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,393
Why don't you just piss off
and get out of it, eh? For God's sake.

789
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,356
That's terrible, that.

790
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,432
Please, could you move?
Excuse me for a minute.

791
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,516
Go on, you squirt her.

792
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,269
Yes!

793
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,517
Oi! What's goin' on?!
Get that bloody gorilla off of here!

794
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,475
Get that bloody gorilla back in his cage!

795
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,391
How do you like it, eh?

796
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,312
OK, you go in now
or you get the same treatment.

797
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,351
Oh, behave! No! I'm gonna go in!

798
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,278
Come on, Maggie.
You will set the bed on fire.

799
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,311
I thought you was asleep.

800
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,432
It's not good for the baby or for you.
And you'll set the bed on fire.

801
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,391
Put it out.

802
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,351
What's happening?

803
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,277
Maggie?

804
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,511
- Do you want to go to the hospital?
- Oh, George, not yet.

805
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,271
Fuckin' hell.

806
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,311
It's OK.

807
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,351
Take the sheet away.

808
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,438
Just gonna clean you down below
a minute.

809
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,433
OK, when you get the next pain
take a nice deep breath in

810
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,313
and push right down into your bottom.

811
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,319
That's it.
Keep going, keep going, good.

812
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,390
OK, let it out.

813
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,273
OK, just breathe this pain through.

814
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,392
You bastard, George.

815
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,274
Come on.
You're doing really well.

816
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,392
- The baby's nearly out.
- It will be OK.

817
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,397
- I'm going to push now.
- OK, big push.

818
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,352
Nice big push, right down to your bottom.

819
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,318
Super. Go on, keep it going. Keep pushing.

820
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,476
Keep pushing.

821
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,273
Keep pushing, keep pushing. OK.

822
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,392
- Let go of my arm.
- That's it, that's it.

823
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,512
OK, just stop pushing,
stop pushing.

824
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,511
Stop pushing.

825
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,390
OK. Baby's head is out, all right?

826
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,313
Just waiting for baby
to come down a bit more, all right?

827
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:59,309
- What's the matter?
- We're clearing the baby's airways.

828
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,352
Pain coming up? Pain coming up? No?

829
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,279
There, it's out. It's a little girl. A little girl.

830
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,515
- You've got a girl.
- Oh!

831
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,275
You... bastard. I wanted a boy.

832
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,308
? Me la dio tu amor?

833
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,436
? Da-da da da-da ba-ba...?

834
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,392
What's this,
the Eurovision Song Contest?

835
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,510
And where were you yesterday?

836
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,317
At the hospital. I've got a beautiful daughter.

837
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,352
Congratulations, you just lost two days pay.

838
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,351
But it only was one day out.

839
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,477
You seriously inconvenienced me.
Seriously.

840
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,431
- Está caliente el hombre.
- ¿Qué le pasa?

841
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,318
- Hello!
- Who is it?

842
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,436
It's the health visitor, Mrs Modegwa.

843
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,396
- Hi. Mrs Modegwa?
- No.

844
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,273
Oh, I'm sorry. Erm...

845
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,312
I thought... I'm looking for Maggie Modegwa.

846
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,279
No, you're seven years out of date -
he's gone back to Kenya.

847
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,356
You've got some old files there, haven't you?

848
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,430
Can I see the baby?

849
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,390
I just came to see the baby!

850
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,396
? Duerme, duerme, negrita?

851
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,436
You'll have her as mad as yourself.

852
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:56,315
? Que tu mama
está en el campo, negrita?

853
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,517
You like that song?
Listen, I'm singing to you, eh?

854
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,271
I'm singing to you.

855
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,312
Look. Look at the birds over there.

856
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,390
Look, do you want to look?
Don't you want to look?

857
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,275
- The birds, the sky.
- She can't hear you, soft thing.

858
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,390
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

859
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,439
- Who is it?
- Moira Denning, your health visitor.

860
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,517
- What do you want?
- How are you coping with the new baby?

861
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,430
- Coping fine, why?
- Can I come in?

862
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,278
- What for?
- To see the baby.

863
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,518
- There's nothing wrong with the baby.
- It's routine. Are you coping OK?

864
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,352
- Why don't you want me to come in?
- I never said that.

865
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,269
I never said I didn't want you to come in.
You better come in then.

866
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,515
I'm going out soon.
The baby's over there on the couch.

867
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,469
Hello. Hello. Oh, she's gorgeous.
Hello, darling.

868
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,353
- Could you pick her up for me?
- Ive just put her down.

869
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,351
- Is she feeding all right?
- Yeah.

870
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,470
- Sleeping?
- Yeah.

871
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,436
And how about you, Mrs Conlan?

872
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,270
Why do you want to know how I am?
I thought you came to see the baby.

873
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,278
Could you just sit down
so we can have a chat?

874
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,311
I'm on my way out.

875
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,353
This is your... fifth child,
is that correct, Maggie?

876
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,437
- That's right.
- And how are the other four?

877
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,474
All right. My sister, Mairead, she's looking
after them for a couple of weeks.

878
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,392
Maggie, I know your other kids are in care.

879
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,319
I know about the fire
and everything that happened.

880
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,477
But you couldn't get
my fucking name right last week.

881
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,478
If there's uncertainty
about the father's name...

882
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,472
There's no bloody uncertainty
about her fathers name.

883
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,398
- How are you, Maggie?
- I'm all right, why?

884
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,473
Be a lot more better if you stopped
snooping round every fuckin' five minutes.

885
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,432
Can I ask what that mark on your face is?

886
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,270
Oh, God! You've got such
fuckin' x-ray eyes today, haven't you?

887
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,517
If you must know, it's off this.
That's what that done.

888
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,469
OK.

889
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,314
I think you best get off now,
cos I'm waiting to go out.

890
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,351
Well, I'm happy with the baby.

891
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:26,393
- Have Social Services been round?
- No, and I don't want them here.

892
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,273
Can you bring the baby
to the clinic on Tuesday?

893
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,278
I brought her last week.

894
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,359
- Is that your bedroom?
- You can't go in, I haven't made the bed.

895
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,475
OK.

896
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,308
- So I'll see you in the clinic on Tuesday.
- OK.

897
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,432
- Make sure you bring her with you.
- I will. Ta-ra.

898
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,511
Shit.

899
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,352
- George! What are you doing?
- Is she gone?

900
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,437
She's gone, she heard you though.
What are you doing?

901
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,359
Why did you put that there?
If my mother was here she would...

902
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,434
Cheeky git! It's all your junk!
Where do you want me to stick it?

903
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,392
Well, shove it up your arse then.

904
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,475
- You cheeky bastard!
- Oh!

905
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,435
Stick it up your own arse!
I'm not your fucking mother anyway.

906
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,438
- Come on, let me out!
- I won't. Till you apologise!

907
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,475
Let me out of here!

908
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,399
Shh... He's gone now, he's gone now.

909
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,391
Oh, no...

910
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,430
Oh, the nosey old bag.

911
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,311
Do you remember the kids names?

912
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,355
- Yes.
- Go on...

913
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,359
Sean, N-Nicky...

914
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,430
- Serena and Mary.
- That's it.

915
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,392
But his name's Mickey, with an M, not Nicky.

916
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,432
- Where are they now?
- They've had to go away.

917
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,471
- Why?
- Why?

918
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,357
- Cos they did.
- When?

919
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,430
- Katy...
- Awhile ago now.

920
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,358
You want some Coke?

921
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,436
- Do you want some Coke?
- Yeah.

922
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,359
Right, who's for tea? You want some tea?
Do you want Coke, kids?

923
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,430
Come on, I'll get you some Coke.

924
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,471
I'll get it!

925
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,318
No, leave it.
No, I'll get it.

926
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,278
- No, don't.
- Shut up, will ya?

927
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,276
- Hello.
- Is there a Maggie Conlan here?

928
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,311
Er, no, she's away. Why?

929
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,312
- I need to have a word with her.
- No, she's away.

930
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,515
- Are you Maggie Conlan?
- No.

931
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,431
- Can I come in?
- Don't you understand English?

932
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,517
What's going on?
Whose baby is this?

933
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,354
- Mine.
- Which hospital was it born at?

934
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,351
The Royal.

935
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,273
- Is this your baby?
- I'm Maggie Conlan. What's wrong?

936
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,436
We have a place of safety order
to remove this baby.

937
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,431
- What?
- You understand?

938
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,393
- No. What have I done wrong?
- I have to take the baby with me.

939
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,512
It's a temporary order.
You can challenge it after 72 hours.

940
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,432
- But I have to take the baby now.
- Nothing's happened!

941
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,391
You can attend the case conference.

942
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,432
No, I don't...
I don't even know who you are!

943
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,429
You've made a mistake, not again.
Please, you can't do this, you can't...

944
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,359
- It's only a temporary order...
- It's all different!

945
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,396
I have to take the baby with me now.

946
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,433
- Maggie, calm down.
- Please, you've made a mistake! Please!

947
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,399
We'll have a case conference,
you'll be able to talk about it.

948
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,274
Please, you made a mistake.
I'm not Maggie Conlan.

949
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,312
- Please, Maggie...
- Please just wait till her dad comes in.

950
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,437
- No, you can't.
- Calm down, I've got to take the baby.

951
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,438
- You can't do this again to me! Please!
- Come on, Maggie, please.

952
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,273
I have to take the baby. You can come and...

953
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,437
Go and get George!
Go and get George! Go!

954
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,313
All right! All right!

955
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,392
Shes just had a baby!

956
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,399
What the fuck are you doing?!
Shes just had a fucking baby!

957
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,516
- Calm down. Calm down!
- You're gonna kill her!

958
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,271
Please, give the baby to me.

959
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,313
Calm down.

960
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,438
Do you know
what you've fucking done to her?!

961
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,431
Don't! You'll make it worse.

962
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,516
Maggie, listen!

963
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,313
- Listen to me...
- No!

964
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,430
- Get away!
- No!

965
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,278
Calm down, calm down.

966
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,278
Get off her! Get off her!

967
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,312
- Get off her. Get off her!
Stop it.

968
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,352
- Fuck off!
- Calm down!

969
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,430
Get off of her. Get off of her.

970
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,393
Oh, go and get George!

971
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,278
I'll get him, I'll get him.

972
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,312
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No! No!

973
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,316
Bob...

974
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,398
- Where's George?
- In the back.

975
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,510
- George!
- What's happened?

976
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,350
- They took the baby. Come on.
- What?

977
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,278
They took Zoe.
The Social took the baby! Come on!

978
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,396
- Oh, Christ.
- Oi!

979
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,431
Oi! Come back here!

980
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,358
How... can they do this to us?

981
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,391
How can they do this to us?

982
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,431
They have.

983
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,399
You can't go near them
and tell them nothing, George.

984
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,278
- Yes, we'll tell them.
- It's not safe for you to go.

985
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,390
We'll tell them without shouting.

986
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,278
They don't have to think we are mad.

987
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,310
We'll tell them... they will understand
they made a mistake.

988
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,430
But we have to be gentle.

989
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,319
How can I be nice to them
when they took five of my kids?

990
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,476
One of yours! How can I do that?

991
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,469
How can I stand there and smile at them?
I can't go back to that courtroom.

992
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,433
You don't go shouting,
you have to be gentler.

993
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,477
Explain to them. We have to be nice.
I don't know.

994
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,354
But you have to tell them. We have to.

995
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,515
Ooh. Have you been crying?

996
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,271
Have you been crying?

997
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,356
Have you? She knows it's us, look.

998
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,359
Yes, she knows.
She knows our voices, you know.

999
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,476
- She does.
- She knows how we hold her,

1000
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,511
- our smell.
- Smells!

1001
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,398
Listen to him! Smell! Speak for himself.

1002
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,513
She does remember. She's made of us,
you know? She's made of us.

1003
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,271
Yeah?

1004
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,311
Her nose is all running.

1005
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,389
There.

1006
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,513
How's she got a cold when people
are supposed to be looking after her?

1007
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,274
Do you want to hold her?
OK.

1008
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,517
How are you? You miss us, eh?

1009
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,397
It's OK, it's OK.

1010
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,398
We'll see you again, you know.
We'll see you again.

1011
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,392
- Maggie, your times up.
- Oh, fuck off.

1012
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,477
Come on. Come on, little one.

1013
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,278
As I was saying before...

1014
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,396
Here y'are, love. Do you want sugar?

1015
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,398
- Here, have a biscuit.
- Thank you.

1016
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,273
As I was saying before,

1017
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,472
he's all right. I mean, look at him.
He's placid, he's kind...

1018
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,471
- Thank you.
- Well, you are.

1019
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,353
If anyone's the mouthy one, it's me.

1020
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,359
I'm just sick and tired of people,
every time they look at us,

1021
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,392
it's like he's gonna kick me head in -
and he's not.

1022
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:55,394
You've only got to... Stick a bomb
up his arse and it wouldn't move him.

1023
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:02,430
And all right, I do lose my temper,
I'm not lying about that, I can't help it.

1024
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,432
I mean, I am angry, I'm fucking...

1025
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,471
I mean...

1026
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,278
I said I wouldn't swear. I'm sorry.

1027
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,357
I mean, I do get angry,
I'm not lying about that.

1028
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,472
And I know me own throat...
my mouth cuts me own throat.

1029
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,399
My mouth works before me brain -
thats just me.

1030
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,431
And all we want is the baby back.

1031
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,471
She's done nothing,
George has done nothing

1032
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,313
and I can't see that I've done wrong neither.

1033
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,432
- Do you want a biscuit, Mary?
- Mm. May.

1034
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,471
Oh, May. Sorry.

1035
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:39,350
I mean, as I was saying before,
even if I was guilty of what everyone says,

1036
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,472
I mean, what about... George?

1037
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,476
I mean, he's Zoe's dad.

1038
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,355
He's being... had all kinds
of fingers pointed at him.

1039
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,352
And he's the innocent party in all this.

1040
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,391
I mean, I can take it all.

1041
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,470
But I don't think it's fair on George

1042
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,478
because he's not that type of person to...

1043
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,357
- Do you want a biscuit?
- No, thanks.

1044
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,359
- Go on, you may as well.
- Thanks.

1045
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,397
How's communication between you two?
Do you speak Spanish?

1046
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,398
It takes all my time
to speak English.

1047
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,352
He's the one that speaks all the languages.

1048
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,470
Tell her what languages you speak.

1049
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,508
Well, it's Portuguese, German, French
and some Italian.

1050
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,355
- Apart from my own language, Spanish.
- So he's the clever one.

1051
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:34,394
- But we do OK in English.
- Do you find if you can't communicate

1052
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:39,355
that you get frustrated at all?
You might misinterpret each other?

1053
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,351
No.

1054
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,318
- It depends.
- How do you think we communicate?

1055
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,510
Fucking tom-tom drums?

1056
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:52,356
It all depends. It's not only language you use
to communicate to other people,

1057
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,269
- especially the one you love.
- So you feel you have a stable relationship?

1058
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,392
Yeah, and only
we need our baby, yeah?

1059
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,391
Supportive relationship?

1060
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:07,309
Actually, I can't stand his fucking guts!
Is that what you want to hear?!

1061
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,517
- Is that the way you talk to your children?
- No! With you people

1062
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,432
I haven't had a fucking chance
to say good morning to my children!

1063
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,477
- Perhaps you've never tried!
- How do you fucking know?!

1064
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,275
- Don't, Maggie...
- She thinks you're a fucking alien

1065
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,437
- from outer space, for fuck's sake!
- We have to talk to them.

1066
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,391
That's what you wanna hear, isn't it?

1067
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,472
Do you think that Social Services
like to take your children away?

1068
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,432
They love doing things
to fuck people's brains up.

1069
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,317
- Oh, do they?
- Yeah.

1070
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,275
Do they really? They're not there to help?
If you would help yourself, Maggie,

1071
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,390
the help is there for you and Zoe if you...

1072
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,359
If you wanted to help him or Zoe
you'd bring her back here!

1073
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,352
What you see here is pain.
All you are seeing is pain.

1074
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:55,316
And that is part because our hearts has
been broken because you take our kid away.

1075
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,432
- We took your...
- Listen, Miss fucking social worker!

1076
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,479
You listen to my pain!
What did you do for me when I was little?

1077
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,318
- Maggie...
- My father sexually abused me!

1078
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,432
Was that an environmentally healthy safe
place to fuckin' be?!

1079
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:13,474
No! So you whipped me into the fucking
home! Did it do me any good? Did it fuck!

1080
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,351
No wonder I'm fucked up,

1081
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,430
these fucked my life up
and they're fucking it up again!

1082
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,512
Take the book in your right hand
and read the oath.

1083
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:35,434
I swear that my evidence shall be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

1084
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,477
Mrs Higgs, give the court
your full name and address.

1085
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,432
Pamela Higgs, 35 Margaret Court.

1086
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:49,476
Mrs Higgs, you say in your affidavit
that in your opinion

1087
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,508
the relationship between Miss Conlan
and Mr Arellano is a violent one.

1088
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,271
- Yes.
- Why do you say that?

1089
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,357
They're always shouting.
She's always calling for help.

1090
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,318
- She's lying!
- I know he's hitting her.

1091
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,273
How do you...
how do you come to say that?

1092
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,313
Every night she screams and hollers
and he hit's her.

1093
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:15,309
- It's so loud you can't help looking in.
- And what have you seen?

1094
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,313
I see him holding onto her,
and her screaming to get away from her.

1095
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,510
A couple of months ago
she had a big black eye...

1096
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,474
That's a lie!

1097
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,277
I had a black eye cos I fell over her fucking
whisky bottles her and her sidekick let out.

1098
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:33,393
- You vicious old bitch!
- Mr Anderson, please control your client.

1099
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,512
This behaviour must not
be tolerated in this court.

1100
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,431
Let's see if he's in.

1101
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,318
- Yeah, he's got a bit of a beard.
- Yeah, that's him.

1102
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,395
Yeah, OK.

1103
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:56,520
Mr Arellano, why can you
not return to your native country?

1104
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,398
Well, I-I seem to be an enemy
of the government, so they say.

1105
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,274
Which government is this?
Which country?

1106
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,389
It's Paraguay.

1107
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,428
Mr Arellano, have you taken part,
directly or indirectly

1108
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,393
in any violent acts
against the Paraguayan government?

1109
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:22,434
No. No. The whole country
is involved in violence.

1110
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:28,350
Let me say this.
There is a little boy... is about six

1111
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,511
in the house where I used to work
in my country.

1112
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,352
E- Every day he tries to drown himself.

1113
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,472
He puts some water in-in a little bath

1114
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,314
and he look at it, he want to find a river

1115
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,476
he wants to put his face in the water...

1116
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,311
He's looking for his mother.

1117
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,512
He watched when the soldiers
killed his mother - they drowned her -

1118
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,478
so he's looking for his mother in the water.

1119
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,392
A- And I said, that's wrong.

1120
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,353
And I said that to... to... the people I talked to.

1121
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,511
And I'm not a violent man.
I never hurt anybody.

1122
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,355
I said, "this is wrong". I'm not violent,
I've never been violent.

1123
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,313
- I never will.
- All right, we'll move on from there.

1124
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,356
Mr Arellano, are you married?

1125
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,318
- What?
- Do you have a wife in Paraguay?

1126
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,475
I... I-I don't know.

1127
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,511
I... just don't know.

1128
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,432
You don't know if you have a wife?

1129
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,512
Well, you see, it's been...
it's been a long time.

1130
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,317
I let a long time ago. So I don't know.

1131
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,510
My Lord, I have no further questions
for this witness.

1132
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,350
Mr Anderson,
do you wish to re-examine?

1133
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,349
No, thank you, My Lord.
Thank you, Mr Arellano.

1134
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,516
I'm just going out. I need to walk, OK?

1135
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,511
- Mr Arellano?
- Yeah.

1136
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,398
- Mr Jorge Arellano?
- Yeah, yeah, that's me.

1137
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,439
I'm serving you with a notice of intention
to initiate deportation proceedings

1138
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:22,476
- as an illegal overstayer in this country.
- What does that mean? What did I do?

1139
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,398
When you came here
you were told not to work

1140
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,437
and you took a job at Southern Chicken.

1141
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,438
I am asked to make a very difficult decision.

1142
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,358
I have great sympathy for the mother

1143
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,517
but I am bound to consider
the risks to the child.

1144
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,433
I have heard evidence
in relation to the first four children

1145
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,476
and this weighs very heavily with me.

1146
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,389
The mother has not been able to provide
a stable environment for them.

1147
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,472
The evidence suggests
a woman of low intellect

1148
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,514
and little self control -
as has been borned out in this court earlier.

1149
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,316
She has had a number of partners.

1150
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:06,309
She has put her children, and now this baby,
at risk of violence.

1151
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,519
Her own violent temper, and her refusal
to avail herself of numerous efforts,

1152
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:19,277
efforts and offers of help from the plaintiff
Social Services Department

1153
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,392
suggests she is, in fact, beyond help.

1154
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,479
She asserts that her life
has in any case changed dramatically

1155
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,511
since she met Mr Arellano.

1156
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,359
I see little evidence of change,
and given the defendant's history...

1157
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,395
Maggie!

1158
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,433
I can have no confidence
she will ever change.

1159
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,431
Miss Moore-Davis...

1160
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:50,311
I confirm the ward ship. The minor to remain
in the care of the local authority.

1161
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,352
No access to either defendant.

1162
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,480
I give the local authority leave to place
the minor with long-term foster parents.

1163
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,476
You bastard!

1164
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,318
You fucking bastard!

1165
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,311
Bastard!

1166
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,311
It's all your fucking fault!

1167
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,396
- Get off!
- Maggie, please...

1168
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,392
I'll kill that Mrs Higgs! I'll fucking kill her!

1169
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:31,269
? Yo te perdí, yo te perdí?

1170
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,278
Maggie? Maggie?

1171
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,351
Hey, Maggie, look.

1172
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,352
- What's that then?
- They returned my passport.

1173
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,391
I'm free to stay.

1174
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,468
And the judge said,
"Mr Arellano is a man of good character,

1175
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,278
"and he's not a threat to anyone. "

1176
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,393
- So, here I am.
- So you're stuck here then, are you?

1177
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:10,315
Well, no. I can stay, can leave.
I got my passport, I'm a free man.

1178
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,390
So when you getting off?

1179
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,516
Look, I'm telling you I can stay.

1180
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,318
I mean, they will not deport me.

1181
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,357
I mean, you should have
come with me, you know?

1182
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,518
M- Maybe if you heard it
with your own ears you would believe me.

1183
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:29,431
Why are you stuck here with me
when you can go anywhere?

1184
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,393
You must be fucking mad to stay here.
You may as well go.

1185
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,352
There's nothing keeping you here anymore.

1186
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:40,359
Well, it's you, you know?
You are here, my daughter is here.

1187
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:44,439
She's not here, George! She's not here at
all, or haven't you noticed? She's gone.

1188
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,439
So there's nothing keeping you here
so you might as well fuck off.

1189
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,432
But this is my house, this is my home.

1190
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,431
She's my daughter.

1191
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,431
How could I leave?

1192
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:01,315
I don't want you here. I want you to go.
I really want you to go.

1193
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,351
You've got every intention of going anyway.

1194
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,351
You'll go in the end
so you might as well just go now

1195
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,392
and fucking make it
just as easy for both of us.

1196
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,273
God... please, Maggie.

1197
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,312
Just listen for once, OK?

1198
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,390
You think I'm going to leave you?

1199
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,431
You think that?

1200
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:22,399
Look, I tell you -
I've told you over and over again!

1201
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,318
Look, I'm here, I won't leave you.

1202
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,311
Are you fucking stupid?

1203
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,353
Are you fucking deaf?!
I don't want you here! Fuck off!

1204
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,318
What, you want to hit something? Just hit it.

1205
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,351
Get the fuck out! Get out!

1206
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,392
Get the fuck out! Get out!

1207
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,431
I want you to get out!

1208
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,399
There's door is! Get out! And stay out!

1209
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,311
Fucking stay out!

1210
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,397
Get the fuck out!

1211
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,271
Fuck it!

1212
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,431
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1213
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,358
- Are you sure? Is she OK?
- You OK?

1214
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,358
- Yeah, I just feel a bit sick.
- You sure?

1215
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,391
- Ah...
- What's up?

1216
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,470
At least give me the bleedin' heavy ones.

1217
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,432
- Oh, behave. What are you like?
- You're not fit for this baby.

1218
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,314
I better be, there's nothing I can do about it.

1219
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,477
Do you honestly think
you can hide this one from 'em?

1220
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,359
- I'm gonna keep it.
- Where? In the fucking cupboard?

1221
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,359
- Look, I'm keeping the baby.
- You're booked into the same hospital.

1222
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,278
They've got to stick me in the same hospital.

1223
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,515
Don't you think
you've been through enough?

1224
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,274
What were you thinking of,
going in for another one?

1225
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,515
Look, Mairead, me and George
are gonna have a family,

1226
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,317
if it takes the rest of our lives,
we're gonna have a family.

1227
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,396
You've got your kids, we've got no one.

1228
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,513
So me and George are gonna have ours.
Give us me bag, I'm going home.

1229
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,313
Maggie! Maggie!

1230
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,475
No!

1231
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,318
- Come on.
- No.

1232
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,392
George, tell them, I'm not letting them get
this one, I'm taking it with me.

1233
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,353
You must help them, it will be more difficult.

1234
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,395
- No!
- Maggie, please.

1235
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,431
- No!
- Maggie, come on, please.

1236
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,318
No!

1237
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,472
- Maggie, help them, please.
- Come on, Maggie.

1238
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:26,469
Maggie, relax. Maggie, listen to me.
We've got to get the baby out.

1239
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:30,393
It's staying where it is!
Get away from me!

1240
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,432
- Come on, Maggie.
- No! No!

1241
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,352
- It cannot stay in there.
- No, George! No!

1242
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,436
It can't stay in there. Come on.

1243
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,470
Maggie, the baby's head's coming.

1244
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,392
- Keep yourself on the bed. Come on.
- No!

1245
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,431
- No, no!
- Maggie, push now.

1246
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,271
No.

1247
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,312
Come on, push! Good!
Push!

1248
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,471
That's it! Good!
Well done! Come on, push!

1249
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,308
- That's excellent.
- Push! That's really good, Maggie.

1250
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,278
- One last push, come on.
- One last push!

1251
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,438
And baby's out, well done.
Excellent. Well done.

1252
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,477
You've got a little girl.

1253
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,311
Well done.

1254
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,511
Hello, little one.

1255
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,390
She looks like you.

1256
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,432
- She looks just like you.
- She looks like Sean.

1257
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,311
Oh, look at her little...

1258
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,391
You go bo-bo's, eh?

1259
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,431
There's a good girl.

1260
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,472
You go to sleep in there. That's it.

1261
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,398
Oh, she's a good girl.

1262
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,317
Maggie?

1263
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,512
- Oh, George, I'm glad you're here.
- Are you all right?

1264
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:14,355
Why have they stuck us in here.
Have you seen the solicitor?

1265
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,318
Listen, the nurse just stopped me and, er...

1266
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,478
there's two people want to talk to me...
and, erm...

1267
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:28,316
Well, I saw them and they said they
wanted to talk to us. To both of us.

1268
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,475
Who?

1269
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,353
Well, they want to talk to us.

1270
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,358
- Who?
- They... they are from the Social...

1271
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,475
Services.

1272
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,278
They just said they wanted to talk.

1273
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,515
They didn't say anything else.
Just wanted to talk.

1274
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,274
- After all that they've done to us?
- But I...

1275
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,472
Hello, Maggie. I'm just gonna
check the baby's temperature.

1276
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:03,468
At least they want to talk to both of us,
it's not just you on your own.

1277
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:07,268
We are together and we'll talk to them.

1278
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,356
I mean they just said they...

1279
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:17,313
Maggie Conlan, erm, I'm Kevin McNally
from Social Services.

1280
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,510
- This is my colleague.
- Sarah Thompson.

1281
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,432
You know there's things
we're concerned about...

1282
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,429
and a decision... we came to a decision
last week, where...

1283
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,471
- we will have to...
- No.

1284
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,358
...take the baby to a place of safety.

1285
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,473
What safety?
The baby's safe and you have no right...

1286
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,393
We can go with the baby to the court
but you don't need to take her.

1287
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,477
- It is...
- Just go to your office!

1288
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,399
- Jorge, it is illegal...
- Just leave us alone! No! No!

1289
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,358
Get... Get away from her!
Get away from her!

1290
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,356
Get away!

1291
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,437
- Fuck off!
- Get away from my baby!

1292
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,438
Fuck! Give me back my baby!
Give her back!

1293
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,438
My baby! My baby!

1294
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,431
Get off! Get off!

1295
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,358
No!

1296
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,356
Maggie!

1297
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,351
Maggie, please!

1298
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,516
George, please.

1299
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,398
Maggie! Can we have some?

1300
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,392
Doctor!

1301
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,352
She tried to throw herself out the window.

1302
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,391
Get off!

1303
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,436
No!
Maggie...

1304
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,393
Hold her arm, her arm. Hold her arm down.

1305
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,312
It's all right now.
No!

1306
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,477
Her right arm.
Please, Maggie...

1307
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:45,310
Calm down, Maggie.
OK, hold her arm straight.

1308
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,311
OK, Maggie.

1309
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,390
You need to hold her arm more secure.

1310
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,476
No! No!

1311
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,433
- Maggie, it'll be all right.
- Swab. Just rub that now.

1312
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,318
Get off!

1313
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,316
Ok, Maggie, just...

1314
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,318
All right, Maggie.
Tell her to calm down.

1315
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,353
No!
Bastards!

1316
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,517
She should be quite calm now...
Maggie...

1317
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:19,514
What a juggler you are!

1318
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,430
George, stop tapping the cup.

1319
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,391
Just leave me alone.

1320
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,430
It's driving me crackers, stop it.

1321
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,431
Just lay off, OK?

1322
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,431
Stop tapping the fucking cup!

1323
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,353
Just don't hit me, OK? Don't hit me.

1324
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,392
Who's wound you up? Eh?
Got to you, have they?

1325
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,358
Wound up like a little rubber band, are you?

1326
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,358
Just don't hit me, that's all I'm asking you.
Just don't hit me.

1327
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,393
What are you letting me hit you for?
Any other man wouldn't.

1328
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:56,394
Mind you, any other man wouldn't let
a fucking social worker steal his kids.

1329
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,431
What the hell did you want me to do?

1330
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,516
I told you there were policemen!

1331
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,432
I was thinking about you,
about not killing yourself!

1332
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,432
Yeah. Thinking about me, my arse.

1333
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,313
You could've done something but no.

1334
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:12,437
And what for? They would take me out
of the country. They would deport me.

1335
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:16,439
- Then you would have been alone.
- Better than being stuck here with you!

1336
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,392
You fucking suck-holing bastard!

1337
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,437
You've been down there, haven't you?
Smiling to them, apologising.

1338
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:27,429
What for, after what they've done to us?!
Fucking kissing their arse.

1339
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,510
You want them to think
we're both of us crazy.

1340
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:34,319
So you shout, you swear.
You don't listen to anything.

1341
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:38,273
And what do you listen to? Them!
Suck-holing round them. Kissing their arse.

1342
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,359
The only thing you haven't done
is give them a four-course meal. Fuck off!

1343
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,274
I can't believe
that you fucking held me down

1344
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:55,359
while they walked out with the baby.
I just can't believe it.

1345
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,318
Do you know what?
No wonder your wife fucking let you

1346
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:03,348
because you're nothing but a fucking
spineless bastard who won't do nothing

1347
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:07,439
except hold the mother of his fucking child
down while they walk out with it!

1348
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,399
- What do you want me to do, eh?
- I want you to fuck off.

1349
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,393
- Run away to Paraguay?
- Anything but hold me down!

1350
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,273
- They would think we're mad!
- Who was it holding me down

1351
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,311
and let his daughter get out the door!

1352
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,430
You fuckin' know I couldn't do that!

1353
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:27,318
What the hell do you want me to do?
Ort to be?

1354
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,351
Just one of those men...

1355
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,312
that hit you and beats you up?

1356
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,312
The ones you want to bed,
to sleep with them so bad

1357
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,359
that the social worker don't believe
you should keep your kids?!

1358
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,311
- Because of you!
- Because of me?

1359
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,437
Because you have sex with animals!
Now they think I am an animal!

1360
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:50,316
At least a fucking animal stays with its litter!

1361
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,311
Just calm down, OK?

1362
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,311
Calm down? Calm down?!

1363
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,511
- We calm down, then we talk, OK?
- Talk? Talk?!

1364
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,512
You could've gone out the door
with the baby but no!

1365
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,479
You held onto me!
You weren't supposed to hold me!

1366
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,432
They wasn't taking me,
they were taking her!

1367
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,397
And I fucking hate you for that!
I fucking hate you!

1368
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:18,319
You bastard! You should have
fucking been there and done something!

1369
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,352
- You hate me?
- Yes! I fucking hate you!

1370
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,436
- And you want me dead?
- Yes!

1371
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,432
- Fuck off!
- Well... go away! Just leave me!

1372
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,471
- Go on, get out!
- Just fucking leave me!

1373
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,314
- Go on! Fuck off!
- Just kill myself...

1374
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,351
Out the window.

1375
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,510
I just want to kill myself.

1376
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,511
I just want to die.

1377
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,311
Just want to die.

1378
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:55,439
They took my babies,
they took my... my daughters.

1379
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,311
They rob them from us.

1380
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,358
Just want something... I just want to die.

1381
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:09,397
I just want to...
