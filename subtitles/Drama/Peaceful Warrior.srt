1
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,824
Hello.

2
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:11,334
Breathing pretty heavy
over there.

3
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,801
Just a dream.

4
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,151
You sure you're okay?

5
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,491
Do you want me to leave
or something?

6
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,956
No, stay.
I'm gonna go get some air.

7
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,744
You know you got two
different shoes on, right?

8
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,000
One's a little newer
than the other.

9
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,419
Anything else?

10
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,257
Thanks for stopping by.

11
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,002
What the hell
did you just do?

12
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,424
How did you get up there?

13
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,289
Be strong, fellows.
We going, baby. Come on.

14
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,461
One of us has to move on
some of that. Oh, yeah?

15
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,631
Well, some of us already have.
Hi, Dory.

16
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,426
Hey, Tommy. Hey, Dan!

17
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,595
Looking good,
all right.

18
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,762
Thanks, Trev.

19
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,348
Referring to the endless array
of women, dickhead.

20
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,102
How can they all be in love
with me? Exactly, how can they?

21
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,104
Incoming, gentlemen.

22
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,941
Oh, my sweet mama and papa.

23
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,153
See that smile she gave us?
Yeah. Looked like a toothpaste ad.

24
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,156
Whitest teeth
I've ever come across.

25
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,034
Faster, faster!
Punch hard, punch hard.

26
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,870
Heel! Good!
All right, Jensen.

27
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,998
You work hard and you get
results. That's how it happens.

28
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,715
Nice, Kyle.

29
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,385
Excellent.

30
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,849
Now, who else has some good
stuff to show me today, huh?

31
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,061
All right, Millman. Nice.

32
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,564
Tight. Lower your shoulders.
Good. Keep it tight.

33
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,736
Good, good.

34
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,907
I want to show you something, Coach.
Don't waste energy. Keep that mouth shut.

35
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,076
Good.

36
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,829
Millman. Millman!

37
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,094
Sorry, Coach.

38
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,805
Sorry doesn't mean anything.

39
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,183
I can do this.

40
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,644
I've been working on it.

41
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,939
Get over here!

42
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,861
Nobody on this planet can do
what you are trying to do.

43
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,117
You are great up there, Danny.
You're one of the best I've seen.

44
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,329
You're gonna rank even higher
than you did last year,

45
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,583
and you might make it
through all the qualifiers if

46
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,626
you don't
kill yourself first.

47
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,007
Tommy, you're up.

48
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,804
What's he trying to do?

49
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,557
Three consecutive flips
before he dismounts.

50
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,519
Anybody ever done that?
Nope.

51
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,647
That's why
he's trying to do it.

52
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,150
Thinks it's gonna make him
lord of the rings.

53
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,904
Only, with Middleman, it's where he tries
to tear both arms out of their sockets.

54
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,866
All right, the next qualifying
heat is six weeks from today,

55
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,659
and you know what I say.

56
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,286
Don't think
this is gonna happen

57
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,789
just 'cause you're pretty
and can do a handstand.

58
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,125
You think I'm kidding?

59
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,921
And I've got footage of your
competition you need to see again.

60
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,544
Help you with something?

61
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,803
You can tell me
how you did it.

62
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,642
You like things explained.

63
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,604
Don't you?

64
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,489
How we doing tonight?

65
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,326
Look.

66
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,122
That roof's gotta be at
least 10, maybe 12 feet high.

67
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,835
No human can make a vertical
leap over four or five feet, tops.

68
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,587
I know. I'm a gymnast.

69
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,801
Toughest men's sport in the
world. Most people don't know that.

70
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,722
The Spartans of ancient Greece
were gymnasts, too.

71
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,891
They vaulted over bulls.

72
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,518
Trained their elite warriors
that way.

73
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,270
Did you know that?

74
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,609
I know more than you think. And
you think more than you know.

75
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,236
But knowledge is
not the same as wisdom.

76
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,447
Yeah? What's the difference?

77
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,242
You know how to clean a
windshield, right? Yeah.

78
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,077
Wisdom is doing it.

79
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:35,254
I train seven days a week,
50 weeks out of the year.

80
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,174
Why so much?
Are you serious?

81
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,386
I am a heartbeat away
from qualifying.

82
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,096
Qualifying for what?

83
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,601
You watch the Olympics?
No.

84
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,271
Thanks for stopping by.

85
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,275
Look, even as good as I am,

86
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,781
I gotta do everything I can
to make sure that I qualify.

87
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,619
There's a lot you'd have to know before
you could understand what you saw.

88
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,290
Go. Ask me.
Ask me something.

89
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,043
Ask me anything.

90
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,173
Are you happy?

91
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,012
You said
I could ask you anything.

92
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,349
What does happy
have to do with anything?

93
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,767
Everything.

94
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,811
My dad's got plenty of cash,

95
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,314
school's kind of a breeze,
I get straight A's.

96
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,192
I got great friends,
I'm in great shape,

97
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,320
and I only sleep alone
when I absolutely want to.

98
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,614
So why can't you
sleep at night?

99
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,078
Yesterday, you came here
at 3:00 a. m. Now, tonight.

100
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,455
That's two nights in a row.

101
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,667
What are you? Some kind of a Quickie
Mart philosopher or something like that?

102
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,877
You need some philosophy?

103
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,880
No, thanks, Socrates.
I get enough at school.

104
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,008
Last question.

105
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:06,262
If you don't make the Olympic
team, what will you do?

106
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,185
If I don't what?

107
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,936
You must have thought
about it.

108
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,730
What the hell
are you talking about?

109
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,565
What's the problem?

110
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,070
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

111
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,909
You're a freak. And I don't
need you freaking me out.

112
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,458
Thirteen.

113
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,338
Fourteen.

114
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,757
Your exit sign's lit, Middleman.

115
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,513
Fifteen.

116
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,017
Sixteen.

117
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,729
Hey, there, beautiful thing.
So, this is what you do for fun.

118
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,984
Seventeen.

119
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,736
Eighteen.

120
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,410
Did I pick up that maybe you and
Dory hooked up the other night?

121
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,287
Come on, Dan-o.
It's all you.

122
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,250
Nineteen.

123
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,919
She told you that?
Is it true?

124
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,425
We're supposed to be friends,
man.

125
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,098
What does
that mean, exactly?

126
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,601
It means you're a jerk who
treats his friends like dirt.

127
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,436
Somebody grab my beers.

128
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,109
Somebody grab mine!

129
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,991
Hey! Hey! Hey!

130
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,703
Come on, guys.

131
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,746
Hey, Dan, what's the matter
with you, man?

132
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,041
With friends like you, who
needs assholes, right, Dan-o?

133
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,210
Calm down. What? You
want to fight Tommy?

134
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,964
Who does he think he is? He's
pissed at you, all right? Is it true?

135
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,800
I thought Dory was old news.
All right?

136
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,886
So, excuse me if she
comes banging on my door.

137
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,013
Why? Why, Dan?

138
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,140
Listen to yourself.
Dory was Tommy's girl.

139
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,809
I said I thought it was over!

140
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,437
Just go back
to your party, man.

141
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,647
Okay. Yeah, I will.

142
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,001
Hey.

143
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,257
You want these?

144
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,607
You're really cute.

145
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,951
Jesus!

146
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,879
Susie, you okay?

147
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,050
Yeah.

148
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,260
Sorry.

149
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,998
What's the matter?

150
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,749
Couldn't sleep again?

151
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,762
What would you say
if I told you

152
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,724
that I keep seeing those shoes
in a dream I keep having?

153
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,059
I'd say maybe
you're still asleep.

154
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,027
You can live a whole lifetime
without ever being awake.

155
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,613
Hey, Socrates.

156
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,991
If you know so much,

157
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,661
how come you're working
at a gas station?

158
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,457
This is a service station.
We offer service.

159
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,543
There's no higher purpose.

160
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,506
Than pumping gas?
Service to others.

161
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,929
How we doing tonight?

162
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,335
Japanese style, huh?

163
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,682
So you know Socrates?

164
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,017
Is that what you call him?

165
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,562
I bet he loves that.

166
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,772
You eat here with him
every night?

167
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,108
Actually,
I think one's for you.

168
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,572
I see you've met Joy.

169
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,866
Hey, big Buddha.
Hi, little Buddha.

170
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,535
Joy, this is Dan.

171
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,037
We met.

172
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,081
Socrates.
Socrates.

173
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,084
Bon appétit.

174
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,052
You look hungry.

175
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,021
Joy do all that?

176
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,992
She live around here?

177
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,497
She related to you
or something?

178
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,416
You need to start asking
better questions.

179
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,096
What?

180
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,807
Slow down.
You might taste something.

181
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,689
You sure got a lot of rules
about stuff, don't you?

182
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,944
Not rules. Things I've learned
from my own life experience.

183
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,740
That's why I'd say
your eating is sloppy.

184
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,035
Who cares?
You do.

185
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,121
That's the difference
between us, Dan.

186
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,458
You practice gymnastics.
I practice everything.

187
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,254
If I was your trainer,
no meat.

188
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,674
Seriously?
None.

189
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,719
I could probably
handle that.

190
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,806
No TV, no alcohol,
no drugs and no sex.

191
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,059
And that's why I'm glad
you're not my trainer.

192
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,313
So, this diet and your training
are making you all you can be?

193
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,024
Absolutely.

194
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,820
So, how long
can you stand like this?

195
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,199
Name it.

196
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,702
Five minutes. On the table.
Done.

197
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,751
You move so much as a muscle,

198
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,337
and I get to call you Jack
for the rest of the night.

199
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,673
Jack?
Short for jackass.

200
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,181
What time is it?

201
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,936
What time is it?

202
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,318
What time

203
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,736
is

204
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,112
it?

205
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,076
What

206
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,828
time

207
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:32,870
is...

208
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,335
My son, Jack.

209
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,804
Thanks for stopping by.

210
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:55,017
Everyone tells you what to do
and what's good for you.

211
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,562
They don't want you
to find your own answers.

212
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,897
They want you
to believe theirs.

213
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,318
And let me guess.
You want me to believe yours.

214
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,820
No.

215
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,782
I want you to stop gathering
information from outside yourself

216
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,577
and start gathering it
from the inside.

217
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,789
What are you, part of
some cult or something?

218
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,792
People are afraid
of what's inside,

219
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,379
and that's the only place they're
ever gonna find what they need.

220
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,966
Why can't you sleep?

221
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:30,136
Is it because,
maybe, late at night,

222
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,472
when all the noise dies down and
you're lying there in the bed,

223
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:37,685
and there's nobody around but you,
then, maybe, you get a little scared?

224
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,941
Scared because suddenly
everything feels so

225
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,195
empty.

226
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:56,412
You tell me you want to be more than
just someone who gets up on those rings

227
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,665
and performs
a well-practiced stunt or two.

228
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,754
You tell me
you want to be someone

229
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,174
who uses his mind and his body

230
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,053
in ways that most people would
never have the courage to,

231
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,474
and I will train you, Dan,

232
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,102
to be a real warrior.

233
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,306
Is he all right?

234
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,187
What's going on?

235
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,523
Kyle. He took a bad fall.

236
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,441
It's fine. I'm fine.

237
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,405
It might be broken.
No.

238
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,990
We'll need an x-ray.
No.

239
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,367
It's all right, Kyle. It's
all right. It's all right.

240
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,244
I mean it, Coach.
I know.

241
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,453
It doesn't feel like a break.

242
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,247
They're just gonna have
a look at it, that's all.

243
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,124
I don't need it looked at.

244
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,211
And I said you did.

245
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,257
Let's go.

246
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,137
Put it in a sling.
I don't need a sling.

247
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,645
Rider down, man.
Bad break.

248
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,982
You don't know that.
It could be a sprain.

249
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:52,069
I mean, he's a casualty,
Tommy-boy. He's our best horse man.

250
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,281
Where do you think
that leaves us, huh?

251
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,657
Trevor, get off that thing.

252
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,534
Or what?
Like you don't want it?

253
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,786
Except you suck
at the pommel horse, Middleman.

254
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,623
I just never focused on it.

255
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,542
That's 'cause you got
one big show and only one.

256
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,085
Lord of the rings.

257
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,795
Yeah? Want to see
what I can do?

258
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,631
Don't embarrass yourself.
Go play, little boy.

259
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:15,009
Jesus Christ, did you both
just see them take Kyle away?

260
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,474
I mean, Jesus,
what if he's done?

261
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,937
Don't get in my face about it, all right?
Jesus, go hold his hand if you want to.

262
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,662
Sometimes,
I don't like myself very much.

263
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:49,335
My first thought was about how maybe
Kyle's fall could work out for me.

264
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,507
People are not their thoughts.

265
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,636
They think they are and it
brings them all kinds of sadness.

266
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,098
Toss me that wrench.

267
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,393
I'm not what I think?

268
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,437
Of course not.

269
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,153
The five-eighths.

270
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,711
The mind is just
a reflex organ.

271
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,255
It reacts to everything.

272
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:38,342
Fills your head with millions
of random thoughts a day.

273
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,928
None of those thoughts
reveal any more about you

274
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,891
than a freckle does
at the end of your nose.

275
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,733
Take a swing at me.
What?

276
00:28:58,446 --> 00:28:59,780
What are you doing?

277
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,909
Come on. 10 bucks if you
can slap me on the cheek.

278
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,081
Come on. Take a shot.

279
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,959
Knock it off, man.
I don't want to hit you.

280
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,711
You don't want to hit me?

281
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,676
I don't want to hurt you.

282
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,889
I guess I'll just have to
keep slapping you then.

283
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:38,486
Did you notice how the right
leverage can be very effective?

284
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,955
What if I were to tell you

285
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:54,001
that's what your training,
even your life, is about?

286
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,965
Developing the wisdom
to apply the right leverage

287
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,676
in the right place,
at the right time.

288
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,471
Take out the trash.
You take out the trash.

289
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,099
The trash is up here.

290
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,894
That's the first part
of your training,

291
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:15,314
learning to throw out everything
you don't need in here.

292
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,822
How?

293
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,951
Meet me tomorrow on campus.

294
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,871
Strawberry Creek bridge.

295
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:33,499
Where the hell are you going?
Poli-sci. Where are you going?

296
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,502
I'm going to pommel horse
try-outs.

297
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,587
I forgot.

298
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,339
Less than an hour.
Hey, hey! Wait up.

299
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:43,134
Tell them to hold up
for me, all right? What?

300
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,186
Soc!

301
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,731
Soc!

302
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:03,154
Listen.
I totally forgot about this.

303
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,072
Now, I got this thing
at the gym.

304
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,034
It's pretty important.
Can we make this quick?

305
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,203
Sure.

306
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,548
Hey!

307
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,972
Hey! I'm talking to you.

308
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:35,061
What the hell is wrong with you?
You said you were in a hurry.

309
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,396
So you pushed me off the
bridge? I emptied your mind.

310
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,773
You what?
I emptied...

311
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,192
No, you didn't.
You threw me into the river.

312
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,694
And while you were falling, tell
me, Dan, what were you thinking of?

313
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:44,821
I don't know!

314
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,280
Were you thinking about school? No!

315
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,573
Grocery shopping?
No!

316
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,992
This thing you had to
hurry off to? No! I was...

317
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,369
The present.

318
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:54,372
Devoted 100% to the experience
you were having.

319
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,082
You even had a word for it.

320
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:02,255
You're out of your mind.
You know that?

321
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,174
It's taken
a lifetime of practice.

322
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,642
We want you
out of your mind, too, Dan.

323
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:21,148
What is that you do?

324
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,484
Some kind of
martial arts move?

325
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:28,447
I didn't see it coming.
You weren't paying attention.

326
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:32,577
Even now you're not.
Your mind's filling up again.

327
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,580
You're missing out
on everything that's going on.

328
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,665
There's nothing going on.

329
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,550
There's never
nothing going on.

330
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,891
Take out the trash, Dan.

331
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:42,355
The trash is anything that is keeping
you from the only thing that matters,

332
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,690
this moment.

333
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,526
Here.

334
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,194
Now.

335
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,702
And when you truly are
in the here and now,

336
00:33:56,744 --> 00:34:01,249
you'll be amazed at what you can
do and how well you can do it.

337
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:10,174
Until we know more about Kyle,
we need the horse covered, so...

338
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,262
Anybody who wants
a shot at it, gets a shot.

339
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:18,891
Where's Millman?

340
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:18,659
All right,
next man up. Trev?

341
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,704
You know I'm superstitious,
Coach. I gotta go last.

342
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,122
I'll go.

343
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,880
All right.

344
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:19,405
Millman, where the hell
did that come from?

345
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:35,922
Soc!

346
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:39,926
Hot damn! I wish you could've
been there. You would've loved it!

347
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,428
I used your trick.

348
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:46,474
I used your mind trick and it worked.
It totally worked. I was awesome.

349
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:53,189
It's not a trick. Yeah, well,
whatever it is, I used it.

350
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,526
I took out the trash,
and I mean Trev?

351
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,945
Trev's the one guy
I'm always going up against.

352
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,989
You should have seen me.
I demolished the guy.

353
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:06,953
You know, I wasn't worried
about what did happen,

354
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,996
or what might happen,
what could happen.

355
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:12,875
I just got up there
and I cleared my mind.

356
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,588
And I was flawless.

357
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:24,929
Listen, I'm jumping in
with both feet. All right?

358
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:30,101
Whatever you tell me to do, I'm gonna do.
No beer, no meat, no girls, no problem.

359
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:33,604
How long did you stay
that way, clear and flawless?

360
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:38,025
"I demolished that guy.
You should have seen me. "

361
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,655
You're in the past.

362
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:46,159
Gloating.

363
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,245
You're not in the now, living.

364
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,499
You haven't learned anything.

365
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:59,922
Go home.
Training's over for tonight.

366
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,468
Wait a minute.

367
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:13,186
Wait a minute.

368
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:16,480
Go home, I said.

369
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,102
Hey, Dan.

370
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:41,626
Why do we have to be all the way up
here, where we could kill ourselves?

371
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,669
I was hoping
you could tell me.

372
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,047
God!

373
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,007
What do I keep trying for?

374
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:52,261
I'll never make this cut.

375
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:57,183
Dad was right.

376
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:00,853
I'm gonna make him right if
I don't find a way to do this.

377
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,358
Will I ever forgive myself
if I don't make this cut?

378
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,109
Where the hell is Millman?

379
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:10,196
Too good to show up
for practice, now, I guess.

380
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,658
I don't know how to handle these
kids. What do I say to them?

381
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:17,078
They're talking,
but their lips aren't moving.

382
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:21,791
I'm not their mother.
I'm their coach.

383
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:24,001
Coach thinks
I'm worthless.

384
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,128
I am worthless.

385
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,715
I'm a worthless piece of shit

386
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:32,260
and Millman's always
gonna be better than me.

387
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,262
Am I reading their minds?

388
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:38,057
Maybe you just never really
listened to them before.

389
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:41,853
I've only got four qualifiers
left. I've got to get new mats.

390
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,939
I can't stick this double double.
My line's not straight on the bar.

391
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:47,483
I'm such a worthless
piece of shit.

392
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:55,283
You gotta be doing this.
Otherwise I'm losing my mind.

393
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:59,745
Sometimes you have to lose your
mind before you come to your senses.

394
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:02,456
Millman!

395
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,919
It's about time you showed up.

396
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:09,964
Thanks for joining us.

397
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:55,468
Go home, I said.

398
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,989
What did you just do to me?

399
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:25,289
You have to be strong
if you're gonna do this, Dan.

400
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,125
What did you do?

401
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:32,088
Where I'm gonna take you, some
of the things I'm gonna show you,

402
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:35,716
you're gonna need strength.

403
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:39,512
And you're gonna need
to trust me.

404
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:51,357
So it's hot as hell,
and this penguin,

405
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,569
he's pushing his broken-down
car past the 31 flavors.

406
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:57,363
So, suddenly he's practically
burying his face in a large vanilla

407
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,157
when he sees
a service station.

408
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,034
So he goes over, the mechanic
opens up the hood and says,

409
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:05,163
"Looks to me
like you've blown a seal. "

410
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:09,250
The penguin wipes his mouth and says,
"Hey, screw you! It's ice cream. "

411
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:16,757
What's up, Tommy?
Hey, Trev.

412
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:20,845
Hey, what's up with
the rabbit chow, Middleman?

413
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:28,728
All right, I got another one.

414
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:32,773
A man, a duck and a big-breasted
nun walk into a bar, right?

415
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:35,318
So, this old guy
did this high jump.

416
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:40,490
Did this really high jump.

417
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:42,742
And?

418
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,413
I'm kind of doing
what he tells me

419
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:50,750
so I can find out
how he did it.

420
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,043
Wait a minute.

421
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:54,921
You're letting somebody
else coach you? No.

422
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:59,258
Well, what's he doing to you?
'Cause you look like crap.

423
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,676
I don't know.

424
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:05,973
I don't know
what he's doing to me.

425
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:16,234
You better get away from it,
Middleman.

426
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:20,738
We got qualifiers in four weeks and you're
looking like a worthless piece of shit.

427
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:36,254
Hey!

428
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,423
Joy, right?
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:42,927
I need to talk to you
about our mutual friend.

430
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:44,887
Socrates?

431
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:49,517
If he didn't tell you his
name, you won't get it from me.

432
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,061
Yeah, why didn't he tell me?

433
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,647
I mean, I don't know anything
about the guy.

434
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,109
I'm serious.

435
00:46:58,192 --> 00:47:01,779
All right? He's supposed to be making
me stronger, making my life better.

436
00:47:01,863 --> 00:47:03,489
It's just the opposite.

437
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:06,534
What's he doing?

438
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:09,287
What are you worried about?

439
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:12,665
I want to know
who I'm dealing with here.

440
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,738
Come on, come on.
Tight. Keep it tight, Danny!

441
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,449
No! No, you're shaking!
You're shaking!

442
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,578
What the hell
are you doing up there?

443
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:37,917
Yeah, I'm off today.

444
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,418
Oh. You're off, huh?

445
00:48:39,502 --> 00:48:41,838
Well, you've been off for
one hell of a streak, Millman.

446
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:45,216
First you're a dream on the horse and
now you can barely stand up straight.

447
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:46,384
Huh?

448
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:51,681
Next time you're tired, go take a
nap instead of coming to practice.

449
00:48:59,772 --> 00:49:01,774
Ike, your key?
Yep, all right.

450
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:13,286
Voyeur.

451
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,705
How we doing tonight?

452
00:49:15,788 --> 00:49:17,290
How am I doing?

453
00:49:18,082 --> 00:49:20,960
I'm tired, I'm hungry
and I'm horny.

454
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:22,712
How are you doing?

455
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,717
I need some answers tonight.

456
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,304
I need to know that this...

457
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:35,641
That this is all going somewhere,
and I need to know it right now.

458
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:39,854
I mean, what kind of a warrior trains
by sitting around scrubbing toilets?

459
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:42,899
When you become a warrior, you
learn to meditate in every action.

460
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:45,943
Scrubbing toilets?
Letting go of attachments.

461
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:48,321
Like your pride.

462
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:50,990
Giving up your addictions. Yeah,
name one thing I'm addicted to.

463
00:49:51,073 --> 00:49:54,535
Talking.
Especially interrupting.

464
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:57,121
Knowing everything,
when in fact you know nothing.

465
00:49:57,205 --> 00:50:00,708
You really think that this is going
to expand my awareness of anything?

466
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:04,003
My game is off! My coach
probably thinks that I'm on drugs,

467
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:05,630
and I'm thinking...

468
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:11,052
I just don't have any more
time for you right now.

469
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:14,514
All you have is right now,
Jack.

470
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:19,936
Did you just call me
a jackass again?

471
00:50:21,646 --> 00:50:24,816
'Cause, you know, I'm really starting
to wonder how someone with the life

472
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:28,194
that you've managed to put
together can teach me anything.

473
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:31,364
I mean, are you really happy?

474
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:35,493
Maybe you're just a case of someone
who, not having made much of themselves,

475
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:38,579
says that the world is lost and
all these things don't matter.

476
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:42,416
Be happy with less, right? Less
than what? Less than nothing?

477
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,878
I call you a jackass
when you act like a jackass.

478
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:48,965
Like now, Dan, when you're
letting your emotions control you.

479
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:51,884
This isn't emotion!
This is common sense!

480
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:57,265
You know what?
Let me tell you something,

481
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:59,559
whatever your name really is.

482
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:04,355
When I get what I want,
I'll be happy.

483
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:09,569
For real and forever and
anything else I say it'll be.

484
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,822
'Cause I will make it happen.

485
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:46,981
Three, two, one!

486
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:57,325
Drink! Drink! Drink!

487
00:51:58,326 --> 00:51:59,869
Danny, good.

488
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:02,038
That's it, Danny.

489
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:03,289
Steady.

490
00:52:04,832 --> 00:52:08,169
Good. All right, come on!
Bring it home!

491
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:19,472
That's what I remember about
you, Millman! You were good.

492
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:28,898
I needed this.

493
00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:31,067
Needed to escape.

494
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:35,696
Lucky me.
Yeah, and lucky me.

495
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,282
You guys
are in such great shape.

496
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:41,577
So if I wasn't
in such great shape,

497
00:52:42,495 --> 00:52:45,706
wasn't on the gymnastics team,
just had a regular body,

498
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,458
you wouldn't be into me?

499
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:50,503
If I didn't have this body,
would you be into me?

500
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:56,128
Hey, Middleman.

501
00:54:58,005 --> 00:54:59,549
I don't know what to say.

502
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:00,925
Hey.

503
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:03,928
Got the whole team here.

504
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:07,515
You ran a red light, man.
Can you believe that?

505
00:55:07,598 --> 00:55:09,183
You gotta get better, man,
'cause...

506
00:55:09,267 --> 00:55:10,393
You ran a red light.

507
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:12,186
...whose ass
am I gonna kick at practice?

508
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,605
Don't waste your energy.
Keep that mouth shut.

509
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:15,982
Dan?

510
00:55:58,566 --> 00:55:59,650
Dan?

511
00:56:11,621 --> 00:56:14,624
I hear your folks are waiting
down in the cafeteria.

512
00:56:14,707 --> 00:56:17,043
I don't want my folks.

513
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:19,462
I want to know
what's going on.

514
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:21,964
I'm gonna tell you, but
your parents will probably...

515
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:25,218
I don't need anyone
to hold my hand right now.

516
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,054
My leg is in a cast.
When does it come off?

517
00:56:28,137 --> 00:56:31,390
Your leg didn't just break,
Dan.

518
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:32,892
It shattered.

519
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:37,647
You fractured your femur
in 17 different pieces.

520
00:56:39,565 --> 00:56:43,569
We had to take bone from your hip and
pin it to your leg with a steel rod.

521
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:49,909
How long for it to come out?

522
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:53,913
It doesn't come out.

523
00:56:55,998 --> 00:56:58,417
Now, in a few months, you'll be
able to start the rehab process.

524
00:56:58,501 --> 00:57:00,837
You can talk to your
physical therapist,

525
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:04,006
and, with some hard work,

526
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,843
I'm sure you'll eventually
be able to walk again.

527
00:57:09,262 --> 00:57:12,682
Now, I know it might not
sound like it right now but,

528
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:16,269
given what happened,

529
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:20,690
that makes you
a very lucky young man.

530
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,977
Hey, Bob, come on!

531
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:36,599
Hey, stranger.

532
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:42,271
Hey.

533
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:47,610
I heard you got out of the
hospital. How you doing?

534
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,365
Okay.

535
00:58:58,287 --> 00:59:00,039
I thought about you.

536
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:05,461
Yeah?

537
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,301
Can I try something?

538
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:33,573
Warm hands.

539
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,163
Wow.

540
00:59:42,498 --> 00:59:43,916
Really warm.

541
00:59:46,919 --> 00:59:50,173
You ever hear of
the healing power of touch?

542
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:55,845
No.

543
00:59:58,347 --> 01:00:01,517
But, at this point, I could
be talked into anything.

544
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:05,938
I'm not coming on to you, Dan.

545
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:15,948
Shouldn't you be healing
my leg instead of my chest?

546
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:22,205
Maybe I don't think your

547
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:24,707
leg is the only thing
that got broken.

548
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:37,887
I know this is
a scary moment for you.

549
01:00:39,722 --> 01:00:41,974
Are you paying attention
to it?

550
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:47,897
How is the old man?

551
01:00:49,982 --> 01:00:51,818
Why don't you ask him?

552
01:00:56,322 --> 01:00:58,074
He ever ask about me?

553
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:03,246
That was bad.

554
01:01:03,996 --> 01:01:05,998
That was, like,
me sounding like...

555
01:01:05,998 --> 01:01:09,585
That was bad. That was you
sounding like you miss him.

556
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:19,262
You know, he came
to visit you in the hospital.

557
01:01:27,353 --> 01:01:29,188
I'll see you around.

558
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:23,743
Hey, Coach.

559
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:27,580
Millman?

560
01:02:30,082 --> 01:02:31,918
Good to see you, man.

561
01:02:33,669 --> 01:02:36,672
Looks like you're bulked up
in the shoulders a little.

562
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:40,259
That's pretty much all I can
do right now, presses and curls.

563
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:41,594
Yeah.

564
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:46,098
Hospital doesn't think so, but
I'm gonna be off this cane soon.

565
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:47,517
Then, I'm back.

566
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,602
You gotta listen to them.

567
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:51,604
I have this crazy thought.

568
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:55,191
I'm already gonna miss
the third round.

569
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:56,859
I can't fix that.

570
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:01,113
But that final qualifier?
Dan.

571
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:03,199
That's not till next fall.

572
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:07,119
That gives me eight months.

573
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,122
What are you gonna do
in eight months?

574
01:03:10,122 --> 01:03:12,124
I already petitioned
the Olympic Committee.

575
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:13,626
Dan, you have to be realistic.

576
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:15,962
What if I get back? Huh?

577
01:03:16,045 --> 01:03:18,714
What if I get back to where I was?
You wouldn't want me on the team?

578
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:21,133
Of course I would, Dan,
but look at yourself.

579
01:03:21,217 --> 01:03:25,555
For Christ's sake, you've got a piece
of metal holding your leg together!

580
01:03:26,138 --> 01:03:28,808
You can't give up on me.
I'm not giving up on you, Dan.

581
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:30,977
Then, please, just hear me out. Dan!

582
01:03:35,898 --> 01:03:39,068
The doctors have told me
there's just no question.

583
01:03:40,486 --> 01:03:43,406
You will never
compete again.

584
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,763
Christ, Millman, what the
hell is going on in there?

585
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:35,017
Come on, Danny, open the door,
man! Answer me!

586
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:36,435
Millman...

587
01:07:03,856 --> 01:07:05,525
What do you want?

588
01:07:27,129 --> 01:07:29,715
No one's stopping me,
so just stay away.

589
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:40,059
I didn't come here
to stop you.

590
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,894
You think I won't do it?

591
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:47,400
'Cause I'm not afraid
of anything.

592
01:07:48,484 --> 01:07:49,902
Not even this.

593
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:54,490
Or how about this?

594
01:07:58,411 --> 01:07:59,745
Or this?

595
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:06,919
Look at you.

596
01:08:09,922 --> 01:08:12,091
Hanging on for dear life.

597
01:08:14,093 --> 01:08:15,595
Afraid to fall.

598
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:21,767
Well, I say

599
01:08:22,768 --> 01:08:23,853
fall.

600
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:32,361
It's not like
you're giving up anything.

601
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:35,781
Nothing you haven't
already lost.

602
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:42,872
What are you holding onto,
anyway?

603
01:08:52,715 --> 01:08:54,467
It's you, isn't it?

604
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:59,388
You're the one
I have to let go of.

605
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,903
You know what you're doing?

606
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:17,490
No.

607
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:21,077
Do you know

608
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,829
who you are

609
01:09:23,412 --> 01:09:25,498
without me?

610
01:09:30,419 --> 01:09:31,420
No.

611
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:34,674
Then what

612
01:09:34,757 --> 01:09:35,758
are

613
01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:37,677
you doing?

614
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:06,349
Go.

615
01:11:15,024 --> 01:11:16,192
Again.

616
01:11:27,703 --> 01:11:29,872
I don't know what to do now.

617
01:11:30,915 --> 01:11:33,209
First realization
of a warrior.

618
01:11:34,585 --> 01:11:36,045
What is?

619
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:37,547
Not knowing.

620
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:53,563
What's happening to me?

621
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:57,900
I don't cry.

622
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:00,820
Apparently, you do.

623
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:05,867
It's embarrassing.

624
01:12:09,745 --> 01:12:11,497
Emotions are natural,

625
01:12:12,915 --> 01:12:14,917
like the passing weather.

626
01:12:18,004 --> 01:12:19,672
What do you do

627
01:12:21,674 --> 01:12:24,093
if you can't do
what you were born to?

628
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:27,805
Everything has
a purpose, Dan,

629
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:30,600
even this.

630
01:12:35,062 --> 01:12:37,273
And it's up to you
to find it.

631
01:12:50,703 --> 01:12:51,704
Go.

632
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,633
Your training can now move
to a new arena,

633
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:11,599
an arena where you
find your answers from within.

634
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:15,394
That old Plymouth.

635
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:19,565
Sit on it till you have
something of value to tell me.

636
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,738
That's it?

637
01:13:26,572 --> 01:13:30,409
I don't hear from you until you
have an insight worth sharing.

638
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:37,667
That's all?

639
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,842
How we doing tonight?

640
01:13:56,769 --> 01:13:57,937
Okay.

641
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:00,273
Okay.

642
01:14:00,356 --> 01:14:03,776
Anger, hatred, violence,
they're really all just fear.

643
01:14:04,777 --> 01:14:08,364
Fear, then, not money,
is the root of all evil.

644
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:22,545
Chaos Theory is correct except that
chaos is actually not chaotic at all

645
01:14:22,628 --> 01:14:24,797
but perfectly controlled.

646
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:28,968
If you lend somebody $20 and never see
that person again, it was probably worth it.

647
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:31,929
When making a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich,

648
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:34,390
you must first apply the
peanut butter, not the jelly,

649
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,559
to the bottom half
of the bread.

650
01:14:44,233 --> 01:14:49,155
The people that are the hardest to love
are usually the ones who need it the most.

651
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:53,576
Hmm?

652
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:31,424
There you are.
Thank you very much.

653
01:16:36,512 --> 01:16:38,848
There's never
nothing going on.

654
01:16:46,898 --> 01:16:49,108
There are no ordinary moments.

655
01:16:59,202 --> 01:17:00,620
Yeah.

656
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:07,376
Welcome back.

657
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:19,305
You gotta be kidding me.

658
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:25,311
This isn't another vision,
is it?

659
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:28,397
'Cause I don't see
how this could be happening.

660
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:33,820
What the hell are you doing?

661
01:17:52,129 --> 01:17:53,756
Something wrong?

662
01:17:54,924 --> 01:17:58,511
We don't do this anymore,
remember? We know better.

663
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:02,682
We're better than everyone
who doesn't know what we know

664
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:05,059
or live the way we do?

665
01:18:05,101 --> 01:18:07,186
Is that what you mean?

666
01:18:07,228 --> 01:18:08,938
Not better, maybe.

667
01:18:10,356 --> 01:18:11,607
Smarter.

668
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:14,485
There is no "better. "

669
01:18:19,031 --> 01:18:21,033
You will never be better.

670
01:18:21,868 --> 01:18:25,413
Same way you'll never be less
than anybody else.

671
01:18:31,711 --> 01:18:33,713
The habit is the problem.

672
01:18:35,047 --> 01:18:38,384
All you need to do is be
conscious about your choices

673
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:40,803
and responsible
for your actions.

674
01:18:43,055 --> 01:18:47,477
Is that why, out of all the people
you could have taught, you chose me?

675
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,729
You done flattering yourself?

676
01:18:54,317 --> 01:18:55,818
You chose me.

677
01:18:59,322 --> 01:19:01,324
Why should I believe you?

678
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:05,578
You taught me yourself to only
listen to my own intuition.

679
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:08,581
How do you know that I'm not
your own intuition

680
01:19:08,706 --> 01:19:10,750
speaking to you right now?

681
01:19:15,254 --> 01:19:17,423
You mean maybe
I made you up?

682
01:19:25,932 --> 01:19:28,059
Don't mess with me like that.

683
01:19:36,859 --> 01:19:41,113
Every what has its what? Every
action has its price and its pleasure.

684
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:43,950
Recognizing both sides,
a warrior becomes...

685
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:46,536
...realistic and responsible
for his actions.

686
01:19:48,704 --> 01:19:50,790
Boy sounds bad
over there, man.

687
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:55,378
You gotta be kidding me.

688
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:57,380
Money, boys.

689
01:19:58,214 --> 01:20:01,134
Picked the wrong guy
to pull this shit on, boys.

690
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:07,098
Little leverage, at the right
time, at the right place?

691
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,769
Yours.

692
01:20:13,354 --> 01:20:16,149
We can ramp this up
a little, tough guy.

693
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:23,739
Thank you and good night.

694
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:28,244
Didn't you forget our watches?

695
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:40,173
This is where
you give it to them, right?

696
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,844
Now, maybe I should have said
Dan's watch. I don't wear one.

697
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:48,681
Give it.

698
01:20:54,854 --> 01:20:56,355
Thanks, old man.

699
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:59,233
What are you, a medium jacket?

700
01:21:01,319 --> 01:21:02,778
Is he a what?

701
01:21:08,576 --> 01:21:10,453
I'm not taking your jacket.

702
01:21:10,536 --> 01:21:13,789
It's a good jacket.
Nice warm lining.

703
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:15,291
I'll take it.

704
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:18,377
It's a good jacket.

705
01:21:21,881 --> 01:21:24,717
You. You're about Dan's size.

706
01:21:38,481 --> 01:21:41,734
What size shoe do you
wear, Dan? Are you kidding?

707
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:45,905
Christ, Soc, how far
are we gonna take this?

708
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:49,784
They could have
killed us!

709
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:51,661
They could have killed us!

710
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:55,748
You could have kicked every
single one of those guys' asses.

711
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,501
Instead, we're probably gonna get
picked up for indecent exposure.

712
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:02,255
You think that's funny? Do
you? You think that's funny?

713
01:22:02,296 --> 01:22:05,174
You could have laid out every
single one of those guys.

714
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:07,552
Tell me. Tell me what the
hell you were thinking.

715
01:22:07,593 --> 01:22:11,514
That the ones that are hardest to love
are the ones that need it the most.

716
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:14,267
That knowledge
is not the same as wisdom.

717
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:17,103
Wisdom is doing.
They could have killed us.

718
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:20,189
It's a transformation.

719
01:22:21,774 --> 01:22:24,193
Death?
Yes.

720
01:22:24,235 --> 01:22:29,699
It's a little bit more radical than puberty
but nothing to get particularly upset about.

721
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:34,078
What the hell
are you talking about?

722
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:37,039
Death isn't sad.

723
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,293
The sad thing is

724
01:22:41,377 --> 01:22:43,629
most people don't live at all.

725
01:22:52,221 --> 01:22:54,223
Is that a double double?

726
01:22:57,602 --> 01:23:00,188
No, that was a full twisting
double layout.

727
01:23:00,313 --> 01:23:02,773
I need to make it
a double double.

728
01:23:02,815 --> 01:23:04,233
Look at you.

729
01:23:05,568 --> 01:23:08,237
First day without
the training wheels.

730
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:10,114
No cane, no crutches.

731
01:23:16,662 --> 01:23:18,956
Listen, I just came here
to say,

732
01:23:22,168 --> 01:23:25,004
I haven't always been
a very good friend.

733
01:23:28,007 --> 01:23:32,345
In fact, I can't remember the last
time I was somebody's good friend.

734
01:23:37,683 --> 01:23:39,602
Hey, it gets crazy,
you know?

735
01:23:40,853 --> 01:23:45,191
I mean, what are you gonna do when we're
always competing against each other?

736
01:23:47,652 --> 01:23:50,696
Anyway, what I really
came here to say was...

737
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:52,615
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

738
01:23:52,698 --> 01:23:56,035
Trev, is Middleman apologizing?

739
01:23:57,203 --> 01:23:58,704
I think he is.

740
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:04,627
Oh, God. Oh, God. He's
going down. Oh, my God.

741
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,796
He's going down!
He's going down!

742
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:10,299
Medic!
Get the paddles! Clear!

743
01:24:11,092 --> 01:24:12,552
Clear!

744
01:24:12,552 --> 01:24:15,638
Oh, God, take me instead!

745
01:24:15,888 --> 01:24:17,348
Oh, no!

746
01:24:17,473 --> 01:24:19,934
Took for granted
what I could do.

747
01:24:19,976 --> 01:24:22,019
I was sloppy with my life.

748
01:24:23,896 --> 01:24:25,398
I'm scared, but

749
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:29,986
I feel like I got rid of
all the old stuff, and...

750
01:24:31,946 --> 01:24:34,031
I think it was
the right thing to do.

751
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:35,908
When you feel fear,

752
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,373
use the sword.

753
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:47,587
Take it up here
and cut the mind to ribbons.

754
01:24:47,628 --> 01:24:50,339
Slash through
all those regrets and fears

755
01:24:50,423 --> 01:24:53,843
and anything else that lives
in the past or the future.

756
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:56,179
I want to be able
to do that.

757
01:24:56,971 --> 01:24:59,182
I think I'm ready.

758
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:00,766
Ready for what?

759
01:25:01,934 --> 01:25:04,687
Devoting my life
to a higher purpose.

760
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,189
Really?

761
01:25:06,772 --> 01:25:08,691
Service to others, right?

762
01:25:11,944 --> 01:25:15,114
That's gonna be me, now. I'll
do whatever you think I should.

763
01:25:15,114 --> 01:25:16,824
All right.
All right.

764
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:20,119
I think you should continue
your training as a gymnast.

765
01:25:35,218 --> 01:25:38,387
A warrior does not give up
what he loves, Dan.

766
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:43,351
He finds the love
in what he does.

767
01:25:43,392 --> 01:25:44,811
Look at me!

768
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:47,814
Look at me.

769
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:53,653
I have a metal rod in my leg.

770
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,405
A warrior
is not about perfection

771
01:25:56,447 --> 01:25:58,324
or victory

772
01:25:58,449 --> 01:26:00,159
or invulnerability.

773
01:26:01,494 --> 01:26:03,913
He's about
absolute vulnerability.

774
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:07,333
That's the only
true courage.

775
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:10,586
What kind of training you think I
could do? Huh? I just had an accident.

776
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:14,006
The accident is your training.
Life is choice.

777
01:26:14,006 --> 01:26:17,009
You can choose to be a victim or
anything else you'd like to be.

778
01:26:17,009 --> 01:26:20,680
Just ignore what happened to me?
A warrior acts. Only a fool reacts.

779
01:26:20,763 --> 01:26:23,850
What if I can't do it? That's
the future. Throw it out.

780
01:26:23,933 --> 01:26:27,687
Well, how would we start? There
is no starting or stopping,

781
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:29,188
only doing.

782
01:26:33,693 --> 01:26:35,945
I want to show you something.

783
01:26:51,544 --> 01:26:53,880
When did you do all this?

784
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:56,549
When you were lying
in that hospital.

785
01:26:59,218 --> 01:27:00,803
While I was what?

786
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:10,730
Now we can really
go to work.

787
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:02,819
I don't believe you for
a minute. Seriously, man!

788
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:06,155
You talking about that redhead? Not
the redhead, man, your redheaded girl.

789
01:30:06,197 --> 01:30:07,406
How is she my redheaded girl?

790
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,575
You were on her all night,
bro. I handed her off to you.

791
01:30:09,659 --> 01:30:11,744
Which redhead
are we talking about?

792
01:30:15,331 --> 01:30:17,083
Make this a threesome?

793
01:30:21,337 --> 01:30:23,881
You're really not my type,
Middleman.

794
01:30:35,101 --> 01:30:39,939
What would you guys say if I told you I
was ready to get up on those rings again?

795
01:30:44,527 --> 01:30:47,196
I'd say you hit your head
and not your leg.

796
01:31:01,627 --> 01:31:02,962
Hey, Coach.

797
01:31:14,974 --> 01:31:16,392
That yours?

798
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:21,314
Wait here.

799
01:31:37,747 --> 01:31:39,749
You boys give us the room
for a minute.

800
01:31:39,832 --> 01:31:42,668
What? Why?
What's going on?

801
01:31:44,337 --> 01:31:45,922
It's okay. Hey.

802
01:31:48,174 --> 01:31:51,010
I've had this in my office
for a few days now.

803
01:31:52,678 --> 01:31:55,515
I just didn't think I'd ever
need to give it to you.

804
01:31:56,182 --> 01:31:58,351
The Olympic Committee voted

805
01:31:58,434 --> 01:32:02,855
on your request for a special
dispensation to compete in the qualifiers.

806
01:32:05,358 --> 01:32:06,692
I'm sorry.

807
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,117
You petitioned
the Olympic Committee?

808
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:17,036
They talked to your doctors,

809
01:32:18,287 --> 01:32:23,042
who feel there's no evidence to indicate
that you're strong enough to compete.

810
01:32:27,463 --> 01:32:29,549
Is that what it says, Dan-o?

811
01:32:31,217 --> 01:32:32,301
No.

812
01:32:35,805 --> 01:32:38,224
It says that you could
turn that decision around

813
01:32:38,224 --> 01:32:40,810
if you saw any evidence
to the contrary.

814
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:44,063
And I said I'm sorry.

815
01:32:44,147 --> 01:32:49,068
You watch me and you tell me
you don't see any evidence.

816
01:32:49,068 --> 01:32:52,488
I don't want to see a man who
was in a cast 10 months ago

817
01:32:52,572 --> 01:32:53,906
trying to do triple flips.

818
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:56,409
Watch me.
Then you tell me that.

819
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:59,745
The doctor said that you could spend
the rest of your life in a wheelchair.

820
01:32:59,745 --> 01:33:01,747
You think I care about that?

821
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:05,418
No, Dan,
'cause I've seen your ego

822
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:08,838
nearly kill you up on
those rings about 100 times

823
01:33:08,921 --> 01:33:12,425
and I am not ready
to see that happen for real.

824
01:33:17,346 --> 01:33:20,683
I've already said that
to the committee,

825
01:33:20,766 --> 01:33:22,935
and they have closed the case.

826
01:33:29,108 --> 01:33:30,776
You gave up on me.

827
01:33:37,533 --> 01:33:39,035
Danny, come on.

828
01:33:42,288 --> 01:33:43,956
You gave up on me.

829
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:48,377
Dan.

830
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:11,567
Nearly all of humanity
shares your predicament, Dan.

831
01:34:12,985 --> 01:34:15,822
If you don't get
what you want, you suffer.

832
01:34:18,157 --> 01:34:21,494
And even when you get
exactly what you want,

833
01:34:21,577 --> 01:34:23,579
you still suffer

834
01:34:23,663 --> 01:34:26,249
because you can't
hold onto it forever.

835
01:34:26,999 --> 01:34:28,835
He thought I couldn't do it.

836
01:34:28,918 --> 01:34:30,419
Doesn't matter.

837
01:34:30,503 --> 01:34:33,089
He doesn't know
that I'll be there 100%.

838
01:34:33,172 --> 01:34:37,009
You don't need him or any letter to get
up on those rings and do what you love.

839
01:34:37,093 --> 01:34:39,679
Yes, I do. All right?

840
01:34:39,762 --> 01:34:42,014
I'm talking about getting up there
and winning the gold right now,

841
01:34:42,098 --> 01:34:43,266
so, yes, I do.

842
01:34:43,349 --> 01:34:45,184
The gold is a craving.

843
01:34:45,268 --> 01:34:47,937
"If only I had it, I'd be happy.
" Can't you hear it in there?

844
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:52,191
It's a dream, Soc. All right? I
can't think that dreams are bad.

845
01:34:52,191 --> 01:34:54,944
You don't surrender
your dreams, Dan.

846
01:34:56,028 --> 01:34:59,782
You surrender the one thing you
never have and you never will,

847
01:34:59,866 --> 01:35:01,033
control.

848
01:35:02,118 --> 01:35:05,121
Accept that you don't control
what will happen to you.

849
01:35:05,872 --> 01:35:10,042
That you may or you may not
compete in the Olympics.

850
01:35:10,793 --> 01:35:13,045
That you may
or you may not, Dan.

851
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:18,134
And that you are something
exceptional either way.

852
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:22,638
I was ready
to give this all up,

853
01:35:22,722 --> 01:35:24,807
but you stood here

854
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:27,477
and you told me that you
wanted me to train again!

855
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,395
I told you a warrior
does what he loves.

856
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:32,315
And this is what I love!

857
01:35:32,398 --> 01:35:34,484
Chasing gold?

858
01:35:34,567 --> 01:35:37,737
Living in fear
that you might fail?

859
01:35:38,988 --> 01:35:40,072
That's what you love
about it?

860
01:35:40,156 --> 01:35:44,243
No! Dreaming of standing up
there and winning this thing!

861
01:35:44,327 --> 01:35:48,748
Of doing what has always felt like
the thing that I was put here to do.

862
01:35:48,831 --> 01:35:53,252
I've been on a trampoline since before
I could ride a bike because I loved it.

863
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:57,256
'Cause it was the first thing

864
01:36:00,092 --> 01:36:03,346
that I was sure that I loved.

865
01:36:12,271 --> 01:36:13,606
I'm sorry.

866
01:36:15,775 --> 01:36:17,360
Okay? I'm sorry.

867
01:36:19,946 --> 01:36:23,366
I thought I was strong
but I'm not.

868
01:36:26,786 --> 01:36:29,956
'Cause I really tried
to give this whole thing up

869
01:36:34,877 --> 01:36:36,295
but I can't.

870
01:37:32,602 --> 01:37:36,272
Tomorrow morning,
bring your hiking shoes.

871
01:37:39,692 --> 01:37:45,281
I've got a place I've wanted to take you
since the first night you walked in here.

872
01:37:48,367 --> 01:37:50,870
It's a long hike
but I think...

873
01:37:52,872 --> 01:37:56,709
I think you're finally
ready to see it.

874
01:38:15,394 --> 01:38:16,979
Three?
Three.

875
01:38:19,398 --> 01:38:21,567
Life has just three rules?

876
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:23,653
And you already know them.

877
01:38:24,821 --> 01:38:27,657
Paradox,

878
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:28,991
humor and change.

879
01:38:29,742 --> 01:38:31,577
Paradox.

880
01:38:31,661 --> 01:38:35,498
Life is a mystery. Don't waste
time trying to figure it out.

881
01:38:36,749 --> 01:38:38,251
Humor.

882
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:41,921
Keep a sense of humor,
especially about yourself.

883
01:38:42,004 --> 01:38:43,589
It is a strength
beyond all measure.

884
01:38:43,673 --> 01:38:44,841
Change.

885
01:38:52,932 --> 01:38:55,268
Know that nothing
stays the same.

886
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:05,027
Hey, please tell me
we're getting a little closer.

887
01:39:11,284 --> 01:39:14,370
Come on, Soc,
it's been three hours, man.

888
01:39:14,453 --> 01:39:16,038
Now, we're here.

889
01:39:21,627 --> 01:39:24,464
We're where?
At what I came to show you.

890
01:39:30,887 --> 01:39:32,472
What, the view?

891
01:39:32,555 --> 01:39:34,557
There, next to your foot.

892
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:42,732
The flower?
No.

893
01:39:42,815 --> 01:39:44,901
Better not be.
The rock.

894
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:51,657
There's something...

895
01:39:51,741 --> 01:39:54,243
There's something special
about this rock?

896
01:39:54,327 --> 01:39:55,411
Something wrong?

897
01:39:55,495 --> 01:39:58,498
Come on, Soc! This is what
I was finally ready to see?

898
01:39:58,581 --> 01:40:01,167
Well, the whole trip up here,
you were excited, you were happy.

899
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:02,835
Yeah, because I thought
I was gonna see something!

900
01:40:02,919 --> 01:40:06,172
You were like a kid on Christmas
morning. You said so yourself.

901
01:40:06,255 --> 01:40:08,174
The whole trip up here,
it made you feel good.

902
01:40:08,257 --> 01:40:11,594
Because for the past three hours I've
been waiting to see this wonderful thing.

903
01:40:11,677 --> 01:40:15,431
Well, what changed? That there's
nothing here but this rock!

904
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,103
I probably should have told
you that before we left, huh?

905
01:40:22,104 --> 01:40:23,606
But I guess

906
01:40:26,192 --> 01:40:28,694
I wasn't sure
what we'd find, either.

907
01:40:30,696 --> 01:40:32,198
Never am.

908
01:40:38,788 --> 01:40:41,040
Sorry you're not
happy anymore.

909
01:40:55,138 --> 01:40:56,556
The journey.

910
01:41:05,398 --> 01:41:07,900
The journey's
what brings us happiness

911
01:41:09,485 --> 01:41:11,237
not the destination.

912
01:41:36,345 --> 01:41:37,680
Millman.

913
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,602
Millman, what are you doing?

914
01:41:46,939 --> 01:41:49,692
Millman, get your hands
out of the chalk.

915
01:42:57,677 --> 01:42:58,761
Hey.

916
01:43:00,513 --> 01:43:01,514
Hey.

917
01:43:03,182 --> 01:43:05,017
Ready for the big day?

918
01:43:05,101 --> 01:43:07,270
Yeah. I leave tonight.

919
01:43:13,526 --> 01:43:15,111
Where you headed?

920
01:43:18,197 --> 01:43:20,199
Just out running.

921
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:21,534
With a book?

922
01:43:23,536 --> 01:43:27,290
Actually, I think
I want to kiss you.

923
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:35,965
Anything to say?

924
01:43:38,718 --> 01:43:40,470
Good luck tomorrow.

925
01:43:41,554 --> 01:43:44,474
You know, I see us together,
you and me.

926
01:43:45,725 --> 01:43:47,810
I dream stuff all the time!

927
01:43:49,061 --> 01:43:51,063
Sometimes it comes true!

928
01:43:56,068 --> 01:43:58,237
Hey, I'm just telling you!

929
01:43:58,321 --> 01:44:00,740
I really think
it might happen!

930
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:02,575
Then maybe it will!

931
01:44:35,107 --> 01:44:37,109
This your place, Millman?

932
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:55,378
Who are you?

933
01:44:55,461 --> 01:44:58,214
Where's the other guy
who works here?

934
01:44:58,464 --> 01:45:00,133
I just started today.

935
01:45:02,802 --> 01:45:05,638
You want gas,
you gotta pump it yourself.

936
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:08,224
Hey.

937
01:45:11,978 --> 01:45:13,312
Hey, man.

938
01:45:25,324 --> 01:45:26,409
Hello!

939
01:45:51,517 --> 01:45:54,520
Where's your secret weapon?
I don't know.

940
01:45:56,272 --> 01:45:59,942
What do you mean? He stood you
up? We moving on, here, Millman?

941
01:46:09,202 --> 01:46:12,038
He ever tell you
how he got up on that roof?

942
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:16,959
It doesn't matter.

943
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:49,575
A very strong 9.3
for young David Bloodgood,

944
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:52,995
ranking him in the top seven athletes
we've seen competing here today.

945
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:55,081
The competition
is fierce this year.

946
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:58,251
I can't remember a time when
the bar has been raised so high.

947
01:46:58,334 --> 01:46:59,669
And for good reason, Bart.

948
01:46:59,752 --> 01:47:01,337
For those of you
just joining our broadcast,

949
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:05,508
these trials today will decide the
six young men from all over the country

950
01:47:05,591 --> 01:47:09,762
who will be representing the United
States at this year's Olympics.

951
01:47:13,766 --> 01:47:17,687
All right, Millman. Just the
routine you showed me. Right?

952
01:47:19,772 --> 01:47:23,359
No triple flips,
no showboating.

953
01:47:24,527 --> 01:47:26,779
Just get up there and be you.

954
01:47:31,284 --> 01:47:35,037
Coming up next, the top
qualifiers from UC Berkeley.

955
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:38,624
Hey.

956
01:47:41,961 --> 01:47:44,380
How you doing?
You together?

957
01:47:48,217 --> 01:47:50,803
You did something that none of us
can completely wrap our heads around.

958
01:47:50,887 --> 01:47:52,555
You know that, right?

959
01:47:55,141 --> 01:47:57,810
I mean, it's like a miracle
or something, Dan-o.

960
01:48:01,314 --> 01:48:03,733
Whatever you learned, man,

961
01:48:03,816 --> 01:48:06,152
whatever that guy
taught you...

962
01:48:08,821 --> 01:48:10,239
You think...

963
01:48:13,242 --> 01:48:16,579
You think maybe you can rub a
little of that magic onto me?

964
01:48:19,665 --> 01:48:21,501
It's not magic, Tommy.

965
01:48:23,336 --> 01:48:27,006
Just getting rid of all that
bullshit you have up in your head,

966
01:48:27,089 --> 01:48:29,509
tells you
you might not be enough.

967
01:48:32,929 --> 01:48:34,931
So when you get up there,

968
01:48:37,266 --> 01:48:39,769
you make every move
about the move.

969
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:43,689
All right?
Not about the gold.

970
01:48:43,773 --> 01:48:46,609
Not about what your dad
thinks about you.

971
01:48:46,692 --> 01:48:48,444
Not about anything

972
01:48:50,613 --> 01:48:52,782
but that one moment in time.

973
01:48:56,202 --> 01:48:58,287
But this is for the gold.

974
01:49:01,707 --> 01:49:03,876
Everything we do, Dan-o.

975
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,128
I mean, at least for me,

976
01:49:05,211 --> 01:49:09,549
my whole life is about getting those
20 seconds in front of those judges

977
01:49:09,632 --> 01:49:11,884
so they can
give me that gold.

978
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:18,558
You wanna know what my dad would
think of me if that happened?

979
01:49:19,642 --> 01:49:22,812
You want to know how
my whole life would change?

980
01:49:22,895 --> 01:49:26,983
How everything that's a problem
right now wouldn't matter anymore?

981
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,902
I'd get everything I want.

982
01:49:33,906 --> 01:49:35,658
I'd get to be happy.

983
01:49:38,661 --> 01:49:40,746
I'd get to be happy, Dan-o.

984
01:49:45,251 --> 01:49:47,920
Next up,
ladies and gentlemen,

985
01:49:48,004 --> 01:49:52,592
from UC Berkeley, Dan Millman.

986
01:49:52,675 --> 01:49:56,345
Now, Dan is quite the wild card, Bart,
because less than 10 short months ago,

987
01:49:56,429 --> 01:50:00,600
this young man actually shattered
his leg in a motorcycle accident.

988
01:53:02,949 --> 01:53:04,700
Where are you, Dan?

989
01:53:06,536 --> 01:53:07,954
Here.

990
01:53:07,954 --> 01:53:10,289
What time is it?

991
01:53:10,373 --> 01:53:12,375
Now.

992
01:53:12,458 --> 01:53:14,043
What are you?

993
01:53:15,795 --> 01:53:17,213
This moment.
