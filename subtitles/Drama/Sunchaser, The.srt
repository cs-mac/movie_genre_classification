1
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,648
Fuck you, marshal.

2
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:27,289
I hate you.

3
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:35,445
Watch out for this one. He's a ding.

4
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:38,709
Six counts, first degree murder,
armed robbery and assault.

5
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:39,858
Fuck you.

6
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:42,166
Okay, on your knees, Monroe.

7
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:44,341
Okay.

8
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:49,526
Say sir when you speak to me.

9
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,797
Okay, sir.

10
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,428
- You got a problem?
- I got no problems with nothing, sir.

11
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:06,776
- What's this?
- A nuclear device.

12
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,805
Hi, Mr. Vogel. I'm Dr. Reynolds.

13
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,838
How are you feeling today?

14
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,677
Not so good today.

15
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:51,353
The Cytoxan's making you nauseous?

16
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:55,641
I just don't feel so good.

17
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,073
I see.

18
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,650
I'd like to talk to you
about your latest CAT scans.

19
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:10,965
Would you excuse me for one moment?

20
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,141
That's a nice watch.

21
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,544
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

22
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,401
Michael, we're gonna lose the house.

23
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,435
This is our last chance to close.
Elaine says our bid is too low.

24
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,810
She thinks our bid is too low?

25
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:32,762
- How can it be too low?
- Because Elaine...

26
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:36,058
Died last Thursday. And they still
had him down for an MRI today.

27
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:39,637
Who does she think she is, Ivana Trump?
She's a goddamned real estate agent.

28
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:41,693
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

29
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,381
Michael, Michael, Michael.

30
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,332
Hey, can you eavesdrop
on somebody else's life?

31
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,987
- Thank you.
- Elaine says we should offer 2 million.

32
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,059
Two million
is more than the house is worth.

33
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,572
Please, honey. Please, please?

34
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,109
No. No, absolutely not.

35
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,953
Victoria, we have gone over this
and over this.

36
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:00,828
- Do you realize who built this house?
- I know it once belonged to Hal Roach.

37
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,200
But the pool alone...

38
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,675
I know it's got a great pool.

39
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,872
- Do you realize who swam in it?
- I know Spanky swam in it. I know.

40
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,413
- It's just too goddamn much money.
- If you don't want this, you don't love me.

41
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,557
- I have to go, okay?
- It's as simple as that.

42
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:15,930
Yeah, thank you.

43
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:22,618
Sorry, it's been a madhouse today.

44
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,757
We're short on staff.

45
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:29,180
I think we're gonna have to consider
trying a different drug.

46
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,460
Your radiation field is
here and right here.

47
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:37,171
Yeah, and what, ignore the spread
to the retroperitoneum?

48
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:39,928
It¡s a spread
to the periaortic lymph nodes.

49
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:42,680
Axial views, right?
There's your tumor mass.

50
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:46,295
There's your metastasis to the liver.
There's your lymph node.

51
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:49,015
School of Dentistry
is across the street, fellas.

52
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,768
Knee bone connected to the shin bone.

53
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,047
Neoplasm in my opinion...

54
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:55,801
Hey, Mighty Mike. Buy the house?

55
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,211
I don't wanna talk about it.

56
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,611
Victoria's dream house.
I thought you were closing.

57
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:00,822
Give it to Dr. Reynolds.

58
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,966
Okay, are we still on for tonight?

59
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,793
Dr. Reynolds, I have a new case file.

60
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,163
Granita, 7:00?

61
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,880
- Patient should be in Pediatrics.
- Pediatrics sent him up.

62
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,453
Can't handle him. Too dangerous.

63
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,916
- What the hell does that mean?
- He's a killer.

64
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,251
Pediatrics can just dump their overload
on us?

65
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,008
Tell them to cut down on tennis...

66
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:20,663
... maybe they have more time
to practice medicine.

67
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:21,813
Send him back down.

68
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:25,463
If Pediatrics determines they're dangerous,
we have to handle them up here.

69
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:29,111
- Subhuman piece of shit.
- Honestly, Dr. Byrnes.

70
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,804
They bus him in
twice a month from jail. Bam!

71
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:35,415
The last deputy that brought him here
had to have plastic surgery on his face.

72
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,413
If I were you, I'd develop a sudden pain in
the chest and leave his chart for Newman.

73
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,485
Because I don't think he'd hit a woman.
But then, you never know.

74
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:45,972
Page Dr. Newman.
I think I'm getting chest pain.

75
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,825
Page Dr. Newman.

76
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,577
Dr. Newman is in Surgery.

77
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,020
You got to handle this. Here.

78
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,599
Hey, I gotta go
to the Tumor Board Conference.

79
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:16,543
Hi, I'm Dr. Reynolds.

80
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,426
Smoking. Very good.

81
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:30,111
You know, this wing
would never have been built...

82
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,105
...without the support
of cigarette smokers like yourself.

83
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:39,509
So on behalf of all of us here,
I thank you.

84
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:44,727
Funny thing, though,
it's a no-smoking facility.

85
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,532
Should I call Reggie White out there...

86
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,598
...to get him to come in here
and help you put it out?

87
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:03,351
Thank you.

88
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,002
You're due
for a radiation treatment today.

89
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:16,187
But before I can put my John Hancock
on this form, I have to fill it out.

90
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,175
Which means I have to examine you.

91
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:22,526
So I'll need you to take your top off.

92
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,161
Why don't you take it off?

93
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:39,070
Why don't we start over?

94
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,954
Hi.

95
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,614
I'm Dr. Reynolds.

96
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,470
You're looking at me like I'm an animal
or something...

97
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,975
...you tight-ass,
suit-wearing motherfucker...

98
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:05,788
...rolling your fresh wheels,
stacking your loot.

99
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:09,084
You do as much damage as anyone.
You just hide your shit better, right?

100
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,485
You think you're so down?
So bigtime cool?

101
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:14,877
No, that's lawyers. I'm a doctor.

102
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:19,514
I'm not going in that oven again.
I'm not some fucking hot dog.

103
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,128
Okay, that's fair enough.
I'll make you a deal.

104
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,988
Let me examine you...

105
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:27,608
...we'll just take a CAT scan
and finish off the chemo.

106
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,232
You're a motherfucking liar.

107
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,596
Could be.

108
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,649
Nice touch.

109
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:57,814
What are these from?

110
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,601
Bullets.

111
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,720
Breathe deeply.

112
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:11,991
Again.

113
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,522
Didn't you see them coming?

114
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:22,431
Yeah. Yeah, I seen them coming.

115
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:26,750
The bullets come out the guns
and hit me in the chest.

116
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:31,232
Wasn't there some warning?

117
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:37,790
If you're gonna shoot somebody,
why warn them?

118
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,700
It was a get-back thing.

119
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,327
Cough.

120
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,596
That's enough.

121
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,016
This has cheese.

122
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:11,584
Yeah, you ordered goat cheese.

123
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:14,015
Yeah, I ordered goat cheese.
I didn't order mozzarella.

124
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:15,323
Michael, can you...?

125
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,661
No, it's okay.
I'll make you a fresh one.

126
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:20,892
Michael is not talking about the house.

127
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:24,376
Apparently,
2 million is too low a bid for the Palisades.

128
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:27,841
So? Bid higher. Just bid higher.

129
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:30,588
Pretty soon
you're not gonna be worrying about money.

130
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:32,542
Tell him that.

131
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:36,089
The director of oncology
has been vacant for two months.

132
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,975
Why do you think
they haven't even recruited outside?

133
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:42,367
Because Bradfords got you tapped for it,
buddy boy.

134
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,221
He's got Newman tapped for it.

135
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:47,702
Oh, come on, Newman
is a lightweight. Ann Arbor.

136
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,808
There is no such thing
as a modest surgeon, is there?

137
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:54,426
Oh, Michael's not modest,
he's just superstitious.

138
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,765
You're Harvard Med,
you were chief resident.

139
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,832
You know damn well
Bradfords going to pick you.

140
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,693
- Has he mentioned dinner yet?
- No.

141
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,160
- Radicchio salad.
- Thank you.

142
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:08,795
He will. Any day now,
he's going to invite you out to Morton's.

143
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,996
- Morton's on Monday, that's his M.O.
- Yeah.

144
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:13,504
I don't have anything to wear.

145
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:19,996
All right, guys. To Dr. Reynolds, folks.

146
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:22,551
The youngest head of a section
in Surgery.

147
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:26,400
Finally,
a parking spot with your name on it.

148
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,851
Are you drinking what I'm drinking?

149
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,698
You will remember your friends,
won't you?

150
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,721
What was your name?

151
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:38,299
Because I want
the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit.

152
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,325
- So, what did you think of Blue?
- Blue?

153
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,953
A real charmer.

154
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,872
So long as I don't have to make
house calls.

155
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,245
What are you talking about?

156
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,872
A 16-year-old gangbanger...

157
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:53,693
...with a rare high-grade
retroperitoneal sarcoma...

158
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:56,575
...your husband had the pleasure of seeing.
- Really?

159
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,230
Youth Authority case.
Pediatrics sent him up.

160
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,250
This is delicious.

161
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:03,266
What did he do?

162
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:06,240
- Who?
- This 16-year-old boy.

163
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:09,916
I read his medical record, hon,
not his rap sheet.

164
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,155
Well, I read it.

165
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,178
He blew his stepfather's brains out.

166
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:48,384
May beauty be before me

167
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:50,914
May beauty be behind me

168
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,851
May beauty be above me

169
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,987
May beauty be below me

170
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:00,830
May beauty be all around me

171
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,676
Coming to bed?

172
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,785
I thought Sally looked
beautiful tonight.

173
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,480
Isn't it wonderful how she just glowed?

174
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:31,677
She didn't even have to tell us
she was pregnant.

175
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:36,825
Yes, she glowed.

176
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:42,145
Can you imagine Chip changing a diaper?

177
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,575
Still thinking about that boy
you saw today?

178
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,064
Why would I be thinking
about that boy?

179
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,282
What is it, Michael?

180
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:15,007
Look, Jimmy, Lou Brock.

181
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,409
What will you trade me for him?

182
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,626
Take it.

183
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:44,446
Doesn't fit me anymore.

184
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:55,458
I want you to do something for me.

185
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:04,923
I want you to turn off the machine.

186
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:10,786
- No, no.
- Don't be afraid.

187
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,956
No, no.

188
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,361
Don't be afraid.

189
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:19,003
Just do it.

190
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,421
For me, Mikey.

191
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,683
Mighty Mike.

192
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,781
Yeah. Here you go.

193
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,509
I got it.

194
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,653
- Yeah.
- Yes.

195
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:42,977
Hey, Michael.
Do you have a minute?

196
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,602
Bingo.

197
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,172
Morton's, 7:00.

198
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,292
Oh, my God. This is it.

199
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,671
What should I wear?

200
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,358
How about the new stilettos
and them black thigh-highs?

201
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:57,951
You're terrible.

202
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,800
Okay.
I have a zoo board meeting at 2:30.

203
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:02,013
By the time I get home...

204
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,905
Dr. Reynolds.

205
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,509
I'm just gonna have to meet
you there at 7.

206
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:09,659
Don't be late.

207
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,720
- What the hell is this?
- It's your worst nightmare.

208
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,576
- No way.
- He's been turfed over to you.

209
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:19,425
- I'm not seeing him. Page Dr. Newman.
- Now in Surgery.

210
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,371
- Byrnes, then.
- Pathology.

211
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:35,615
How are you?

212
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:41,346
The Youth Facility physician says
you're reporting abdominal pains.

213
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:43,426
More than usual?

214
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,291
Okay, more than usual.

215
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,878
Reports of your scans are back.

216
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,834
Let's take a look.

217
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,400
Fucked, huh?

218
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,017
Tumor's gotten larger.

219
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:06,589
Excuse me for a moment, please.

220
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,955
Metastasis to the liver and lungs.
Double whammy.

221
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:29,085
Well, there it is.

222
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:35,205
I give him one,
maybe two months at the most.

223
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,938
Still looking pretty.

224
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:46,660
Still looking good.

225
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,606
Hey, I gotta take a leak.

226
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:39,937
You know, there is the possibility
that he might be eligible...

227
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:43,266
...for the NIH Sarcoma Protocol
over at City of Hope.

228
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:48,230
What? Come on, he fits all the criteria.

229
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,917
Advanced stage of the disease.

230
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:53,153
Nobody this far along
could survive that degree of toxicity.

231
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,621
- Especially a 16-year-old kid.
- Come on, Mike.

232
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:59,776
Sixteen is an advantage.
You can do anything to a 16-year-old.

233
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:02,277
Anything but guarantee them their lives,
right, Chip?

234
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,900
Let's be frank, gentlemen.

235
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:06,405
Mr. Monroe is a ward of the state, right?

236
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,777
They pick up the tab here.

237
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:10,593
I would strongly advise against it.

238
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,995
Subjecting a kid...

239
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,225
A patient to a regimen that...

240
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:18,627
And I think
Dr. Byrnes would have to agree...

241
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,791
...would be a painful waste of time.

242
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:24,161
I disagree.

243
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:30,430
I think you should screen him anyways.
See if he does fit the criteria.

244
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,931
You take him over to City of Hope
this afternoon.

245
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:35,942
Let's get him in there
before they close their study.

246
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:38,493
Me?

247
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:44,413
He is your patient, isn't he?

248
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:48,900
They wanna give you
higher doses of chemo.

249
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,447
It's a fly ride, man.

250
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:53,854
Where's the fax?

251
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:56,674
They're installing it tomorrow morning.

252
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:26,918
Now what?

253
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,287
Jesus Christ.

254
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:38,976
Monroe?

255
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,095
Son of a bitch.

256
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:50,653
Drop it. Drop it.

257
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:53,830
You make a sound and you're gonna die.

258
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:58,247
I'll peel your cap right here, right now,
motherfucker.

259
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,078
What's the problem?

260
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,445
Shut up and move.

261
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,344
Help me!

262
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,327
Okay. Okay.

263
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:16,543
Keep your hands down.

264
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,575
Move.

265
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,084
Drive. I said, drive.

266
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:37,857
Drive!

267
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,046
Call the police! Get me out of here!

268
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:43,525
Get me out of here!

269
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:44,998
Help me!

270
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,332
Help! Get me out of here!

271
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:49,056
Call the police!

272
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:51,777
You need to be in a hospital.

273
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:55,358
Shit, man.

274
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:57,633
Thought I was gonna have to peel
that man's cap.

275
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,378
Mess with his motherfucking ride,
but this is much better.

276
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,602
You wouldn't peel a doctor's cap,
would you?

277
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,289
I'll drop you. I could care less.

278
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:11,042
- No, Dr. Reynolds hasn't called in.
- This is Mrs. Reynolds.

279
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,031
Okay, let me try paging him.

280
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,364
It's important that I reach him.

281
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:22,212
Dr. Reynolds,
please call the nurse station ASAP.

282
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,607
That motherfucker's dead.

283
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,048
They got your brother
all handcuffed and shit.

284
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:55,777
Like this is 1712.

285
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:16,584
Jesus, this looks like the 6:00 news.

286
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:18,087
It's the Hazards, man.

287
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,624
You don't wanna go in the Hazards at night.
Even the grandmas got tattoos out here.

288
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,809
Don't worry,
no one's gonna mess with you, man.

289
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:29,887
There's too many Judas around.

290
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,600
Don't.

291
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,457
Yeah, boy.

292
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:49,919
Man, fuck the police. Fuck the police.

293
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,679
Your 'hood?

294
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:53,954
Whole country was our 'hood
about 400 years ago.

295
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:56,423
You see, I'm a mix.
Half-breed, half-Navajo.

296
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:02,213
Don't stare at them. Don't stare.

297
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:05,858
- She's tied up, you know.
- Punk motherfuckers.

298
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,567
I ought to UZI
these motherfuckers up in his car.

299
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:18,441
It's just another cluckhead
robbing a store.

300
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:21,575
Hey, pull in here.

301
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:24,072
- What for?
- Just pull in.

302
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:31,876
Money.

303
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:34,024
Get out.

304
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,705
I got one, two months at the most.

305
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:39,492
Yeah, I heard you motherfuckers.

306
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:42,953
So, what the fuck if I bust a cap
in your ass right now, huh?

307
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,058
Now, get out.

308
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,488
You got tools?

309
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,308
Tools?

310
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:57,322
- Man, don't remark me.
- They're in the trunk, I guess.

311
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:58,889
I don't know, I just got it. l...

312
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,505
Well, then open
the motherfucking trunk, then.

313
00:26:16,746 --> 00:26:18,208
Easy.

314
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,967
Easy.

315
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:30,376
How do they live like this?

316
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:36,682
It's their 'hood, man.

317
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:51,875
You're stealing this car?

318
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:54,628
No, you are. I don't got a license.

319
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:00,298
Bing, bang.

320
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,433
I could care less.

321
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,327
I still got the touch, man.

322
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:12,033
Well, what about my...?

323
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:15,464
That is a $ 176,000 car.

324
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:17,514
You're about to trade down, man.

325
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:19,136
Now, drive.

326
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:20,417
Drive.

327
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,152
Listen, that's really stupid.

328
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:27,776
Easy, bust it right.

329
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:31,209
Hey, watch out, watch out.
Be careful.

330
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:33,472
Hey, bust it right. In there.

331
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,408
Go left. Left.

332
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:40,296
Right in there. Right in there.

333
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,228
- My man, Smokes.
- What's up, homey?

334
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:51,046
What's up? You're still getting fucked up
over some bitch?

335
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,258
Hell, yeah, you know it.

336
00:27:52,427 --> 00:27:54,980
I just ain't got turned out
like your ass yet.

337
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:59,850
- Fuck you, holmes.
- Fuck you, homeboy.

338
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:03,684
Oh, you for real, man.

339
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:07,048
Yeah, but who the fuck
is this motherfucker right here?

340
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,121
He's all right.
That's my doctor, he's cool.

341
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:11,048
He's gonna make sure I'm all right.

342
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:14,441
I see doctor got himself
all hemmed up, huh?

343
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:21,123
You need some motherfucking walk-through
metal detectors in that damn hospital.

344
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,942
Because I just walk right up in that
motherfucker strapped.

345
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:25,514
You know what I'm saying?

346
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:28,873
They be checking like one out of 10.

347
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:33,062
So I figure I just stash the nine
in the ceiling of the fourth floor bathroom.

348
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,497
That's great.

349
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,122
Hey, man, you know,
I got this real bad pain in my side.

350
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,785
Check it out.

351
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,401
I don't pay attention
to that father figure.

352
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:45,867
I just handle mine,
and I'm rolling with the trigger.

353
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,153
Hey, doc, check it out, man.

354
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:56,106
It's a fly color, huh?

355
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:59,749
Do you have any idea
how toxic that is?

356
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:03,113
Hey, doc, the drill is talking to me.

357
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,805
The drill.

358
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:08,387
The drill, he's saying
he going to kill your bitch ass.

359
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:34,466
Brandon, listen to me.

360
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:37,190
You have stage four
retroperitoneal sarcoma.

361
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,432
What's "stage four" mean?

362
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:42,084
It means you have
an advanced inoperable tumor.

363
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:44,619
Your only hope
is high-dose chemotherapy.

364
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,017
Yeah, I kind of thought that.

365
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:54,529
But before I die, I want to get me
as much pussy as I can get.

366
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,068
Brandon, listen, I can understand
how this might make you a bit unstable.

367
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:02,342
By the way, the moniker is Blue.

368
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:04,331
Brandon Monroe is just a name on a file.

369
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,434
Blue.

370
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:09,955
All right, Blue, where are we going?

371
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:11,947
Is that too much to ask?

372
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:14,663
Arizona.

373
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,901
Shiprock. Navajo reservation.

374
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:18,857
Are you insane?

375
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:21,221
Dibe' Ni'tsaa? What the hell is this?

376
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:22,697
It's Dibe' Ni'tsaa.

377
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,162
- We're gonna meet someone there.
- Who?

378
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,456
That's enough questions, all right?
Just do what I tell you to do.

379
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:31,559
Now what the fuck are you doing?

380
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:35,402
Well, I'm just trying to make up a little time.
I have to be at Morton's at 7:00.

381
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:37,802
That sounds like a faggot.
Is he your butt buddy?

382
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:41,281
- No, he is a restaurant.
- That sounds like a faggot restaurant.

383
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,842
Sounds like you've had experience.

384
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,693
I hear this is a notorious speed trap.

385
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:48,716
We should be careful.

386
00:30:49,453 --> 00:30:50,915
Hey.

387
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:52,972
You wanna tear it? Let's tear it.

388
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,595
I'm in control now.

389
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,154
- Whoo!
- Oh, no.

390
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:01,351
No.

391
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:04,364
No, no, no. Stop it.

392
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:06,732
We're gonna die.

393
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:08,716
We're gonna die.

394
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:12,042
Oh, shit!

395
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,891
We're gonna die.

396
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:26,754
We hit 118. Detroit iron, man. Whoo!

397
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,291
- Yeah.
- You're crazy.

398
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:39,532
Victoria, I wonder if he
has forgotten us.

399
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:44,456
Mrs. Reynolds, you have a phone call.

400
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:45,767
Thank you.

401
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,624
Excuse me.

402
00:31:54,894 --> 00:31:56,421
Thanks.

403
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:57,866
- Hello?
- Hi, Victoria.

404
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,786
Chip, where is he?

405
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,438
- Michael told me that...
- He disappeared.

406
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:03,620
What?

407
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,363
Go slow.

408
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:03,627
Well, that's a balanced meal.

409
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,749
Can I help you?

410
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:11,304
Thirty dollars on Number 5.

411
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,192
Sixty-four fifty.

412
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:27,107
Out of a hundred.

413
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:34,149
You know, miss, you really
shouldn't be smoking around that infant.

414
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,879
There's no ventilation here at all.

415
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,047
Secondary smoke definitely can do
irreparable damage...

416
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:41,353
...to a respiratory system that young.

417
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,700
Thirty-five fifty is your change.

418
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:49,542
- What are you, a fucking doctor?
- Well, as a matter of fact...

419
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,645
I don't need nobody telling me
how to take care of my kid.

420
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,644
You want this job, asshole?

421
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:04,195
Miss, if you knew the statistics,
I'm sure you wouldn't take that attitude.

422
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:07,627
Fuck you.

423
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:14,762
Keep frying up those mentholated lights,
and junior will end up looking just like me.

424
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,447
Both of you two,
get the hell out of here right now.

425
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:20,484
Or I'm calling my boyfriend.

426
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:23,690
K-BAFM at the top of the hour.

427
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:29,222
Lucky 108 FM, the tristate home
of classic rock from the '60s, '70s and '80s.

428
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:33,708
Rocking on glitter platforms
with David Bowie, with "Suffragette City"

429
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,656
Secondary smoke
can cause irreparable damage...

430
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,244
...to a respiratory system that young.

431
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,237
That's all right, man.

432
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:48,140
Yeah, that's all right. That's fine.

433
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:52,297
You know, my wife is probably having
a nervous breakdown right now.

434
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:54,470
I missed the most important dinner
of my life.

435
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,581
Yes, everything is all right.

436
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:57,798
It's just peachy.

437
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:01,033
You know, a lot of weird shit
happens in life.

438
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:23,241
What are those?

439
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:24,815
Just some A's, man.

440
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:26,863
Amphetamines.

441
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,869
Well, live it up, you know. Live it up.

442
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:33,132
Candy bars, alcohol, cigarettes.

443
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:35,979
The human body
is a remarkable and resilient thing...

444
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:39,689
...but you can't continue
with this kind of abuse.

445
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:42,376
- Your white blood count is extremely low.
- Oh, fuck that.

446
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:46,635
White blood count and red blood count,
you think I give a fuck about either one?

447
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:49,387
Is it any worse
than the shit you give me?

448
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,886
You're gonna have to crash sometime.
I promise you.

449
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:54,186
You think you know what's good for me.

450
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:56,391
You don't know shit, man.

451
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,944
It's all explanatory how I gets wicked

452
00:36:00,111 --> 00:36:03,527
But it's mandatory that I just kick it

453
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:06,988
- Pull over.
- What?

454
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,520
Pull over.

455
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:13,191
Why are we pulling over? I think...

456
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,432
No, no, no, man. Way over.

457
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,029
This does not look safe.

458
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,825
It's not safe.

459
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:20,367
It's only beautiful.

460
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:21,670
What?

461
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,400
Keep rolling.

462
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:26,793
- What was that?
- Cattle guard.

463
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,683
- It's cool, cool.
- Huh?

464
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:29,830
It's cool.

465
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,164
- Just stop here, stop.
- Stop here? I'm not stopping here.

466
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:34,822
Why are we stopping here?

467
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,269
To sleep.

468
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:38,923
To sleep?

469
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:47,367
You know, we're gonna get shot
by some rancher out here after all this.

470
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:51,049
No, ain't no ranchers out here.

471
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,865
Mountain lions, maybe.

472
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:57,158
No, no, no, you know what?

473
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:00,174
There ain't no mountain lions out here.

474
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,527
I think there's devil worshippers, man.

475
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:06,761
They cut us up and drink our blood.

476
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:09,384
This looks like the kind of place
they'd hang.

477
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:10,763
Would you be quiet, please?

478
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,522
No, you...

479
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,063
Aliens.

480
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:16,527
There's aliens out here.
Little white motherfuckers.

481
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:19,339
- Would you please be quiet?
- The Army knows about this shit.

482
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,701
They've been keeping it a secret.
They've got these spaceships up there.

483
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:26,280
- They beam us up and cut us up with lasers.
- Would you please be quiet?

484
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:34,735
Good night, doctor.

485
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:39,888
Good night.

486
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,392
He's out there, man.

487
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,055
He's out there.

488
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,689
Good news.

489
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:34,672
There's no blood and no body.

490
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:38,794
- That's what the sheriff's office says.
- Oh, I think that's very reassuring, Victoria.

491
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:40,784
I sent Callie off with Rosa this morning.

492
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:44,240
I just couldn't bear to tell her
why Michael's mother's flying in.

493
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:45,384
Don't worry, honey.

494
00:38:45,553 --> 00:38:48,106
I mean, he's only a 16-year-old boy.

495
00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:59,627
Please, God, let him be gone.
Let him be gone.

496
00:38:59,793 --> 00:39:02,510
I'll never cheat
another insurance company.

497
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,942
I'll buy Victoria the house.

498
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:06,796
Whatever it takes, I...

499
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:08,587
Just please, God, I beg you.

500
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:10,958
Just let me get out of this,
let me get out of this.

501
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,032
Yeah.

502
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:17,385
Good morning, doc.

503
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,296
Let's go.

504
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,089
Subhuman piece of shit.

505
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,083
Please leave a message at the beep.

506
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,582
Hello? This is Brandon Monroe.

507
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:22,858
I'm in Arizona.

508
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:24,849
I'm on my way.

509
00:40:31,154 --> 00:40:33,129
Everything is cool. Let's roll.

510
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:43,951
I said, let's roll.

511
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:53,457
Look, Blue, I'm losing my mind.

512
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,600
I'm...

513
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:59,692
If you put that gun away
and let me out right now...

514
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:05,545
... I'll forget this everhappened,
I won't press charges, I swear to God.

515
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:08,235
Man, you as dumb as two bricks.

516
00:41:08,403 --> 00:41:09,832
I'm dumb?

517
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:11,693
I'm dumb?

518
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:15,154
Right now, there is a manhunt underway
for you and me, my friend.

519
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:17,736
I'm talking FBI, state police.

520
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:20,809
Our pictures our probably plastered
all over the front page.

521
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,761
- Don't flatter yourself, man.
- The next time we stop for gas...

522
00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:26,705
And by the way, this baby
is getting about 10 miles per gallon.

523
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:29,255
The next time we stop anywhere
for anything...

524
00:41:29,427 --> 00:41:33,005
... this whole charade
is over, finished, done, finito.

525
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:34,415
Anywhere, huh?

526
00:41:57,523 --> 00:42:00,240
Yeah, okay, all right.
Pull in here right now.

527
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:04,402
Right here.

528
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:27,921
Looks like nobody read
the front pages yet.

529
00:42:29,235 --> 00:42:32,683
When you're checking out the menu, Mr.
Glock is gonna be looking at your dick.

530
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:36,648
So try to give any rope, any,
you will make the front page.

531
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,958
You know what I'm saying? So sit down.

532
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:47,914
Breakfast?

533
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,926
The special?

534
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:54,994
- What is the special?
- It's on the menu.

535
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,523
Two strips of bacon,
eggs, sunny-side up,

536
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,832
hash browns, some fried perch
and a side of tartar sauce.

537
00:43:03,252 --> 00:43:06,568
Do you have anything that would
constitute nourishment on the menu?

538
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,490
We got what we got
and we don't got what we don't got.

539
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,440
Do you got carrot juice?

540
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:13,492
No, we got carrots.

541
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:15,059
Two specials.

542
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:19,214
And a carrot.

543
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:26,731
Nice tits, huh?

544
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,882
I beg your pardon?

545
00:43:28,052 --> 00:43:29,514
You were checking out her tits.

546
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:31,757
I wasn't checking out anything.

547
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,414
Yeah, you were.
You were checking them.

548
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:36,299
Nice ass too, huh?

549
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:38,028
What would your wife say?

550
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:41,131
Why don't you grow
some pubic hair, junior.

551
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,497
I got pubic hair, asshole.
It's the one place I got hair left.

552
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,904
You're lucky.

553
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,868
You better eat up, man.

554
00:44:10,036 --> 00:44:11,629
We won't be hanging here all day.

555
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:15,947
Hey, Fuzz.

556
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:27,785
You know, it might be wise to take
a breath between bites once in a while.

557
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,745
What do you care how I eat
or what I eat?

558
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,251
There's some relationship...

559
00:44:31,413 --> 00:44:34,347
... between what you're putting
in your body and the state it's in.

560
00:44:34,517 --> 00:44:36,721
You should see the shit
they give us in jail.

561
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:38,542
Horse cock and piss.

562
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,262
They kick it through the pie door.
Shit will kill you.

563
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,509
Yeah.

564
00:44:42,677 --> 00:44:44,433
I knew I could make it.

565
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:46,004
Do you have any family, Blue?

566
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:53,165
My pops, my real father,
he was a down motherfucker, man,

567
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,510
but he's dead.

568
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:56,084
My mother died in jail too.

569
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:59,216
My brothers are all locked up and shit.

570
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,195
My sister, she's raising
two kids by herself.

571
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:04,365
Do you have any friends?

572
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:09,073
All the G's,
the ones I used to hang with,

573
00:45:09,237 --> 00:45:13,011
they're all Glocked up or locked up
except Smokes.

574
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:15,762
I don't know nobody out there no more.

575
00:45:16,117 --> 00:45:18,834
You see, I was 13 when I went to jail,
now I'm 16.

576
00:45:18,997 --> 00:45:21,452
Nobody knows who I am no more.
You know what I'm saying?

577
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:23,214
I grown old.

578
00:45:26,197 --> 00:45:31,435
I have a daughter. She's 3.

579
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,033
I have a picture. Would you like to see it?

580
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:35,757
Why the fuck not?

581
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:38,129
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

582
00:45:38,293 --> 00:45:41,871
That's my wife on the right
and my daughter on the left, obviously.

583
00:45:45,013 --> 00:45:47,795
I worry about her growing up.

584
00:45:47,957 --> 00:45:49,845
She looks nice. What's her name?

585
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:52,846
Calantha. Callie.

586
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:54,798
My mother's idea.

587
00:45:57,205 --> 00:45:59,060
It's a nice name.

588
00:46:00,693 --> 00:46:02,832
Yeah, I like a different name.

589
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:05,708
My homegirl's name was Leilani.

590
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,597
Leilani. I like that.

591
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:10,830
She was the one that got me shot up.

592
00:46:10,997 --> 00:46:12,820
Bitch set me up.

593
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,580
You a pretty good father, man?

594
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:21,490
You'd have to ask Callie.

595
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:25,555
You could be acting the father role,
which maybe you're not, you know.

596
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:28,341
My foster father,
used to beat the shit out of me...

597
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:31,469
... and his other kids with his belt,
with the end with the buckle.

598
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:33,460
Every night
he could get his hands on us.

599
00:46:33,621 --> 00:46:34,963
Sick motherfucker, man.

600
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,998
I should have peeled his cap a lot sooner.

601
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:42,060
It was always, "You little half-breed.
You little red nigger."

602
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,532
I'm the one he always tied up.

603
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:47,694
I used to go crazy
when I heard him coming.

604
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:50,000
But I knew where he kept his gat.

605
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:53,996
A 9 mm Mr. Ruger.

606
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:00,879
So one night,
he put it to my foster mom real bad.

607
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:04,821
He tied her to the radiator,
made us watch that shit.

608
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:07,852
So that was the night
I killed his ass with his own gun.

609
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,921
I didn't even think about it twice.

610
00:47:12,086 --> 00:47:13,875
Bam, bam, bam!

611
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:18,482
You gonna eat your food?

612
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:24,114
No, you wanna kill yourself,
be my guest.

613
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:28,333
How's that carrot, man?

614
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:33,294
Listen, Blue, I'm talking to you now
human being to human being.

615
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:36,273
Oh, you mean,
like an emotional conversation?

616
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:38,064
You could call it that.

617
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,711
Yeah, I like to sit back
and just conversate.

618
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:45,004
Well, if you want me to drive you
to this sacred mountain...

619
00:47:45,174 --> 00:47:47,760
... or wherever, or whomever,

620
00:47:47,927 --> 00:47:50,644
that's fine, I don't mind driving.

621
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:52,334
I just...

622
00:47:52,694 --> 00:47:54,799
I want to see my wife
and daughter again.

623
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:56,204
That's all I want.

624
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,836
That's all... That's all...

625
00:47:58,006 --> 00:48:01,422
Don't get so pumped up.
You're getting all pumped up.

626
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,340
You look like you're having a nic fit.
You want a smoke?

627
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,213
No, thank you.

628
00:48:10,711 --> 00:48:13,646
I would like to urinate, if that's okay.

629
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:28,246
Go ahead. Urinate.

630
00:48:29,143 --> 00:48:30,223
Thank you.

631
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:32,333
Shoot the ball.

632
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:47,121
Excuse me.

633
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:08,973
Hey, man, check it out.

634
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:45,965
Frenchman something or other.
I didn't notice the entire name.

635
00:49:46,264 --> 00:49:48,817
It's a bar, a diner, for chrissakes.

636
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:51,635
I'm in Shitsville, Arizona.
How should I know?

637
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,760
Just get someone here.
He's got a gun, a very large gun.

638
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,967
You're a motherfucking liar.

639
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,778
- Help, help!
- What's the matter?

640
00:50:01,943 --> 00:50:03,569
He wanted to suck my dick.

641
00:50:03,736 --> 00:50:06,671
I was hitching a ride to the res.
He promised to buy me breakfast.

642
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:09,556
- Son of a...
- Oh, fuck, just what I need.

643
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:12,054
Gentlemen, I am a married man
with a child.

644
00:50:12,216 --> 00:50:13,776
Do I look like a homosexual to you?

645
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:19,282
Stupid motherfucker.

646
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,389
Goddamn it.

647
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,283
You fucking son of a bitch. I'll kill you.

648
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,219
Well, you can't suck his dick
but you can sure as hell suck mine.

649
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:39,406
Damn it, take it outside!
You know better than that.

650
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:41,201
Let's go, come on!

651
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:43,539
Come on, get him out of here.

652
00:50:43,704 --> 00:50:45,973
- Take it outside!
- You fucking faggot!

653
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:49,999
- Damn it, stay out!
- Lower than whale shit, get him up.

654
00:50:50,168 --> 00:50:51,662
Hold him.

655
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:05,558
Hop in, shithead.

656
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,241
Fucker! Son of a bitch!

657
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:09,521
Motherfucker.

658
00:51:09,689 --> 00:51:12,056
Fuck, come on, man.
Get in the fucking truck.

659
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:15,185
Let's go, man.

660
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:17,491
We're gonna be running
the side roads from now.

661
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,729
You maniac! They were gonna kill me!

662
00:51:19,896 --> 00:51:22,230
I thought you were trying
to talk straight up to me.

663
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:25,175
I should've taken you out
back there. Fuck.

664
00:51:35,545 --> 00:51:36,722
Shit.

665
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:40,369
Oh, great. Now let's have a shootout.

666
00:51:41,497 --> 00:51:43,504
Goddamn it.

667
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:59,223
Get behind the wheel.

668
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,871
If you could drive like that,
what do you need me for?

669
00:52:05,976 --> 00:52:07,700
Because I'm dying, asshole.

670
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:29,681
We got a 911 call from a Dr. Reynolds.

671
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,336
Mrs. Reynolds.

672
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:39,823
I'm so glad you're here.

673
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:41,008
I'm so worried.

674
00:52:41,177 --> 00:52:43,828
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.
Daddy's lost.

675
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:47,124
My girl, my favorite angel.

676
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,718
Wonderful to see you.

677
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:52,369
- Oh, well, now she's so big.
- Give Grandma a kiss.

678
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:56,851
Hey, Earl.

679
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:02,744
Come on, let's go pay.

680
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,257
Come on, move it.

681
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:08,918
I said, let's go pay for gas.

682
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:14,355
Hey! You goddamn fool,
that was all your money, right?

683
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:15,504
All the fucking money.

684
00:53:15,673 --> 00:53:18,129
- I'll beat the shit out of you.
- Go ahead and beat me.

685
00:53:18,297 --> 00:53:19,639
Give me your watch.

686
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:22,485
Give me your watch.
Give me your watch, you fucking punk.

687
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:29,301
I should've blown up your Porsche.
You sick motherfucker.

688
00:53:29,466 --> 00:53:33,011
No, I'm the doctor.
You're the sick little motherfucker.

689
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,591
No fucking way.

690
00:53:36,762 --> 00:53:38,453
No fucking way.

691
00:53:43,258 --> 00:53:45,494
There's six rows of pumping
and a truck jamming...

692
00:53:45,658 --> 00:53:47,000
... between us and the cashier.

693
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:49,529
Nobody's gonna hear nothing,
you know what I'm saying?

694
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,821
Give me the ring or you're gonna die.
I'll peel your cap, point-blank.

695
00:53:52,986 --> 00:53:57,329
You go ahead and peel my cap,
you little bastard.

696
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:01,080
I'm afraid we're gonna have to go
30,000 rads, doc.

697
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:05,463
Make that 50,000 rads.

698
00:54:05,626 --> 00:54:08,244
Strap the motherfucker in,
pull the switch.

699
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:11,253
God.

700
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:14,003
Oh, you're gonna have to die sometime.

701
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,471
But before you do,
I'm gonna tell you something.

702
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:18,293
Something this big OG once told me.

703
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,432
He was no regular person
off the reservation.

704
00:54:20,602 --> 00:54:22,031
He knew where the animals go.

705
00:54:22,202 --> 00:54:25,071
He knew where they were gonna come,
and where they were gonna go.

706
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:26,769
He was from Shiprock.

707
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:29,360
A full-blown medicine man.

708
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,846
We kicked it at night sitting at a campfire,
listening to him tell stories.

709
00:54:33,018 --> 00:54:35,320
And one of them I never forgot.
You wanna hear it?

710
00:54:37,434 --> 00:54:40,184
Sixty thousand rads!
Torch the motherfucker!

711
00:54:44,827 --> 00:54:46,321
Oh, looks like you wanna hear it.

712
00:54:47,707 --> 00:54:51,863
You see, long ago there was this family
that had two brothers.

713
00:54:52,026 --> 00:54:55,375
One was small and strong,
the other was big and weak.

714
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:57,139
The weak one got sicker and sicker.

715
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:58,965
He was dying, he couldn't walk.

716
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:00,375
Take it.

717
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:01,521
So his family...

718
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:04,593
- It doesn't fit me anymore.
- They called for every medicine man.

719
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:07,129
Like from every reservation,
even the Utes and Apache.

720
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:09,178
But nobody could do shit about it.

721
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:10,996
Then, like, at sunrise one morning,

722
00:55:11,162 --> 00:55:12,144
Mighty Mike.

723
00:55:12,315 --> 00:55:15,217
this beetle climbed up
on the sick boy's bed.

724
00:55:15,387 --> 00:55:17,526
I want you to do something for me.

725
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:19,187
Say yes.

726
00:55:19,354 --> 00:55:21,689
So his family...
And they're fast runners too, man.

727
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:25,648
They chase the sun when it comes up and
run away from it when it goes down.

728
00:55:25,818 --> 00:55:27,313
For me, Mikey.

729
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:30,965
Mighty Mike.

730
00:55:31,131 --> 00:55:34,229
This beetle climbed up
by the sick boy's bed.

731
00:55:34,395 --> 00:55:35,956
No.

732
00:55:36,122 --> 00:55:39,057
They loved the sun,
these tiger beetles. They're tough.

733
00:55:39,227 --> 00:55:40,503
And they're fast runners too.

734
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,357
They chase the sun when it comes up...

735
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:44,945
... and they run away from it
when it starts to go down.

736
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:13,047
The Sunchaser, he said a prayer
and he told the boy:

737
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:16,178
"Follow me to the lake
on the sacred mountain.

738
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:22,097
If you swim in its waters,
it will cure you of all your disease."

739
00:56:23,387 --> 00:56:26,137
Shit. For four fucking days,
the Sunchaser came at sunrise.

740
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:30,161
And for four days, he said his prayer
and made his promise.

741
00:56:30,332 --> 00:56:33,714
But nobody believed the boy when he
told them about the Sunchaser's promise.

742
00:56:33,883 --> 00:56:36,305
Nobody, except finally his brother.

743
00:56:37,883 --> 00:56:40,502
He was small but he was tough, cabron.

744
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:44,186
He was the only one
that was really down for his brother.

745
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:47,280
So at next sunrise, the younger brother...

746
00:56:47,452 --> 00:56:51,729
... rode with his older brother
on his horse.

747
00:56:52,508 --> 00:56:55,607
They went from sunrise,
following the Sunchaser.

748
00:56:55,772 --> 00:56:59,219
They rode for fucking days
until they reached that mountain.

749
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,008
And when they did,
the younger brother,

750
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:05,750
he climbed up that mountain
with his sick older brother on his back.

751
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:09,145
You see it.
Do you know what I'm saying?

752
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:11,895
And he put him in the water.

753
00:57:12,284 --> 00:57:14,356
And he started to swim.

754
00:57:16,252 --> 00:57:19,099
And there was nothing wrong
with him no more.

755
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,332
Nothing at all.

756
00:57:29,788 --> 00:57:33,400
I learned a lot of down shit
from that old medicine man.

757
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:40,699
May beauty be before me,
may beauty be behind me

758
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:45,945
May beauty be above me,
may beauty be below me

759
00:57:46,108 --> 00:57:49,425
May beauty be all around me

760
00:57:51,292 --> 00:57:53,015
I got a heart just like you do.

761
00:57:57,148 --> 00:57:59,287
See, when I got sick, like...

762
00:57:59,804 --> 00:58:01,233
... nobody cared about me.

763
00:58:02,748 --> 00:58:05,977
You know, you think you're gonna die
and they're like...

764
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:08,659
I was in jail
hoping for someone to help me.

765
00:58:08,828 --> 00:58:10,770
I wrote to that
old medicine man from jail.

766
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,809
He made me that prayer
to say whenever I felt bad.

767
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,558
And just like the Sunchaser,
he told me...

768
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:22,325
... that he would take me
to that lake on the sacred mountain...

769
00:58:22,493 --> 00:58:25,275
... and drive out all of my sickness.

770
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:31,186
And if you think you're gonna stop me
from getting there, you're dead wrong.

771
00:58:31,356 --> 00:58:33,778
You ain't deep enough.

772
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:38,620
Damn.

773
00:58:40,413 --> 00:58:41,973
Well, what do you know?

774
00:58:43,165 --> 00:58:45,499
The Black Talking God
must be with you today.

775
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,344
Maybe I'll kill you, maybe I won't.

776
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:51,380
Now, I'll get us some gas.

777
00:59:08,573 --> 00:59:10,264
Fill it up, please, on 16.

778
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,087
Sixteen.

779
00:59:12,413 --> 00:59:14,071
Haven't I seen you on TV?

780
00:59:14,237 --> 00:59:15,666
Oh, goodness, no.

781
00:59:15,837 --> 00:59:18,390
You look just like that gal
on Designing Women.

782
00:59:18,557 --> 00:59:21,873
- What's her name?
- I don't watch television.

783
00:59:22,045 --> 00:59:23,670
I bet you tell that to everybody.

784
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:25,812
You're right, I do.

785
00:59:27,229 --> 00:59:29,912
- I don't think that's your name.
- No, that's my name.

786
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:33,176
- And I'll be right back to sign
my autograph. - Right.

787
00:59:35,517 --> 00:59:38,386
Twenty dollars on pump 16.

788
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:41,492
Twenty dollars on pump 16.

789
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,240
There was also
considerable property damage.

790
00:59:45,693 --> 00:59:50,712
And two motorcycles were,
shall we say, maliciously destroyed.

791
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:54,232
Perhaps I missed a beat.

792
00:59:54,398 --> 00:59:56,405
Just what the hell
are you people insinuating?

793
00:59:56,574 --> 00:59:58,003
My husband is the hostage here.

794
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:00,857
No one is insinuating anything.

795
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,100
Your husband made a judgment call.

796
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:05,530
He took it upon himself to demand...

797
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:08,475
... that a youthful offender
be transported to another facility.

798
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:11,387
A patient, a terminally ill adolescent.

799
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:16,284
Mrs. Reynolds, believe me,
no one would call them adolescents.

800
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:19,479
Mrs. Reynolds, to your knowledge,

801
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:23,540
has your husband ever been treated
for any kind of emotional problems?

802
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,597
I'm afraid
I don't understand the question.

803
01:00:25,757 --> 01:00:30,100
Are there any areas,
any areas of your husbands past,

804
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,277
that he doesn't talk about?

805
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:35,261
I'm not intimidated
by police technique, Mr. Collier.

806
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:38,586
So please don't treat me
as you do everyone else.

807
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,954
It's information I need, Mrs. Reynolds.

808
01:00:41,118 --> 01:00:45,111
My husband is a healthy,
rational, loving man.

809
01:00:45,278 --> 01:00:49,621
The only emotional problem he has
is the gun that's been put to his head.

810
01:01:00,766 --> 01:01:02,227
Fuck!

811
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,523
Motherfucker!

812
01:01:30,911 --> 01:01:32,220
Beautiful.

813
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:46,457
You know, Blue,

814
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:52,600
I wish there were a sacred mountain,
I really do.

815
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,640
I wish there were
a magic lake on top of it...

816
01:01:55,807 --> 01:02:00,629
that could take away all your pain
and make you well again.

817
01:02:02,527 --> 01:02:03,934
But there is no sacred mountain.

818
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:09,016
There is no magic
that's going to cure you.

819
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:13,304
And the longer you spend searching
for it, the more you're going to suffer.

820
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:18,356
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I understand.

821
01:02:18,718 --> 01:02:21,173
I understand you're full of shit.

822
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:24,596
- You need medical attention.
- I need more than that.

823
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,003
You need me, but you don't trust me...

824
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:29,916
... because of all the stereotypes
you have about white people.

825
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,737
Hey, I ain't no racist, man.

826
01:02:31,902 --> 01:02:34,455
I'm in the jungle, you're in the hills
looking down at me.

827
01:02:34,623 --> 01:02:38,300
And you want me to think
that my life depends on you? Fuck you!

828
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,219
Okay, fine.

829
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:44,922
But think again,
it starts with little beads of sweat.

830
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:47,608
And then comes the coughing,
sometimes uncontrollable.

831
01:02:47,775 --> 01:02:49,597
And then the chills
and the shivering.

832
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:51,864
And then when your liver
starts to shut down...

833
01:02:52,031 --> 01:02:54,202
... you slip into a coma.

834
01:02:55,551 --> 01:02:57,787
Why don't you let me
take you to a hospital?

835
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,708
Why don't you stick your head up your
ass and see what you really look like.

836
01:03:06,303 --> 01:03:09,467
Okay. Fuck it!

837
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:11,355
And fuck you!

838
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:14,942
You think because you saw
some picture in some book...

839
01:03:15,103 --> 01:03:19,805
... that some asshole drew
in 1850-whatever-the-hell...

840
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:23,382
... that you're just gonna pull up
in front of it like it's Disneyland?

841
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:24,925
It ain't no Disneyland, man.

842
01:03:25,087 --> 01:03:27,771
It's real.
It's one of the sacred mountains.

843
01:03:28,607 --> 01:03:30,844
- Ain't nothing sacred to you?
- Of course there is.

844
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:32,284
What?

845
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,503
Oh, look.

846
01:03:36,672 --> 01:03:41,014
Look, it's the holy mountain.
And there's the medicine man waving at us.

847
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:44,598
And there's Dorothy and the Tin Man
and the Wizard of Oz and th...

848
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,445
Oh, I've been bitten by a rattlesnake.

849
01:03:51,616 --> 01:03:53,590
Oh, God.

850
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,768
Oh, my God.

851
01:03:56,864 --> 01:04:00,377
I'm gonna die right out here. Oh, God.

852
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:03,550
I'm already tachycardic.

853
01:04:04,096 --> 01:04:06,267
I'm gonna have
an endocardial hemorrhage.

854
01:04:07,296 --> 01:04:09,401
Oh, what am I doing?
I don't even have a watch.

855
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,094
What...?

856
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:18,167
Let it burn. Electricity neutralizes
the protein in the snake venom.

857
01:04:20,832 --> 01:04:23,353
I can't talk proper English.

858
01:04:23,808 --> 01:04:25,052
You amaze me.

859
01:04:25,216 --> 01:04:27,420
Why? Because you thought I was dumb?

860
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:30,583
You think I don't use my mind?

861
01:04:30,752 --> 01:04:32,508
No, I don't think you're dumb...

862
01:04:32,672 --> 01:04:34,198
What the fuck do you think?

863
01:04:34,368 --> 01:04:37,183
- About what?
- About what?

864
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:40,573
About me, any of your patients.

865
01:04:41,184 --> 01:04:42,940
You think about them?

866
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,727
Yes, of course.

867
01:04:44,896 --> 01:04:47,765
- About the way they feel?
- Yes.

868
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,309
Who you shitting, motherfucker?
You ain't got the balls for it.

869
01:04:53,088 --> 01:04:55,390
Indian people believe,
you bit by a snake...

870
01:04:55,552 --> 01:04:59,032
... it's because of something bad
you done to someone else.

871
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:03,548
There's something crawling in you, man.

872
01:05:05,312 --> 01:05:07,101
Your mind ain't in tune to your heart.

873
01:05:08,032 --> 01:05:09,820
Do you know what I'm saying?

874
01:05:18,433 --> 01:05:20,221
Where are you going?

875
01:05:21,248 --> 01:05:23,136
I don't even understand
how you're walking.

876
01:05:23,296 --> 01:05:25,718
By rights, you should be dead by now.

877
01:05:29,632 --> 01:05:32,502
Can we stop for a minute?
I've just been bitten by a rattlesnake.

878
01:05:32,673 --> 01:05:35,640
I'll stop when I can't see straight.
That's when I'll stop.

879
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:37,053
Where are we going?

880
01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:30,263
Stop, please. Could you please stop?

881
01:06:30,433 --> 01:06:32,637
Please, just stop. Stop.

882
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:35,038
Could you please just stop?

883
01:06:36,065 --> 01:06:38,301
Hello? Stop.

884
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:11,769
Okay, now, if you would just
keep going when we get to...

885
01:07:11,937 --> 01:07:13,825
Just keep going. Don't stop for this...

886
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,360
Don't stop, trust me.

887
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:17,082
Please, he's dangerous. Don't stop.

888
01:07:17,249 --> 01:07:20,032
- This is rough territory.
- God.

889
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:25,951
- You in?
- Thanks.

890
01:07:26,114 --> 01:07:27,772
Hang on.

891
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:29,498
Are you here for the Convergence?

892
01:07:29,665 --> 01:07:31,159
The Harmonic Convergence?

893
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:33,915
Do you mind if I put my leg up?
I've been bitten by a...

894
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:37,464
There are hundreds of people here
for the Convergence.

895
01:07:37,634 --> 01:07:39,292
This whole area is a power point.

896
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,368
I'm going into Flagstaff for supplies.

897
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:43,512
We're headed to Flagstaff. Cool.

898
01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:49,050
You know, I'm really picking
up some weird energies from you two.

899
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:56,123
- Maybe you've seen us on the news.
- Shut up.

900
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:57,533
I don't listen to news.

901
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:59,608
- Well, allow me to fill you in.
- Shut up.

902
01:08:00,578 --> 01:08:01,789
I'm terminally ill.

903
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:04,223
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- I wouldn't count on it.

904
01:08:04,386 --> 01:08:06,524
I said shut up, motherfucker!

905
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,446
Excuse me.

906
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:12,095
We're actually headed
up north of Flagstaff.

907
01:08:12,258 --> 01:08:13,534
Up Shiprock way.

908
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:18,490
- Are you Navajo?
- No, he's fugitive.

909
01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,080
My real father was Navajo.
That's what I am.

910
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:25,178
- I'm going to one of the sacred
mountains. - I love sacred mountains.

911
01:08:25,346 --> 01:08:28,826
You see, there's this magic lake
on top of this mountain,

912
01:08:28,994 --> 01:08:31,645
but no white man believes
that its waters are magic.

913
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:32,857
Oh, here we go.

914
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:35,131
Water is a highly concentrated element...

915
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:38,364
... with great healing power
simply awaiting release.

916
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:42,327
If you sick and you swim in its waters,
it will take away all your sickness.

917
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:44,702
Oh, how very beautiful.

918
01:08:44,866 --> 01:08:48,063
Did you hear the one
about Goldilocks and the three bears?

919
01:08:48,226 --> 01:08:51,292
You don't care
what anybody believes, do you?

920
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:53,888
No.

921
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,510
You don't have an ear for faith.

922
01:08:56,674 --> 01:09:00,122
So naturally you will not allow
that throughout history...

923
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:04,284
... there have occurred innumerable
cases of instantaneous healing.

924
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,549
Diseased tissues rendered whole
in a flash of time.

925
01:09:10,243 --> 01:09:11,901
If I could continue with my point...

926
01:09:12,931 --> 01:09:14,458
The fine vibrations of the mind...

927
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:18,042
... can act on the lower vibrations
of diseased tissue.

928
01:09:20,099 --> 01:09:21,343
Would you like some water?

929
01:09:22,755 --> 01:09:26,333
- I'm starving. Do you have any food?
- No.

930
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:28,729
Thanks.

931
01:09:29,987 --> 01:09:33,816
The Navajo are very spiritual people.

932
01:09:33,987 --> 01:09:39,072
Excuse me, this spiritual master
just escaped from a California prison.

933
01:09:39,235 --> 01:09:41,210
I'm his hostage.

934
01:09:41,538 --> 01:09:45,499
How do you do?
I'm Michael Reynolds, Dr. Michael Reynolds.

935
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:51,166
I'm Renata Baumbauer,
Dr. Renata Baumbauer, Ph.D.

936
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:56,350
He gave me one month to live.
I had no choice, y'know what I'm saying?

937
01:09:56,515 --> 01:10:00,061
Is that true? Did you tell him
he only had one month to live?

938
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:04,185
Yes.

939
01:10:04,355 --> 01:10:07,170
The only thing worse
than a lawyer is a doctor.

940
01:10:07,459 --> 01:10:08,833
Nine hundred to Control.

941
01:10:08,995 --> 01:10:10,751
Nine hundred, go ahead.

942
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:14,777
Okay, Sector 8, there's no sign.
No sign, Sector 8.

943
01:10:17,539 --> 01:10:20,768
I bet you're a Leo.
Leo people tend to be bombastic.

944
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:21,979
Are you a Leo?

945
01:10:22,148 --> 01:10:26,141
I have an Uncle Leo, he's an atheist.

946
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,784
The man really breaks me up.
He don't cop to nothing.

947
01:10:30,947 --> 01:10:34,242
I hope you've been
very successful, doctor.

948
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:36,291
Because I am now
just about convinced...

949
01:10:36,452 --> 01:10:39,386
... that Western medicine will
forever regard symptoms of disease...

950
01:10:39,555 --> 01:10:43,745
... as simply errors to be corrected
by drugs and surgery.

951
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,274
- Well, I... - You doctors will never
do us any good...

952
01:10:46,435 --> 01:10:49,054
... until you wake up
and learn not to poison us.

953
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,456
Hey, don't look at me, man.
I didn't say nothing.

954
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:53,921
She gave you a lot of rope,
but she kicks the truth.

955
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:57,499
Yeah, well,
I've had just about enough of this bullshit.

956
01:10:57,668 --> 01:10:59,555
Cancer.

957
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:02,490
Excuse me?

958
01:11:03,524 --> 01:11:06,840
You are definitely a Leo, Cancer rising.

959
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,248
Leos look for
what they can get out of life.

960
01:11:09,411 --> 01:11:12,510
At war with your home-loving other self.

961
01:11:13,316 --> 01:11:17,025
Leos should wear rubies.
They bring serenity of mind.

962
01:11:17,187 --> 01:11:19,871
I'm a Sagittarius, the sign of philosophy.

963
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:24,250
Higher learning and broad concepts.
I wear turquoise.

964
01:11:25,092 --> 01:11:27,426
The doc's got a magic charm too.

965
01:11:27,587 --> 01:11:30,435
That ring, that fly little silver one.

966
01:11:30,596 --> 01:11:32,221
Yeah, he'd rather die than give it up.

967
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:34,908
You know, normally silver
relieves stress.

968
01:11:35,076 --> 01:11:37,596
And enhances emotional balance.

969
01:11:37,764 --> 01:11:41,855
Though perhaps in your case,
silver caused some toxic reaction.

970
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,312
Your state of mind is fucked up, man.

971
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,413
"There is nothing as important as DNA.

972
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:57,436
It carries the hereditary information
that determines the structure of proteins.

973
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:01,401
The only substance that directs cells
to grow and divide are encoded by it.

974
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:04,256
DNA. Deoxyribonucleic acid.

975
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:06,690
It is the essential constituent of life."

976
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:09,601
Watson and Crick,
The Double Helix, 1953.

977
01:12:09,764 --> 01:12:13,212
"All healing comes from
the divine within.

978
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:16,380
Absolute faith makes fear
and worry an impossibility."

979
01:12:16,548 --> 01:12:18,653
Edgar Cayce, 1943.

980
01:12:19,076 --> 01:12:20,734
It seem the rain will never let up

981
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,110
I try to keep my head up

982
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:23,869
And still keep from getting wet up

983
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:25,498
It's funny when it rain, it pours

984
01:12:25,668 --> 01:12:27,970
They got money for wars
But can't feed the poor

985
01:12:28,132 --> 01:12:30,303
Tupac, 1994.

986
01:12:47,717 --> 01:12:49,375
Come on, check it out.

987
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,363
- Car's clear.
- Okay.

988
01:12:51,524 --> 01:12:53,980
You. You, back a bit.

989
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:56,832
You two head up the road.
Check up there.

990
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:59,364
Don and DeLane, check that way.

991
01:12:59,525 --> 01:13:01,630
See if there's anybody over the ledge.

992
01:13:01,797 --> 01:13:03,619
What's in the car?

993
01:13:07,844 --> 01:13:10,114
He's got a battery cable.

994
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:47,901
Are you sure
this is where you wanna get off?

995
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:50,211
Not exactly my first choice.

996
01:13:51,141 --> 01:13:53,279
It's been memorable.

997
01:13:54,981 --> 01:13:56,257
Thank you very much.

998
01:13:56,421 --> 01:13:57,916
I mean it, you know.

999
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:00,257
The meaning behind your words is cool.

1000
01:14:05,253 --> 01:14:07,261
Forgive yourself, Dr. Reynolds.

1001
01:14:07,429 --> 01:14:08,411
For what?

1002
01:14:08,933 --> 01:14:11,453
For whatever it was
that closed your heart.

1003
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:15,451
And never go barefoot
to a snake-stomping.

1004
01:14:20,197 --> 01:14:21,986
Lunatic.

1005
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:26,948
Can we please slow down?
I have been bitten by a rattlesnake.

1006
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,479
Hello? This is Brandon Monroe.

1007
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:46,533
I'm in Flagstaff. I'm almost there.

1008
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:50,687
Everything's cool.

1009
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:53,407
I don't like the way you look.

1010
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:55,877
I never liked the way you look.

1011
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:57,445
No, I mean it. You don't look...

1012
01:14:57,606 --> 01:14:59,493
You look like hell.

1013
01:15:01,094 --> 01:15:03,745
It's about 50 miles
before we get to Shiprock country.

1014
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:05,633
No, you've got no miles left in you.

1015
01:15:05,798 --> 01:15:07,653
You have to let me
take you to a hospital.

1016
01:15:07,814 --> 01:15:09,603
And I mean now.

1017
01:15:11,686 --> 01:15:13,409
Fuck you.

1018
01:15:14,054 --> 01:15:15,548
The way you walk.

1019
01:15:15,718 --> 01:15:17,441
The way you talk.

1020
01:15:17,606 --> 01:15:20,126
The way you act.
The way you carry yourself.

1021
01:15:20,294 --> 01:15:22,367
You don't understand
a fucking word I say.

1022
01:15:22,534 --> 01:15:25,796
How can I? Half of what you say
sounds like it's in a foreign language.

1023
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:29,152
I don't need you anymore, anyway.
I can get there myself.

1024
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,656
The only place you're gonna get to
is in a fucking coma.

1025
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,229
I've been there already.

1026
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:38,811
You need to be in a hospital.

1027
01:15:38,982 --> 01:15:41,251
Don't yell.

1028
01:15:41,414 --> 01:15:43,007
That hurt.

1029
01:15:43,686 --> 01:15:45,213
So fuck off.

1030
01:15:45,382 --> 01:15:48,251
You need to be in a hospital.

1031
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:51,935
What the fuck's your problem?

1032
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:55,233
I got you down as gone.

1033
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:58,045
So why don't you get the fuck gone?

1034
01:16:03,047 --> 01:16:04,541
Go.

1035
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,877
Okay, I can go. I can go.

1036
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:17,348
I'm going, I'm going.

1037
01:16:18,055 --> 01:16:20,543
Oh, now I can go?

1038
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:24,229
Suddenly I have your permission?

1039
01:16:24,711 --> 01:16:27,264
After you've ruined my career.

1040
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:31,391
Put a gun on me for a thousand miles.
You nearly popped me and peeled me.

1041
01:16:31,558 --> 01:16:35,420
Now suddenly I can go?
Without even an apology?

1042
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,020
My apologies.

1043
01:16:37,191 --> 01:16:38,685
Fuck you.

1044
01:16:44,455 --> 01:16:48,164
You don't have to worry about your fever,
you're gonna kill yourself in this thing.

1045
01:16:48,327 --> 01:16:49,538
- See you around.
- Pull over.

1046
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:52,932
Let me drive this thing
before you kill yourself.

1047
01:16:53,638 --> 01:16:55,744
Somebody's stealing
Deacon Clay's Cadillac.

1048
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:02,081
Stop the goddamn car
and let me drive!

1049
01:17:03,143 --> 01:17:05,030
God, is that my car too?

1050
01:17:05,191 --> 01:17:08,191
Stop the goddamn car
and let me drive.

1051
01:17:26,529 --> 01:17:28,155
Are we here?

1052
01:17:28,322 --> 01:17:30,110
Yes, we're here.

1053
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,521
Hey, wait a minute.

1054
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:38,071
Flagstaff Medical Center.
I'm taking you into the emergency room.

1055
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:40,096
Fuck. I knew you were lying to me.

1056
01:17:40,257 --> 01:17:41,664
You have developed pneumonia.

1057
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:43,101
That is why you have a fever.

1058
01:17:43,265 --> 01:17:46,811
That is what I've been trying to tell you
about your lung infection.

1059
01:17:46,977 --> 01:17:48,384
Your white blood count is down.

1060
01:17:48,545 --> 01:17:52,025
If you do not get an immediate IV of
antibiotics, you'll slip into a coma...

1061
01:17:52,193 --> 01:17:55,008
... which you're never gonna come out of
and that's no bullshit.

1062
01:17:55,169 --> 01:17:57,722
No! No hospital.

1063
01:18:01,825 --> 01:18:04,542
If you don't get out of that car
right now...

1064
01:18:04,705 --> 01:18:07,258
... and I mean right now,
I'm gonna kill you myself.

1065
01:18:08,066 --> 01:18:10,335
Right on. Right on, then.

1066
01:18:10,498 --> 01:18:14,076
You know, Indians, they believe
sickness is payback for doing wrong.

1067
01:18:14,242 --> 01:18:15,387
Well, don't...

1068
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:17,342
I've done a lot of bad shit.

1069
01:18:17,505 --> 01:18:21,084
If I can't square it, if I can't get
there, I'm gonna peel my cap right now.

1070
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,810
No, don't do that.

1071
01:18:22,978 --> 01:18:25,214
You give me that
"your life depends on me" shit...

1072
01:18:25,377 --> 01:18:26,938
... I'll kill your ass with me.

1073
01:18:27,106 --> 01:18:28,251
Give me the gun, Blue.

1074
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:30,905
I feel sorry for you.
Maybe it's like Renata said.

1075
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:33,627
You don't believe in nothing
but yourself.

1076
01:18:35,618 --> 01:18:37,025
- Give me the gun.
- What's wrong?

1077
01:18:37,186 --> 01:18:39,259
You scared to watch somebody die?

1078
01:18:39,938 --> 01:18:41,247
Give me the gun, Blue.

1079
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:43,068
Why? You wanna do it for me?

1080
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:45,143
Give me the fucking gun!

1081
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:50,590
I'll be right back.

1082
01:18:50,754 --> 01:18:53,754
With the man, right?
You're gonna dime on me.

1083
01:18:53,922 --> 01:18:56,704
- You don't know anything about me.
- Yeah, I do.

1084
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:58,840
You never broke a law
in your whole life.

1085
01:19:01,986 --> 01:19:03,263
You have all the paperwork?

1086
01:19:03,426 --> 01:19:05,335
Yeah, I got it right here.

1087
01:19:43,202 --> 01:19:44,609
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

1088
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:50,913
I'm Dr. Newman from Gynecology.

1089
01:19:51,074 --> 01:19:52,962
Here to pick up
Progesterone suppositories.

1090
01:19:53,123 --> 01:19:56,571
I called them down this morning.
They should be in the refrigerator.

1091
01:19:56,738 --> 01:19:59,389
- Dr. Newman?
- Gynecology.

1092
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:01,689
I'll go check.

1093
01:20:01,859 --> 01:20:03,266
Thank you.

1094
01:20:13,154 --> 01:20:14,845
Where is it?

1095
01:20:28,227 --> 01:20:29,569
There it is.

1096
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:31,519
Okay.

1097
01:20:38,595 --> 01:20:40,897
Ceftazidime. Bingo.

1098
01:20:41,411 --> 01:20:42,785
Hey, what are you doing?

1099
01:20:43,363 --> 01:20:44,769
Nothing.

1100
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:52,062
I must be insane.

1101
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:54,457
Hold it right there.

1102
01:21:01,507 --> 01:21:03,198
Let's roll.

1103
01:21:05,571 --> 01:21:06,651
Damn.

1104
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:09,372
BLUE:
Keep your hands on the wheel and drive.

1105
01:21:31,523 --> 01:21:32,505
Get in.

1106
01:21:54,692 --> 01:21:56,066
You used the gun?

1107
01:21:57,956 --> 01:22:00,127
Only as a visual aid.

1108
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:02,179
I would've paid to see that.

1109
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:04,761
A straight white guy robbing a store.

1110
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,463
"JCR." Who is that?

1111
01:22:10,627 --> 01:22:12,667
It's my big brother.

1112
01:22:13,764 --> 01:22:14,843
Jimmy.

1113
01:22:15,652 --> 01:22:17,888
He ain't around no more.

1114
01:22:19,908 --> 01:22:22,843
You two were really down
for each other, huh?

1115
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:27,553
He was sick too.
He had a malignant tumor.

1116
01:22:27,716 --> 01:22:30,399
He was 11 when he was diagnosed.

1117
01:22:30,564 --> 01:22:35,103
My mother and I used to wheel him
to school in a wheelchair.

1118
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,714
I put studs in the tires.

1119
01:22:42,468 --> 01:22:46,941
He was tough just like you.

1120
01:22:47,108 --> 01:22:48,733
A fighter.

1121
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,267
I remember one time...

1122
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:56,097
... we went to Mexico for Thanksgiving.

1123
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:58,169
Acapulco.

1124
01:22:58,596 --> 01:23:03,779
And he was sunning himself on a raft,
you know, in the pool.

1125
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:07,453
Fuck you.

1126
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:10,274
Oh, no, that's a healthy "fuck you."

1127
01:23:10,437 --> 01:23:13,917
So he's out there sunning himself when
he had this sombrero over his face...

1128
01:23:14,084 --> 01:23:18,110
... and I don't know
what I was thinking.

1129
01:23:18,276 --> 01:23:22,553
I wanted to test the strength
of that sombrero.

1130
01:23:23,396 --> 01:23:28,579
So I got up on to the diving board
and jumped on it.

1131
01:23:33,413 --> 01:23:36,828
He came out of there,
he was mad as a hornet.

1132
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,547
Chased me for an hour.

1133
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:45,018
He was your age
when he went into the hospital full-time.

1134
01:23:45,924 --> 01:23:48,477
He hated that fucking place.

1135
01:23:51,268 --> 01:23:54,236
Yeah, it was cold, marble, sterile.

1136
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:57,568
He said it was a place
where you went to die.

1137
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:02,977
You're looking better already,
you know that?

1138
01:24:08,005 --> 01:24:10,012
And they gave him everything
for the pain...

1139
01:24:10,181 --> 01:24:14,687
... but nothing seemed to work.

1140
01:24:14,853 --> 01:24:16,741
Pain was unimaginable.

1141
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:19,748
I want you to do something for me.

1142
01:24:24,069 --> 01:24:29,251
I want you to turn off the machine.

1143
01:24:32,549 --> 01:24:33,531
No.

1144
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:34,814
- Don't be afraid.
- No.

1145
01:24:35,365 --> 01:24:37,504
No. No.

1146
01:24:37,669 --> 01:24:39,709
Don't be afraid.

1147
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:41,341
You know, I...

1148
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:43,451
Just do it.

1149
01:24:46,245 --> 01:24:50,271
At first, I couldn't do it,
and I told him so.

1150
01:24:50,437 --> 01:24:52,225
Mighty Mike.

1151
01:24:52,389 --> 01:24:54,178
But then, after a few minutes...

1152
01:24:54,341 --> 01:24:55,715
It's a trade, okay?

1153
01:24:58,533 --> 01:24:59,962
It's okay.

1154
01:25:02,117 --> 01:25:03,775
Okay.

1155
01:25:19,526 --> 01:25:24,315
And then I ran and I ran
and I ran and I ran and I ran.

1156
01:25:24,934 --> 01:25:27,781
You never talk personal on it before.

1157
01:25:35,494 --> 01:25:37,054
No.

1158
01:25:38,822 --> 01:25:40,862
I think we're stable.

1159
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:45,790
You think this heap will make it
all the way to Shiprock?

1160
01:25:47,846 --> 01:25:49,820
Jam it, holmes.

1161
01:26:01,414 --> 01:26:04,262
This is Cynthia Allison, reporting
live from Flagstaff, Arizona,

1162
01:26:04,422 --> 01:26:07,935
where there has been a startling new
twist in the Dr. Reynolds kidnapping.

1163
01:26:08,102 --> 01:26:10,076
Michael Reynolds,
appearing live and well...

1164
01:26:10,246 --> 01:26:12,450
I'm so glad you're here.

1165
01:26:12,614 --> 01:26:15,167
Witnesses say
he was armed with a handgun.

1166
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:17,189
All he said was, "Hold it right there."

1167
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:18,724
And I put my hands up.

1168
01:26:18,886 --> 01:26:21,952
Apparently, some antibiotics,
steroids, syringes...

1169
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:25,980
... and several dextrose-filled IV bags
were stolen from the pharmacy.

1170
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,972
Reynolds' wife, Victoria, could not be...

1171
01:26:28,134 --> 01:26:29,825
- That's Daddy.
- ... reached for comment.

1172
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:31,746
We'll be staying tight on this story.

1173
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:37,028
We haven't seen anything this strange
since Patty Hearst took up with the SLA.

1174
01:26:38,918 --> 01:26:40,347
I never liked Reynolds.

1175
01:26:40,519 --> 01:26:42,428
- You never...
- Since day one.

1176
01:26:54,407 --> 01:26:55,901
- Hello?
- Dr. Byrnes?

1177
01:26:56,583 --> 01:27:00,096
I have a collect call from Dr. Reynolds.
Will you accept the charges?

1178
01:27:00,262 --> 01:27:01,724
Don't talk, listen.

1179
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:05,536
I want you to tell Victoria
something for me.

1180
01:27:05,702 --> 01:27:07,874
- Chip.
- Michael, where the fuck are you?

1181
01:27:08,038 --> 01:27:10,559
Tell her I miss her and I love her
and I'll see her soon.

1182
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:12,767
And give my love to Callie.

1183
01:27:12,934 --> 01:27:14,757
And...

1184
01:27:14,919 --> 01:27:17,090
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1185
01:27:17,255 --> 01:27:18,782
See you.

1186
01:27:23,303 --> 01:27:26,532
You want me to call the medicine man?
Tell him we're on our way?

1187
01:27:27,655 --> 01:27:29,542
He knows.

1188
01:27:30,854 --> 01:27:32,348
He knows.

1189
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:50,172
Well, I'm sorry
that we had to stop you this morning...

1190
01:27:50,343 --> 01:27:51,903
... but we're looking for fugitives.

1191
01:27:52,071 --> 01:27:54,210
They might be in a white Cadillac.

1192
01:27:55,079 --> 01:27:57,501
We're in Navajo land, holmes.

1193
01:27:58,247 --> 01:28:00,189
Shit.

1194
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:02,814
Fuck. Son of a bitch.

1195
01:28:02,983 --> 01:28:05,187
More judas. We're fucked.

1196
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:10,655
What are you doing?

1197
01:28:11,367 --> 01:28:12,349
I don't know.

1198
01:28:20,647 --> 01:28:21,662
Is that a car?

1199
01:28:21,832 --> 01:28:24,166
Just some Indian boys
driving some horses.

1200
01:28:24,327 --> 01:28:27,971
Livestock or people,
it's always a battle.

1201
01:28:53,256 --> 01:28:54,663
Hi.

1202
01:28:55,528 --> 01:28:57,284
Nice horses.

1203
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:03,364
Just a little stomachache, holmes.

1204
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:09,796
Check me out, man.
My father was Mike Her Many Horses.

1205
01:29:20,072 --> 01:29:21,795
I got it.

1206
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:27,263
Excuse me, you on the tan horse.

1207
01:29:27,944 --> 01:29:32,417
Can we take car?

1208
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:35,104
Go down?

1209
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:37,981
- Down?
- What are you trying to say, man?

1210
01:29:56,296 --> 01:29:58,914
Whoo-hoo!

1211
01:30:16,968 --> 01:30:19,390
Hey, you drive pretty good
for a white man.

1212
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:21,666
This is young Reynolds' first year
at Daytona...

1213
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,418
... but we get the feeling
we'll be seeing more of him.

1214
01:30:24,584 --> 01:30:27,486
- You the man, doc.
- Whoo! Yeah.

1215
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:37,983
Mighty Mike.

1216
01:31:59,529 --> 01:32:01,733
What was that medicine man's name?

1217
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:03,206
Webster Skyhorse.

1218
01:32:03,369 --> 01:32:06,435
Webster Skyhorse.

1219
01:32:51,018 --> 01:32:52,741
Hello?

1220
01:32:54,826 --> 01:32:56,419
Hello?

1221
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:01,891
Hello?

1222
01:33:05,002 --> 01:33:07,336
Webster Skyhorse.

1223
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:13,794
You sure he's expecting you?

1224
01:33:13,962 --> 01:33:15,784
What did he say?

1225
01:33:16,586 --> 01:33:17,993
Nothing.

1226
01:33:19,882 --> 01:33:21,224
Nothing?

1227
01:33:23,434 --> 01:33:26,117
I don't understand.
You talked to him on the phone, right?

1228
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,401
I didn't talk to nobody.

1229
01:33:35,562 --> 01:33:37,766
You didn't talk to nobody.

1230
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:44,069
What do you mean, you didn't talk
to nobody? What about the medicine man?

1231
01:33:44,426 --> 01:33:46,531
Webster Skyhorse?

1232
01:33:47,883 --> 01:33:49,988
Guy who sent you the book?

1233
01:33:52,106 --> 01:33:57,638
Last time I saw him, I was 8 years old.

1234
01:33:59,626 --> 01:34:02,081
I never heard from him again.

1235
01:34:07,371 --> 01:34:08,614
You're joking, right?

1236
01:34:10,347 --> 01:34:12,135
No, man.

1237
01:34:14,218 --> 01:34:16,128
Everything's cool.

1238
01:34:20,043 --> 01:34:21,449
What about the sacred mountain?

1239
01:34:21,611 --> 01:34:24,774
The holy people? Wha...?

1240
01:34:25,803 --> 01:34:26,785
The lake?

1241
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:29,540
No white man
has ever believed in its magic.

1242
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:32,227
Sounds like a lot
of Indian woo-woo shit, don't it?

1243
01:34:33,707 --> 01:34:38,944
Right up there with rain dances
and talking coyotes.

1244
01:34:41,546 --> 01:34:43,718
Do you know where I got this book?

1245
01:34:47,914 --> 01:34:50,817
I stole it from the library in jail.

1246
01:34:50,987 --> 01:34:53,769
You white people donate
a lot of dumb shit at Christmas time...

1247
01:34:53,931 --> 01:34:55,305
You know what I'm saying?

1248
01:34:55,883 --> 01:34:57,192
But everything's still cool.

1249
01:35:08,427 --> 01:35:10,314
Everything's cool.

1250
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:14,053
Everything is cool.

1251
01:35:15,307 --> 01:35:17,478
You warped little fuck!

1252
01:35:17,643 --> 01:35:19,880
I knew you were a fake.

1253
01:35:29,227 --> 01:35:31,944
I'm a goddamn fugitive!

1254
01:35:33,132 --> 01:35:34,757
For what?

1255
01:35:36,235 --> 01:35:37,926
For what?

1256
01:35:39,211 --> 01:35:41,993
A lot of shuck and jive.
That's for what.

1257
01:36:03,628 --> 01:36:05,766
I gave up everything.

1258
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:11,463
My reputation, out the window.

1259
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:16,231
Director of Oncology,
out the fucking window.

1260
01:36:17,484 --> 01:36:18,793
Don't get all jacked up.

1261
01:36:18,956 --> 01:36:21,891
So don't tell me
it's just a lot of woo-woo shit.

1262
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:23,947
It can't be woo-woo shit.

1263
01:36:24,108 --> 01:36:27,142
We came here to find the sacred
mountain, and we're gonna find it.

1264
01:36:27,308 --> 01:36:28,322
I'm gonna find it.

1265
01:36:28,492 --> 01:36:30,150
You're nutting up on me, man.

1266
01:36:30,316 --> 01:36:32,039
Don't nut up on me, doc.

1267
01:36:48,716 --> 01:36:50,821
What are you doing here?

1268
01:36:51,116 --> 01:36:52,905
This is private property.

1269
01:36:53,068 --> 01:36:54,409
Can't be the IRS.

1270
01:36:55,084 --> 01:36:57,092
They drive Chryslers.

1271
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,242
Who are you?

1272
01:36:59,916 --> 01:37:01,290
Who are you?

1273
01:37:01,453 --> 01:37:02,794
I'm Michael Reynolds.

1274
01:37:02,956 --> 01:37:06,982
Dr. Michael Reynolds.
I'm an oncologist in Los Angeles.

1275
01:37:07,148 --> 01:37:08,196
This is my patient.

1276
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:10,666
They were talking about you
on Good Morning America.

1277
01:37:10,828 --> 01:37:12,170
Really?

1278
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:13,674
You have television?

1279
01:37:14,796 --> 01:37:17,643
No. I get Good Morning America
by smoke signal.

1280
01:37:18,636 --> 01:37:20,545
What are you doing out here?

1281
01:37:21,132 --> 01:37:25,027
We came to find the sacred mountain,
Dibe' Ni'tsaa.

1282
01:37:25,197 --> 01:37:27,684
Just show her the book.
Show her the book.

1283
01:37:27,852 --> 01:37:30,024
It's just a book he's showing you.

1284
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,250
Here's a picture of it. Check it out.

1285
01:37:50,924 --> 01:37:54,372
You're the one who keeps leaving messages
on my machine for my grandfather?

1286
01:37:54,541 --> 01:37:56,363
The medicine man, Webster Skyhorse?

1287
01:37:56,844 --> 01:37:57,826
That's right.

1288
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:03,817
That's great.
That's who we're here to see.

1289
01:38:03,981 --> 01:38:06,282
He can show us
where the sacred mountain is.

1290
01:38:06,445 --> 01:38:10,471
My grandfather may be a medicine man,
but he's also been a lot of other things.

1291
01:38:11,436 --> 01:38:14,153
Now he's playing hide-and-seek
with the IRS.

1292
01:38:14,316 --> 01:38:15,745
I just come by to feed his dog.

1293
01:38:15,917 --> 01:38:18,154
Happy trails, cowboys.

1294
01:38:20,941 --> 01:38:22,370
Listen to me.

1295
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:24,199
That boy is dying.

1296
01:38:24,365 --> 01:38:27,333
And he's dying the hard way.
Abdominal cancer.

1297
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:31,494
The only person who's meant a damn
to him in his short miserable life...

1298
01:38:31,661 --> 01:38:32,871
... is your grandfather.

1299
01:38:33,037 --> 01:38:35,459
That may be hard to believe,
but that is why he's here.

1300
01:38:35,629 --> 01:38:37,484
That is all he's got left.

1301
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:40,133
Who are you, his great white savior?

1302
01:38:40,301 --> 01:38:43,749
Federal boarding schools are full
of half-breed Indian boys just like him.

1303
01:38:44,141 --> 01:38:45,515
I work with them every day.

1304
01:38:45,677 --> 01:38:47,433
They're my people. Mine.

1305
01:38:47,597 --> 01:38:51,176
I've seen enough college-degree white
people like you to last me 10 lifetimes.

1306
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:53,314
So why don't you just leave?

1307
01:38:53,933 --> 01:38:55,875
Does that look like my car?

1308
01:38:56,429 --> 01:39:00,936
I traded in a brand-new
Porsche 911 Turbo for this.

1309
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:04,810
I've been beaten up,
bitten by a rattlesnake.

1310
01:39:05,838 --> 01:39:10,377
I've been humiliated
by some lunatic astrologer in a van.

1311
01:39:10,542 --> 01:39:12,997
I haven't shaved,
or brushed my teeth, or bathed...

1312
01:39:13,166 --> 01:39:15,751
... or changed my underwear
in three days.

1313
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:19,146
I have dirt in every pore of my body.

1314
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:26,150
You want us to leave,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

1315
01:39:26,317 --> 01:39:29,164
In fact, I would prefer it.
You'd be doing me a personal favor.

1316
01:39:29,326 --> 01:39:31,715
Go ahead. Here, shoot me.

1317
01:39:32,589 --> 01:39:34,051
Blue.

1318
01:39:36,494 --> 01:39:37,737
Blue.

1319
01:39:37,901 --> 01:39:39,724
Blue. Blue, come on.

1320
01:39:40,142 --> 01:39:42,149
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1321
01:39:42,318 --> 01:39:44,227
Blue. Come on.

1322
01:39:44,398 --> 01:39:45,707
Blue.

1323
01:39:45,869 --> 01:39:47,146
Come on, look at me.

1324
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:49,159
Look at me.

1325
01:39:49,613 --> 01:39:51,272
Here's some water.

1326
01:39:52,589 --> 01:39:53,604
Blue?

1327
01:39:53,774 --> 01:39:56,425
Come on. Come on. Come on, Blue.

1328
01:39:56,781 --> 01:39:57,796
Look at me.

1329
01:39:57,966 --> 01:39:59,754
Look at me. Come on.

1330
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:01,062
Blue.

1331
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:02,691
Blue.

1332
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:14,478
You scare me like that again,
I'll kill you.

1333
01:40:14,638 --> 01:40:17,191
Blah, blah, blah.

1334
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:28,102
We're almost there, Blue.

1335
01:40:35,822 --> 01:40:38,670
Take this road going north.

1336
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:41,318
It will become another dirt road,
and curve east.

1337
01:40:42,222 --> 01:40:45,288
At the point where three streams
become one...

1338
01:40:45,454 --> 01:40:47,364
... follow the west fork.

1339
01:40:48,398 --> 01:40:50,373
Lost Canyon Creek.

1340
01:40:51,343 --> 01:40:53,131
That is the way.

1341
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:57,892
Thank you.

1342
01:40:58,734 --> 01:41:00,141
Thank you.

1343
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:10,924
Dr. Reynolds?

1344
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:15,752
Dr. Reynolds.

1345
01:41:16,847 --> 01:41:19,781
For you,
there's probably nothing up there...

1346
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:23,944
... except a lot of rock,
and snow and grief.

1347
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:26,118
Very deep grief.

1348
01:41:27,055 --> 01:41:31,397
But to the Navajo Nation,
it is a dwelling place for the spirits.

1349
01:41:32,111 --> 01:41:35,493
The shapes the earth takes
to tell its stories.

1350
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:40,484
Don't go there
unless you're prepared to listen.

1351
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,669
My God.

1352
01:43:00,655 --> 01:43:03,557
I don't believe it. It's beautiful.

1353
01:43:22,096 --> 01:43:23,721
Nine-oh-two to Control.

1354
01:43:23,888 --> 01:43:26,409
We have a forest service report
of a possible sighting...

1355
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:28,517
... in the vicinity of Hesper's Peak.

1356
01:43:28,688 --> 01:43:32,682
Proceed there directly.
Report approaching Three Forks, over.

1357
01:43:32,848 --> 01:43:34,374
Ten-four.

1358
01:43:37,424 --> 01:43:39,082
Don't be afraid.

1359
01:43:39,248 --> 01:43:40,459
Just do it.

1360
01:43:40,624 --> 01:43:42,184
For me, Mikey.

1361
01:43:42,352 --> 01:43:43,334
Mighty Mike.

1362
01:43:43,504 --> 01:43:46,438
Come on. Come on, you can make it.

1363
01:43:49,872 --> 01:43:52,686
Come on. You can make it.

1364
01:43:54,896 --> 01:43:56,303
Come on.

1365
01:43:56,464 --> 01:43:58,853
Come on. Come on.

1366
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:00,398
Come on.

1367
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:02,728
Come on.

1368
01:44:02,897 --> 01:44:04,685
Come on, you can make it.

1369
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,730
Remember the lake.

1370
01:44:06,896 --> 01:44:09,863
We're almost there at the lake.
The magic lake, Blue.

1371
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,870
Nine-oh-two to 900.

1372
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,469
Nine-oh-two, go ahead.

1373
01:44:14,865 --> 01:44:17,767
We believe that the subject vehicle
is a white Caddy...

1374
01:44:17,936 --> 01:44:20,108
... parked south-southeast in Grid 3.

1375
01:44:20,273 --> 01:44:21,385
- Say again.
- Roger.

1376
01:44:21,552 --> 01:44:24,334
We believe that the subject vehicle
is a white Caddy...

1377
01:44:24,496 --> 01:44:27,496
... parked south-southeast in Grid 3.

1378
01:44:27,664 --> 01:44:30,599
- Nine hundred to control.
- Nine hundred, go ahead.

1379
01:44:30,768 --> 01:44:33,638
Sector 11, I've got tire tracks
in sight.

1380
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,085
Nine-oh-two to 900.

1381
01:44:35,248 --> 01:44:37,387
Nine-oh-two, go ahead.

1382
01:44:37,553 --> 01:44:38,567
Roger. I'm at your six.

1383
01:44:38,736 --> 01:44:42,249
About three miles back,
just coming up on Three Forks.

1384
01:44:43,728 --> 01:44:44,808
Nine hundred to Control.

1385
01:44:44,977 --> 01:44:48,075
I have the subject vehicle
in sight right now.

1386
01:45:24,113 --> 01:45:26,960
Come on. Come on.

1387
01:45:27,121 --> 01:45:28,528
I can do it myself.

1388
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:30,926
Let somebody help you
for once in your life.

1389
01:45:31,089 --> 01:45:32,398
Come on.

1390
01:45:39,281 --> 01:45:40,558
Nine hundred to Control.

1391
01:45:41,329 --> 01:45:44,198
- Nine hundred, go ahead.
- Ten-four. I've been through Grid 8.

1392
01:45:44,369 --> 01:45:47,598
Thought I saw a glimmer.
I'm gonna go back and have another look.

1393
01:46:23,954 --> 01:46:25,994
Where is it?

1394
01:46:27,186 --> 01:46:29,903
Where's the goddamn lake?

1395
01:46:35,538 --> 01:46:36,683
It's okay, man.

1396
01:46:37,906 --> 01:46:39,248
It's okay.

1397
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:41,679
No, it's not. It's not okay.

1398
01:46:45,138 --> 01:46:47,243
Oh, shit. What now?

1399
01:47:25,586 --> 01:47:27,408
What's he saying?

1400
01:47:28,146 --> 01:47:31,757
He's saying, "Thank you.
Thank you for bringing me here."

1401
01:47:31,922 --> 01:47:32,905
Sure.

1402
01:47:33,074 --> 01:47:34,700
Sure.

1403
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:36,940
It's no problem.

1404
01:47:37,426 --> 01:47:41,933
Does he believe in the lake?

1405
01:47:42,098 --> 01:47:45,414
Does he believe in the power
of its waters?

1406
01:47:45,586 --> 01:47:47,048
Now you got me talking like you.

1407
01:47:47,218 --> 01:47:48,745
White people...

1408
01:47:48,914 --> 01:47:52,143
... have never believed the power
of the Dibe' Ni'tsaa.

1409
01:47:52,306 --> 01:47:53,964
Yes, but what about the magic lake?

1410
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:55,952
Can it really do...?

1411
01:47:56,371 --> 01:47:58,989
Can it really do what they say?

1412
01:47:59,955 --> 01:48:02,093
Can it really do that?

1413
01:48:02,258 --> 01:48:04,363
What do you want most?

1414
01:48:04,946 --> 01:48:06,223
I want it to do what I can't.

1415
01:48:06,386 --> 01:48:07,946
I want it to...

1416
01:48:08,114 --> 01:48:10,602
I want you to help Blue.

1417
01:48:12,883 --> 01:48:14,344
He knows.

1418
01:48:14,515 --> 01:48:16,620
It's my time.

1419
01:48:16,979 --> 01:48:19,346
He's gonna take me now.

1420
01:48:19,698 --> 01:48:23,081
To drive the sickness out from me.

1421
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:24,999
Good.

1422
01:48:25,171 --> 01:48:27,407
That's real good, Blue. That's good.

1423
01:48:28,018 --> 01:48:30,058
That's real good.

1424
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:31,753
Let's go.

1425
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:33,329
Wait.

1426
01:48:34,163 --> 01:48:35,657
You can't come.

1427
01:48:37,587 --> 01:48:41,034
I mean, I don't want you to.

1428
01:48:43,763 --> 01:48:45,650
That's okay.

1429
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:49,160
Okay, you know, I'm okay with that.

1430
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:53,480
I should probably get back
before I see my face on a milk carton.

1431
01:48:54,707 --> 01:48:56,779
I guess this is goodbye.

1432
01:48:58,035 --> 01:48:59,409
Yeah.

1433
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:08,492
Thank you for saving my life, Blue.

1434
01:49:09,811 --> 01:49:12,266
It was no big deal, man.

1435
01:49:13,267 --> 01:49:15,634
A man's gotta do what he's gotta do.

1436
01:49:15,795 --> 01:49:17,257
Yeah.

1437
01:49:19,475 --> 01:49:21,264
It's been real.

1438
01:49:21,747 --> 01:49:23,536
You know what I'm saying?

1439
01:49:24,275 --> 01:49:26,446
You are real, man.

1440
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:43,722
Go.

1441
01:49:43,892 --> 01:49:45,582
Go. Get out of here.

1442
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,656
I got you down as gone.

1443
01:50:03,027 --> 01:50:04,456
Blue?

1444
01:50:06,068 --> 01:50:07,344
Catch.

1445
01:50:10,739 --> 01:50:11,983
It's yours.

1446
01:50:12,596 --> 01:50:15,247
You practically killed me for it.

1447
01:50:15,412 --> 01:50:17,354
Watch out for the Judas, man.

1448
01:50:23,796 --> 01:50:24,908
Blue.

1449
01:50:27,763 --> 01:50:28,745
Blue?

1450
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:30,290
Yeah?

1451
01:50:30,836 --> 01:50:32,429
We made it.

1452
01:52:10,005 --> 01:52:13,714
Nine hundred to Control,
I have the subject in sight.

1453
01:52:21,813 --> 01:52:23,307
Fuck!

1454
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:28,401
May beauty be before me

1455
01:52:28,565 --> 01:52:30,932
May beauty be behind me

1456
01:52:31,445 --> 01:52:33,780
May beauty be above me

1457
01:52:34,453 --> 01:52:37,006
May beauty be below me

1458
01:52:37,845 --> 01:52:40,812
May beauty be all around me
