SHIRIN

2
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:20,359
A film by
Abbas KIAROSTAMI

3
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:25,513
Based on "Khosrow and Shirin"
by Farrideh Golbou

4
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:30,159
Inspired by the work of
Hakim Nezami Ganjavi

5
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:36,404
Screenplay:
M. Rahmanian

6
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:24,042
Directed and Produced by:
Abbas Kiarostami

7
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,558
Listen to me, my sisters.

8
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:36,440
It's time for my story now

9
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:38,958
Right here,

10
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,198
by the lifeless body
of Khosrow,

11
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:50,675
a man who was your king and
my husband until yesterday,

12
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:56,796
Today, he found refuge
in death.

13
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,878
Look, my sisters,

14
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:03,276
how serene he seems.

15
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:08,843
As calm as the first time
I saw him.

16
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:13,238
I was seventeen
and the world was still young.

17
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:17,521
How many twilights have passed
since then?

18
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:21,759
How many springs turned
into autumns,

19
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:27,319
to bring us here, to this bloody sight,
my Khosrow.

20
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:32,881
See how your sweet Shirin
has become bitter?

21
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,681
O my husband,
it is not Shirin's fault,

22
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:40,724
if the world has become bitter.

23
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:22,278
This way, this way...

24
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,357
Come our way, Shirin!

25
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,561
This way!

26
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,762
You are trotting, Shirin!

27
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:34,713
Damn you!
But where are you?

28
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:38,719
Your eyes are blindfolded,
open up your ears!

29
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:42,878
Just follow our voices!

30
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,400
More to the right,
More to the left...

31
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,442
You are surrounded by flowers.

32
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:51,554
Choose one
and enjoy its nectar.

33
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,034
What is it?

34
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:00,594
A piece of wood.

35
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,718
Why is it here?

36
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:07,082
A gift brought by the winds perhaps!

37
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:09,679
There is an image engraved on it.

38
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:12,041
Show us.

39
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:16,400
What is it?

40
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,874
Nothing, nothing...

41
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,878
Is it for nothing that
you all sigh?

42
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:24,957
Take off my blindfold!

43
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,559
If you do that, you'll be defeated!

44
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,716
Take it off!

45
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,680
This defeat is worth
hundreds of victories.

46
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:45,393
It must be a portrait,
engraved by Mani.

47
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:47,521
Never mind the artist.

48
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,562
Whose face is it?

49
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,558
A prince perhaps... or an angel!

50
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:53,840
A spirit?

51
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,839
This much beauty
can't be human.

52
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,519
The traits might be of an angel,

53
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:03,916
but portrayed by a demon's hand.

54
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07,714
Portrait of an angel, work of a demon!

55
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:10,115
Leave the portrait, it is damned!

56
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,321
Damned?

57
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:13,999
Its bad omen will be
inflicted upon you.

58
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,120
Let us go!

59
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:17,481
Go? But where to?

60
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,523
It is not even noon,
the excursion is not over yet.

61
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:22,084
Let us leave this place.

62
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:25,239
This meadow is haunted
by the portrait.

63
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:28,078
Let's get back to the mountain
and its waterfalls.

64
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:06,765
Stop it!

65
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:09,155
I told you to stop it!

66
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,403
This portrait...

67
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,283
Here it comes again!

68
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:15,878
Where is it?

69
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,321
Near that rock,
immersed in the water.

70
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,158
Damn this beauty!

71
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,522
Let us pray
to get rid of this demon.

72
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:28,317
Who is he, anyway?

73
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:32,114
Robbing
my heart and my soul?

74
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,482
O Shirin,
Princess of Armenia,

75
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:38,557
why are you so enraptured by him,

76
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,364
you, desired by thousands?

77
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,834
Let us go back to the palace!

78
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,600
Right now!
The demons are after us.

79
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:39,883
Shirin, my niece
and my dear daughter.

80
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:45,161
More than a niece
and less than a daughter.

81
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,521
Another aphorism of yours?

82
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:49,596
Pardon, Your Majesty!

83
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:53,644
"My aunt" would be preferable,
you foolish girl.

84
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,682
You are a queen and I...

85
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,155
And you, my sole heiress.

86
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:02,524
Sooner or later,
you will be on my throne,

87
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,917
delighted by your accession
and grieved by my death.

88
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:10,601
Call me aunt,
as royalty is ephemeral

89
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:12,357
and blood ties eternal.

90
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,277
Why mention death?

91
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,164
Let us talk about joyful matters.

92
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,715
Your excursion was quite short.

93
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,274
I am tired, my aunt.

94
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:25,678
This horse is stubborn.
Riding it is exhausting.

95
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:29,441
Shabdiz longs for the plains,
while in the stable.

96
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:32,597
Ride him fearlessly
through the fields.

97
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,837
The sound of his trot
is the sweetest of melodies.

98
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:40,237
I am sleepy...

99
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:43,080
Right now, the sweetest of melodies

100
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:47,875
would be a lullaby
sung by a motherly voice.

101
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:31,876
What a nightmare!

102
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,956
What a grim nightmare!

103
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,638
What is it?

104
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:39,320
A lamp, a candle,
some light!

105
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,282
What is it?

106
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:44,038
What is wrong?

107
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:47,676
My Shirin?
Another nightmare?

108
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:50,435
My nightmares are neverending.

109
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:54,359
But this time, they follow me
through the day.

110
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,322
What is this?

111
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:59,955
The portrait
of a handsome man.

112
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,719
Why is it here?

113
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:06,434
I thought it to be one of your usual
acts of mischief.

114
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:10,644
I should be dammed if I knew anything
about this sinister portrait.

115
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:15,196
It might be the doing
of one of your friends.

116
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:18,402
But why?
To inflame my passion?

117
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,284
Inflame it?

118
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:24,519
At first sight I gave up
my heart to this longing.

119
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:27,563
What a bitter game for sweet Shirin.

120
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:30,683
But who is he, dear nanny?

121
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:32,962
You are feverish, my sweet.

122
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,355
You are burning with fever.

123
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,117
Who is he, dear nanny?

124
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,843
Who is he?

125
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,599
Tomorrow you will go to Mount Khazra.

126
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:43,915
There lives a magus.

127
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,964
He possesses all the secrets
of the world.

128
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,400
The secret of all secrets.

129
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:53,479
He will tell you.

130
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:55,394
My confidant...

131
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,238
Now, try to sleep.

132
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:01,036
Night is fading and dawn is coming.

133
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:07,239
At sunrise I will get Shabdiz
ready for you.

134
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,878
Sleep, my sweet, sleep.

135
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,764
A hard day lies ahead of you.

136
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:06,476
It took me a while to understand
that it was all a game,

137
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,920
a grotesque game.

138
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:13,762
The handsome portrait pursued me,
crept even into my chamber.

139
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:18,999
Changed hands and finally
ended up in hands of my confidant.

140
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,156
And that fake magus,

141
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:25,763
the impostor who manipulated
the strings of all the puppets.

142
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,434
Go to Tisfun, my child,
to the palace of Madaen.

143
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:23,560
Why there?

144
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:26,114
Aren't you looking
for the man in the portrait?

145
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:29,516
- But who is he?
- Khosrow, the prince of Persia.

146
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:33,314
- Khosrow?
- Who has fallen in love with you.

147
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:36,522
In love? With me? But...

148
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,678
In love.
There is no if or but, young lady.

149
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:43,280
How does he know me?

150
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:45,641
The same way you know him.

151
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:49,639
He saw a beautiful portrait
which was not the image of love,

152
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,035
but love personified.

153
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:56,443
- And you know all that?
- And more.

154
00:15:56,605 --> 00:16:01,520
Your horse, for instance,
is your aunt's,

155
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:05,645
Shabdiz, the greatest of all horses.

156
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:09,514
Then, omniscient man,
do help me,

157
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:13,565
as I don't have the heart to stay
or the courage to go.

158
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:17,035
Do as you're told: go to Tisfun.

159
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:20,118
Ride Shabdiz
and go full gallop to Madaen.

160
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:23,834
Your destiny awaits you.

161
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:52,754
I need to travel as light as the wind.

162
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,315
Farewell mirror and comb.

163
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:58,318
Farewell pendants and earrings.

164
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,921
Farewell trappings of finery.

165
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:04,756
Faster, Shabdiz, faster!

166
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:08,123
The magus told me
my destiny awaits me.

167
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:10,356
If only I could find a spring

168
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:14,201
to wash out the soil
of this tough journey.

169
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:23,678
O water... water...
embrace me,

170
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:27,236
caress me with your droplets,

171
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,476
hold me like a lover,

172
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:32,479
take my breath away.

173
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:38,881
O water,
I have such a thirst for you,

174
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:41,640
keep your thirst for me.

175
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:45,355
Immerse me in your kisses,

176
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,959
O water.

177
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,559
Who is there?

178
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:31,359
Who are you?

179
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:35,314
A stranger who like a thief,
spies on me at night?

180
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:46,838
Was it he?

181
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:51,318
Khosrow?
The prince of Persia?

182
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:54,444
What was he doing there?

183
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:00,959
O Destiny...

184
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:29,202
I was going to Tisfun
while he was going to Armenia.

185
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:36,514
What if my aunt, Queen of Armenia,
finds out about my departure?

186
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:02,161
Gone? Disappeared?
As if by magic?

187
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:06,717
With all the maids of honour
and the guards

188
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:10,515
who were supposed
to keep an eye on her?

189
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:15,521
She could get on Shabdiz
and disappear into the night?

190
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:18,644
Without anyone realising?

191
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:20,159
- My lady!
- Silence!

192
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:22,203
You are the guiltiest of them all.

193
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:27,959
Haunted by a nightmare or a dream,
she went to look for her beloved.

194
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,959
A young heart is not familiar
with loving.

195
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:34,402
Just a caprice
which comes and goes.

196
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:36,636
You were all sound asleep,

197
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,604
while she was planning
her sinister departure.

198
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,119
Madame...

199
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:44,994
Majesty...

200
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,361
Speak out. Any news of Shirin?

201
00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:49,676
An exhausted horseman is here.

202
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:52,519
He says he is a prince in disguise.

203
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,484
- What does he want?
- He is looking for Shirin.

204
00:21:57,086 --> 00:22:00,522
His name is Khosrow
and he requests an audience.

205
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,641
My lady...

206
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:05,640
If he is a prince,
let us treat him courteously.

207
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:09,321
So be it. Let us welcome him.

208
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,396
Here it is cold.

209
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:59,878
So cold that my hands and my face
are becoming numb.

210
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,243
But my man's body is still warm.

211
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:09,799
The man for whom I left my country

212
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:12,434
and adopted this warm land.

213
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:15,637
Do you hear me, my Khosrow?

214
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:17,398
For you...

215
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:21,879
...who anticipated my arrival,

216
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:25,004
who built this palace for me

217
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,726
and gathered all these servants
at my service.

218
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:30,878
But I was a mountain girl.

219
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:35,358
I asked your builders to construct me
a palace on the mountain sides.

220
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:19,036
What a sombre residence!

221
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:21,356
As sombre as its owner.

222
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:27,357
Is this message from Armenia,
from Mahin Banoo?

223
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:29,244
From Khosrow.

224
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:32,079
- What game are you playing?
- Game?

225
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:34,680
- I know you from before.
- Me?

226
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:37,599
Don't insult my intelligence
by denying it.

227
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:40,200
We have met before, haven't we?

228
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:42,845
Yes, Madame.

229
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:44,758
When and where?

230
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,914
Madame, I...

231
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,999
Once you pretended to be
an omniscient magus.

232
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,885
And today
you are Khosrow's messenger?

233
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,925
Back then, it was an act.

234
00:24:58,086 --> 00:25:00,361
Today I am being truthful.

235
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:04,678
I despise the truth that comes
from a charlatan like you.

236
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:10,364
Khosrow awaits you in Armenia,
in your aunt's palace.

237
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:14,121
Khosrow invited me to Tisfun
and fled to Armenia himself?

238
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:15,719
For what reason?

239
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:18,958
For affairs of state, Madame.

240
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:22,721
The state has its reasons
that even reason ignores.

241
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:28,721
What's my part in this play?

242
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:32,242
We were living happily,
singing songs amongst friends.

243
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,397
I abandoned my country

244
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,160
for the sake of a sweetheart,
who had already gone elsewhere.

245
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:42,559
The road to love is always
hazardous, Madame.

246
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:49,564
Be courageous! Shabdiz and I
look forward to the journey.

247
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,726
What if it's a new trick?

248
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,275
Another plot against me?

249
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:26,961
He's gone, my child.

250
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:29,196
Gone? But where?

251
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:33,119
The king, his father,
blinded and captured...

252
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:37,916
One of his generals greedy
for his throne.

253
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:43,718
And Khosrow must fight
for his father, for his throne,

254
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:45,797
for his kingdom,

255
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:48,196
but not for his love.

256
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:50,515
What would you do in his place?

257
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:57,844
I was born to be flung between one
bitter stratagem and another,

258
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:01,476
like an arrow in the hands
of a novice archer.

259
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:05,924
Shirin, don't ever
leave me alone again.

260
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:08,441
I am exhausted, my aunt.

261
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:13,479
I must sleep,
either to dream of Khosrow

262
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:15,602
or to have nightmares
about the war.

263
00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:07,597
Who are these men
around Bahram?

264
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:09,358
Your serfs, Majesty.

265
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:13,360
Ferocious fighters,
better than our indolent soldiers.

266
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:17,121
What was promised to them?
Paradise, treasure or power?

267
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:21,518
Deception is more effective
than the promise of paradise.

268
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:24,679
What should we do,
now that we are doomed?

269
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,202
- This war is hopeless.
- We can retreat from this defeat.

270
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:31,801
The main player
in this chess game is deception.

271
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:35,800
The pawns aspire to royalty.

272
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:39,675
The king should retreat to his fort.

273
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:42,804
Where to, Shapoor?
Escape to where?

274
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:47,517
First Azerbaijan, and then Moghan.

275
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,644
In the vicinity of Mahin and Shirin?

276
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:53,081
O the tricks of Destiny!

277
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:56,955
All we need is forty men.

278
00:29:57,126 --> 00:30:00,801
Let us go! It's never too late to fight.

279
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:42,440
I saw him.
At last I saw him.

280
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:45,244
Last night I dreamt of a knight

281
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:49,684
who had a branch instead of a head,

282
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:53,316
where a dove had made its nest.

283
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:57,035
Was it a dream or a nightmare?
I cannot tell.

284
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,878
I cannot tell.

285
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:40,198
I thought you were at the front,
fighting the fierce enemy.

286
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,675
Their arrows were not as piercing
as your gaze.

287
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:47,316
So you turned your back on the war,

288
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:49,716
defying the enemies in front

289
00:31:49,886 --> 00:31:52,354
and ignoring the ones behind you.

290
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:57,439
Shirin, I was afraid...

291
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:02,235
So you are here to exercise your wrath
on the young gazelles of this land.

292
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:06,243
I feared that
we would never meet.

293
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:11,356
The engraver of the portrait should be
punished for his lack of skill.

294
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:15,360
- Is that a compliment or an insult?
- You are tired.

295
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:18,324
I shouldn't keep you
any longer.

296
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,363
- Let us go.
- Where?

297
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,084
Do not fear, my lord.

298
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:27,240
It is a long road, but we will shorten it
with a few passionate stories.

299
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,794
- Run!
- Run? From what?

300
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:50,119
From him, his presence, his intimacy,
his constant entreaties.

301
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:53,722
From the look in his eyes,
where lies the demon called desire.

302
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:56,240
From the road to disgrace.

303
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:59,841
From the darkest destiny.

304
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:57,916
All this laughter, all that charm,
does it make people happy?

305
00:35:58,086 --> 00:36:01,601
Women and wine! A combination
that can't be matched, Majesty.

306
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:06,442
If we add the night to it,
it assures sensuality.

307
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:11,275
That sombre sensuality belongs
to the ignorant, not to lovers.

308
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:15,120
An endless solitude
for a short-lived encounter.

309
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:19,962
A pained expression
does not suit your lordship's face.

310
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:25,715
In such a night, the clouds and rain
have hidden the face of the moon,

311
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:28,319
What joy may there be?

312
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:31,875
Where is she, Shapoor?
Where is my moon?

313
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:36,722
She is glowing on the other side
of the garden, glowing in the dark.

314
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:39,763
Is she here?
Shirin is among us?

315
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:42,075
Look, my lord!

316
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:45,602
She is waiting
on the other side of the garden.

317
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:48,155
Sad and lonely.

318
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:00,238
Stay here.

319
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:28,725
You are alone,
a stranger to intimacy.

320
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:31,877
Khosrow in Armenia
and Shirin alone?

321
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,684
It's impossible, my lord.

322
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:38,078
The flames of passion uncover
the deepest desire of the lover.

323
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:42,126
Tell me more clearly.

324
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:45,756
Thirsty in the desert,
you pretend to be immersed in the sea.

325
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:49,395
Your smile is inviting
and your eyes discouraging.

326
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:51,841
What is the mystery of this game?

327
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:53,923
No mystery!

328
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:58,716
The king desires an intimate union,
for Shirin's body to warm his bed.

329
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,718
Water to quench his thirst.

330
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:06,322
But alas, it is quenched
at the cost of Shirin's virtue.

331
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,760
I am burning with love
and you evade me.

332
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:14,761
Your kingdom conquered by Bahram
and you languish with love in Armenia?

333
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,278
What can I do?

334
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:18,242
Your love
made me forget my throne.

335
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:22,762
And your heirs?
How would you answer them?

336
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,281
That your lust for Shirin,
deprived them of the throne?

337
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:27,798
Love not lust!

338
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:30,957
It's an excuse
for getting satisfaction.

339
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:35,438
But Shirin is a dam
that no deluge can overwhelm.

340
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:39,201
Iran, the 5000-year-old lady,
embraced Bahram

341
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:43,324
and squirms with pain and pleasure
beneath the thighs of his soldiers.

342
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:46,045
Why would the young
and the sweet resist?

343
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:09,917
Men are childish.

344
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:13,715
They break the toy
that does not give in to their game.

345
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:19,920
That night,
Khosrow left for Rome.

346
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:23,874
With the help of the Roman army,
he defeated Bahram

347
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,715
and married Maryam,
the daughter of the Roman emperor.

348
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:32,161
He won back his throne

349
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:37,844
and Shirin, already alone,
became lonelier.

350
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:33,756
My aunt! My dear aunt!

351
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,804
Calm down, little love bird!

352
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:40,718
You look pale and feverish.

353
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:44,719
What do the court physicians do,
beside sleeping and eating?

354
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:50,801
Stop being childish
and beware of death.

355
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:54,640
Why speak of death?

356
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:59,561
I had my blossoming spring,
I grew old in the autumn.

357
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:05,596
I now welcome the winter and the snow
that will cover my grave.

358
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:08,758
Haven't I suffered enough?

359
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:13,123
My heart can't afford
to be broken again,

360
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:17,404
nor my body to be abandoned.

361
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:24,244
It took me a long time on this earth
to understand that the joys of life

362
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:28,034
are like the caress of a feather
on the palm of your hand.

363
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:34,202
Pleasurable at first,
but a real torment if it endures.

364
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:40,521
I leave this earth

365
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:45,555
to people
who deserve a better life.

366
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:48,479
Bring the potion!

367
00:42:48,646 --> 00:42:50,477
Hurry!

368
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:54,439
It's too late, my child.

369
00:42:54,606 --> 00:43:01,159
Time flies and yet there are still
so many unexpressed thoughts.

370
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:04,204
Talk straight from your heart,
I'll understand

371
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:07,084
Do tell, I am listening.

372
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:12,878
I will bury my pain in my heart
and shed no tears.

373
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:20,316
I fear for your youth
which will end tonight.

374
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:22,794
At dawn

375
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:28,085
you will occupy the throne
and command this people.

376
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:35,598
This kingdom
was the apple of my eye,

377
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:41,955
and once my eyes are closed,
it will be yours to receive.

378
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:48,524
I cherished these people
as my own children.

379
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:53,524
Ensure that they have a better life.

380
00:43:53,686 --> 00:43:58,362
Let your subjects travel freely
and exempt them from paying taxes.

381
00:43:58,526 --> 00:44:02,758
Offer them a peaceful life,

382
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:09,956
so that the prey and the predator,
the sheep and the wolf,

383
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:14,005
drink from the same spring.

384
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:17,317
My sweet Shirin,

385
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:22,036
we destroyed this world.

386
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:27,953
It's yours to reconstruct.

387
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,356
Sleep, my aunt.

388
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:35,477
Today, with each drop of my tears,

389
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:40,674
I ask myself a thousand times,
where is my beloved.

390
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:45,515
But the day is almost over,
my suffering aunt.

391
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:49,078
I have no more tears left,

392
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:53,440
and the thought of Khosrow
is not as vivid.

393
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:57,281
And hard times are upon us.

394
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:53,603
Shirin...

395
00:46:08,526 --> 00:46:13,475
O my true God,
come to my aid.

396
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:18,804
Are you awake?

397
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:24,164
With all the love whispers,
how can I sleep?

398
00:46:25,405 --> 00:46:28,761
Love whispers?

399
00:46:28,925 --> 00:46:34,443
For years, we lost sleep
over the nightmare of Bahram.

400
00:46:34,606 --> 00:46:37,882
Now that he is burning in hell,

401
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:40,719
we have to endure
your sweet dreams of Shirin.

402
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,683
That is her name, isn't it?

403
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:48,123
A faraway love, and perhaps lost.

404
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:53,280
Lying with his spouse,
the king dreams of his lost love.

405
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:09,644
On a night like this, when angels
and demons reunite,

406
00:47:10,846 --> 00:47:13,076
has she any thoughts for me?

407
00:47:17,846 --> 00:47:20,644
I have no other thoughts.

408
00:47:20,806 --> 00:47:26,676
For years now, Shapoor,
my only joy is thinking of him.

409
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:28,837
That is why I summoned you.

410
00:47:29,006 --> 00:47:31,566
At your service, my lady.

411
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:35,196
The life of a queen is so dull.

412
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:39,597
They fall to their knees,
they worship you.

413
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:45,124
But you know that it's all
about their fascination with the throne.

414
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:50,599
In this despicable life,
only love can save you.

415
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:54,156
It is the same for the flame.
As long as it's burning...

416
00:47:54,326 --> 00:47:55,679
It's dead!

417
00:47:55,846 --> 00:47:57,916
That is another story.

418
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:02,762
The fire I talk about,
never dies as long as it's tended.

419
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:06,918
I am not a flame and there is no wind
blowing from anywhere.

420
00:48:07,086 --> 00:48:10,362
I speak of love, my lady.

421
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:14,758
Let it burn, for time is passing by

422
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,200
and the autumn of life awaits you.

423
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:21,404
Your words are hurtful
and quite bitter.

424
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:25,764
That is how the truth is.

425
00:48:25,925 --> 00:48:29,634
Let us go to Iran.

426
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:33,003
I leave Armenia to my heirs.

427
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:36,044
Love makes me lose my patience

428
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:39,243
and it fills me with strength
and courage.

429
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:41,282
We'll leave tonight.

430
00:48:41,445 --> 00:48:45,723
Guided by the full moon,
we will ride at full gallop,

431
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:50,401
Not straight towards love,
but to its neighbourhood

432
00:48:50,566 --> 00:48:55,117
where the same sun
would shine on both Khosrow and me.

433
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:24,037
- Is she in Iran?
- Yes, my lord.

434
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:27,964
In that sombre residence.

435
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:32,404
- She left her throne to come to Iran?
- As fast as possible!

436
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:34,716
Does she know about my marriage?

437
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:37,558
She received the news
with a bitter smile.

438
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:42,163
- What kind of madness is this?
- Love. That is the name for it.

439
00:50:42,326 --> 00:50:46,842
- I love her too, but...
- Men get warmed by love.

440
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:49,645
Women get burned.

441
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:53,765
They are the first victims
of that fire.

442
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,644
This love is not satisfied
with one victim only.

443
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:59,240
Bring her to me,
for us to burn together.

444
00:50:59,405 --> 00:51:00,360
Majesty...

445
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:02,835
Maryam should not learn about this.

446
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:06,760
A woman's jealousy
is as destructive as her love.

447
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:24,075
- No!
- No?

448
00:51:24,246 --> 00:51:27,477
Write it down!
For me to seal it.

449
00:51:27,646 --> 00:51:31,480
- Isn't it too short a letter?
- Short and sweet.

450
00:51:31,646 --> 00:51:35,195
Khosrow understands my heart
with fewer words.

451
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:37,162
Forgive my boldness,

452
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:43,276
but why leave the throne
for this sombre residence?

453
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:52,476
Today I discovered
my first grey hair.

454
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:56,798
It took me a lifetime to understand
that love was not an old rag

455
00:51:56,965 --> 00:51:59,638
with which to polish men's boots.

456
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:03,640
Khosrow choose Maryam
to make a political alliance.

457
00:52:03,806 --> 00:52:08,243
He seeks his loved one
to escape his solitude.

458
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:10,794
Write down that Shirin is a lover,

459
00:52:10,965 --> 00:52:15,117
not just a sweet presence
to save him from his lonely nights.

460
00:52:15,286 --> 00:52:19,040
- No, don't write that!
- What should I write then?

461
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,317
Write... No, that's enough.

462
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:50,154
- Are you Farhad?
- Which Farhad?

463
00:52:50,326 --> 00:52:52,999
How many live in this dreary place?

464
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:56,158
The one I know
is a master of geometry.

465
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:58,556
He knows all about
Euclid and Almagest.

466
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:03,197
I am one of his disciples
and I can take a message for him.

467
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:05,196
There is a palace
at the foothill of Bistun.

468
00:53:05,365 --> 00:53:07,481
The lady of the house requested
his presence.

469
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:10,877
Each evening master Farhad
inspects his apprentice's work...

470
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:14,721
Evening? Too late!
The lady cannot wait.

471
00:53:14,885 --> 00:53:17,160
Tell him to hurry!

472
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:21,956
- I forgot! Where should he go?
- To the palace of Shirin.

473
00:53:57,126 --> 00:54:00,482
I am so grateful for your presence.

474
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:06,562
Your school fellow, Shapoor,
praised your many talents.

475
00:54:07,646 --> 00:54:11,480
From geometry to drawing...

476
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:15,275
- Please, sit down.
- My lady...

477
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:18,755
I can see that you are skilful
and well built.

478
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:23,316
Your hands show
traces of hard labour.

479
00:54:23,485 --> 00:54:26,397
- Why are they shaking?
- My whole body trembles.

480
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:31,321
Maybe you guessed the arduous task
Shirin wants to entrust you with?

481
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:36,355
Shirin has been deprived of milk
in her palace.

482
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:42,761
The meadows are far away
and the roads bumpy.

483
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:44,358
Nothing is to our taste:

484
00:54:44,526 --> 00:54:47,882
neither the sweets
made for our pleasure,

485
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:51,118
nor the delicacy of the meat.

486
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:52,719
Master!

487
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:57,119
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, Madame.

488
00:54:57,286 --> 00:55:00,084
You were talking about milk
and sweet Shirin...

489
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:05,435
What is it, master?
You look so pale!

490
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:10,240
He fainted!

491
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:12,965
We are losing him! Master Farhad!

492
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:17,119
Bring some water, a potion,
the incense - just hurry!

493
00:55:17,286 --> 00:55:20,881
He is shaking,
his eyes glazing over.

494
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:24,038
- Call the physician!
- Wait!

495
00:55:24,206 --> 00:55:27,278
He is calming down,
his eyes are heavy.

496
00:55:27,445 --> 00:55:28,878
What happened to the water?

497
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:31,560
Here it is.
Shall we spray it on his face?

498
00:55:35,286 --> 00:55:37,959
His eyes, Madame...

499
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,838
Thank God.

500
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:46,285
Master, are you awake?
Can you see me?

501
00:56:14,846 --> 00:56:20,955
How to forget that gaze,
virtuous, tender, and soft?

502
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:25,838
Don't blame me,
if by the side of Khosrow's dead body,

503
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:29,715
I am remembering
the loving gaze of Farhad.

504
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:31,398
It's not my fault,

505
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:34,478
but the fault of this world,
cruel to lovers,

506
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:39,640
and which endowed Farhad
with that gaze and not anyone else,

507
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:41,956
not even Khosrow.

508
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,275
- Farhad? Which Farhad?
- The stone carver.

509
00:57:10,445 --> 00:57:13,676
My friend and my schoolfellow.

510
00:57:13,846 --> 00:57:18,476
In China he studied geometry
and I chose the pen.

511
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:22,764
He chose the order of art and science.

512
00:57:22,925 --> 00:57:27,282
To enter the court,
I bowed and submitted to the kings.

513
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,039
Such men are inclined
towards rebellion.

514
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:33,323
Why is he submitting to love now?

515
00:57:33,485 --> 00:57:36,955
Love and rebellion,
two sides of the same coin.

516
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:41,836
Disappointed by one,
they turn to the other.

517
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:45,237
Hence, before people make
another Bahram of him,

518
00:57:45,405 --> 00:57:47,714
- bring him to me.
- Your Majesty...

519
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:51,673
The stone carver
is interfering with our love.

520
00:57:51,846 --> 00:57:54,314
Either he is daring,
or the king has weakened?

521
00:57:54,485 --> 00:57:57,522
I need to look straight
into his eyes.

522
00:57:57,686 --> 00:58:01,076
Inform the stone carver that
Mount Damavand awaits him.

523
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:33,400
My governess used to tell
me the story of a sculptor

524
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:36,524
whose hands got cut off
for disobedience

525
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:39,246
and then he started sculpting
with his feet.

526
00:58:39,405 --> 00:58:44,399
But it would be a pity to cut off
your hands and feed them to the dogs.

527
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:48,798
- The hands of a sculptor...
- The hands of a stone carver...

528
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:51,479
The hands of a lover, I must say!

529
00:58:53,326 --> 00:58:54,805
Isn't that so?

530
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,923
Those mountains were carved
by love and not by your hands!

531
00:58:58,086 --> 00:59:01,761
My hands obey my heart,
and my heart obeys Shirin.

532
00:59:01,925 --> 00:59:03,677
Oh yes! Shirin!

533
00:59:03,846 --> 00:59:08,044
People are telling stories about
your love for the Armenian princess.

534
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:10,925
Those are not stories, my king.

535
00:59:11,086 --> 00:59:14,283
She is etched onto my heart
and I long for her.

536
00:59:14,445 --> 00:59:16,675
Are you talking about love
or engraving?

537
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:20,156
Boasting about a scratched heart?
Love deserves better.

538
00:59:20,326 --> 00:59:24,319
The king talks about the heart
but I am talking about my soul.

539
00:59:24,485 --> 00:59:27,795
- Talk about Shirin's love!
- It's sweeter than love.

540
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:33,278
- A love without support or refuge?
- My eye will be its refuge.

541
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,197
What if she fills it
with tears and blood?

542
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:37,435
I will offer her the other one.

543
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:41,485
- What if she asks for more?
- I will implore the gods for it.

544
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:44,206
If you had a more peaceful life
you wouldn't be so extreme.

545
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:46,276
I've no desire for easy living.

546
00:59:46,445 --> 00:59:50,074
- An unfortunate plight.
- Love is a sweet struggle.

547
00:59:50,246 --> 00:59:51,679
Learn to be patient then!

548
00:59:51,846 --> 00:59:56,203
How can I be patient with a broken heart?
Impossible!

549
00:59:56,365 --> 01:00:00,597
- Stop this game!
- The game of love, my king?

550
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:05,282
- Is there an end to it?
- Another impossible demand!

551
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:09,996
- Still blinded by love?
- Till death fills my eyes.

552
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:12,282
It's a hopeless love.
Abandon it!

553
01:00:12,445 --> 01:00:14,515
Love does not abandon me!

554
01:00:14,686 --> 01:00:16,438
Are you aware of my love for her?

555
01:00:16,606 --> 01:00:20,440
The king's love does not
surprise me.

556
01:00:20,606 --> 01:00:24,394
I am surprised that the entire
world is not in love with her.

557
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:31,005
- What an obstinate heart!
- My heart is not mine anymore.

558
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,724
One last question.

559
01:00:32,885 --> 01:00:36,036
What would you do
if I were to look at her body?

560
01:00:36,206 --> 01:00:39,437
Again and again?

561
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:43,838
The king's gaze
would make me sigh

562
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:48,716
and with that sigh,
I could burn the whole world.

563
01:01:41,006 --> 01:01:44,601
All the sky has to offer

564
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:47,803
is love.

565
01:01:49,846 --> 01:01:53,839
The earth would be a desert

566
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,759
without the rain of love.

567
01:01:57,766 --> 01:02:01,998
A loveless soul

568
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,119
is a dead flower.

569
01:02:07,485 --> 01:02:13,117
Even with a hundred lives,
without love,

570
01:02:13,286 --> 01:02:15,242
it would be dead.

571
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:19,283
The flame of love

572
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:23,802
is the best gift of this world.

573
01:02:24,965 --> 01:02:27,559
Without love,

574
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:30,600
flowers wouldn't laugh

575
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:35,514
and clouds wouldn't cry.

576
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:35,163
What is this perfume
coming from the mountains?

577
01:03:35,326 --> 01:03:39,365
Who is this rider,
hair flowing through the wind?

578
01:03:39,526 --> 01:03:41,482
My God!

579
01:03:41,646 --> 01:03:44,956
Are my dreams becoming reality?

580
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:12,877
- Farhad...
- Madame.

581
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:15,196
I am here to see you.

582
01:04:15,365 --> 01:04:17,925
To see your strong arm

583
01:04:18,086 --> 01:04:22,557
fighting rough stone
and cold steel.

584
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:27,754
By the grace of your presence,
the steel is warmer than my heart,

585
01:04:27,925 --> 01:04:31,042
and the stone
softer than the clay.

586
01:04:31,206 --> 01:04:35,279
Isn't this my portrait looking back at me
as if it were my reflection in a mirror?

587
01:04:36,646 --> 01:04:41,037
How could you remember me
in such detail after a single encounter?

588
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:43,925
My eyes are not guilty
of this insolence.

589
01:04:44,086 --> 01:04:47,123
Your face is engraved
on my heart.

590
01:04:47,286 --> 01:04:49,641
It's too hot.

591
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:52,923
How can you work
under this blazing sun?

592
01:04:53,086 --> 01:04:54,804
Are you feeling dizzy?

593
01:04:58,286 --> 01:05:00,242
My horse feels worse than me.

594
01:05:00,405 --> 01:05:05,763
Stay on the saddle
and don't let go of the reins.

595
01:05:05,925 --> 01:05:08,803
I brought you milk.

596
01:05:08,965 --> 01:05:11,957
If only this horse would stay calm...

597
01:05:14,326 --> 01:05:16,681
Shirin or the milk...

598
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:20,600
For which one of these benedictions
should I be more grateful?

599
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:22,199
Drink, Farhad.

600
01:05:22,365 --> 01:05:26,074
The cold milk
tends to your burning heart.

601
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:33,405
Let my heart burn endlessly,

602
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:37,479
hoping for a droplet of water,
dripping from my lady's finger.

603
01:05:39,286 --> 01:05:42,198
Calm down, my horse,
don't be agitated.

604
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:44,321
It is not a good time to rebel.

605
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:49,354
He is not agitated, my lady.
He is offering his life to his rider.

606
01:05:49,526 --> 01:05:51,084
Help me, Farhad.

607
01:05:51,246 --> 01:05:55,239
Soon, I will be rolling in my blood
through the stones.

608
01:05:55,405 --> 01:05:57,077
Have no fear.

609
01:05:57,246 --> 01:06:01,842
The horse and the rider
can now relax on my shoulders.

610
01:06:03,646 --> 01:06:06,444
The horse and the rider
on your shoulders?

611
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:08,955
I must be dreaming.

612
01:06:09,126 --> 01:06:12,038
It is you who appeared in my dream.

613
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:17,883
You came to transform
a nightmare into a sweet dream.

614
01:06:18,046 --> 01:06:20,799
Have no fear, Shirin.

615
01:06:20,965 --> 01:06:24,674
You stay on your horse,
on my shoulders

616
01:06:24,846 --> 01:06:26,996
and I will take you to your residence.

617
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:32,638
Stay on your saddle,
as without the strength of your name,

618
01:06:32,806 --> 01:06:36,082
Bistun is nothing more than a ruin
worthy of owls.

619
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:39,640
Your name is endangering our glory,
Farhad.

620
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:44,322
You made of geometry an art admired
by all, and I didn't say anything.

621
01:07:44,486 --> 01:07:46,477
You fell in love with the love of my life,

622
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,877
your song was chanted by all
and I didn't say anything.

623
01:07:50,045 --> 01:07:53,515
You were wandering around
singing your love for Shirin,

624
01:07:53,686 --> 01:07:58,043
your voice filled the plains and the
mountains and I didn't say anything.

625
01:07:58,205 --> 01:08:02,403
You got on your knees in front of me,
King of Persia, Khosrow Parviz,

626
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:07,321
but praised her,
and I didn't say anything.

627
01:08:07,486 --> 01:08:11,035
But what is this new feat?

628
01:08:11,205 --> 01:08:14,163
Taking Shirin
and her horse on your shoulders

629
01:08:14,326 --> 01:08:17,363
wandering around town and
leaving the passers-by astonished?

630
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:19,038
I have to wash away this disgrace.

631
01:08:19,205 --> 01:08:25,644
Khosrow will save his honour
in the fairest way.

632
01:08:25,805 --> 01:08:29,081
It's a battle
between my heart and your chisel.

633
01:08:29,245 --> 01:08:33,557
Throw your chisel, as my heart
is tough enough to bend it,

634
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:36,835
in the fairest way.

635
01:08:37,005 --> 01:08:41,044
It's not a battle between a king
and his subject, but between lovers.

636
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:44,038
One will live and one will perish.

637
01:08:44,205 --> 01:08:46,196
The one who wins

638
01:08:46,365 --> 01:08:49,641
is the cruel-hearted one
who wears the tough armour of rancour

639
01:08:49,805 --> 01:08:53,275
and wields the bitter sword
of vengeance!

640
01:10:35,605 --> 01:10:39,154
<i>I am lost from within</i>

641
01:10:39,326 --> 01:10:43,285
<i>And from my own eyes</i>

642
01:10:43,445 --> 01:10:48,519
<i>I disappeared</i>

643
01:10:50,805 --> 01:10:57,324
<i>Like spindrift</i>

644
01:10:57,485 --> 01:11:03,674
<i>I melted in the sea</i>

645
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:09,235
<i>I was a shadow</i>

646
01:11:09,405 --> 01:11:12,363
<i>At the beginning</i>

647
01:11:12,525 --> 01:11:17,883
<i>Lying down on the ground</i>

648
01:11:19,445 --> 01:11:24,678
<i>As soon as the sun</i>

649
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:29,396
<i>Appeared</i>

650
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:35,435
<i>I disappeared</i>

651
01:11:57,925 --> 01:11:59,802
That's a beautiful song.

652
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:02,001
I don't know if it's beautiful,

653
01:12:02,165 --> 01:12:04,998
but if this breath couldn't
turn into a chant,

654
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:07,633
it would have consumed me.

655
01:12:07,805 --> 01:12:13,038
Without these songs,
the world would be a living hell!

656
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:16,834
You look like a mountain boy!

657
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:22,125
- But you can't be from Zagros.
- I am from Ararat, in Armenia.

658
01:12:22,286 --> 01:12:24,356
From so far away?

659
01:12:24,525 --> 01:12:29,315
I am here to mourn
the great lady of Armenia.

660
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:32,875
A lady from Armenia?

661
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:36,799
She renounced the throne,
searching for a hopeless love.

662
01:12:36,965 --> 01:12:41,561
Alas, Iran did not
offer her a wedding, but a funeral.

663
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:45,274
Who are you talking about?

664
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:48,755
Why are you moved by
the death of a complete stranger?

665
01:12:48,925 --> 01:12:51,200
Just tell me the name of the stranger.

666
01:12:51,365 --> 01:12:56,234
To me, it would sound sweeter than
the name of many intimate friends.

667
01:12:56,405 --> 01:13:00,842
Shirin, the lady of Armenia,
died in her bloom.

668
01:13:03,765 --> 01:13:07,917
Call me from the depth
of darkness.

669
01:13:08,085 --> 01:13:13,034
Shirin!
My sweet!

670
01:13:13,205 --> 01:13:16,754
How could I bear
the bitterness of this existence

671
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:20,235
without you, my Shirin?

672
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:33,555
Take my stone-carving hand
and lead me.

673
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:08,555
Damn this game of men
that we call love!

674
01:14:08,725 --> 01:14:13,241
They buried your innocence,
and your lonely soul.

675
01:14:14,286 --> 01:14:18,245
With you, Shirin was buried too.

676
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:22,393
You cracked open the soil
with your chisel

677
01:14:22,565 --> 01:14:28,834
and a tree burst out, bearing fruit
that was a panacea for lovers.

678
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:31,755
But what am I saying, Farhad?

679
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,723
With you, all lovers died.

680
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:03,438
Years passed by,
we became old,

681
01:17:03,605 --> 01:17:06,244
children grew up,

682
01:17:06,405 --> 01:17:10,557
our intimates
died one after the other.

683
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:14,124
Farhad is dead,

684
01:17:14,286 --> 01:17:17,437
Maryam is dead,

685
01:17:17,605 --> 01:17:20,961
Shirouyeh, son of Khosrow,
has grown up.

686
01:17:21,565 --> 01:17:23,840
And Shirin

687
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:28,442
who had waited
for so many years, all alone,

688
01:17:28,605 --> 01:17:35,363
finally took the warm hands
of Khosrow into her hands.

689
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:41,122
After waiting so long,
finally the days of longing were over.

690
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,994
We have waited so long
for this embrace, my sweet.

691
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:26,555
I am fearful, Khosrow.

692
01:18:26,725 --> 01:18:30,320
Why are you fearful,
in this serene, voluptuous night?

693
01:18:30,485 --> 01:18:33,477
I fear that this embrace
may turn out to be a dream.

694
01:18:33,645 --> 01:18:36,842
Like all the dreams we had
throughout the years

695
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:41,476
which, on waking,
would turn into horrible nightmares.

696
01:18:41,645 --> 01:18:46,161
I overcame thousands
of perilous obstacles to reach you.

697
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:51,605
I had to use thousands of schemes
to get to the only object of my desire.

698
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:57,241
O my Shirin,
queen of all fairy tales...

699
01:18:57,405 --> 01:18:59,316
I am fearful, Khosrow.

700
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:04,036
I fear that this joy won't last.

701
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:06,594
The earth is turning for us

702
01:19:06,765 --> 01:19:10,838
and even the inhabitants
of paradise envy us.

703
01:19:11,005 --> 01:19:14,634
- And your son, Shirouyeh?
- Shirouyeh?

704
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:17,239
One can see a demon
in his eyes.

705
01:19:17,405 --> 01:19:19,157
He is so young.

706
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:23,160
His eyes are filled
with rancour and hatred.

707
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:26,398
He is just a child, my sweet.

708
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:29,363
A child with much ambition.

709
01:19:29,525 --> 01:19:32,164
Not least to sit on your throne.

710
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:34,840
His brothers are more worthy.

711
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:38,202
I fear for them too.

712
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:39,434
Shirin!

713
01:19:39,605 --> 01:19:44,884
I swear to God that your fear
is the fruit of your imagination.

714
01:19:45,045 --> 01:19:47,320
I am tormented, Khosrow.

715
01:19:47,485 --> 01:19:50,955
Fear and anxiety do not leave me.

716
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,638
You should leave them.

717
01:19:52,805 --> 01:19:56,718
Yield to me,
to this night of union,

718
01:19:56,885 --> 01:20:00,434
to the stars that are shining for us

719
01:20:00,605 --> 01:20:03,677
and to this full moon,
with its bridal look.

720
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:22,201
One night, this child,
this youngster,

721
01:20:22,365 --> 01:20:26,438
exchanged his childhood
for power.

722
01:20:27,445 --> 01:20:30,437
He cut off the hands and feet
of his brothers

723
01:20:30,605 --> 01:20:34,757
and imprisoned his father.

724
01:20:34,925 --> 01:20:37,439
But you my sisters,

725
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:40,324
you know the story
better than I do.

726
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:44,524
Here is another manly game.

727
01:21:13,525 --> 01:21:15,243
Shirin...

728
01:21:18,326 --> 01:21:19,805
Khosrow!

729
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:25,836
Who's calling me?

730
01:21:26,005 --> 01:21:30,203
Be calm, my love.
It's me, Shirin.

731
01:21:31,245 --> 01:21:33,520
I cannot see you, my sweet.

732
01:21:35,445 --> 01:21:36,798
My eyes...

733
01:21:36,965 --> 01:21:39,877
You won't need them,
in this darkness.

734
01:21:40,045 --> 01:21:42,798
Here are my hands, my hair.

735
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:45,320
My heart, can you hear it?

736
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:48,875
It beats for you.

737
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:52,435
I spoke of serene voluptuousness
in the arms of my beloved,

738
01:21:52,605 --> 01:21:55,278
forgetting about the bell

739
01:21:55,445 --> 01:21:58,243
which tolls the end
of our ephemeral happiness.

740
01:21:58,405 --> 01:22:00,680
Be calm, my love.

741
01:22:00,845 --> 01:22:05,521
The hour is cruel, but I cherish the fact
that you are alive.

742
01:22:05,685 --> 01:22:08,802
I will share your last breath.

743
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,159
Don't leave me.

744
01:22:10,326 --> 01:22:12,362
Neither chains nor prison could kill me -

745
01:22:12,525 --> 01:22:15,085
your absence is fatal to me.

746
01:22:15,245 --> 01:22:16,997
Be calm and sleep,

747
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:20,521
like an exhausted tide
which rests on the sand.

748
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:22,164
Sleep.

749
01:22:22,326 --> 01:22:25,841
I won't leave you.

750
01:22:26,005 --> 01:22:27,916
Sleep.

751
01:22:33,845 --> 01:22:37,394
It was the last time
I ever slept.

752
01:23:31,805 --> 01:23:35,480
- Hit him harder!
- Once and for all!

753
01:23:35,645 --> 01:23:38,318
- Let's get it over with!
- It's done!

754
01:24:06,405 --> 01:24:08,714
And here we are,

755
01:24:08,885 --> 01:24:11,524
Khosrow and I,

756
01:24:11,685 --> 01:24:14,643
and you, my grieving sisters.

757
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:20,281
You look at his dead body
and you cry.

758
01:24:20,445 --> 01:24:24,563
You listen to my story
and you cry.

759
01:24:24,725 --> 01:24:30,561
Through these tears,
I see your eyes.

760
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:36,235
Are you shedding these tears
for me, Shirin?

761
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:41,274
Or for the Shirin
that hides in each one of you?

762
01:24:42,685 --> 01:24:47,998
Shirin who, through her life, received
neither any favour nor any attention.

763
01:24:49,485 --> 01:24:54,161
She was in love,
a love that was never returned.

764
01:24:55,165 --> 01:25:00,842
She was lonely
and no one believed her loneliness.

765
01:25:01,005 --> 01:25:07,717
Upon her death only,
they would remember the young girl

766
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:11,434
In love with games,
rain and sunshine,

767
01:25:11,605 --> 01:25:15,484
a rainbow in her eyes

768
01:25:15,645 --> 01:25:20,082
and tears of seven colours
falling on her cheeks.

769
01:25:23,965 --> 01:25:26,160
Ah, I am tired,

770
01:25:26,805 --> 01:25:30,036
so tired, my sad sisters.

771
01:25:31,005 --> 01:25:34,236
Only a dagger,

772
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:39,433
a small dagger
could relieve me from

773
01:25:39,605 --> 01:25:42,881
these many years of exhaustion.

774
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:53,755
<i>I am lost from within</i>

775
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:59,597
<i>And from my own eyes</i>

776
01:25:59,765 --> 01:26:03,724
<i>I disappeared</i>

777
01:26:07,845 --> 01:26:12,441
<i>Like spindrift</i>

778
01:26:14,645 --> 01:26:21,323
<i>I melted in the sea</i>

779
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:26,321
<i>I was a shadow</i>

780
01:26:26,485 --> 01:26:29,716
<i>At the beginning</i>

781
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:34,754
<i>Lying down on the ground...</i>
