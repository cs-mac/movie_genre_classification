1
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:05,208
- Hello.
- Blair, I'd like to speak with my wife.

2
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:09,754
-Oh, Barney, it's 3:00 in the morning.
-Put my wife on the phone.

3
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:13,083
-She's not your wife and I'm not waking hen
-All right.

4
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,840
Well, then just ask her
what she wants me to do

5
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,922
with all these nude photos I have of her.

6
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,599
Come to think of it,
you actually might want them,

7
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,769
if only to see
what Miriam looked like in her prime.

8
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:28,765
Hm.

9
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,773
-Fuck.

10
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,742
Son of a bitch.

11
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,123
-Hello.
- Daddy

12
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,963
Blair had a heart attack last night.

13
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:36,507
-Really?
-Yes, really.

14
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,211
-How bad?
-Minor

15
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,004
He thought it was indigestion.

16
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,886
Putz.

17
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:48,177
-Dad, it's still a heart attack.
-Yeah, that's true.

18
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,355
You know, the long-term effects
of these things

19
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,523
don't often show up until later.

20
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,521
Impotence is still on the table.

21
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,195
Are you... Are you not at all concerned
that you might have caused this?

22
00:03:58,813 --> 00:03:59,939
Why would I be?

23
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,616
Mom told me about the phone call last night.

24
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:06,663
The one that woke Blair up
at 3:30 in the morning.

25
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:10,701
-Dad...
-Listen, sweetheart, I... I got to call you back.

26
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,083
-I'm on the elevator.
-You better And Michael.

27
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:17,165
-He's been trying to reach you, too.
-I will.

28
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:50,165
-I hope it doesn't swell up.
-It already has.

29
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,411
Okay. Cut!

30
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,625
-How was that?
-Appallingly bad.

31
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,169
Great. Moving on.

32
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:56,666
Moving on to the next set...

33
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:58,089
You know I...

34
00:04:58,372 --> 00:04:59,464
Barney... Excuse me...

35
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,883
-Barney, good...
- I want to talk to you.

36
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,005
Have you seen today's paper?

37
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,924
We need to go over the opening
for next week's episode.

38
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,801
The teaser is over a minute long.

39
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:08,842
Morning, everyone!
Yes, I know about the book!

40
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:10,642
And yes, I've seen today's paper.

41
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:13,847
No, I don't give a Hying fuck
and neither should you.

42
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:15,556
Let that be the end of it.

43
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,939
Barney, the network wants to make
a really big deal about the 30th season.

44
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,650
They want to bring in a new face.
Somebody young.

45
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:25,233
Maybe... Maybe Solange has a sexy,
young niece who comes to live with her.

46
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,863
No. No way.

47
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:29,411
They want to write her down
in favour of a new character.

48
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,990
So they want to bring in
some tits and ass, huh?

49
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:33,450
Isn't that why you hired her in the first place?

50
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,705
I want a word with you now!

51
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,377
Oh.

52
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,586
What language is this?

53
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:47,718
They're from Bulgaria.

54
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:51,601
Press clippings about me
and they just keep coming.

55
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:52,801
They love me over there.

56
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,104
And this proves what I'm really worth
to the foreign market.

57
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:59,191
Well, I will give this my utmost attention.

58
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,201
Five games into
the National Hockey League last night...

59
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:12,701
In their last regular season home game,
Montreal squeaked by Calgary.

60
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,827
A score of seven to six.

61
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,258
You get home okay last night?

62
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:32,050
I got home. Thank you.

63
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:36,395
He's already had more than a few.

64
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:47,444
That's for you. I even signed it.

65
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,697
See that review in the paper today?
Not bad, eh?

66
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,208
Ah, why do you have to be like that?

67
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,968
I even wrote you a nice little note.

68
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:14,767
"To Barney. None of this
would have been possible without you."

69
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,979
-"All the Best, Detective Sean O'Hearne,"
-Very sweet.

70
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,723
This is a big day.

71
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:25,023
Just wanted to buy you a drink,
share in the moment, be a mensch,

72
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:26,319
like you people might say.

73
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,194
Oh, for someone
who professes to hate me so much,

74
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:31,776
you certainly do go out of your way
to come around here a lot.

75
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:34,245
I just want to know
what you did with the body already.

76
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:35,746
Why don't you just leave him alone?

77
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,745
Because he got away with murder, sweetie.

78
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,501
You screwed over everyone you ever knew
or cared about.

79
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:49,627
Now the whole world's going to know
what a cock-sucking murderer you really are.

80
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,759
You could use a mint.

81
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,426
-it's a real page-turner.
-Yeah.

82
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,384
-Boogie!
- Barney!

83
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,348
- Boogie, what's happening?
-Hey, Cedric.

84
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:39,184
-Leo!
-Welcome back.

85
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:40,595
-Dr Smooze.
-Dr Smooze is back.

86
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:41,770
You're back.

87
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:46,767
-I'm good. I'm good...
-Boogie...

88
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:50,987
-Okay.
-Hey, come here. Come here. Sit down.

89
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,574
Boogie! Boogie, who is that?

90
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:55,696
-Who's that? That's The Countess.
- The Countess.

91
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:56,819
- Wow.
-Yeah.

92
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,116
-Where did you meet her?
-Ah...

93
00:08:58,195 --> 00:08:59,868
Somewhere between my blackout
in Lake Como

94
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,241
and my hangover in Sainte-Maxime.

95
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,244
Listen, if someone could find out for me
and get her name, please,

96
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:06,704
-it would be great.
-My man.

97
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,544
Leo. How was your showing?

98
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:15,342
The show was a bust.
I only sold one piece, to Barney.

99
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:18,720
Oh, his work is too bold for that crowd.

100
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,810
Barney, our very own patron of the arts.

101
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:23,933
Otherwise known as our only friend
with a real job.

102
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,272
That's true.

103
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,147
To Barney, living the lessons of the Bard,

104
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:32,730
"Be as great in act
as you have been in thought."

105
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,078
What about you, my High Priest?
Did you get through those books I sent you?

106
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,580
-A few of them, yeah.
-A few of them?

107
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:44,701
I sent you Gogol, I sent you Heine.
What have you been doing with yourself?

108
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:49,129
Well, actually, I'm getting married.

109
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,457
-To who?
-To me.

110
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:53,379
Oh, it's trouble.

111
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:58,593
Prince Charmingbaum here knocked me up
by way of a magical 30 seconds of friction.

112
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,012
Where the hell have you been?
You didn't come home last night.

113
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,219
Who remembers?
Has he told you what he's doing now?

114
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,349
No.

115
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:07,648
Exporting olive oil to some guy, Hymie,
back in Montreal.

116
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:10,818
-It's like a bad Jewish sitcom.
-Well, someone's got to make a living.

117
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:14,363
He comes to Europe and sells oil.
It's fucking humiliating.

118
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:16,156
You're not one of us. You're a voyeur.

119
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:18,450
All right. A toast to the newlyweds.

120
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,910
To your health, to your happiness.

121
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,447
And a three-inch prick.

122
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,582
Why did you agree to marry her?

123
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:34,880
-I got her pregnant, man.
-So?

124
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,129
it's Clara Chambers, man,
she's crazy.

125
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,766
She's a conversation piece, she's not a wife.
And how do you even know it's yours?

126
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:46,308
-it's mine.
-All right, if you say so.

127
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:52,693
- He's coming with me.
-Don't let him knock you up.

128
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,520
- You got any money?
- Some. Why?

129
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:55,650
Provisions.

130
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,525
We're going to do it all, Barney.
All of it.

131
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,781
Opium, the horse, the hash.

132
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:05,789
Everything under and behind the sun,
on and off the table.

133
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:10,790
Hey, we only go around once, my friend.

134
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:25,097
Oh, hold on. Hold on.
Don't tell me, your novel?

135
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,686
You finished it?

136
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,018
-No.
-Oh!

137
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,688
-Volume one, huh. This is it?
-Not yet. Not yet.

138
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,311
I'm not done with it yet.

139
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:36,779
Read it so far.

140
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:57,507
Jesus Christ, Boogie, this is brilliant.
When are they publishing it?

141
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,172
They're not.

142
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:01,341
Why not?

143
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,346
I'm never giving it to that ridiculous editor.

144
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:06,517
Okay.
What about the advance that they paid you?

145
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:08,890
I wrote him another one.

146
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,638
You're kidding. Which?

147
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,693
”Vanessa's Pussy”?

148
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,109
What's it about?

149
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:28,540
It's my interpretation of The Book of Job
as told through Vanessa's vaginal lips.

150
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,704
I don't know,
for some reason the editor passed.

151
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:35,875
Let me guess here,
Vanessa is the editor's wife?

152
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:37,210
Was.

153
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,001
-Come here, man.
-What?

154
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:48,433
Quit dicking around
and finish this book already.

155
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:02,444
Hey, assholes. You want to wait up?
It is my wedding.

156
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,828
You don't have to
go through with this, you know.

157
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,121
You're saying this to me now?

158
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,583
I'm just saying no one will think
any less of you if you don't.

159
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:17,087
That's good to know. Give me this.

160
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,761
Barney Ponosski.

161
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,051
Panofsky.

162
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:32,226
Pinasski.

163
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:33,808
Off-ski.

164
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,143
Panosski.

165
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:39,276
-Pan-off-ski. it's fine.
-Panosski.

166
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:42,271
Clara Charnofsky_

167
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:46,074
No. No. Her name is Clara Chambers.

168
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:47,943
Charnofsky?

169
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,203
I was married to a Russian gangster
for five days...

170
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,077
-Charnofsky... Jesus.
-I ran away on the honeymoon.

171
00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:55,204
I just never bothered to do the paperwork
to change the name back.

172
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,503
Did you ever think to mention that?

173
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,045
Don't worry, baby.
You still got yourself a true-blue shiksa.

174
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:06,425
What else haven't you told me, sweetheart?
Are there any kids I don't Know about?

175
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:12,139
Only two. Yosel and Chaim.
They're locked in our attic.

176
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,977
When you go out to get the hockey scores,

177
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:17,223
I let them down and force feed them
pork-roast milkshakes through a funnel.

178
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,314
There!

179
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,337
I will speak in English.
I'm afraid the infant was a stillborn.

180
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:52,345
But your wife is healthy, and will certainly
be able to bear other children.

181
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:57,021
I must ask you
if you know the biological father,

182
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:00,141
-for our records, Signor.
-Well, I'm the father.

183
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:12,286
Then you must be an albino.

184
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,368
Little baby never even had a chance.

185
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,210
Brother.

186
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,129
Oh!

187
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,294
- Barney, what are you doing?
- Cedric, you okay?

188
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,550
- Barney, what the hell?

189
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,180
He just lost his son.

190
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:53,574
Every four hours they attach clamps
to my nipples and milk me like I was a cow.

191
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:02,081
I really thought it was yours.

192
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:04,250
Let's talk about this later.

193
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:12,089
Oh, Barney,
you really do wear your heart on your sleeve.

194
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:18,556
Now put it away. it's disgusting to look at.

195
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:24,271
Barney, where are you going? Wait.

196
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:29,613
Barney, I'm sorry.
Barney, please, we'll start over!

197
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,777
Barney, come back!

198
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,776
I got a call today from Montreal.

199
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:39,372
My Uncle Irv offered
to get me a job in TV production.

200
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,746
Says there's all these tax loopholes
that make it foolproof in Canada.

201
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:48,624
Could you pass the lighter off the table,
please?

202
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,558
Thanks.

203
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,237
When did this come, man?

204
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,115
Oh, shit. I completely forgot.
It came a few days ago.

205
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,991
Oh...

206
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,829
”Dear Barney,
please come for dinner tonight at 8.

207
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,577
”I think it's important we talk. "

208
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:27,580
Clara!

209
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:31,838
”I'm sorry. I really do miss you.

210
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,346
"I need you. I'll even make latkes. "

211
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:08,954
Oh.

212
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:32,985
Oh.

213
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,773
Are you here about the apartment?

214
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,902
I'm Charnofsky

215
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:42,495
The Russian?

216
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:47,413
From Brighton Beach, in New York.
Your Mechutan.

217
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,587
Your father-in-law. Clara's father.
You going to invite me in?

218
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:09,063
Who'd buy such a disgusting thing?

219
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:11,650
Actually, Clara made it.

220
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,687
That's me, with the horns.

221
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:22,286
I can only imagine, Mr Panofsky,
the guilt that you are carrying,

222
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:23,828
but you should know, my Clara,

223
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:26,407
this is not the first time
she tried to kill herself.

224
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,539
No, no, no. When she was 12 years old,

225
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:33,839
she used to tear hair out in clumps,
right out of her head, yeah.

226
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,838
She said that we're not her parents,
we should be so lucky.

227
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,924
She said she's not Jewish.

228
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:43,507
She said, "Tell me who my real parents are."
And until we told her, she wouldn't eat.

229
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,763
We'd have to force her mouth open
and she was a biter.

230
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,056
Let me tell you.

231
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,772
We had to pour chicken soup down
through a funnel.

232
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,606
And she would be gone sometimes for days.
Who knows where? Greenwich Village.

233
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:57,312
And so I had to lock her up in the attic.

234
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,151
Dr Kupner, thank God for him.

235
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,531
He arranged for the mental hospital,
the latest, the best treatment,

236
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:06,830
the shocking electric... Something.
Never mind the expense.

237
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,453
We would do without.
But, you know, was she grateful?

238
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:12,001
No, she would yell in front of everybody
at the hospital,

239
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,796
"Dr Kupner, you felt up my tits."

240
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:19,589
Language like this, from a young girl,
you can imagine.

241
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:22,471
And then she would come home.
You know what she did for a thank you?

242
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:24,673
She sat in the bathtub,
she cut open her wrists,

243
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,679
the ambulance is sitting outside.

244
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,101
People are peeking through their curtains.

245
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,850
My wife was so ashamed,
she couldn't leave the apartment for a week!

246
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,691
Anyway, you shouldn't blame yourself,
Mr Panofsky,

247
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,691
because she did it before.

248
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,278
I think you should leave.

249
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,323
I've upset you.

250
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,332
Get out of here.

251
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:54,544
Get out?
What, do you talk like this to an older man?

252
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:56,208
I just lost a daughter.

253
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,002
So high and mighty
you're getting with me, huh.

254
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:05,305
You couldn't have made her so happy, either,
or she would not have done that to herself.

255
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,677
I'll throw your ass down the stairs.
I don't care.

256
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:08,383
The man at the embassy told me
it took two days...

257
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:09,843
Two days for you to find her!

258
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,553
Where were you, her loving husband,
where were you?

259
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:12,979
-Get out!
-Where were you?

260
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,101
Get out now!

261
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:25,154
Abe!
Did you hear what happened last night?

262
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:29,158
Some Nazi punks took a shit
right on the steps of Beth Zion.

263
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,122
Yeah, that's right.

264
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,330
And that's why you cannot be
complacent with your support.

265
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,002
We need Israel.

266
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,539
Look, I don't need to tell you
where things like this can lead.

267
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:41,500
Starts out with a turd, next thing you know,
we're wearing armbands again.

268
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,548
Mmm-hmm. Excellent.

269
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:49,349
And, Abe, I'll see you Friday night
for dinner, right? Great.

270
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:55,397
Donations go through the roof
when shit like this happens. Let's eat.

271
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,695
Fundraising, this is how you make
real connections, Barney.

272
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,278
I'll give you the target's annual income,

273
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,406
not the numbers on his tax returns,
the real numbers.

274
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,449
It could happen here, you tell him.

275
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:12,239
Israel is our insurance policy.

276
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:15,917
It could happen here.
Israel is our insurance policy...

277
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:20,589
Who's to say that it can't happen here.
Israel is our insurance policy.

278
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:23,667
And I hate to say it, but it could happen here.

279
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:28,046
Gentlemen, I need to borrow
my nephew here for a moment.

280
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:34,846
What did I tell you, producing, fundraising,
it's all the same dance.

281
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:37,226
Now listen to me.
I've got a girl I want you to meet.

282
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:38,894
-Darling.
-Hi...

283
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:40,190
Dexey, back from Florida.

284
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,813
Irv, I don't need to be set up.

285
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:46,148
Listen, she's got it all,
she comes from a very good family.

286
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,405
She's got a master's from McGill
and she's a good-looker.

287
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:50,531
Sweetie.

288
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:56,374
-Yeah, you're right.
-Sweetie, this is him.

289
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:03,044
-Hello.
-You're Barney.

290
00:23:04,874 --> 00:23:08,378
So, throughout the entire second year
of my master's degree,

291
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:09,883
I have a master's degree,

292
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:12,182
I had this reoccurring dream
where I'm 16 again

293
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,181
and I'm standing in Reuben's Butcher Shop
on St Viateur.

294
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,139
And I have this long pigtail
and it has a ribbon in it,

295
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:21,646
which my Aunt Sarah brought back
from Saks, in New York City.

296
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:24,857
And did you know Reuben?
He was such a card.

297
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:25,983
When I was 10,

298
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:29,407
he would always come around
from behind the counter and he would go,

299
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:32,281
"How come a beauty like you
isn't married yet?"

300
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,830
I was only 10, which is...
And I'm not married now.

301
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:37,122
Oh.

302
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:42,045
Is your dad really a cop? ls he? Is that true?
'Cause I heard he was a cop.

303
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,337
That's why you're not a square
like all the other Jewish boys I know.

304
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,217
-Button up your jacket.
-I don't want to.

305
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,890
-Why?
-Yours isn't buttoned.

306
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,387
Mine doesn't fit as well.

307
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,109
-it's the housekeeper, Dad.
-Swanky.

308
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,527
Go ahead.

309
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:26,043
So, Mr Panofsky,

310
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:30,298
you must have a lot of interesting stories,
you know, having been a detective and all.

311
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:32,716
Gorgeous, please call me Izzy.

312
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,258
And I was just a beat cop.

313
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,391
I mean, Jews don't get promoted to detective
in this town.

314
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:44,687
Oh. Did you ever encounter anti-Semitism
in your profession?

315
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,602
What do you think?
Let me give you an example.

316
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:49,813
One of my first shifts on the job,

317
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:52,740
I corner four guys
doing a dope deal in an alley,

318
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:54,738
big score for a rookie.

319
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:56,319
So, you know, I call in for backup

320
00:24:56,402 --> 00:24:59,622
because the rules say
you can only put three in a patrol car.

321
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:01,620
And, you know, I'm playing it by the book.

322
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,293
The dispatcher says to me,

323
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,122
"Your people are good with numbers,
you figure it out."

324
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:11,794
So I toss three in the back,
and the fourth I throw over the hood

325
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,549
and I handcuff him to the...

326
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:15,296
Side mirror.

327
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:18,137
There you go. Haul them all in.

328
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,224
Oh, my God,
that sounds so dangerous.

329
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:24,814
Only when he blocked my view.

330
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,476
That's funny.

331
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:32,197
Are you saying you were gratuitously violent
with suspected felons?

332
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:35,150
Gratuitously? No, I always got paid.
I ain't going to work for free.

333
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,202
He means unnecessarily, Dad.

334
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,369
Oh, look. When a fellow is young
and you give him authority,

335
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:42,866
he likes to push people around.

336
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:45,369
But I always knew
that my name was Israel Panofsky,

337
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,712
and you know,
I knew I had to be extra careful

338
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:50,082
and I was, most of the time.

339
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:52,333
"Most"?

340
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,419
Did you ever consider
that your career advancement

341
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:58,223
was stunted by your professional conduct
and not by imagined prejudices?

342
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:05,264
I call it as I see it.

343
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:10,936
But you're the one with the mansion
on the hill, so what do I know?

344
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:20,867
You got your brains from him
and beauty from her.

345
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,447
And you are one sweet little casserole.

346
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,375
Can we make a toast?

347
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,414
To the blessed match of these two lovebirds.

348
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:33,041
You never know
what tomorrow's going to bring

349
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,502
so get to shtupping and multiply already.

350
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,969
The chicken is great.

351
00:26:44,218 --> 00:26:45,219
It's fish.

352
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,104
No shit? Sorry.

353
00:26:57,732 --> 00:27:00,736
Darling, I can't tell you
how gorgeous you look.

354
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:02,320
And did you see Marsha?

355
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,155
Did you see the way she was looking at you?

356
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:06,832
Did I ever.
Poison from her eyes, she was so jealous.

357
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:08,785
Did you see what she was wearing?
She looked like a futon.

358
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,543
-What?
-How's that? ls that gonna do you?

359
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:15,500
What? No, it's cold, it should be hot.

360
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:16,960
I think it's supposed to be cold.

361
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:20,425
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Thank you.

362
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,869
We're married!

363
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:42,712
Hey, man. What's the score?

364
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:46,679
-One-zip. Boston just scored.
-Ah, Shit.

365
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:51,179
Give me a shot-

366
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:52,684
Mmm-hmm.

367
00:28:58,352 --> 00:28:59,399
I'll have another one.

368
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,264
Sorry.

369
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:40,603
Beautiful. Bring it around.

370
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,862
Let's go!

371
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:43,613
Oh!

372
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:45,734
God damn it!

373
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:48,076
It was a hell of a save, though.

374
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:50,743
Barney, your father's with the rabbi.
Will you go do something, now?

375
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:51,910
Mmm-hmm.

376
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:55,285
Will you put that out?
A lot of my relatives have asthma.

377
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,297
So, we're shaking down
a rub and tug, you know,

378
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,216
but I never bust the girls
because they provide a valuable service.

379
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:08,013
But, you know, we do it for appearances.

380
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:13,095
Anyway, we're doing our thing and one
of the clients, this crazy Hungarian Nazi,

381
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:17,395
loaded on Slivovitz starts going ape-shit,
comes at me with a chair

382
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:20,727
and I swear to God,
a hard-on the size of a can of hairspray.

383
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:26,528
-Dad.
-Yeah?

384
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,280
-Can I steal you away for a minute?
-Yeah, sure.

385
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:30,995
I'll be back in a minute.
If I'm not, you start without me.

386
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:32,329
All right, come on.

387
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:34,582
You know,
I didn't think I'd be having a good time.

388
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:37,206
I thought they'd all be snotty,
but they're a nice bunch of people.

389
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,129
What are you laughing at?

390
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:43,962
What are you laughing at?

391
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,461
-Jesus Christ!
-What?

392
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:49,465
Nothing. I love you, Dad.

393
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:52,800
Oh, man.

394
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:56,971
-What in the hell's that?
-I almost forgot.

395
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,348
Mmm-hmm.

396
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:02,480
-What's that?

397
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,480
Your wedding present.

398
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,908
Jesus Christ.

399
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:13,329
That was my first gun. I want you to have it.

400
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:18,376
I don't know what to say.

401
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,460
Don't say anything.
Give me a kiss and get us a drink.

402
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,133
Come on.

403
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:32,466
-Single malt.
-Yeah, give the cop a drink.

404
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:34,843
Your father-in-law said

405
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:37,095
that neither of you were to have
anything else to drink.

406
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:39,727
-What?
-Really?

407
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:44,193
Is that right? Here you go, Dad, have a party.
Where is that asshole?

408
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:52,155
Don't embarrass me.

409
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:57,035
-Give me a double.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,731
Barney,

411
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:33,739
can I help you?

412
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:40,330
Uh... No. Nothing, nothing.
Why? Forget it.

413
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:45,710
Yeah. Don't you ever tell my father
what he can and cannot do again.

414
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,249
He traumatised the rabbi's wife.

415
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:52,921
I don't care
if he fingered her under the goddamn table.

416
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:56,057
He's my father and he will have your respect.

417
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:15,026
Hello.

418
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,619
-Hi...
-Sorry, we haven't met.

419
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:19,535
-I'm Barney.
-I'm Miriam.

420
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:22,537
-Thank you for having me.
-Oh, of course.

421
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:25,870
-Are you all right?
-Fine. Perfect. Yes.

422
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,462
-I understand you're in television.
-Mmm.

423
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:33,132
-Totally Unnecessary Productions.
-On, that's a little harsh.

424
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:34,970
No, that's the name of my company.

425
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:36,805
-it's not.
-Yes, it is.

426
00:33:36,922 --> 00:33:40,472
-It is and they are, believe me.
-That's funny.

427
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:43,850
Your cigar is out.

428
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:48,814
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't want it to bother you.

429
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:52,693
Oh, please, it's a Montecristo. Go ahead.

430
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:57,530
Thank you, I will.

431
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,575
Do you know
why they're called Montecristos?

432
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:02,372
Haven't a clue.

433
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,834
Fine cigars are rolled by hand.

434
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:07,711
And the men and women whose job this is

435
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:11,458
chip in from their own wages
and employ lectors,

436
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,670
these people who read to them all day long
while they work.

437
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:18,764
It's entertainment to make the day pass.

438
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,467
At the factory
which produces the Montecristo,

439
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,518
the workers' favourite story was...

440
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:25,850
Ah-ha.

441
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:28,850
You guessed it. The Count of said name.

442
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:31,064
Lectors.

443
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:32,357
Nice touch, huh?

444
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:37,992
-I never knew any of that.
- Barney!

445
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:40,661
One. One.

446
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:45,700
-What?
-Thank you! Thank you!

447
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:48,581
-What's that?
-I'm sorry, it's nothing,

448
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,420
it's the hockey game. Stanley Cup.

449
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:52,043
Oh. Who's winning?

450
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:55,711
Habs have tied it up, in fact.
Do you follow hockey?

451
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:59,385
No, but I read newspapers.

452
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:04,514
Are you doing anything later?

453
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:06,721
Because we could still catch
a flight to Rome.

454
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:09,641
Lunch at Dal Bolognese
on the Piazza del Popolo.

455
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:10,770
To Rome?

456
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,105
Rome.

457
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:14,854
The bride may take issue with that.

458
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:18,907
Anyway, I have a train to catch later,
back to New York.

459
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:22,532
-Congratulations again.
-Thank you.

460
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:33,797
Thank you for being here, Boogie.

461
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:36,876
I'll never miss any of your weddings.

462
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:39,966
Hey.

463
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:47,265
I almost forgot.

464
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:53,609
It's a classy dame. Smart as a whip, too.

465
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,773
Who?

466
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:02,281
-Let's get you that drink.
-That would be good.

467
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,757
Oh, man.

468
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:24,345
For the first time in my life, I am truly,
seriously, irretrievably in love.

469
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:25,466
So am I, Barney.

470
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:28,806
So am I.

471
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:54,669
Central Station, please.

472
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,589
- You see this?
-Oh, my God.

473
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,467
You know what, to hell with it.

474
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,864
Ready for boarding on...

475
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,707
IDs, tickets?

476
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,212
Wow! I like you with glasses.

477
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,216
-What are you doing here?
-Run away with me.

478
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:45,383
What?

479
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:46,884
Run away with me.

480
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:51,056
Or, or stay with me. I don't care.
Or I could go with you.

481
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,804
-Are you out of your mind?
-No. I'm...

482
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:57,983
I'm bent over backwards in love with you,
Miriam.

483
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,982
I'm... I'm heels over head, completely...

484
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:05,066
Don't be ridiculous.
We just met, at your wedding.

485
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:11,205
-It's not funny. Barney, get off the train...
-I cannot believe that this really happens.

486
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:14,743
It really happens. Just like that.

487
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:16,334
IDs, tickets?

488
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,208
It's amazing, no?

489
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,502
And I don't care if it happened
on my wedding night,

490
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:24,552
at a funeral, on my deathbed.

491
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,841
It happened.

492
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:30,924
IDS. Tickets.

493
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,266
I don't have an ID or a ticket. Sorry.

494
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,444
Then you'll just have to get off the train,
okay?

495
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:47,362
Get off the train, Barney.

496
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,945
Among other things, sobriety and regret
are anxiously waiting up for you.

497
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,701
Here, I got it.

498
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:57,626
You look fantastic in that dress.

499
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:05,380
Leaving Montreal in two minutes.

500
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,086
Two minutes, everybody.

501
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,502
Oh!

502
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:57,181
Oh, my God.

503
00:39:57,302 --> 00:40:00,806
-We thought you were dead.
-We thought you were dead.

504
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:04,109
I called the police, I called all the hospitals.

505
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:06,357
I was so verklempt,
Dr Stein gave me a Valium.

506
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,942
I was supposed to take half,
I took the whole thing.

507
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:15,196
That was a gift.

508
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:25,835
So this must be the Via Condotti.

509
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,555
Ah!

510
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:41,227
Would you put that away, please?
It's our honeymoon, not a travel junket.

511
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,398
-I'm embarrassing you?
-Yes.

512
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,643
Like with the bidet?

513
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:49,814
You didn't have to ask the concierge.
I could have told you what it was for.

514
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:52,320
-Do you have a master's degree?
-No.

515
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:55,869
Am I embarrassed? Snap out of it.

516
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,913
We came to Rome to have fun!

517
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:00,825
Not to mourn the death of your first wife.

518
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:05,249
Yeah, we went to the Vatican.
it's old.

519
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:06,751
Yeah!

520
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,753
Ma. Ma. Ma.

521
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:10,755
You should see the bathrobes they got here.
Yeah.

522
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:14,426
And the soap. To die for.
Well, of course I will.

523
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:18,176
I already stuffed three bars
in my suitcase for you.

524
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:21,349
Okay, Ma, you know what?
I'm going to talk to you tomorrow.

525
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:23,271
Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

526
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:27,021
Hmm.

527
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,943
Hey, you know what?
I was just thinking about the wedding.

528
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:35,284
-It was beautiful, wasn't it?
-Yeah. Lots of relatives.

529
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,529
-I got a big family.
-Yeah, you certainly do.

530
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:42,325
-Who was that guy from Chicago again?
-My cousin, Isaac?

531
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,378
Right, Isaac, right. Funny guy.

532
00:41:48,997 --> 00:41:50,294
And what about that girl?

533
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:54,675
I think she was from New York,
the one in the blue dress?

534
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:57,681
Oh, Miriam Grant.

535
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,138
Right. Who is she again?

536
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:02,057
She was a couple of years behind me
at McGill.

537
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:04,513
She's the kind of girl, you know,
she subscribes to The Economist,

538
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:05,939
but she buys Vogue off the stand.

539
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:08,226
I think Jeff brought her.

540
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,607
-Jeff seems gay.
-Jeff is gay.

541
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,396
Just pretends for the family.

542
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,736
Ah. Good.

543
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:17,780
Good?

544
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:20,279
Well, yeah. I mean,

545
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:24,868
better that the guy lives a lie
than he inconvenience the family. I mean...

546
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,752
Well, yes.

547
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,297
I think I'm going to take a quick nap
before dinner.

548
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:38,714
-Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't think so.
-why?

549
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,599
I don't think so.

550
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:58,405
-Oh, did you wash it like I asked?
-Yeah.

551
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:01,824
-With soap?
-Yep.

552
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:05,122
-Okay.

553
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:30,478
-Sorry I'm late. I took a cab.
-It's okay, I just got here.

554
00:43:30,557 --> 00:43:33,026
And how are you, my favourite offspring?

555
00:43:33,101 --> 00:43:35,320
To tell you the truth, perplexed.

556
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:37,397
-By what?
-By you.

557
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:39,532
Before this recent phone incident,

558
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:42,532
you got Blair a subscription
to Boy Toy Monthly using his work address.

559
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:43,703
Mmm-hmm.

560
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:47,079
And before that, you signed him up
to an Al Qaeda website.

561
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,251
The man still can't fly out of the country.

562
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:51,203
I've upset Claire, is that it?

563
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,580
No, you've upset Mom.

564
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,586
Blair's too much of a chicken-shit
to say anything.

565
00:43:55,832 --> 00:43:59,302
See? You truly are my proudest achievement.
Do you know that?

566
00:44:00,545 --> 00:44:03,515
-He stole her from me, sweetheart.
-No, he didn't.

567
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,309
You got divorced, she got remarried.

568
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:10,939
Look, no one was rooting for a comeback
more than I was, but it's time to let it go.

569
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:15,770
-They're happily married, I'm sorry.
-They're married. Stick to the facts.

570
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:21,409
-An apology wouldn't hurt, either.
-Oh, for Christ's sake, apologise to who?

571
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:25,579
Hey, why don't you come up to the country
this weekend, hmm?

572
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:27,948
-Actually, I have a date.
-Oh.

573
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:31,627
-Nice boy?
-No. He's a nasty piece of work.

574
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:34,462
-Funny.
-Yes, he's very nice.

575
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:39,426
We'll see. it's our third date
and I'm not bored silly or madly in love.

576
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:42,846
I like him.
I think that shows a sign of maturity.

577
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:44,093
What?

578
00:44:46,341 --> 00:44:49,845
-Where the hell did I park my car?
-You took a cab.

579
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:55,442
Right. Yeah.

580
00:44:57,102 --> 00:45:00,652
Well, I definitely need a weekend
in the country, huh?

581
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,528
All right.

582
00:46:03,668 --> 00:46:06,387
Oh, thank you, nurse.

583
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,763
Thank you for landing us safely, Constable.

584
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,805
Hopefully, the weather will be
more forgiving the next time I pass through.

585
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:18,063
You can be sure my landing strip
will always be clear for you.

586
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:24,564
-Cut! Great.

587
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:26,950
Moving on to the next setup.

588
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:29,240
All right, we'll take this one down

589
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,196
-and we're gonna move 75 feet.
-Um...

590
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,377
I need a couple of rigs.

591
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,292
What's the matter with Solange?

592
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:46,837
Her fiancé died in a plane crash.

593
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,138
Oh, come on, that was more than a year ago.

594
00:46:49,214 --> 00:46:51,262
I mean, you look at her,
you would think that she...

595
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:55,103
To let you finish that thought
would be an insult to stupidity.

596
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,018
-Huh.
-Barney, excuse me.

597
00:46:57,973 --> 00:47:00,021
Phone's for you. it's a Miriam Grant.

598
00:47:08,149 --> 00:47:09,196
Miriam?

599
00:47:09,317 --> 00:47:10,944
Barney. This has to stop.

600
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:12,404
You got my flowers.

601
00:47:12,487 --> 00:47:16,458
Yeah, I got the flowers, I got the gifts,
every week it's something else.

602
00:47:17,742 --> 00:47:20,245
I don't know where to start
with how inappropriate this all is.

603
00:47:20,328 --> 00:47:23,377
Why don't you just skip ahead
from where I'm annoying and inappropriate

604
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:24,628
to where I'm charming and endearing.

605
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,884
No. 'Cause you're a married man
and I won't be involved with you in any way.

606
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:33,217
No, I'm sorry. I know.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?

607
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:36,178
I could be in New York tomorrow.

608
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:38,104
Are you listening to me?

609
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:39,556
Every word.

610
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:42,734
Really? Well, words matter. Actions matter.

611
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:45,608
If you want people to take you seriously,
then act accordingly.

612
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:48,778
Understand? What am I saying?

613
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:54,121
"Be great in act as you have in thought."

614
00:47:56,781 --> 00:47:58,078
Well, yes, exactly.

615
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:03,963
I have to go, so stop this nonsense
and focus on your marriage.

616
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,008
I'm just so happy that you called.
Thank you, Miriam.

617
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,801
Goodbye, Barney.

618
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:27,271
Well, tell Daddy not to eat the bagels
if they make him bloated.

619
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,778
Did I say he was fat? Did... I did not.

620
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:35,529
I actually have to go because I have to go
and vacuum the broadloom downstairs.

621
00:48:36,196 --> 00:48:38,244
Because I had to fire the maid.

622
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,543
Because every time
Barney and I would go out,

623
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,245
his father would come over
and have sex with her.

624
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:48,087
I know it's disgusting. You asked.

625
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,130
-Goodbye.

626
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:58,469
If you don't throw this out, I will.

627
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:01,555
I'll take it up to the country house, yeah?

628
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,645
Oh.

629
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:08,028
Will you tell your buddy, Bernard,
don't throw up all over the place

630
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:10,105
'cause I just changed out all the carpets.

631
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,073
Absolutely.

632
00:49:15,694 --> 00:49:17,116
You went to the game last night.

633
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:19,618
You think the score
magically changed overnight?

634
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,539
I gotta get going.

635
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:31,840
Barney. Barney, stop, this is important!

636
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,971
-What's important?
-This is... This.

637
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:37,215
Talking. This communicating.

638
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:40,514
You don't want Boogie puking
all over the carpets and your father's fat.

639
00:49:40,593 --> 00:49:41,810
Does that about cover it?

640
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:44,644
Do I talk down to you like that?

641
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,352
I gotta get going.

642
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,696
Okay. I'll be... I'll see you in a couple of days.

643
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:19,261
Hi.

644
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:22,140
Get in. Come on.

645
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:34,856
I thought you came here to kick.

646
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,992
Come on, man.
I've been on flights for 15 hours.

647
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,658
I had to fix up one more time
or I wasn't going to make it.

648
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:06,479
Oh, shit.

649
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:14,525
I thought I'd surprise you.

650
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,115
Surprise.

651
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:24,577
Thanks.

652
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,668
So, this is why you brought him here?

653
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:35,291
He needed some place safe to kick.

654
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,469
Yeah, it's called rehab.

655
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:39,846
You want one?

656
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:41,264
Just bring the bottle to the table, Barney,

657
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:43,512
then you won't be jumping up
every two minutes.

658
00:51:44,926 --> 00:51:47,554
Wow, are we ever in for a jolly time
this weekend.

659
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,230
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

660
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:51,649
Look what I found
while going through your wallet.

661
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,655
You're going to be very embarrassed
when they show up.

662
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,741
I called the florist.

663
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,652
While she's usually discreet
about her clients,

664
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:04,032
the ray of sunshine that is you

665
00:52:04,112 --> 00:52:06,615
left the manager eager to tell me
about the standing order of roses

666
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:07,786
that you have to someone

667
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:09,375
-in New York every week.
-Jesus Christ.

668
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:13,125
This is ridiculous. Are you going to pick
through every goddamn receipt that I have?

669
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,090
I'm not going to sit here
and be interrogated like this.

670
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:43,325
Schmuck.

671
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:05,389
Sorry I'm late. I have to get a divorce.

672
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:07,967
What!

673
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:10,019
Holy shit!

674
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:13,223
You cheated?

675
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:14,853
-No.
-She did?

676
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:16,647
-No.
-So what happened?

677
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:20,484
I'm in love with someone else.

678
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,159
Who?

679
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,158
You don't know her.

680
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:28,871
Where'd you meet her?

681
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:32,997
-You don't want to know that.
-Wait a minute.

682
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:36,376
You asked me here to talk
and now you don't want to talk?

683
00:53:36,496 --> 00:53:38,089
-What do you want from me?
-I don't know.

684
00:53:38,164 --> 00:53:39,416
Give me a hint.

685
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,344
-Some paternal wisdom. How about that?
-Ah. Fine.

686
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:49,351
Look, you're talking to someone
who knows how hard marriage can be.

687
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:52,599
In the beginning, it's all briskets
and blowjobs and la-di-da,

688
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:53,726
ain't life grand?

689
00:53:53,846 --> 00:53:56,599
But soon enough, real life starts, right?

690
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:59,735
You come home from work,
all she wants to do is talk.

691
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:03,148
All you want to do is screw, right?

692
00:54:03,231 --> 00:54:07,361
And before long, every day is like pushing
an avocado through a cheese grater.

693
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:10,037
It all feels like you're holding a pile of shit.

694
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:11,413
Mmm.

695
00:54:11,572 --> 00:54:14,200
This is the paternal wisdom I'm gonna get?

696
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:18,546
Maybe you should just take a step back
before you do something rash

697
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:20,419
and take a good hard look at the situation.

698
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:25,337
You're married to a well-bred woman
who is loaded.

699
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,470
Makes a nice, flaky kugel,
has a beautiful rack.

700
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:32,143
And many successful marriages have
been built on far less.

701
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:37,641
All right. You know what, just drop it.
Forget I even came in here with this.

702
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:40,273
-Listen to me. Will you listen to me?
-Mmm.

703
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,562
If you divorce her,
she's going to take you to the cleaners.

704
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:44,818
Oh, come on. Her father is loaded.

705
00:54:45,398 --> 00:54:48,026
She's going to inherit a shitload of money.
She's going to be fine.

706
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:51,113
You think that's going to stop her
from taking all of yours?

707
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,324
I don't care.

708
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,632
You want to tell me her name?

709
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,424
Miriam.

710
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:15,933
And is she the one?
Is she the mother of your children?

711
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:20,141
Absolutely.

712
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:23,690
All right then, let's do it.

713
00:55:25,813 --> 00:55:30,034
I'll be back tomorrow.
I'm just too drunk to drive tonight.

714
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:32,320
You're leaving me with a junkie.

715
00:55:33,654 --> 00:55:35,497
Are you with your whore?

716
00:55:35,615 --> 00:55:37,288
-No.
-So you do have a whore?

717
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:41,000
My father was right about you.
You son of a bitch!

718
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:43,130
You're not the kind of man
that I should have married.

719
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:44,506
I should have married...

720
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,057
In local news, forest fires have been reported

721
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,513
along the shores of Mont Orford,

722
00:55:58,638 --> 00:56:01,391
due to continued dry conditions in the area.

723
00:56:01,474 --> 00:56:03,693
Details coming up
on the morning news at 7:00.

724
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:41,727
Oh, God!

725
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:46,690
Get Out!

726
00:56:47,353 --> 00:56:48,354
Oh, shit.

727
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:52,908
Barney!

728
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:59,207
You bastard son of a bitch.
This is all your fault!

729
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:00,700
My fault?

730
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:02,077
Yeah, this is your fault.

731
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:04,078
You got to be kidding me.

732
00:57:04,203 --> 00:57:08,879
Oh, wow, my wife and my best friend.
Good heavens.

733
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,216
I just... I took in a little tray of food
'cause I was worried about him.

734
00:57:12,545 --> 00:57:16,049
And he was all trembling and sweaty
and soaked through his sheets,

735
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:19,014
so I lay down beside him
to try and keep him warm.

736
00:57:19,093 --> 00:57:21,016
And I don't know how he got my robe off!

737
00:57:21,095 --> 00:57:22,312
No, it's a mystery.

738
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:24,686
Must have been some kind
of voodoo magic or something.

739
00:57:24,765 --> 00:57:27,564
Wasn't that covered
by your master's degree?

740
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:29,612
Yeah, didn't you take that class?

741
00:57:29,729 --> 00:57:32,528
Feminist Approaches
to Fornication and Adultery.

742
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:33,824
I can't hear you!

743
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,870
-Maybe you were sick that day, professor.
-You know,

744
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,540
I don't think we should talk about this
while I am still so upset.

745
00:57:41,073 --> 00:57:43,792
-Oh, you're so upset?
-Yes!

746
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,412
You're so upset.

747
00:57:45,536 --> 00:57:46,753
And now I'm leaving!

748
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:48,748
Where the hell are you going, sweetheart?

749
00:57:48,873 --> 00:57:50,295
I'm going to my mother's!

750
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,427
Oh, well, say hi.
And tell them we're getting a divorce!

751
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:55,220
Tell her yourself.

752
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:58,432
But don't do it today,
because she's getting a root canal.

753
00:57:58,716 --> 00:58:00,844
I was coming back to try to work things out.

754
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:02,270
Oh, bullshit!

755
00:58:02,553 --> 00:58:04,931
I bet you two perverts
cooked this whole thing up together.

756
00:58:05,097 --> 00:58:09,944
No, I'm going to kill him for this
and then I'm coming for you.

757
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:12,155
And just for kicks, your father after that.

758
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:13,648
Go to hell!

759
00:58:24,575 --> 00:58:25,792
Animal!

760
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,728
I should kill you for this.

761
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:49,434
Oh, no.

762
00:58:50,142 --> 00:58:52,110
What you should have done was call first.

763
00:58:54,772 --> 00:58:56,149
Thank you.

764
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:02,117
How could you do that to me?

765
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:04,490
Oh, no, no, no. She did it to me.

766
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:05,996
Ah.

767
00:59:06,117 --> 00:59:07,790
It was innocent enough to start with.

768
00:59:07,994 --> 00:59:11,749
She brought me something to eat.
She started talking and talking and talking.

769
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:14,835
Tells me how you've been shirking
your husbandly duties.

770
00:59:14,959 --> 00:59:16,085
So you fucked her?

771
00:59:16,168 --> 00:59:18,296
Well, it was the only thing
that would shut her up.

772
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:27,312
Try the dining room.

773
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:32,314
I'm going to need you
to do something for me, Boogie.

774
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,866
I'm going to need you to testify that
I came home to you in bed with my wife.

775
00:59:41,777 --> 00:59:45,498
You sly bastard.
You planned this all along, didn't you?

776
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,708
Oh, no, no, no, no.

777
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,707
No. Who could have planned this?

778
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,711
I don't see any scotch, but lookie here?

779
00:59:58,169 --> 00:59:59,216
Lookie, lookie here.

780
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,681
What do you say, huh?

781
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:04,801
Duel at high noon?

782
01:00:05,843 --> 01:00:08,892
I just don't think we have enough booze
to get us there, do we?

783
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:10,894
-That's loaded, shmuck.
-Hmm.

784
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,519
Come on, there's more in the kitchen.

785
01:00:34,747 --> 01:00:36,499
Hey, man, hey.

786
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:43,090
Hey, listen, man,
will you testify for me or not?

787
01:00:44,298 --> 01:00:45,720
I'll think about it.

788
01:00:47,718 --> 01:00:51,768
You know what? I think that it's time
that you came through for me, for once.

789
01:00:55,393 --> 01:00:59,148
How many times have I bailed you out
over the years, man?

790
01:00:59,772 --> 01:01:02,491
I don't know, man. I wasn't counting.

791
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:05,406
Neither was I.

792
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:08,330
You sure about that?

793
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,708
When I had nothing,
I borrowed for you, man.

794
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:18,541
You owe me.

795
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:25,640
Isn't this getting interesting?
Very interesting.

796
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:31,346
But I'd like to go for a swim and think it over.

797
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,433
You must have a snorkel and flippers
here somewhere.

798
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,998
Hey, Balzac, how's the novel coming along?

799
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:57,998
Now, are you asking as a friend,
or are you asking as an investor?

800
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,252
Both.

801
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:03,340
Well, I'm still working on it, man.

802
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,012
You're a fraud.

803
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:11,762
-Have I let poor Barney down?
-Yeah, you have, yeah, fraud.

804
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:17,024
Well, too fucking bad. Too fucking bad.

805
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,727
-You know what, man?
-What?

806
01:02:19,852 --> 01:02:23,152
-I brought you in. I educated you.
-Mmm.

807
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:27,110
I put all the right books right in your hands
and look what you've become.

808
01:02:27,193 --> 01:02:28,365
What?

809
01:02:28,903 --> 01:02:32,407
A TV hustler
married to a rich man's vulgar daughter.

810
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:37,666
But not so vulgar
that you wouldn't bang her, asshole.

811
01:02:38,245 --> 01:02:42,500
Oh, and that's not the only wife of yours
I had. Not at all.

812
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:46,129
The next time I'm in New York,

813
01:02:46,212 --> 01:02:49,591
I'll call on your little tart
and I'll make it a trifecta.

814
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:54,933
Fuck you!

815
01:03:21,247 --> 01:03:25,002
What happened to you?
Boogie, what happened to you?

816
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:29,513
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing happened to me.

817
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:33,058
That's what you take
as such a personal of fence.

818
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,352
I am not your pet project.

819
01:03:36,136 --> 01:03:38,309
I am not your vicarious life.

820
01:03:38,973 --> 01:03:40,099
You're not my friend?

821
01:03:41,308 --> 01:03:43,231
Hey! Do you realise something?

822
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:45,358
Do you realise
that you haven't even come close

823
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:48,486
-to giving me a goddamn apology?
-You know what?

824
01:03:48,566 --> 01:03:53,037
Let me recommend another book for you
to stock your shelf with there, Barney.

825
01:03:53,112 --> 01:03:55,490
The Life of Heinrich Heine,

826
01:03:55,573 --> 01:03:58,292
who, upon his deathbed,
was begged by his loved ones

827
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:01,041
to ask for God's forgiveness
before he passed.

828
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:06,172
But good old Heinrich, he had only this
to say, "God will surely forgive me.

829
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,879
"After all it's his fucking job."

830
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:17,061
Hey, Boogie, wait.
Wait a minute, Boogie. Fuck.

831
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:22,934
You're too drunk, man,
and you're a lousy swimmer.

832
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,448
Boogie, stop!

833
01:04:30,941 --> 01:04:32,614
Take the goddamn flippers off-

834
01:04:33,277 --> 01:04:34,574
Boogie, God damn it!

835
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:37,327
I'll shoot, man. I'll shoot you, prick.

836
01:04:37,698 --> 01:04:39,245
-Shoot then.
-I will!

837
01:04:41,952 --> 01:04:42,999
Oh, shit.

838
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,128
-Holy fuck.
-There you go.

839
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:49,001
There it is.

840
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:53,510
But next time, you shoot it at me,
you fucking coward. Shoot it at me.

841
01:04:54,506 --> 01:04:59,683
You'll see for yourself what's really inside
this mossy damn cavity you think is a heart.

842
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,521
Fine.

843
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:02,848
-Fine.
-Come on, do it.

844
01:05:03,015 --> 01:05:04,562
-Don't you fucking...

845
01:05:37,549 --> 01:05:40,974
Busy day. Big fire a few miles east.

846
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,723
Twenty cottages burned so far.

847
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,308
They're wasting their time out there.

848
01:05:45,391 --> 01:05:48,235
I told them I already looked
all over the lake in my boat.

849
01:05:48,936 --> 01:05:51,030
He's broken into a cottage.

850
01:05:51,105 --> 01:05:54,234
He emptied it of all the booze
and pills he could find. He moved on.

851
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:57,949
But he leaves his clothes and wallet here?

852
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,789
He took someone else's clothes.

853
01:06:02,282 --> 01:06:04,250
No break-ins have been reported.

854
01:06:05,577 --> 01:06:06,954
You got something to drink?

855
01:06:27,266 --> 01:06:29,109
That's kind of sick.

856
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:30,982
My first wife made that.

857
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:34,277
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

858
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:36,283
She's dead.

859
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:38,618
Catch her fucking someone, too?

860
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:42,991
Actually, she killed herself.

861
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:44,908
Beat you to it, I guess.

862
01:06:44,992 --> 01:06:47,791
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

863
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,543
You know, I called you guys.

864
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:52,633
Yeah, you did.

865
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,133
So, how come you didn't mention this gun?

866
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:04,308
That's... My dad's a retired cop
and he gave me that for protection.

867
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,853
You're Izzy Panofsky's fucking kid?

868
01:07:08,974 --> 01:07:10,146
-Yeah.

869
01:07:11,685 --> 01:07:12,982
No shit?

870
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:16,490
So, how come there are two rounds missing?

871
01:07:17,024 --> 01:07:20,654
-Uh, Boogie and I were horsing around.
-Shooting off rounds?

872
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:22,495
We were drunk.

873
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,494
This was after you found him
fucking your wife?

874
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,951
No, it wasn't like that at all.

875
01:07:27,034 --> 01:07:29,162
You shot off the rounds
before you walked in on them screwing?

876
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:30,496
No.

877
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,456
-After? So you did shoot him?
-Yeah.

878
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:35,713
Yeah. Right through the fucking heart.
For Christ's sake.

879
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:37,427
Now we're getting somewhere.

880
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:40,552
Are you a complete imbecile?
Why are you wasting your time here?

881
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:43,392
What about this piece of ass
you were keeping in New York?

882
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:46,228
-The florist gave us her name, Miriam Grant?
-You leave...

883
01:07:48,889 --> 01:07:49,936
Jesus Christ.

884
01:07:50,015 --> 01:07:52,484
Two bullets fired from your gun

885
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,028
right after you caught your best friend
banging your wife.

886
01:07:55,395 --> 01:07:57,864
You threatened to kill them both
and now he's missing.

887
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:01,110
Unless you ate him,
we'll find the body before Sundown.

888
01:08:01,193 --> 01:08:02,285
Get off of me.

889
01:08:03,237 --> 01:08:05,114
So you tell me where the body is.

890
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:07,700
I'll say you were cooperative and remorseful.

891
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,578
You'll get yourself a smart Jew lawyer
and be out in no time.

892
01:08:10,702 --> 01:08:11,703
Barney! Hey!

893
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:13,872
Hey!

894
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,375
Hey!

895
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:19,382
What are you doing here, Panofsky?

896
01:08:19,503 --> 01:08:22,222
I got a telephone call from my son.
What are you doing here?

897
01:08:22,339 --> 01:08:24,637
Very sweet. He attacked an officer of the law.

898
01:08:24,716 --> 01:08:26,013
Yeah?

899
01:08:26,385 --> 01:08:28,729
From where I'm standing
this looks like police brutality.

900
01:08:29,263 --> 01:08:30,606
Like you're one to talk.

901
01:08:31,223 --> 01:08:32,270
You leave your hands off of him.

902
01:08:32,599 --> 01:08:34,693
-He's going down for murder.
-Really?

903
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,563
Well, it seems like
your razor-sharp detective skills

904
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:39,948
have missed one tiny detail.

905
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:43,573
I don't see a body. Where's the body?

906
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:47,702
Now you got something else to say,
talk to his Jew lawyer.

907
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:59,794
Don't touch it, you'll get germs.

908
01:09:02,462 --> 01:09:04,135
For the moment no charges have been laid.

909
01:09:04,256 --> 01:09:07,601
We've searched the area extensively,
no body has been found yet, so

910
01:09:07,968 --> 01:09:09,641
this remains a missing persons case.

911
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:13,561
Even with the overwhelming circumstantial
evidence implicating Mr Panofsky,

912
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,937
our hands are tied.

913
01:09:15,058 --> 01:09:17,186
All right, people, we got 10 minutes to roll.

914
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:19,772
10 minutes until we're rolling. Actors and...

915
01:09:20,314 --> 01:09:21,691
Excuse me, Barney.

916
01:09:21,773 --> 01:09:23,901
The papers you were waiting for just arrived-

917
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:37,293
-Hello?
- Miriam?

918
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:40,627
I'm... I'm divorced.

919
01:09:42,085 --> 01:09:44,087
-Barney.
-I'm going to be in New York tomorrow.

920
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:45,343
How about dinner?

921
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:47,178
Um, no.

922
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:49,343
-Lunch?
-No.

923
01:09:51,303 --> 01:09:52,646
Miriam, please.

924
01:09:53,096 --> 01:09:54,814
Is the ink even dry yet?

925
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:57,935
Let me check.

926
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:01,146
Yeah.

927
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:04,275
Look, it's just lunch. That's it. Only once.

928
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,828
And if you decide
that you never want to see me again,

929
01:10:08,946 --> 01:10:10,038
then that's it.

930
01:10:10,822 --> 01:10:12,665
I swear Just lunch.

931
01:10:54,408 --> 01:10:58,254
Yes. I'd like a bottle of Dom Pérignon,
well-chilled.

932
01:10:58,704 --> 01:11:04,711
And a dozen long-stem roses sent
to my room at exactly 2:00.

933
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:52,348
Hi.

934
01:11:53,091 --> 01:11:54,183
Hi.

935
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,731
I am so happy that you made it.
Now, have you eaten?

936
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,730
-Is it hot in here?
-No and no.

937
01:12:03,268 --> 01:12:05,270
You're sure. Okay.

938
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,448
Well, champagne?

939
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:12,445
I... it's an occasion,
we should have some champagne.

940
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,702
Don't you think? Yeah. Hey, excuse me.

941
01:12:16,782 --> 01:12:20,753
Can I get a bottle of Dom Pérignon?
And did you want to order now?

942
01:12:21,078 --> 01:12:23,456
Well, I haven't looked at the menu yet.

943
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:26,090
Of course, I'm sorry. You take your time.

944
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:29,219
The champagne, that will be fine.

945
01:12:29,795 --> 01:12:30,967
Thank you.

946
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:33,758
And some beluga.

947
01:12:34,257 --> 01:12:39,889
The Iranian kind not the Russian
'cause the Russian is just too salty.

948
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,777
Wow. It is hot in here.

949
01:12:47,145 --> 01:12:48,488
Are you okay?

950
01:12:48,563 --> 01:12:50,236
No. Yeah. No. No. I'm...

951
01:12:50,315 --> 01:12:53,159
I'm great. I'm fine. I'm fine.

952
01:12:54,111 --> 01:12:56,990
There's just so much
that I want to talk about, you know.

953
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:04,001
Oh, I know, yes, I know. Have you read...

954
01:13:05,831 --> 01:13:07,925
Can I be clear on something?

955
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:11,341
You didn't get divorced on my account,
did you?

956
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,134
Of course I did.

957
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:14,760
You hardly know me.

958
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,515
Your champagne, sir.

959
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:21,346
Oh! Wonderful, look.

960
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:24,604
Now we can celebrate. Good.

961
01:13:25,517 --> 01:13:26,769
Celebrate what?

962
01:13:27,978 --> 01:13:34,782
Well, now that I am no longer a married man
and you and I are finally together.

963
01:13:36,862 --> 01:13:38,614
Are you all right?

964
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:11,692
Don't leave, please.

965
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:18,362
What would you like to talk about?

966
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:24,664
-All the President's Men, Herzog...
-Oh, my God.

967
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,338
Alphonse Daudet?

968
01:14:29,748 --> 01:14:32,251
-Nice reference, by the way.
-Yeah, thanks.

969
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,257
I'm an idiot.

970
01:14:34,377 --> 01:14:36,505
Oh, don't be so modest.

971
01:14:38,757 --> 01:14:40,885
You obviously expected me
to come to your room.

972
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:42,518
Never.

973
01:14:43,053 --> 01:14:45,897
So, the champagne and roses
are for someone else?

974
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:52,397
Oh, my God.

975
01:14:53,939 --> 01:14:55,236
Why don't you get cleaned up?

976
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:59,862
We can go out, get some fresh air,
maybe a slice of pizza.

977
01:14:59,945 --> 01:15:01,697
I'm absolutely starving.

978
01:15:03,448 --> 01:15:06,952
You know, I'm always surprised that
people from New York don't Know this,

979
01:15:07,244 --> 01:15:10,464
but the Big Apple
is actually an old racing term

980
01:15:11,581 --> 01:15:15,586
credited to John Fitzgerald,
sports writer for The Herald in the '30s.

981
01:15:15,669 --> 01:15:19,219
But he had heard it from old stable hands
from Mississippi,

982
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:22,016
using the term
to refer to the New York racetracks

983
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:26,430
because getting to race in New York was
considered hitting the big time, you know.

984
01:15:27,472 --> 01:15:29,941
Getting to take a bite of that Big Apple.

985
01:15:30,016 --> 01:15:36,774
But I'm just going to keep talking here
because I'm afraid that if I stop,

986
01:15:36,856 --> 01:15:39,780
there's going to be a pause or a break
and you're going to say,

987
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:42,203
"It's getting late," or, "l should get going."

988
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:44,998
And I'm not ready for that to happen.

989
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:48,707
I don't want that to happen. Ever.

990
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:56,843
There it was, the pause.

991
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,013
Yeah.

992
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:03,474
I'm still here.

993
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:10,849
Oh, I adored my father.

994
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:12,521
He was my hero.

995
01:16:15,061 --> 01:16:18,861
Until I found out he was sleeping
with every girl he could get his hands on.

996
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:23,324
That killed my mother.

997
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:26,490
It's what gave her cancer.

998
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:27,912
That's a bit unfair.

999
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:34,294
No, it's not. Devastated her, every part of her,
mind and body, heart and soul.

1000
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,467
And that will never happen to me.

1001
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:42,259
Well, I would never do that to you, Miriam.

1002
01:16:44,049 --> 01:16:46,017
I want one thing from you.

1003
01:16:46,092 --> 01:16:47,139
Anything.

1004
01:16:47,218 --> 01:16:49,061
Don't answer, "Anything."

1005
01:16:52,057 --> 01:16:54,105
'Cause it's not real. And life's real.

1006
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:56,232
It's made up of little things,

1007
01:16:56,936 --> 01:17:03,911
minutes, hours, naps, errands, routine
and it has to be enough.

1008
01:17:08,114 --> 01:17:13,837
After all you've done to pursue me,
how can I trust you?

1009
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:20,089
Well, that is, uh,
that's a reasonable question.

1010
01:17:23,588 --> 01:17:27,058
I will just... I will just cut it off.

1011
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,350
You're offering to be my eunuch?

1012
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:33,056
I said that I would do anything
for you, Miriam.

1013
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:37,485
Well, don't do that. We'll be needing it.

1014
01:17:47,153 --> 01:17:51,579
-Barney? Do you take this woman...
-Yes. Yes. I sure as hell do.

1015
01:18:21,646 --> 01:18:24,490
He promised
he'd never miss any of my weddings.

1016
01:18:51,676 --> 01:18:54,270
-Oh, Barney, put it in the freezer.
-What?

1017
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:55,471
The onion.

1018
01:18:56,347 --> 01:18:59,601
Put it in the freezer before you chop it
and then it won't make you cry.

1019
01:19:01,019 --> 01:19:03,021
Well, how did I not know that?

1020
01:19:03,813 --> 01:19:06,987
I think that he's about ready for his nap.

1021
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,117
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

1022
01:19:54,739 --> 01:19:56,867
...it's about time to go for a swim.

1023
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,596
Look at you. Look at you. What are you...

1024
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:18,354
What?

1025
01:20:19,597 --> 01:20:21,565
You did good, boychik.

1026
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:39,705
-Anything?
-No.

1027
01:20:42,245 --> 01:20:44,623
-A nibble?
-No, Dad.

1028
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,128
-Burgers?
-Yes.

1029
01:20:54,299 --> 01:20:56,643
All righty. Burgers it is.

1030
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:58,728
Tell your mother we threw them all back.

1031
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:00,647
For sure.

1032
01:21:08,313 --> 01:21:09,405
Come on, Dad!

1033
01:21:09,981 --> 01:21:12,154
-I got it. I'm working on it, okay?
-Okay.

1034
01:21:12,233 --> 01:21:16,830
I got it.
I'll get it with a little bit of force, you know.

1035
01:21:18,948 --> 01:21:20,325
Son of a bitch.

1036
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:21,875
Now what do we do?

1037
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:34,051
You guys need any help?

1038
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:38,602
Yeah. No. No, thanks, no. I've got it. it's fine.
I just need to get a little bit of a...

1039
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,602
If you throw me a line, I can tow you in.

1040
01:21:52,023 --> 01:21:54,117
I'm renting a cabin here.
Just moved from New York.

1041
01:21:54,192 --> 01:21:56,570
Good. And what do you do, Blair?

1042
01:21:56,653 --> 01:21:57,825
I work in radio.

1043
01:21:58,237 --> 01:22:00,535
Oh, I used to work in radio in New York.

1044
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,662
Really? Where?

1045
01:22:01,741 --> 01:22:02,867
WZAJ.

1046
01:22:03,576 --> 01:22:05,044
It's a little jazz station.

1047
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:07,793
Yeah. Sure, I know it.
Ron Lewis is an old friend of mine.

1048
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:10,254
He is? That's funny. He gave me my first job.

1049
01:22:11,042 --> 01:22:12,965
Isn't that a coincidence?

1050
01:22:13,044 --> 01:22:15,297
The universe works in strange
and mysterious ways, huh?

1051
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:16,757
Mmm. Mmm.

1052
01:22:17,715 --> 01:22:19,638
We were just going to throw some burgers
on the barbecue.

1053
01:22:19,717 --> 01:22:20,764
You wanna join us?

1054
01:22:20,927 --> 01:22:23,931
-I'm a vegan. But thank you.
-A what?

1055
01:22:25,056 --> 01:22:26,808
Is that treatable?

1056
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:30,561
I can make a salad.

1057
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:32,188
No, I don't want to impose.

1058
01:22:32,271 --> 01:22:36,071
I should probably paddle home
before it gets dark, anyway.

1059
01:22:36,693 --> 01:22:39,617
-But it was lovely to meet the both of you.
-Sure.

1060
01:22:42,115 --> 01:22:43,662
-A pleasure.
-Sure.

1061
01:22:45,243 --> 01:22:47,621
- I found this really old cabin...
- Salad...

1062
01:22:47,704 --> 01:22:49,377
-...in the forest and it's really cool.
- Michael.

1063
01:22:49,455 --> 01:22:52,174
-And we should take you there one day.
- Well, here we go.

1064
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:07,056
Probably just flooded.

1065
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,938
I re-attached your pull cord.

1066
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:16,316
That was nice of him.

1067
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:20,658
We'll end our programme
with a request from our regular listener

1068
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:22,785
Alphonse, from Montreal.

1069
01:23:23,364 --> 01:23:26,743
This is Leonard Cohen's
Dance Me to the End of Love.

1070
01:23:26,826 --> 01:23:30,831
I'm Miriam Grant.
You're listening to WIXU, New York.

1071
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,826
It's not like I'm going to war, okay?

1072
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:10,128
-I'll be back Thanksgiving.
-Okay.

1073
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:14,048
I'm going inside.

1074
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:19,679
Any last words of wisdom?

1075
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:20,801
If you need money, ask me.

1076
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,720
Don't start selling dope.

1077
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,092
-No selling dope.
-Yeah.

1078
01:24:24,175 --> 01:24:25,267
Got it.

1079
01:24:34,685 --> 01:24:35,902
Take care of yourself.

1080
01:24:45,988 --> 01:24:48,491
He had to leave home eventually, you know.

1081
01:24:49,534 --> 01:24:50,751
That's not it.

1082
01:24:55,748 --> 01:24:57,546
I want to go back to work.

1083
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:02,555
I've been thinking about it for a while.

1084
01:25:03,714 --> 01:25:05,261
Blair said that
he could get me freelance work.

1085
01:25:05,341 --> 01:25:06,433
Oh. Uh-Oh.

1086
01:25:06,509 --> 01:25:10,935
No, listen. Just research and writing for now,
but it could lead to other things.

1087
01:25:12,682 --> 01:25:13,854
Maybe even on air.

1088
01:25:14,058 --> 01:25:16,561
Well, I'm sure that Blair will do everything
that he can for you.

1089
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:17,858
Oh, stop it.

1090
01:25:18,062 --> 01:25:20,360
And how is everything?

1091
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:22,191
It's excellent, as always, Jean.

1092
01:25:22,441 --> 01:25:23,738
We're good. Thanks.

1093
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,163
I knew how you'd take this.

1094
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:32,118
It's just that I worked so hard
so that you wouldn't have to,

1095
01:25:32,201 --> 01:25:34,124
so you could be here with me and the kids.

1096
01:25:34,203 --> 01:25:35,546
I thought we agreed that was important.

1097
01:25:35,621 --> 01:25:39,967
It was important.
But Michael's gone and soon Kate will be.

1098
01:25:40,251 --> 01:25:43,551
And, you, my darling,
are as grown-up as you'll ever be.

1099
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:47,391
I have to remember that I was once

1100
01:25:47,466 --> 01:25:49,594
Something more
than just a wife and a mother.

1101
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,981
Fine, then. You know what? I'll quit working.
We'll retire early.

1102
01:25:53,055 --> 01:25:55,103
We'll go travelling in Italy.

1103
01:25:56,058 --> 01:25:57,435
We'll get a villa on Lake Como.

1104
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:01,906
You're trying to fix it.
You can't fix this like you do everything else.

1105
01:26:03,608 --> 01:26:08,205
I don't want you to. I need to do this.
Can you try and understand?

1106
01:26:14,243 --> 01:26:15,870
Yes, of course.

1107
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:20,333
Whatever you want to do,
I am behind it 100%.

1108
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,130
Okay.

1109
01:26:24,837 --> 01:26:28,011
Well, Mr Dalhousie,
that's all we have time for

1110
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:31,094
And thank you so much for coming in.

1111
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:32,766
It was a great pleasure.

1112
01:26:33,346 --> 01:26:34,598
Thank you.

1113
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,308
That's great. Perfect. Perfect.

1114
01:26:48,361 --> 01:26:52,286
- Come on! Come on!

1115
01:26:53,866 --> 01:26:57,336
Well, come on!
What the hell kind of a call is that?

1116
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,630
Oh, God damn it.

1117
01:26:59,705 --> 01:27:03,881
He took a fall.
He tripped on his own goddamn stick.

1118
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,382
Where were you?

1119
01:27:53,676 --> 01:27:55,849
I was at Grumpys watching the game.

1120
01:27:56,846 --> 01:27:58,314
Did you hear my interview?

1121
01:28:00,391 --> 01:28:02,439
Oh, God damn it.

1122
01:28:02,518 --> 01:28:06,614
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I lost track of time.

1123
01:28:07,356 --> 01:28:09,905
It was important to me. You knew that, right?

1124
01:28:10,735 --> 01:28:11,782
Yes.

1125
01:28:12,945 --> 01:28:14,413
But you missed my first on-air interview

1126
01:28:14,488 --> 01:28:17,241
'cause you were drunk
and watching the hockey game

1127
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,419
like you've done 1,000 times before.

1128
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:29,174
Yes.

1129
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,345
Okay. I just wanted to be sure that
we were clear on what happened here.

1130
01:28:49,982 --> 01:28:52,326
Should I sleep on the sofa?

1131
01:28:58,449 --> 01:29:00,952
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1132
01:29:01,786 --> 01:29:04,835
You're not sleeping on the sofa.
We don't sleep apart.

1133
01:29:10,795 --> 01:29:12,138
-Did you get your plot yet?
-No.

1134
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:14,307
You should. The good ones go fast.

1135
01:29:25,309 --> 01:29:26,652
-You okay?
-Sure.

1136
01:29:28,145 --> 01:29:31,149
You know, I was thinking about something.
Maybe you should move in with us.

1137
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:34,117
The kids are gone, we got a lot of space.
What do you say?

1138
01:29:34,193 --> 01:29:35,661
Thanks, but no thanks.

1139
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,539
I just don't like the idea
of you being alone, that's all.

1140
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:42,660
I'm not alone.

1141
01:29:47,498 --> 01:29:50,877
You see that? Jacob Stern, no wife?

1142
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:52,503
That's alone.

1143
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:54,930
I'm going to be right here, near your mother.

1144
01:29:55,506 --> 01:29:58,350
When you get to be my age,
you'll see what a comfort that is.

1145
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:02,601
It must be hard without her.

1146
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,852
I'm used to being without her.

1147
01:30:10,396 --> 01:30:11,739
I need to get laid.

1148
01:30:12,731 --> 01:30:16,361
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-What?

1149
01:30:16,694 --> 01:30:18,992
God almighty. Classy, Panofsky.

1150
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:22,075
How long have you ever had to hold out,
Mr Three Wives?

1151
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,202
-Huh?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1152
01:30:24,702 --> 01:30:27,296
And I think it's safe to say in 50 years

1153
01:30:27,371 --> 01:30:28,714
we'll look back on this time

1154
01:30:28,789 --> 01:30:32,214
and our inhumane treatment of animals
for the purposes of mass consumption

1155
01:30:32,376 --> 01:30:36,631
and we'll look at it as a shameful
and barbaric period in our history.

1156
01:30:38,215 --> 01:30:42,220
I mean, I think it's much the way
we view segregation and McCarthyism.

1157
01:30:43,721 --> 01:30:49,774
I think we're at the interval
between consciousness and action...

1158
01:30:49,894 --> 01:30:52,022
-Barney.
- And, you know...

1159
01:30:52,104 --> 01:30:54,106
-Don't smoke that.
-...what provides that momentum

1160
01:30:54,231 --> 01:30:56,700
towards action is conversations like this.

1161
01:30:56,775 --> 01:30:58,448
-Like we're having right now.

1162
01:30:59,069 --> 01:31:01,071
I mean, I think it's probably
going to be less than 50...

1163
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:03,950
What do you...
Do you say less than or fewer...

1164
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,911
- Fewer.
- Yeah, you say fewer than.

1165
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,792
So, I think it'll be fewer than 50...

1166
01:31:21,425 --> 01:31:24,929
If you can't at least be civil with my friends,
don't bother joining us.

1167
01:31:25,638 --> 01:31:27,436
Oh, I thought I was perfectly civil.

1168
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,142
You fell asleep at the table.

1169
01:31:33,771 --> 01:31:35,694
I forgot to ask, how was the cemetery?

1170
01:31:35,773 --> 01:31:37,241
Good times.

1171
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,123
Hello. Yeah?

1172
01:31:52,414 --> 01:31:54,758
Don't take it to heart.

1173
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:41,054
Hiya, boychick.

1174
01:33:05,571 --> 01:33:06,663
I'm sorry.

1175
01:33:30,888 --> 01:33:35,359
Oh, goddamn. Oh, you look like a king.

1176
01:33:37,227 --> 01:33:41,073
That's what you look like, Daddy.
You look like a fucking king.

1177
01:33:53,285 --> 01:33:55,458
-You want anything?
- No, thanks.

1178
01:34:02,211 --> 01:34:03,428
It's your turn.

1179
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:05,889
All righty.

1180
01:34:09,468 --> 01:34:11,812
-What did you do?
-Right here.

1181
01:34:12,429 --> 01:34:13,976
Let's see here.

1182
01:34:14,765 --> 01:34:16,813
This guy right here.

1183
01:34:25,776 --> 01:34:27,073
What word is that?

1184
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,946
Attorney.

1185
01:34:29,571 --> 01:34:31,448
You're missing half the letters.

1186
01:34:33,075 --> 01:34:35,248
It's the abbreviation, genius.

1187
01:34:37,913 --> 01:34:40,462
When you get that lazy with cheating,
I know you're tired.

1188
01:34:41,959 --> 01:34:43,006
Hmm.

1189
01:34:48,298 --> 01:34:52,144
Five, four; three, two...

1190
01:34:53,637 --> 01:34:57,642
And we're back talking with renowned
painter and artist, Leo Fasoli.

1191
01:34:59,143 --> 01:35:03,148
Leo, you recently signed a seven-figure deal
with Simon & Schuster

1192
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,073
to publish your autobiography,

1193
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:08,824
and then you returned the money
saying that you no longer wanted to do it.

1194
01:35:09,653 --> 01:35:10,654
What happened?

1195
01:35:12,156 --> 01:35:15,410
It proved to be more difficult
than I originally thought it would be.

1196
01:35:16,493 --> 01:35:19,588
So does that mean you won't be
doing a retrospective any time soon?

1197
01:35:20,164 --> 01:35:22,508
Who knows? Anything is possible.

1198
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:31,099
-It was nice to meet you.
-My pleasure.

1199
01:35:32,009 --> 01:35:33,135
-Bye.
-Bye.

1200
01:35:37,306 --> 01:35:39,775
-So, you like this one?
-Yeah.

1201
01:35:42,352 --> 01:35:45,447
Thank you again for doing this.
This was a real coup for Miriam.

1202
01:35:45,522 --> 01:35:47,650
-Thank you.
-It was my pleasure, huh.

1203
01:35:48,358 --> 01:35:49,450
She is an amazing woman.

1204
01:35:49,526 --> 01:35:51,278
You sure you don't want to stay the night?

1205
01:35:51,361 --> 01:35:53,329
You know
that we would love to have you. Please.

1206
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:57,000
There's nothing I would enjoy more,
but I have to get back to Italy.

1207
01:35:57,493 --> 01:35:58,870
I have to.

1208
01:35:59,536 --> 01:36:04,633
Hey, you have made a wonderful life
for yourself. It makes me happy.

1209
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,642
See you.

1210
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:21,817
Allow me a toast to you, Barney,
'cause you really came through

1211
01:36:21,892 --> 01:36:24,736
-getting Leo to do this interview.
-Yes, you did. You did.

1212
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:26,980
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1213
01:36:27,064 --> 01:36:29,317
And a toast to Blair on his new job
in New York.

1214
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:31,322
Well, I don't have it yet. Just...

1215
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:33,028
Oh, well, here's hoping.

1216
01:36:35,531 --> 01:36:37,078
-Everybody done.
- Mmm-hmm.

1217
01:36:37,825 --> 01:36:40,920
-Let me help.
-No, no. Guests don't clean.

1218
01:36:41,745 --> 01:36:44,874
Yeah, sit down. Come on, sit.

1219
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:56,181
So, when do you find out?

1220
01:36:56,885 --> 01:36:58,762
Oh, it's... It's another month.

1221
01:36:59,012 --> 01:37:01,060
A month? Oh jeez, come on.

1222
01:37:02,015 --> 01:37:05,269
Don't be so soft. You got to push these guys.
You got to push them.

1223
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:08,276
Let them know that they're going to lose you
if they sit on their asses.

1224
01:37:08,397 --> 01:37:11,947
No, I'm just not one to be aggressive
in that way. You know?

1225
01:37:12,276 --> 01:37:15,029
Just because you're gay,
doesn't mean that you can't be assertive.

1226
01:37:15,112 --> 01:37:17,080
I'm not gay, I just...

1227
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:22,370
No. I didn't think so. But Miriam seems to...

1228
01:37:24,454 --> 01:37:25,626
Miriam thinks I'm gay?

1229
01:37:26,248 --> 01:37:28,967
Well, I told her that you weren't, but...

1230
01:37:32,462 --> 01:37:34,305
So, what are you boys talking about?

1231
01:37:43,307 --> 01:37:44,399
What's with you?

1232
01:37:45,642 --> 01:37:46,734
-What?
-Don't say, "What."

1233
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:48,483
Let's just skip that whole part, okay?

1234
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:52,112
I was just giving him some life lessons,
that's all.

1235
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,073
By telling him that I think he's gay?

1236
01:37:55,485 --> 01:37:57,328
Who even jokes about that any more?

1237
01:37:58,155 --> 01:38:00,157
I don't want to tight about Cher.

1238
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:03,081
Oh, we're not fighting about Blair,
we're fighting about you.

1239
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:06,664
-Why?
-Because getting Leo to come in

1240
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:08,841
doesn't negate all the interviews
that you've missed

1241
01:38:08,957 --> 01:38:11,085
to get drunk and watch the game or...

1242
01:38:12,169 --> 01:38:15,799
Or all the dinners that you ruined
'cause you're incorrigible with my friends.

1243
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:18,850
Oh.

1244
01:38:20,135 --> 01:38:21,307
It doesn't?

1245
01:38:22,346 --> 01:38:24,098
I'm going to go and visit Michael for a week.

1246
01:38:25,182 --> 01:38:26,183
What?

1247
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:28,356
I'm going to New York.

1248
01:38:30,187 --> 01:38:32,861
-Oh, when?
-Next weekend.

1249
01:38:33,565 --> 01:38:36,409
All right, I'll take the week off.

1250
01:38:37,569 --> 01:38:40,664
No, I think a little time apart
would be good for both of us.

1251
01:38:42,699 --> 01:38:45,077
What? Where is this coming from?

1252
01:38:48,038 --> 01:38:49,961
We've hardly been apart
since we've been married.

1253
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:53,214
I think it would be good
to circulate the air a little. That's all.

1254
01:38:53,335 --> 01:38:54,382
You know...

1255
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:59,471
It's only a week, okay?

1256
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:10,523
-Hello?
- Michael.

1257
01:39:10,852 --> 01:39:14,231
Hi. Put your mother on the phone, please.

1258
01:39:14,856 --> 01:39:16,824
Nice talking to you, too, Dad. Mom?

1259
01:39:17,025 --> 01:39:18,368
-Yeah?
-it's Dad.

1260
01:39:19,695 --> 01:39:20,867
Okay. Hold on.

1261
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:25,246
Hi.

1262
01:39:25,867 --> 01:39:30,418
Come home already. Would you?
I can't sleep without you here beside me.

1263
01:39:30,872 --> 01:39:31,919
I know.

1264
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:34,794
I keep reaching over for you in bed.

1265
01:39:35,711 --> 01:39:37,713
You know,
I bought our cemetery plots today.

1266
01:39:37,796 --> 01:39:38,843
What?

1267
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:45,354
I can't handle being without you
for even a day

1268
01:39:45,429 --> 01:39:49,935
and that got me thinking,
and I just needed to have that settled.

1269
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:52,444
That we would be together forever

1270
01:39:52,686 --> 01:39:56,316
Oh. You shouldn't have done that
without talking to me first.

1271
01:39:56,398 --> 01:39:57,615
That's a big thing.

1272
01:39:58,025 --> 01:40:00,403
What does that mean, that you're not sure?

1273
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:03,740
No. Why is everything
all or nothing with you?

1274
01:40:04,614 --> 01:40:08,744
I say I need a little space and you go out
and you buy real estate for our afterlife?

1275
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:14,382
-I'm sorry. I...
-Overreacted. Yes, you did.

1276
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:16,256
I'm sure what you bought is fine.

1277
01:40:16,334 --> 01:40:19,008
I'm sure that if you bought it,
it's the best plot in the whole city,

1278
01:40:19,087 --> 01:40:21,715
but I'm still not coming home today.

1279
01:40:22,841 --> 01:40:25,094
I'm enjoying my week with my son.

1280
01:40:26,845 --> 01:40:29,473
Now, I have to go,
because Blair is waiting for us...

1281
01:40:29,556 --> 01:40:32,435
-Blair?
-Barney, don't even start.

1282
01:40:33,101 --> 01:40:34,944
He actually took your advice

1283
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:37,068
and he told them that he had another offer

1284
01:40:37,147 --> 01:40:38,990
and they called him down
for a final interview.

1285
01:40:39,941 --> 01:40:43,445
Oh, I can't believe
that you're there with Blair.

1286
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:46,407
I'm not even going to
have this conversation with you.

1287
01:40:50,994 --> 01:40:54,214
I love you, but I really do have to go- Okay?

1288
01:40:54,831 --> 01:40:56,083
Uh-huh.

1289
01:41:07,803 --> 01:41:10,397
And then our friend here
leaves his own wedding,

1290
01:41:10,722 --> 01:41:13,145
takes off and chases her right on to the train.

1291
01:41:13,225 --> 01:41:14,477
-No way!
-Yeah.

1292
01:41:14,851 --> 01:41:17,604
-You're crazy.
-That's what I keep telling him.

1293
01:41:22,234 --> 01:41:25,238
-You don't remember me, do you?
-Should I?

1294
01:41:25,445 --> 01:41:28,415
I had a small part on your TV show
a few years ago.

1295
01:41:29,032 --> 01:41:35,005
Really? I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I don't remember that.

1296
01:41:37,082 --> 01:41:40,882
That's okay. I remembered you right away.

1297
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:42,634
-Oh, thank you.

1298
01:41:43,755 --> 01:41:45,974
I'm going to freshen up a bit.

1299
01:41:47,175 --> 01:41:50,224
-Would you mind ordering me another?
-Of course.

1300
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,249
-I need a test now.
-Test for what?

1301
01:42:18,331 --> 01:42:22,211
VD, syphilis, gonorrhea, AIDS,
the whole thing.

1302
01:42:23,545 --> 01:42:26,799
-Slow down. What the hell happened?
-Just give me the test, Morty.

1303
01:42:26,923 --> 01:42:29,017
And I need the results as soon as possible.

1304
01:42:43,273 --> 01:42:44,741
There we go.

1305
01:42:47,736 --> 01:42:50,159
-Oh, it's good to be home.
-Yeah.

1306
01:42:52,657 --> 01:42:58,289
I'll put these in water and then
I'll unpack your bags, so you go relax, okay?

1307
01:42:58,747 --> 01:43:00,749
I have a better idea.

1308
01:43:04,294 --> 01:43:07,514
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

1309
01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:14,478
You must be exhausted, though, right?

1310
01:43:14,554 --> 01:43:18,650
I'm going to make you some tea
and I'm going to run you a bath.

1311
01:43:19,476 --> 01:43:20,523
How's that sound?

1312
01:43:20,602 --> 01:43:22,275
-Barney?
-Yeah?

1313
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:24,110
What's wrong?

1314
01:43:24,356 --> 01:43:25,608
Nothing. Why?

1315
01:43:25,815 --> 01:43:26,862
Barney.

1316
01:43:27,275 --> 01:43:28,447
What?

1317
01:43:28,526 --> 01:43:31,075
--Oh! I got it. I got it. I got it.

1318
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:36,160
Hello? Oh, yeah, hold on. Just a second.

1319
01:43:37,494 --> 01:43:41,965
It's work.
There's crazy problems on the set and it's...

1320
01:43:44,209 --> 01:43:48,635
Well, whenever you're done hiding whatever
it is you screwed up while I was gone,

1321
01:43:48,713 --> 01:43:51,762
I'll be in the bedroom naked.

1322
01:43:58,682 --> 01:44:00,059
Morty, so?

1323
01:44:03,687 --> 01:44:05,280
Oh, thank God.

1324
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,863
Oh, my God, thank God.

1325
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:14,414
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

1326
01:44:23,415 --> 01:44:25,588
I don't know why, but I...

1327
01:44:28,545 --> 01:44:32,175
I checked the caller ID,
'cause you were acting so strange and...

1328
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:39,477
Why did you lie to me about it being Morty?

1329
01:44:46,062 --> 01:44:47,530
Tell me the truth.

1330
01:44:49,316 --> 01:44:50,613
Oh, God.

1331
01:44:52,193 --> 01:44:53,740
Are you sick?

1332
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,784
-Tell me.
-No, I'm not sick. No.

1333
01:44:59,034 --> 01:45:00,707
-The way you cough.
-No.

1334
01:45:01,077 --> 01:45:03,546
-All those cigars?
-Miriam. No.

1335
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:08,210
I am not sick.

1336
01:45:11,921 --> 01:45:13,093
Okay.

1337
01:45:17,135 --> 01:45:18,728
So what is it?

1338
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:23,434
What are you hiding from me?

1339
01:45:27,771 --> 01:45:29,114
Tell me.

1340
01:45:31,816 --> 01:45:33,113
Tell me.

1341
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:40,450
It meant nothing to me.

1342
01:45:44,954 --> 01:45:46,206
Oh, God.

1343
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:49,710
Oh, God.

1344
01:45:56,716 --> 01:46:01,847
Please, Miriam, please.
Please, please, Miriam, please, please...

1345
01:46:02,138 --> 01:46:06,735
-How could you? How could you?
-Please. Please. Please.

1346
01:46:10,647 --> 01:46:12,194
We have a life.

1347
01:46:13,525 --> 01:46:14,868
We have a life.

1348
01:46:21,991 --> 01:46:23,538
We had a life.

1349
01:46:46,349 --> 01:46:47,851
Hey, wait a minute, Michael.

1350
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,702
Hey. Hey.

1351
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:08,372
I know how difficult this is for both of you,

1352
01:47:09,873 --> 01:47:12,752
but your mother and I
are going to work through this, okay?

1353
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:15,545
How could you have fucked this up?

1354
01:47:16,713 --> 01:47:19,637
She deserved so much better than you

1355
01:47:21,885 --> 01:47:23,262
and she still loved you.

1356
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:28,066
You're a miserable, ungrateful prick,
is what you are.

1357
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:30,644
Watch your mouth. I am still your father.

1358
01:47:30,727 --> 01:47:32,729
Yeah, I know.
There's nothing I can do about that.

1359
01:48:09,516 --> 01:48:11,439
Totally Unnecessary Productions.
One second.

1360
01:48:11,935 --> 01:48:14,404
-Good morning, Barney.
-My car was stolen.

1361
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:16,231
Find out what I do to report it, please.

1362
01:48:16,314 --> 01:48:19,784
It's parked in the lot.
I have the keys right here.

1363
01:48:24,989 --> 01:48:26,286
-it's okay.
-I know.

1364
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:41,932
Why did you leave the set?
I thought you might want to give a speech.

1365
01:48:42,006 --> 01:48:43,132
No.

1366
01:48:46,135 --> 01:48:47,557
I'm not interested.

1367
01:48:47,637 --> 01:48:49,310
You don't even know what I'm going to say.

1368
01:48:49,389 --> 01:48:52,984
I am not interested
in what you're going to say, that is the point.

1369
01:48:54,602 --> 01:48:57,822
What if it's something really interesting?

1370
01:48:58,481 --> 01:49:02,611
Right now, I'm in a state
of complete disinterest to all things.

1371
01:49:02,777 --> 01:49:05,701
Is that clear
or should I get someone to translate?

1372
01:49:07,949 --> 01:49:11,294
I'm going to Bulgaria, first class.

1373
01:49:13,204 --> 01:49:15,798
You haven't flown in 30 years, Solange.

1374
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:24,346
I've been in systematic desensitisation
therapy to get over my fear of flying.

1375
01:49:25,508 --> 01:49:27,476
-Are you out of your mind?
-What?

1376
01:49:30,513 --> 01:49:35,644
Some idiots keep printing 30-year-old
pictures of you in bikinis,

1377
01:49:36,853 --> 01:49:39,857
so old Bolsheviks
can have something to jerk off to,

1378
01:49:40,023 --> 01:49:43,527
and you're going to travel
a halfway around the world because of that?

1379
01:49:44,861 --> 01:49:48,206
What the hell do you imagine
is going to happen, Solange?

1380
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:52,243
What are you, you're going to step
right off the plane onto the tarmac

1381
01:49:52,368 --> 01:49:56,339
with the Chanel glasses and the Hermes
scarf wrapped around your new do?

1382
01:49:56,414 --> 01:49:59,418
A gaggle of paparazzi awaiting your arrival?

1383
01:50:00,543 --> 01:50:06,425
You are 180 years old!
Solange, get the fuck over it!

1384
01:50:10,887 --> 01:50:12,184
What the hell is wrong with you?

1385
01:50:12,263 --> 01:50:13,560
What the hell is wrong with me?

1386
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:15,892
My friend Leo just died!

1387
01:50:18,519 --> 01:50:19,941
You hear me?

1388
01:50:21,856 --> 01:50:23,699
Leo died a year ago.

1389
01:50:25,234 --> 01:50:26,235
What?

1390
01:50:31,949 --> 01:50:34,623
You were a pallbearer at his funeral, Barney.

1391
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:49,639
I'm going to start by asking you
a series of questions.

1392
01:50:49,759 --> 01:50:51,807
Just answer them. There's no right or wrong.

1393
01:50:54,055 --> 01:50:55,102
What month is it?

1394
01:50:56,766 --> 01:50:58,268
You're joking.

1395
01:50:59,602 --> 01:51:01,821
-There's a point to all this.
-Uh-huh.

1396
01:51:02,814 --> 01:51:03,906
April.

1397
01:51:04,148 --> 01:51:06,321
-What season is it?
-Summer.

1398
01:51:11,322 --> 01:51:12,790
What kind of car do you drive?

1399
01:51:14,117 --> 01:51:17,291
Morty, this is fucking embarrassing.
What the hell!

1400
01:51:17,995 --> 01:51:19,622
Just answer it.

1401
01:51:20,415 --> 01:51:21,462
It's...

1402
01:51:26,963 --> 01:51:29,512
You know... it's... it's...

1403
01:51:35,138 --> 01:51:36,811
Oh, God damn it.

1404
01:51:41,144 --> 01:51:44,023
This is crazy. This is crazy.

1405
01:51:51,654 --> 01:51:52,701
It's German.

1406
01:52:00,621 --> 01:52:04,876
You know, I can't even find the fucking thing.
Why the hell should I care what it is called?

1407
01:52:33,529 --> 01:52:35,657
That was Leonard Cohen's I'm Your Man,

1408
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:40,003
a request from our ever-faithful listener;
Alphonse, all the way from Montreal.

1409
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:42,998
And here's one for you, Alphonse.

1410
01:52:43,706 --> 01:52:46,880
I Don't Want to Hear it Anymore
by Dusty Springfield.

1411
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:59,392
Here you go, Alphonse.

1412
01:53:34,423 --> 01:53:36,676
Fuck! Fuck!

1413
01:53:53,693 --> 01:53:54,740
Daddy!

1414
01:53:57,446 --> 01:54:01,371
Daddy! Daddy, stop. Stop. Please stop.

1415
01:54:02,785 --> 01:54:04,628
Daddy, what's wrong?

1416
01:54:07,748 --> 01:54:08,965
What's wrong?

1417
01:54:09,292 --> 01:54:12,296
I can't remember
your mother's phone number.

1418
01:54:41,574 --> 01:54:42,951
You look great.

1419
01:54:43,492 --> 01:54:45,290
You look fantastic.

1420
01:54:51,834 --> 01:54:53,632
Sit down, come on.

1421
01:54:59,342 --> 01:55:01,845
You're not going to get sick
on me again, are you?

1422
01:55:01,969 --> 01:55:06,475
No, no. Only coffee for me now. Thank you.

1423
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:11,484
But I do have my crib notes.

1424
01:55:13,522 --> 01:55:15,149
Now where the hell are they?

1425
01:55:16,484 --> 01:55:21,706
Yeah, I got my address and number,
Kate's number, Michael's,

1426
01:55:23,115 --> 01:55:25,493
all the important stuff in case I get lost.

1427
01:55:25,993 --> 01:55:29,122
I was thinking a dog collar
might be better but...

1428
01:55:31,374 --> 01:55:33,718
I've been doing some research,

1429
01:55:35,002 --> 01:55:39,633
and they're always coming out
with new treatments and doing trials.

1430
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,719
Yeah, let's... I don't...
Let's not do that whole thing.

1431
01:55:43,552 --> 01:55:46,601
'Cause we all know
where this is heading, right?

1432
01:55:49,141 --> 01:55:50,734
Can we be friends now?

1433
01:55:53,396 --> 01:55:54,898
No, we can't.

1434
01:55:59,694 --> 01:56:02,493
I'm here for you, if you'll let me be.

1435
01:56:08,869 --> 01:56:11,873
We had a beautiful marriage, but it's over.

1436
01:56:13,249 --> 01:56:15,502
And I want you to accept that.

1437
01:56:19,588 --> 01:56:22,512
Have I ever given up when it comes to you?

1438
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:29,731
Never.

1439
01:56:31,434 --> 01:56:34,608
So what makes you think
I'm going to start now?

1440
01:56:43,404 --> 01:56:46,533
-Are you ready to hear today's special?
-Yeah.

1441
01:56:47,033 --> 01:56:50,412
We have Dover sole
flown in from Calais this morning.

1442
01:56:51,037 --> 01:56:52,084
We have also...

1443
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:02,427
Mmm.

1444
01:57:21,817 --> 01:57:23,194
Thank you.

1445
01:58:12,493 --> 01:58:15,087
Jean, Jean, did you see Barney?

1446
01:58:15,621 --> 01:58:21,378
No, Madame, I haven't. He paid the bill,
but left his wallet on the table.

1447
01:58:22,545 --> 01:58:23,922
Thank you.

1448
01:58:50,156 --> 01:58:52,625
- Barney?
-Yeah?

1449
01:58:53,993 --> 01:58:56,792
-There you are.
-Hey, what's up?

1450
01:58:57,163 --> 01:58:59,586
I couldn't find you. I got scared.

1451
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:03,260
It's so beautiful in here, isn't it?

1452
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:06,593
You forgot your wallet at the table.

1453
01:59:07,298 --> 01:59:11,348
What's wrong with you? Look at you,
you're practically shaking. Hey...

1454
01:59:11,802 --> 01:59:16,683
-Well, I thought I lost you.
-Lost me? No, no.

1455
01:59:19,685 --> 01:59:22,780
Hey, I was thinking, the kids are at school.

1456
01:59:23,314 --> 01:59:27,660
What do you say we go home
and curl up in bed and watch a movie?

1457
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:30,116
-The kids?
-Yeah.

1458
01:59:30,946 --> 01:59:33,199
You dropped them off, right?

1459
01:59:34,533 --> 01:59:39,414
You okay? Oh, my love, hey, don't cry.

1460
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:47,009
Have I not loved you enough today?
Is that it?

1461
01:59:51,258 --> 01:59:53,010
It's okay. Hey.

1462
01:59:55,387 --> 01:59:58,106
What do you say? What do you say?
Let's go play hooky.

1463
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:01,022
Huh?

1464
02:00:04,813 --> 02:00:06,360
Let's get you home.

1465
02:00:08,234 --> 02:00:09,406
Okay.

1466
02:00:25,626 --> 02:00:28,926
It was while on a survey here
on the summit of Mont Orford

1467
02:00:29,004 --> 02:00:32,850
that Hydro workers stumbled upon the
remains of Bernard ”Boogie” Moscovitch,

1468
02:00:32,967 --> 02:00:35,390
who went missing more than 30 years ago.

1469
02:00:35,719 --> 02:00:39,314
His friend, Barney Panofsky,
producer of the long-running soap

1470
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:42,564
O'Malley of the North,
was the only suspect in the case.

1471
02:00:42,643 --> 02:00:47,319
Our findings show that Mr Moscovitch
died by either a severe beating to the skull

1472
02:00:47,398 --> 02:00:52,655
with a blunt instrument, or perhaps injuries
sustained from a fall of considerable height.

1473
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:56,115
But there is no evidence
of gunshot wounds whatsoever

1474
02:00:56,407 --> 02:00:59,035
Retired Detective Sean O'Hearne
whose book about the case

1475
02:00:59,118 --> 02:01:02,839
was both a commercial and critical failure,
had only this to say.

1476
02:01:02,913 --> 02:01:04,961
Just because he didn't shoot him,
doesn't mean he didn't kill him.

1477
02:01:05,374 --> 02:01:07,627
This just brings us one step closer
to proving the truth, okay?

1478
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:08,757
Thank you. Thank you.

1479
02:01:08,836 --> 02:01:11,385
The pathology report
suggesting that the victim's injuries

1480
02:01:11,463 --> 02:01:15,559
were consistent with a sky-diving fall
doesn't shed any new light

1481
02:01:15,634 --> 02:01:18,137
on who may have been responsible
for this death.

1482
02:01:18,721 --> 02:01:21,395
But at least one part of a 30-year mystery

1483
02:01:21,473 --> 02:01:23,350
-has finally been solved.
- Just turn that off.

1484
02:01:30,524 --> 02:01:31,696
Kate?

1485
02:01:32,276 --> 02:01:34,074
Kate, what is this?

1486
02:01:35,404 --> 02:01:38,078
What is...
A regular payment out of the company?

1487
02:01:40,034 --> 02:01:41,160
Oh, that.

1488
02:01:42,161 --> 02:01:44,129
For years now,
Daddy's been paying some guy

1489
02:01:44,204 --> 02:01:47,128
to make up those fake tabloid items
about Solange.

1490
02:01:48,167 --> 02:01:51,137
-Why?
-I don't know. To make her feel good.

1491
02:01:51,670 --> 02:01:54,219
He even went so far as to get them
faxed from Bulgaria,

1492
02:01:54,298 --> 02:01:55,766
just in case she checked the number.

1493
02:01:55,841 --> 02:01:57,184
Bulgaria.

1494
02:01:57,468 --> 02:01:59,311
Daddy asked me to keep them going.

1495
02:01:59,386 --> 02:02:00,433
Here.

1496
02:02:06,226 --> 02:02:11,528
"To my wife Miriam Grant Panofsky,
I leave our city condo

1497
02:02:13,025 --> 02:02:16,700
"and the adjoining plot to my own
in Mount Royal Cemetery,

1498
02:02:17,071 --> 02:02:20,575
"where my wish is for her
to be buried alongside me."

1499
02:02:20,699 --> 02:02:22,417
He shouldn't have included this.
It's not fair to her.

1500
02:02:22,493 --> 02:02:24,461
I mean, she's married to Blair.

1501
02:02:24,536 --> 02:02:26,163
Only until death do them part.

1502
02:02:27,206 --> 02:02:28,378
Right.

1503
02:02:31,794 --> 02:02:32,841
One last thing.

1504
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:40,846
He left Boogie money, "To publish
any original writings of his choosing

1505
02:02:41,553 --> 02:02:43,021
"whenever he should return."

1506
02:02:44,765 --> 02:02:48,190
See? He always thought
Boogie would come back.

1507
02:03:02,491 --> 02:03:04,914
Dad? Hey.

1508
02:03:10,332 --> 02:03:13,461
Here, Dad. Just don't tell Kate, okay?

1509
02:03:53,709 --> 02:03:57,054
Oh, we used to love the water bombers
when we were kids.

1510
02:03:57,171 --> 02:03:58,844
You remember, right, Dad?

1511
02:04:27,242 --> 02:04:30,166
The pathology report
suggesting that the victim's injuries

1512
02:04:30,245 --> 02:04:34,466
were consistent with a sky-diving fall
doesn't shed any new light...

1513
02:04:43,675 --> 02:04:45,803
We only go around once, my friend.
