1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,108
I've been in the marketplace,
trading.

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,478
You're both terrible liars.
(Laughter)

3
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:40,425
- We are best heading north.
- We double back on ourselves,

4
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,440
pick up the trade winds and head
off to Shanti,

5
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:47,337
a place where everyone has a past
and nobody asks questions.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,578
Sounds a delight.

7
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,679
(Thud)

8
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:51,615
Sinbad: We've been hit!

9
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:07,863
- Anwar: We must have hit coral.
- There is no coral in these waters.

10
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,459
Rocks then.

11
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:12,609
What are you doing?
Are you insane?

12
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:15,002
Never get off the boat,
not at sea.

13
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:19,106
We need to know
what state she's in.

14
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,201
What was that?

15
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,660
I saw something!

16
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:43,462
- Get him up. Get him up!
- Gunnar: Pull! Pull!

17
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,165
(Grunting)
I don't see him!

18
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,071
He's not there.

19
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,076
Sinbad!

20
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:02,432

21
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,982
(Gasp)
(Panting)

22
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:49,190
(Splutters)
(Coughing)

23
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:52,661
(Gasping and panting)

24
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,397
- You can thank me later.
- What for?

25
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:59,434
Oh, I don't know.
Saving your life?

26
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:12,239
Come on.

27
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,419
You weren't hard to spot.

28
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,789
It was the screaming
that really did it.

29
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:38,837
Make yourself comfortable.
I'm making something for your wounds.

30
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm Sinbad, by the way.

31
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:05,190
Hello, Sinbad.

32
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,068
Okay.

33
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:17,260
(Pained hiss)
Sorry.

34
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:20,430
- Coral can really sting.
- Coral?

35
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:22,645
- That was a shark.
- A shark?

36
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:25,312
Yeah. Some kind of sea beast
or something.

37
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,058
- A sea beast?
- Yeah? What?

38
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,186
In these waters?
Well, at least your humour survived.

39
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,922
(Laughs)

40
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,626
Let's see.

41
00:04:55,387 --> 00:05:00,224
I'd love to stay, really,
really I would,

42
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:03,749
but I have a ship and
a crew waiting for me.

43
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:06,476
Whoa!

44
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,795
Welcome to the island of
Roisin Moor.

45
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,532
- You?
- Mm-hm.

46
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:14,139
Doesn't that get lonely?

47
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:17,463
I entertain myself.
(Laughs)

48
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:31,808
Gunnar, we're wasting our time.
We need to be searching the water.

49
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,478
The current dragged us here.
Perhaps it dragged Sinbad here, too.

50
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,781
We're not dealing
with currents or tides.

51
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:39,317
I know what I saw down there!

52
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:45,028
A great tail, scales.

53
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,966
It severed the rope.

54
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,460
Then pray we find him first.
(Frustrated sigh)

55
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,311
Ah!

56
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:18,153
(Thud)

57
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,735
We thought we'd lost you.

58
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,124
Oh! You found me.

59
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:37,653
You think we'd leave you?
(Laughs)

60
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:41,293
How did you make it here?

61
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:43,143
The gods were
looking out for you.

62
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:45,780
Ah, I just have an instinct for survival.
(Gunnar laughs)

63
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,238
And let me just say straight off,

64
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,230
I don't blame any of you
for what happened.

65
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:54,076
I took the risk, I know.
It's just that sometimes,

66
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,668
being the hero's
a tough place to be.

67
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:01,363
Aha, I see.

68
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:04,029
Perhaps you could define hero.

69
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:11,804
(Laughs)

70
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,812
(Water trickling)

71
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:25,421
- So, you're here alone?
- With the odd guest.

72
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:28,639
Not alone. I'm free.

73
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:32,739
Here there's no one to tell me
what to do or when to do it.

74
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,430
You look tired, Sinbad.

75
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:38,030
We should get you back.

76
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:40,743
Yes, and no more swimming,

77
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,128
not until you've practiced.

78
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:44,238
Sinbad: I think I had it
under control.

79
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,923
Think you didn't.
(Laughs)

80
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:50,514
Your hospitality is kind, but we have
a long journey ahead of us.

81
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:54,348
Well, may your journey be
full of adventure and excitement

82
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,603
that leaves you breathless for more.

83
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:05,568
- I need to eat.
- Good.

84
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:08,291
Cook will make you something.

85
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,193
Here.

86
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,474
Roisin: Of course.
(Laughs)

87
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,490
May I?

88
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,828
I don't know what you think you're doing
in there, but it ends now, okay?

89
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,454
Have you forgotten
who we're running from?

90
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,169
Nala, she saved my life.

91
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:41,390
And we risk ours
every moment we waste.

92
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,585
I can't keep living like this.

93
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,768
I mean, we're not even living at all.
We're running.

94
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,182
Every day we're running,
scared of dying.

95
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,673
Do you think Akbari is chatting over wine,
debating the meaning of life?

96
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,104
He will find us.

97
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,405
Then go without me.

98
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:03,377
If that's how you feel, just go,

99
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:07,894
get on with your lives and
let me get on with mine.

100
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:10,630
I'm cursed, Nala. Me.

101
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,995
It's me who has to live with it,

102
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,326
not you. I'm staying.

103
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:29,903
For a desert island,
you sure have a lot of trinkets.

104
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:33,707
Yeah. You'd be amazed
what washes up here.

105
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:58,297
Nala: Gunnar?

106
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:03,100
We've gone to hell for you.

107
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:06,271
One night, one night
where I don't feel like me.

108
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,191
- You understand that, Gunnar, right?
- Yeah.

109
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:13,247
And I want to write poetry,
but life's a bitch and you're cursed.

110
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:14,949
Thank you.

111
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,086
Be on the ship by first light,

112
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:20,885
or believe me, hero,
we'll go without you.

113
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,985
Look, the last thing I want to do is
cause trouble with your friends.

114
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,951
- If you want to go, then go.
- No, no, no, really.

115
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:49,710
But I will have to leave soon.

116
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:52,599
As long as I'm back by dawn.

117
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:54,310
I mean, not that I want to
rush anything.

118
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:55,989
(Laughs)
I should hope not.

119
00:10:57,445 --> 00:11:00,357
Not on your last night of freedom.

120
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:36,088
I want to know the life I saved.
Tell me everything.

121
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:49,142
Could be some kind of bone.

122
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,537
Pressure of the water must have
forced it through.

123
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:54,860
I've never seen any creature
that would belong to.

124
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,306
Save your concern, Rina.
Sinbad's alive and well.

125
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:08,188
So, I have a problem with Nala.

126
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:12,176
(Laughs)
You're not alone in that.

127
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,514
Anyway, I don't want to talk
about Nala.

128
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:19,693
Well, indulge me.

129
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:23,920
I am dying
for some conversation.

130
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,703
(Laughs)
Okay.

131
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:35,867
It was Basra, so crowded,
you couldn't move,

132
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:40,577
so hot,
you couldn't breathe.

133
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:46,929
I was with my...

134
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:59,466
Nala... was the only person who
did not weaken by the heat.

135
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:06,576
The dust.
She was like an angel.

136
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:16,763
Tell me about Gunnar.

137
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:21,759
I am starting to think that
you only want me for my mind.

138
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,058
He had these scratches on his chest,
four, I think.

139
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:37,378
- Other than that, he was...
- Stay away from the water tonight.

140
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,372
I don't like how it feels.

141
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,877
(Thud)

142
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:51,115
The thing that drove us here,
it's still down there.

143
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:59,222
He knows how to lift the spirits,
doesn't he?

144
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:08,406
Sinbad. Wake up.
It's nearly dawn.

145
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,981
Your friends are waiting.

146
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:20,356
Gunnar and Nala, remember?
(Sighs)

147
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,758
I've never heard those names.

148
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,629
We go to sleep now.

149
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,945
Okay.

150
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:46,400
(Clicking)
(Coughing)

151
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,111
Help me, please.

152
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,508
- What's happening?
- The curse.

153
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:51,128
The curse?

154
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:53,267
(Grunting)
I have to get off the island!

155
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,461
Who did this to you?

156
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,306
My grandmother.

157
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,552
She cursed me
because I betrayed her.

158
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:02,716
A curse in the moment of anger,
that's not hatred.

159
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,288
That's her pain.

160
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:10,729
- Your grandmother loves you.
- Hate, definitely hates me.

161
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:13,250
Think back, Sinbad,
to the time before the curse,

162
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:15,461
a time when you knew you were loved.

163
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:18,024
Think. I can help you, Sinbad.

164
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,841
Tell me a happy memory
and the curse will go.

165
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:24,093
(Gasping)
Every night,

166
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:29,109
she used to tell me the stories of Arabia,
of the legends.

167
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:35,777
She told me, above all those in the stories,
that I was her hero.

168
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:41,717
And then I broke her heart.

169
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,020
What have you done?

170
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:45,336
(Coughing)

171
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,706
No, good memories only!
(Coughing)

172
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:52,342
Not bad memories.
(Coughing)

173
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,915
Stories of Arabia,
tell me one now,

174
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,897
the ones your grandmother told you.

175
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,233
My grandmother?

176
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,969
I never knew her.
(Panting)

177
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:24,181
I never knew her.

178
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:46,493
I bring news, my lord.

179
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:49,187
Sinbad is no ordinary man.

180
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:51,665
He's surrounded by magic.

181
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,570
You insult the memory of my son.

182
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:56,078
Sinbad is nothing,
least of all magic.

183
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,909
A curse from an ancestor,
his grandmother.

184
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,207
It binds to him like a river weed.

185
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:08,008
We need only find the source and,
inch by inch, we will draw him in.

186
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,715
We've already tried.

187
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:12,171
Every guard in Basra
has been searching for her.

188
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:15,834
Your ways.
I have others.

189
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,189
(Clunking in distance)

190
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:35,538
- Go easy with the paprika.
- So easy with the advice.

191
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:40,361
Please don't tell me how to make gulyasleves.
I grew up with this.

192
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:43,713
For a while, anyway.

193
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:46,901
Rina, it's past sunrise.

194
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:50,753
Sinbad may not be coming back.
(Chopping)

195
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,541
- Nala: Rina, he's not coming.
- Then I'll bring him back.

196
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:15,206
On this ship at dawn.
He knew that.

197
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,645
And he knows what will happen
if Akbari finds us.

198
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:20,009
- He has a curse!
- He's made a choice.

199
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,760
So we just let him die?

200
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,578
He knows his own mind, Rina.

201
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:29,325
As you do yours.

202
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,953
So go, try and bring him back.

203
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:37,240
Anwar, if the curse has taken hold,
he will need you. Hurry.

204
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:39,966
Waiting puts us all in danger.

205
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:46,540
(Sighs)

206
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:49,430
Ah. I've never felt so alive!

207
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:55,592
That's good. Because we are
going on a big walk,

208
00:18:55,616 --> 00:19:01,139
an adventure. I'm going to take
you to a very special place.

209
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:05,546
It's so beautiful and happy

210
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:08,235
that nothing bad on Earth
could ever touch it.

211
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:20,315
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

212
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:31,114
Don't touch me.
Get your hands off me.

213
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,827
Get your hands off me!

214
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,510
Fish bladder, delicious.

215
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:58,705
You're bleeding again.

216
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,905
Ah, it's that damn...

217
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,846
Nala: What's wrong, Cook?

218
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:15,001
- Four scratches you said?
- What?

219
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:19,323
Would've been five if this
hadn't got stuck in the hull.

220
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,009
Always the way.

221
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:23,902
At least try to make some sense.

222
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:27,131
This is no bone.
This is a fingernail.

223
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:29,149
(Laughs)

224
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:33,866
Right. So we're looking for a giant
sea beast with a missing fingernail?

225
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:40,968
A place of shining treasures,
song of enchantment: Siren.

226
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:44,683
There was no song.
Can we please get back to--

227
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:49,654
No, no, Roisin was singing, in her cabin.
If you hadn't called me--

228
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:51,734
It wasn't a woman in the water.

229
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:55,609
Oh, that demon's
whatever she needs to be.

230
00:20:55,632 --> 00:21:03,879
Take human form long enough
to harvest every good memory he has.

231
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:12,834
Piece by piece,
she takes his mind until he is drained.

232
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:19,356
Not a man anymore:
An empty shell on the beach.

233
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,669
Just the sound of wind in his head.

234
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:34,423
What's the rush?

235
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,595
 I thought we were
masters of our own destiny.

236
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,979
Yeah.
We have to be there before sunset.

237
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:46,478
Just like my... someone I knew.
Stickler for timekeeping.

238
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:49,835
Someone you either loved so much,
you can't bear to speak their name,

239
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:53,044
or someone you hated and want to forget?

240
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:58,345
- Loved.
- Ah.

241
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:03,829
My brother, Jamil,
my greatest friend.

242
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:09,231
- And he was never late?
- Oh, no.

243
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:12,363
Even the cockerel went by him.
(Laughter)

244
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,102
And he'd always let me sleep in
as long as possible.

245
00:22:21,246 --> 00:22:23,923
"Brother, when you're asleep,
you're not in any trouble,"

246
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:26,075
that's what he used to say.

247
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:28,845
Jamil! No!

248
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:32,047
He should have left me asleep.

249
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,917
(Coughing)

250
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,259
Something doesn't feel right.
(Choking cough)

251
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:53,516
I feel like I've lost something.

252
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:58,014
I can't remember.
I can't remember!

253
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:04,445
Sinbad!

254
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:20,581
Still hot.

255
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:24,115
Bed's been slept in. Still warm.

256
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:26,696
Water retains heat for at least an hour.

257
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,276
Body temperature's lower, would remain
constant for a shorter length of time.

258
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,531
He was here within last half-hour.

259
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:37,609
I think Sinbad's alive.
He survived the curse.

260
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:53,077
- What is that?
- Rina, move. Run! Run!

261
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:02,494
Pull out my teeth, put out my eyes.
I will never give him up.

262
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:07,474
Oh, you won't need to.
You cursed too well.

263
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:12,053
Sinbad is forever connected to you,
like a heartbeat.

264
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:15,341
And so you will find him.

265
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:21,171
Beware my curse, Taryn.

266
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:25,692
Yours is not the strongest magic in Basra.

267
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:45,405
I didn't understand it at first,
what I felt when I saw your grandson.

268
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:50,878
That such things could still be possible!

269
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:53,881
(Laughs)

270
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:59,517
(Sighs)

271
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:03,122
- That thing, it was a ghost?
- Not possible. They don't exist.

272
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:04,390
(Screaming)
(Thud)

273
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:06,526
(Screaming)

274
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:08,553
What?

275
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:12,097
Come on, Sinbad,
we're nearly there now.

276
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:22,769
Wait, wait. What are you doing to me?
No, no, I don't feel like me.

277
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:28,647
Because you're tasting freedom.
(Laughs)

278
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:35,859
Come on, nobody can resist this place,
not even you.

279
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:40,748
And I'm a real stickler for timekeeping,
just like my brother.

280
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,693
You have a brother?

281
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:45,915
Jamil, my greatest friend.

282
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,077
Jamil, that name.

283
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,601
What about you?
Any brothers or sisters?

284
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:56,411
Uh...
I thought I had someone.

285
00:25:57,433 --> 00:26:01,402
You do, my darling.
You have me.

286
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,002
All men.

287
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:09,894
Bone density puts them in their early 20s,

288
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:12,936
which rules out age-related tooth loss.

289
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,366
Remember Sinbad,
the man we came to find?

290
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,930
Yet they've all got teeth missing.

291
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,260
Doesn't make any sense.

292
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:31,107
Yes, it does.
Found them in her cabin.

293
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,095
We've got to get to Sinbad!

294
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,354
(Gasping)

295
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:04,963
- That's Lord Akbari.
- This is my nightmare, ghosts.

296
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:11,068
I don't think they're ghosts.
I mean, Akbari's not dead, is he?

297
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:13,380
And even if he was,
what would he be doing here?

298
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:17,566
Does nothing makes sense?
Has he lost his mind?

299
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:19,902
Lost his mind?

300
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,247
Come on,
let's get out of here.

301
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,253
Something is stealing his memories.

302
00:27:29,277 --> 00:27:32,200
I'll explain,
but we've got to find Sinbad.

303
00:27:49,408 --> 00:27:51,709
You asked for me, brother?

304
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:57,917
You think I would not hear
of Taryn's return?

305
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,633
Or your growing obsession now turns
to egregious assault and blood,

306
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:05,146
and now to kidnapping.

307
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:10,251
- You mistake my age for apathy.
- And you mistake my pain for obsession.

308
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:14,988
Since you find it impossible to give up your mage,
you may keep her.

309
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:19,420
I'm grateful for that, my Lord.
Though my methods may be questionable,

310
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:22,227
I assure you my motive is sound.

311
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:29,478
And you will go with her from Basra,
from Arabia.

312
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,737
You will settle in a part of this world
so far from here,

313
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,590
so far from the goodness I'm building,

314
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:39,050
you may live out your lives
in black-hearted abandon.

315
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:43,818
But you will never claim my title
or my affections in this lot.

316
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:47,319
My Lord, I beg you, not this.

317
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:56,570
You're dead to me, Akbari.
I've written it so.

318
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:05,076
You, who claim such humanity,

319
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:11,776
you can build a thousand schools of learning,
but you'll never know the workings of a heart.

320
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:21,153
Be gone by nightfall.

321
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:25,404
(Grunt)

322
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:42,766
If we've been together for so many years
then why haven't I seen this place before?

323
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:49,506
But you have, my love. Remember?
This is my sacred temple.

324
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:54,011
No.

325
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:57,298
- Give me the key.
- This can't be it.

326
00:29:57,322 --> 00:29:59,318
- Not just us.
- But my darling, it is.

327
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:05,331
It's me and it's you.
That's what life is.

328
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:11,569
No, no, it's not. I have family,
friends, a mother.

329
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:18,612
- A mother? Where?
- I don't know where. I just feel it.

330
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:27,593
You have no one.
No one but me.

331
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,408
Give me the key.

332
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:41,632
Come on.

333
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:47,374
No! I'm not alone.

334
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,796
- I'm loved.
- My love.

335
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,510
(Smack)
(Thud)

336
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:58,594
(Sighs)
You're alone, just like me.

337
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:15,781
My lord, we must move quickly.

338
00:31:15,804 --> 00:31:19,878
- This cannot look like murder.
- Let it look like what it is.

339
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:23,442
My son is dead.
I'm a murderer.

340
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:28,502
I've lost everything I ever loved.
Call the guards.

341
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:35,508
Your ways have taken me
so far from who I am,

342
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:37,874
I can never get back.

343
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:41,192
Let me give you what you need.

344
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:45,430
You as emir,
Sinbad in your grasp.

345
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:53,467
You're grieving.
Let me help you.

346
00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:00,032
Let me make this all better.

347
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:27,467
Anwar: Come on.

348
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:36,593
- It's locked.
- What, you were expecting a welcome party?

349
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:46,268
(Gasps)
It's okay. Come on, you're okay.

350
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,466
Where...

351
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:51,433
- I need your help, my love.
- Call me by my name.

352
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:54,251
If you want your name,
remember your mother.

353
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:56,476
She's the one who named you.

354
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,229
We were just talking about her.
What was she like?

355
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:04,775
- You think I'll find my name with her?
- Yes.

356
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:12,705
She lost her mind when I was born.

357
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:16,212
What?

358
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,680
There are no stories.
There's nothing to tell.

359
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:27,954
There's nothing?

360
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:29,892
Hurry up.

361
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:33,663
If you have nothing good to
tell me...

362
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:37,205
You and I must part.

363
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:43,514
Stop! Let him live and
I will give you my memories.

364
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:47,037
- Your life for his?
- It's a beautiful story.

365
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:51,604
Don't you want to hear it?
Happy memories from my childhood.

366
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:56,835
Rina, she's stolen his memories,
she'll do the same to you.

367
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:02,203
Your parents loved you very much?

368
00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:06,860
I was more precious to them than gold.

369
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:10,931
And they loved me very much.

370
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:17,254
One morning we began our great adventure.

371
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:26,683
To the house of a great man,
so rich even his servants had servants.

372
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:30,916
What he didn't have was happiness.

373
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,488
This man, he had no children of his own,

374
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:37,756
and he longed to hear laughter
in his enormous house.

375
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,178
- Let him go.
- Tell me all of your story.

376
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:48,031
- Let Sinbad go.
- Sinbad...

377
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:58,140
Tell me all of your story.

378
00:34:59,537 --> 00:35:05,949
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because we love you.

379
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:12,838
- Tell me all of your story.
- He didn't want to hear laughter.

380
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:17,428
- And he didn't need another servant.
- Roisin: No bad memories!

381
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:25,224
He wanted a living thing to own forever.
He bought me and made me his slave.

382
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:28,736
- No, you promised me happy memories!
- Keep this memory!

383
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:30,552
(Screams)

384
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:34,075
It was my family who sold me.

385
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,110
(Muffled scream)

386
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:39,188
And I never saw them again!

387
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,344
(Gasps)

388
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:41,538
(Grunt)

389
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:49,984
Rina.
(Sighs)

390
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,180
It's so good to see you.

391
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:59,234
Thank you.

392
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,862
Can we please get out of here now?

393
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,895
- Sinbad, they're your memories.
- My memories?

394
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:17,323
The bad ones, the ones she couldn't handle.
It's good you don't have them, come on.

395
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,940
- She's right.
- No, no.

396
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:21,042
It's better without them.
No more nightmares.

397
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:23,711
They're a part of me.

398
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:27,815
I want my life back.

399
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:41,495
(Gasps)

400
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:50,137
No, Sinbad, not your grandmother.
There's a curse!

401
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:54,722
I'm sorry.

402
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,244
I'm sorry for what I did.

403
00:38:01,314 --> 00:38:02,548
(Gasps)

404
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:16,894
We've got to go.
We need to get you off land.

405
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:48,224
(In gruff voice)
Help me. Sinbad... Help me.

406
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:53,798
Sinbad, help me...

407
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:58,826
Help me...

408
00:39:08,444 --> 00:39:14,370
Rina.
About what you said earlier.

409
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,059
Don't tell me you believed it too.

410
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,863
- Mm, these gulya...
- Sleves.

411
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,626
- Best I've ever had.
- Mm!

412
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:36,669
- Rina: Thank you.
- Cook, take the tiller.

413
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:57,140
I've spent so long wanting to be
anybody but me,

414
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:06,753
so I wouldn't have
the pain or the memories.

415
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:12,737
But I wouldn't
trade them for a second.

416
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,174
So, that's really your type?

417
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:21,150
Needy?
(Laughs)

418
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:25,783
And I have always had
a thing about long nails.

419
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:37,364
- Help me... Sinbad.
- Grandma?

420
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:43,352
- Help me!
- Dark powers. A trick!

421
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:48,012
- I have to go back home.
- Put it from your mind.

422
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,947
- Forget you saw it.
- Could you?

423
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,468
She's my family. I have to.

424
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:57,611
You heard the man.

425
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:00,754
Let's get to it.

426
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:10,120
