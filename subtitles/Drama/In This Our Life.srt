1
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:13,781
- Afternoon, Tom.
- Hello, Mac.

2
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:15,613
- What are you doing Sunday?
- Nothing.

3
00:01:15,787 --> 00:01:17,277
- I'm going fishing.
- Fishing?

4
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:20,721
Me, I like to lay around of a Sunday
and drink beer in my undershirt.

5
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:23,224
Yes, sir, that's what I like.

6
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:27,228
- Howdy, Mr. Timberlake.
- What you call him Mr. Timberlake for?

7
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,299
You've known him for 20 years,
ain't you?

8
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,868
Yeah. That's why.

9
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:39,672
- Oh, Mr. Timberlake?
- Oh, hello, Parry.

10
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:43,679
Mr. Timberlake, Mr. Fitzroy, he most politely
wants you to be home this afternoon.

11
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,647
- All right.
- He called you, but you was already gone.

12
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:50,276
And Mr. Fitzroy said that he'll be
at your house between 5 and 5:30.

13
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,423
- Thank you.
- He also wants me to pick up...

14
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,923
...Miss Stanley's car.
Give it a wash and a polish.

15
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,117
Very well.

16
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:40,265
Oh, your mother told me the other day
that you were at the head of your class.

17
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,136
- Yes, sir, I reckon that's so.
- Well, that's fine, Parry. I'm proud of you.

18
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,333
Thank you, sir.

19
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:48,838
Well, I don't see Miss Stanley's car
here, Parry.

20
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,482
- I guess she's not home yet.
- I'll just wait, Mr. Asa.

21
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,674
All right.

22
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,456
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Roy.

23
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:04,185
Mother wants you.

24
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:07,627
My, that's a pretty dress.
I like you in blue.

25
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,700
You like me in green.
You like me in yellow. You just like me.

26
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:12,962
I guess that's it. Peter home yet?

27
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:16,505
No, he got a call
and had to go back to the hospital.

28
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,101
Hello, Minerva.

29
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,244
Miss Roy, just look at all these presents.

30
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:24,508
My, my. They sure is beautiful.
I reckon this won't be like the other times.

31
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:28,414
I reckon Miss Stanley going to get married
sure enough this time. Bless the Lord.

32
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,020
This time it's the right man.

33
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:34,124
- He certainly is. Poor Mr. Craig.
- What do you mean, poor Mr. Craig?

34
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:38,353
Nothing, child, except the gentleman
what gets Miss Stanley, gets a handful.

35
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,795
That dress fit you exactly. Didn't need
no fixing when you was married.

36
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,491
Stan has got a smaller waist.

37
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:47,570
And Miss Stanley takes after her mama
and her Uncle William, the Fitzroy side.

38
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,105
Now you just like your grandma,
Mrs. Timberlake.

39
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,900
Only I'm not so pretty.

40
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,006
No.

41
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:58,472
Did you come straight home
from the factory?

42
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,641
Yes, I came straight home.

43
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,084
- What kept you so long?
- I walked.

44
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,814
Why did you walk?

45
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:08,357
Pleasure, that's all. Just pleasure.

46
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,552
- William's coming over.
- Yes, I know.

47
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:13,960
Well, aren't you gonna change your clothes?
Make yourself presentable?

48
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:16,430
- Better put on your other suit.
- Why should I?

49
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,035
Haven't you any pride? Or don't you care?

50
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:20,466
I guess, I don't care.

51
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,370
You don't care, that's the trouble.
If you cared things wouldn't be as they are.

52
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:26,374
Well, things are as they are.

53
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:27,842
Oh, you're a fool.

54
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:29,446
Lavinia.

55
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:32,378
I don't blame William
for taking advantage of a fool.

56
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:35,884
My dealings with your beloved brother
are things of the past. Done.

57
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:38,181
We have other and better things
to think about.

58
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:41,621
- Such as?
- Our children, their future.

59
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,624
Stanley's marriage.

60
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:46,628
- Well?
- Lavinia, I have a feeling...

61
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,959
It's nothing definite, just a feeling.

62
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,999
- That things are not as they should be.

63
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:54,097
No one's making her marry Craig.
It's her own choice.

64
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,297
Ha. She doesn't know her own mind.

65
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:59,466
Oh, that's nonsense, Asa. She knows her
own mind better than the rest of us.

66
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:04,907
That's their ring. William and Charlotte.
Hurry, Asa. Go down and let them in.

67
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:09,583
That's Mrs. Carter's old family
clock. It came from Brussels, Belgium.

68
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:13,952
I remember. She told me.
It's real nice of Mrs. Carter, isn't it?

69
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,185
- Look, William. Isn't this a lovely shape?
- Junk.

70
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:18,556
- William.
- Asa.

71
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,664
- Hello, Charlotte.
- Hello, Asa.

72
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,459
My, so many lovely presents.

73
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:24,727
- How are you?
- Lf I listened to the doctor...

74
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:27,167
...I'd be in a wheelchair.
I don't and I'm not.

75
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:30,672
- He's feeling better lately, aren't you?
- I missed you at the office.

76
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:32,503
Tax payments have been coming up...

77
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,043
...against the old
Timberlake-Fitzroy Corporation.

78
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:37,875
There's no sense in throwing
money away on a dead company.

79
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,449
This statement says
the corporation's dissolved.

80
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:44,248
It needs your signature.
I promised to have it in the mail tonight.

81
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:48,792
Where's Stanley?

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,919
Ever since you gave her the car, William,
we've seen very little of Stanley.

83
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,328
Ha. The way she drives, like a lunatic.

84
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,094
"Eighty-five in the city limits,"
the last ticket said.

85
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,001
If it had been anybody else but my niece,
she'd have gone to jail.

86
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:05,067
What Stanley needs is a firm hand.

87
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,768
Somebody with gumption enough
to make her toe the line.

88
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:10,540
A man with enough red blood in him
to boss her.

89
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,205
William, how you talk.

90
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,249
Well, she'll have a husband pretty soon.

91
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,910
- That'll be his job.
- Craig's not up to it.

92
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:20,421
He's soft.
She'll twist him around her little finger.

93
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,992
- Maybe not.
- There's two ways of breaking a colt.

94
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:24,685
Stanley needs a whip.

95
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:27,923
And Craig won't bring out the whip
any more than you would, Asa.

96
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,363
If he's anything like Daddy,
Stanley's very lucky.

97
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:34,494
Oh, you and your daddy.
Asa may understand you well enough.

98
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:37,073
But I could tell you a thing
or two about Stanley.

99
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,847
Give me five minutes.

100
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,087
If we wanna change our minds,
there's still time.

101
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,955
- Do you?
- No.

102
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:59,062
Are you afraid?

103
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:03,595
I know, you're thinking about Roy.

104
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:07,770
We're in love. Nothing else matters.

105
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,406
Nothing else matters.

106
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,303
That's right.

107
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,810
I adore you, Peter.

108
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:35,396
- Good evening.
- Miss Stanley. I'm taking the car...

109
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,866
...to give it a wash and polish.
- All right. Thank you, Parry.

110
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:47,403
Uncle, dear, I'm so sorry to be late.

111
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,513
- Hello, Charlotte.
- You'd better be sorry.

112
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:53,276
- I couldn't help it. I've been shopping.
- I don't like that dress. It's short.

113
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,511
- You should like it. It cost you enough.
- Your dresses are short.

114
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:59,213
- Did Parry pick up your car?
- He got it when I came in.

115
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:03,122
I wish you'd let him do the driving. It would
save me paying your speeding fines.

116
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:07,321
Stanley, you've got to stop driving like
a lunatic or I'll let them take you to jail.

117
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:10,366
You wouldn't let them do that to me,
would you, Uncle William?

118
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:13,026
I don't want people tagging along
everywhere I go.

119
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:16,662
I have half a mind not to give you
something I've got in my pocket.

120
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:18,604
- Which pocket?
- Here, stop it, stop it.

121
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:21,109
Keep your hands out of my pockets.
Get out, I say. Ha-ha-ha.

122
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,713
Oh, Uncle William, don't be mean to me.
I can't wait.

123
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,975
Well, there.

124
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:29,018
It's a good deal more than you deserve.

125
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:32,645
Uncle, you darling. Father, look.
Isn't he marvelous?

126
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:36,123
- That's very generous of you, William.
- Thank you, too, Aunt Charlotte.

127
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:37,727
It's wonderful, darling.

128
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:41,332
Father's giving Stanley some of Grandma's
furniture to start housekeeping.

129
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,566
How about a kiss for your old uncle,
huh?

130
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:47,070
You're not gonna turn your cheek, are you?
Not after that check.

131
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:50,366
This on top of everything else,
Uncle William, you're so good to me.

132
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:54,410
- I reckon it won't be lasting you long.
- There's plenty more where that came from.

133
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,012
What? You minx.

134
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:00,442
You hear that? You'd better keep
a close hand on your pocketbook.

135
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:02,745
What'll you have to drink?
- Whiskey and water.

136
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:05,856
- Remember what the doctor said.
- The devil with that fussbudget.

137
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:08,584
Nobody's gonna tell me what I can do
and what I can't.

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,819
That's the spirit, Uncle William.

139
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,987
I suppose you've heard what I'm doing
with that white elephant...

140
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,895
...that used to belong to your family
up on Waverly Street.

141
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:20,970
I have a row of taxpayers in mind.
And maybe some apartments up above.

142
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:25,872
It was a good building in its day, I reckon,
but these are no times for sentiment.

143
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:28,137
You can't waste good land
with deadwood.

144
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:32,147
A thing is profitable or it isn't.
And if it isn't, it's through. Finished.

145
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:35,115
That's the way I look at things.
That's how I got where I am.

146
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:37,277
- Peter.
- Hello.

147
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,888
Why didn't you come in?

148
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:41,423
How's Lavinia?
- I, uh, thought you were upstairs.

149
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,618
We're all having a drink to Stanley.

150
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,025
Please come in, Peter.

151
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:48,688
She isn't the only one. Not by a jugful.

152
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,858
Why, Uncle William.

153
00:09:58,443 --> 00:09:59,467
Why, Peter, how nice.

154
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:02,670
Hello, Aunt Charlotte. Mr. Fitzroy.
Ha. Uncle William.

155
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,974
Drink, Peter?
- Uh, straight whiskey.

156
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,119
Dr. Buchanan tells me
that you're doing good at the hospital.

157
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:10,117
He says you're clever with the knife.

158
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:13,815
- Not any more than some of the others.
- He is, Uncle. He's just modest.

159
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:17,860
If you stick to business, there's no reason
why you shouldn't take Buchanan's place.

160
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,998
He's pretty old. I'm not sure
he's as good as everyone thinks.

161
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,257
By the way, where's Craig, Stanley?

162
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:27,970
Craig? Oh, he's at a meeting of something
or other. He's coming by for me later.

163
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,905
Probably one of those civil-liberty affairs.
Civil liberty. Ha.

164
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:35,603
If you ask me, they're concerned only
with liberty for the wrong people.

165
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,743
Who are the wrong people, William?

166
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:41,179
The people who aren't worth a cent
and never will be, that's who.

167
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:45,618
Stanley, if this young man of yours doesn't
get rid of those half-baked radical ideas...

168
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,418
...he'll never be able
to build up a decent law practice.

169
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:50,788
On the other hand, if he's sensible...

170
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:54,227
...I might throw a few sizable fees
in his way myself.

171
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,867
- Perhaps he prefers his ideas to fees.
- What's that?

172
00:10:57,035 --> 00:11:00,266
Craig has convictions. I like
that he wouldn't be Craig without them.

173
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:04,772
He has to earn a living. Don't forget that.
A pretty handsome living, if I know Stanley.

174
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:07,377
I needn't worry as long as I have you,
Uncle William.

175
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,240
You little flirt. Ha-ha.

176
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:13,077
If I were Craig, you bet I'd never let
a pretty girl like you out of my sight.

177
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:16,118
Ha-ha-ha. Why, Uncle William,
what a thing to say.

178
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:19,222
I wonder, darling,
if you realize just how lucky you are.

179
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:21,985
Does anyone ever know?

180
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,027
Yes, I do.

181
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:29,530
I declare, Peter, your wife still thinks
the sun rises and sets with you.

182
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:31,959
Excuse me.

183
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:35,572
We must go upstairs, too, William.
We haven't seen Lavinia.

184
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,002
How is Lavinia, Asa?

185
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:40,804
- When are you coming to see me?
- I'll come very soon.

186
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,839
Thanks again for the check, Uncle.

187
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,451
I wonder if you'd mind
trying on the dress.

188
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:50,179
I've got just about as far as I can
without a fitting.

189
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:52,516
Not now, Roy, please.

190
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,657
But we haven't much time.
I'll be back at the shop on Monday.

191
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:58,694
You go out every evening.
You want it to be right, don't you?

192
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:00,023
I don't care.

193
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,259
I don't care whether it's right or not.

194
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,502
Stanley.

195
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,706
Stanley, what is it, dear?

196
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,372
What's the matter?

197
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,575
Nothing.

198
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:22,242
You and I used to tell each other
everything.

199
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,944
It's different now.

200
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:26,181
What's happened to us?

201
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:30,221
Roy...

202
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,589
Oh, I don't know.

203
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,392
I don't either.

204
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:37,659
That's just the trouble.

205
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,300
Roy, I'll try on the dress.

206
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:44,135
Maybe tomorrow morning.
I've got a headache.

207
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,528
- Peter.
- Yes?

208
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,300
- Where are you going?
- Away.

209
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,478
What do you mean?

210
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:24,513
I'm going away. Out of town.
What do you think I mean?

211
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:31,879
I'm leaving for Lynchburg.

212
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,081
A doctor sent for me for a consultation.

213
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:37,756
Oh, Peter, why didn't you tell me?

214
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:41,330
I won't tell you the crazy thing
that went through my mind.

215
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:43,490
I'm terribly silly because I'm in love.

216
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:46,967
I guess you can't be so in love
without being silly about it.

217
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:50,103
What am I saying, Peter?

218
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:53,801
I'll try to be more sensible.
Just give me a moment.

219
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:58,244
It's my fault for being so clumsy,
about everything.

220
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:04,645
If you'd told me that you were going,
I would've had you packed like a good wife.

221
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:08,818
You'll want your dark-green tie
because it goes well with your gray suit.

222
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,790
And you like things to match.

223
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:13,260
Yes, I like things to match.

224
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:16,696
I like everything to match,
to come out right, to...

225
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:19,598
Oh, I guess I'm talking nonsense.

226
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:22,763
No, you're not talking nonsense, Peter.

227
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:25,735
There's something wrong
and you're unhappy.

228
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,504
Anyone with eyes can see that.

229
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:33,509
Peter, I think I know
what's the matter with us.

230
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:36,209
It's the way we're living here.
We're never alone.

231
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,684
People are always around.

232
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:41,851
When you come back, let's find a place
where we can be to ourselves.

233
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:44,990
Maybe if we'd done it a long time ago
in the very beginning.

234
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,655
It was my fault. It seemed like
letting the family down. It's different now.

235
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,631
- Father says they can manage.
- I don't wanna think about it.

236
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:54,738
You won't have to. I'll find a place.
Get us all moved into it.

237
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,204
You won't have to worry your head
about it.

238
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:01,601
- Roy...
- Please, Peter, I...

239
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,237
I'm tired of decorating
other people's houses.

240
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,045
I want one of my own and that's not all.

241
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,415
I want us to have a family...

242
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,822
...and to make our home just what
we'd wanted for ourselves and for them.

243
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:18,256
I don't want a home.

244
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,126
I don't understand. What do you mean?

245
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,757
We used to talk about it enough,
about being free.

246
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,528
We meant what we said, didn't we?

247
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:29,867
Why, yes, of course.
But what has that got to do with it?

248
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,375
Don't ask me to explain. I haven't any
reason. No reason on God's earth.

249
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:37,912
I just want you to remember what we said,
what we promised each other.

250
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:42,508
I remember there were to be no strings
to our marriage.

251
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:46,379
Even when I was little,
I hated anything with strings to it.

252
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:49,291
So we're free. Both of us, free as air.

253
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:54,088
You're a good sport, Roy, the best thing
that could happen to anybody.

254
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:56,460
Much better than I deserve.

255
00:15:57,168 --> 00:16:01,161
I haven't been much of a husband
but I love you.

256
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,000
Heaven knows I love you.

257
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:49,745
Oh, hello, Craig. Come on in.
She's upstairs.

258
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:53,784
- Oh, Stanley, Craig's here.
- Hello, darling.

259
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,721
I'll be right down.

260
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:59,329
You just missed Uncle William.
He made you and Stanley a very nice gift.

261
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:03,957
You mean Stanley. The only thing he ever
gives me is a lecture on my radical views.

262
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:06,433
- How was the meeting?
- Oh, dry as dust.

263
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:10,973
It's pretty hard to concentrate on slum
clearance and Stanley at the same time.

264
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,172
Darling.

265
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:20,578
I can't go out tonight, I've got a
dreadful headache. I don't think I'd better.

266
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,946
I'm so sorry to disappoint you.

267
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,020
Poor darling. Anything I can do?

268
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,386
No, thank you. I'll just lie quietly
until it passes over.

269
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,493
I wish I could stay and look after you.

270
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,888
Pretty soon I can.

271
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,294
You're sweet, Craig.

272
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:37,661
Much too sweet.

273
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:21,543
Good morning, Mr. Timberlake.
I'll go tell Mrs. Fitzroy you're here, sir.

274
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,407
Mr. Timberlake.

275
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:30,417
Asa.

276
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:35,919
What is it? What's the matter?

277
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,759
I thought she might be here.

278
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:40,328
- Who? Who is it you're looking for?
- Stanley.

279
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:43,399
But Stanley's never here this early
unless she stays overnight.

280
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,297
I thought that's what she'd done.
Spent the night here.

281
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,233
But her car is still in the garage.

282
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,430
What car, Asa?

283
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,336
- What's happened?
- I don't know what's happened.

284
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,603
It's... It's about Stanley.

285
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,576
Stanley? What about her?

286
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,477
Asa, don't stand there like a dumb statue.
What about her?

287
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,811
Well, she's gone. She's not at home.

288
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:04,420
Well, where is she?
She's got to be somewhere.

289
00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:07,148
Of course she's somewhere.
She can't possibly be lost.

290
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:10,418
If she'd had an accident,
we would've heard from the hospital.

291
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:12,255
Who saw her last? Where was she?

292
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,758
After you left last night,
she went to her room.

293
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:18,595
This morning she was gone with most
of her things. She hadn't slept in her bed.

294
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:21,897
- Lf anything's happened to that girl...
- William, nothing's happened.

295
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,802
You know how impulsive Stanley is.

296
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:28,001
She probably thought of someone to visit,
and everyone was asleep when she left.

297
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:31,342
Good gracious, she's able
to take care of herself, isn't she, Asa?

298
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,617
What about Craig? Maybe she's with him.

299
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:36,844
No, no. Craig drove me over here.
He's waiting outside in his car.

300
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:39,114
This beats anything I ever heard.

301
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,383
Poor Lavinia,
she must be in a dreadful state.

302
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,255
We've got her under drugs.
I'm not worried about Lavinia.

303
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:47,625
I'm not even worried about Stanley.
It's Roy I'm thinking about.

304
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:49,698
Roy? What's she got to do with it?

305
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,529
There's something you're not telling us.
I knew that.

306
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,139
Yes, that's true.
I didn't even want to say it to myself.

307
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:57,638
Peter left last night too.

308
00:19:57,808 --> 00:19:59,901
What's that? What do you mean?

309
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:04,309
He said that he had to go to the hospital
at Lynchburg, for a consultation.

310
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:07,349
We called the hospital
and they knew nothing at all about it.

311
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:10,916
Oh, so that's how it is.

312
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,352
But... But you can't think they're together.

313
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:17,324
You... You can't think
that she's gone off with Peter.

314
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:18,689
I've stopped thinking.

315
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:22,355
But Stanley couldn't.
She... She isn't like that.

316
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,866
I don't know what she's like.
I don't know what anybody's like.

317
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:29,563
She's like all the others, I suppose.
The rest of her generation.

318
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,871
No scruples, no religion, nothing.
By heaven, Charlotte, if a niece of mine...

319
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:37,377
You mustn't get excited,
you'll make yourself sick.

320
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:40,517
After what I've done for that girl.
After what I've done.

321
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:42,675
It doesn't make much difference,
does it...

322
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,616
...when a person wants something else.

323
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:54,888
She's not there.
They don't know anything.

324
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:03,403
We'd better drive straight home.
It's almost an hour since we left.

325
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:05,940
She may be back by now.

326
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,604
You know,
anything could have happened.

327
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,341
She might suddenly have taken it
into her mind to visit somebody.

328
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:16,077
Peter may have gone someplace else.

329
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:19,814
It's conceivable that two people
could leave a house on the same night...

330
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,584
...and not necessarily go together.

331
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:35,494
- Aren't you coming in?
- What for?

332
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:36,901
I guess you're right.

333
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:38,905
But don't do anything foolish, Craig.

334
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:41,044
You're young, you've got work to do.

335
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:44,773
- You've got your whole life ahead of you.
- Yeah.

336
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,424
Stanley.

337
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:02,393
You too, Father?

338
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:06,093
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
From here you looked just like her.

339
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,367
- I guess I've just been hoping that...
- You can stop hoping. Mother got a letter.

340
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:16,241
- Oh, then they... They...
- Yes, they did.

341
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:19,246
You didn't expect anything else, did you?

342
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:23,043
- What did Stanley say?
- Just what they say in books.

343
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,280
"I'm sorry to hurt Roy and Craig.
Peter and I had to be together.

344
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:29,324
We were meant for each other. "
Meant for each other.

345
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:32,360
You don't believe such things happen
until they happen to you.

346
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:35,896
Listen to me, Roy.
Stanley's weak but you're strong.

347
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:38,398
The weak always have the strong
to protect them.

348
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:41,299
But the strong must protect themselves
or go under.

349
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,235
I'll protect myself, never fear.

350
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:46,342
What are you going to do?
Are you going to let them...?

351
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,377
I'll never stand in their way.
Craig's a lawyer.

352
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:51,411
He may be glad to arrange it.

353
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:53,777
Oh, I can't bear to hear you talk like that.

354
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,476
We have to talk the way we feel.
That's the way I feel.

355
00:22:56,654 --> 00:22:58,986
Roy, where are you going?

356
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:01,522
To work, of course.
Why should I stay home?

357
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,627
No, thanks. I'm not wearing black.

358
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:09,323
Not for Peter. Not for anyone.
I've got a life to live and I'm gonna live it.

359
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,966
Father, I don't like this hat anymore.

360
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:14,969
I saw one yesterday
in a show window downtown.

361
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:18,108
Bright red with a black feather in it,
off at an angle.

362
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:19,902
What could be more appropriate?

363
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:23,877
Roy, dear, I know what you're going
through but don't let yourself get hard.

364
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:30,320
Be soft, like you?
No. I'll go out and get what I want.

365
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:32,216
The way Stanley gets what she wants.

366
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:35,256
The way Uncle William got away
from you everything he wanted.

367
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:38,156
I'm going to be like the Fitzroys.
They know how to live...

368
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,730
...and I'm gonna be just as hard as they.
That's the way to be happy.

369
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:45,096
No, Roy.
Hard things are apt to get broken.

370
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:48,568
Uncle William hasn't broken.
Stanley hasn't broken.

371
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:52,231
But you, your life is broken.

372
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,809
I'm not gonna be like you.

373
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:33,277
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

374
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:35,543
- Peter.
- Darling.

375
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:39,780
- It's been 22 hours, I counted them.
- So did I.

376
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:43,415
I wish you didn't have to live
at the hospital. When can we be together?

377
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:46,358
I guess I'm lucky to have a job
under the circumstances.

378
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,055
You have only one job that matters.

379
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,531
- You?
- Me.

380
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,932
- Love me?
- Mm.

381
00:24:58,108 --> 00:25:00,838
Peter, I've got a surprise for you.

382
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:08,784
Where'd you get it?

383
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:11,284
Ask no questions.

384
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:15,949
- I know. You rented it.
- No, silly. It's ours.

385
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:18,651
How? You can't buy a machine
like this on what I make.

386
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:21,821
Peter, you needn't look so serious.
I didn't steal the money.

387
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:24,331
Remember Uncle William's check?

388
00:25:25,002 --> 00:25:26,401
Stanley, you didn't cash it.

389
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,234
Well, why not? It's mine.
He gave it to me.

390
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,567
That was for your wedding.

391
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:35,141
Well, we're gonna be married.

392
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:39,676
If you don't understand why you shouldn't
have, there's no use my explaining.

393
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,943
Peter, you're away working
most of the time...

394
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,849
...and I'm stuck up here all by myself.

395
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:47,513
I haven't even got my car.

396
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:52,287
That's why I bought the Victrola
to help me pass the time.

397
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,488
You talk about passing the time.

398
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:56,565
Stanley, do you realize what we've done?

399
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,963
All the unhappiness we've caused?

400
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:02,196
If we don't make up for that
in our own happiness, heaven help us.

401
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:04,498
Stanley...

402
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,074
...you're not even listening.

403
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:10,202
This is the time to face it.
Now when we're starting out.

404
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,348
We've got to be happy, Stanley.

405
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:13,847
We've got to be happy.

406
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:17,220
But, silly, we are happy.

407
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:18,615
Or aren't we?

408
00:26:20,824 --> 00:26:23,520
Sure. Of course, we're happy.

409
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:27,790
Then I can have it, can't I?
Just this one thing?

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,464
You know how I love to dance.
You love to dance, too, don't you?

411
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,115
My lands. You're still here, Miss Roy?

412
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:57,726
I had some late orders to get out.

413
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:00,993
How do you like working here, Parry?

414
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:05,961
Oh, I like it, Miss Roy. Ma and I
sure do appreciate your giving me this job.

415
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:08,798
It's mighty good to have money
coming every week regular.

416
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,899
What did you do with your
first week's salary, Parry?

417
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:13,906
Well, part of it went for rent.

418
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:16,375
Didn't you buy anything for yourself?

419
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:20,142
Yes, ma'am. I bought a book I've been
wanting to get at the second-hand store.

420
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:21,841
Book?

421
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,111
What book?

422
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:28,790
<i>Blackstone's Commentaries: Foundation of
Common Law and Modern Jurisprudence.</i>

423
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:32,918
- What in heaven's name is that?
- It's a law book, ma'am.

424
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:36,623
Why, Parry, you have in mind
to study law someday? Is that it?

425
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,667
Yes, ma'am.
But I reckon it's not gonna be easy.

426
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:42,566
What made you decide
to become a lawyer?

427
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,535
Well, you see, it's like this, Miss Roy.

428
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,737
A white boy, he can take most any kind
of job and improve himself.

429
00:27:50,914 --> 00:27:55,317
Well, like in this store. Maybe he can get
to be a clerk or a manager.

430
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:57,680
But a colored boy, he can't do that.

431
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:00,186
He can keep a job or he can lose a job...

432
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:02,382
...but he can't get any higher up.

433
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,461
So he's got to figure out something
he can do that no one can take away.

434
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,757
And that's why I wanna be a lawyer.

435
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:10,957
Why, Parry, that's wonderful.

436
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:14,661
I had no idea. Minerva never told me.

437
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:17,973
Ma's afraid for a colored boy
to have too much ambition.

438
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:21,941
Oh, she just wants to save you
from disappointment. But you'll make it.

439
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:24,979
You're going to be a lawyer.
I'm certain of it.

440
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:30,643
Thanks, Miss Roy.
I'll remember your saying that. I sure will.

441
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:33,922
- Goodbye, Parry.
- Good night, Miss Roy.

442
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,463
Craig.

443
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:45,699
Oh.

444
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:48,303
Hello, Roy. How are you?

445
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:52,636
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Fine too. Heh.

446
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,209
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes, it's nice.

447
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,542
Um... Sit down, won't you?

448
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:04,551
Well, I just got my decree.

449
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:08,484
Puts a period on what's happened.
I'm a free woman.

450
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,150
If we could only get free from ourselves.

451
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:14,491
- What have you been doing?
- Oh, nothing, everything.

452
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:17,395
- Which?
- Is there any difference?

453
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,432
I've been keeping very busy.

454
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:21,400
Decorating homes for new lovers?

455
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:25,098
- Do you have to talk like that?
- I don't have to talk at all.

456
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:29,268
- Cigarette?
- Thanks, I have some of my own.

457
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,210
I'm not picking them off the street yet.

458
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:35,584
You like being hurt, don't you?
You get a pleasure out of it.

459
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:38,448
Lying down,
letting misery wash over you.

460
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,316
Well...

461
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:42,482
Have you tried working?

462
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,354
What for?

463
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:47,156
For yourself. To keep your self-respect.

464
00:29:47,331 --> 00:29:50,459
- You can't keep something you haven't got.
- How about your practice?

465
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:53,797
- The things you believe in?
- I don't believe in anything.

466
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:58,767
I've just talked with a colored boy,
Parry Clay.

467
00:29:58,942 --> 00:30:00,466
He's going to be a lawyer.

468
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:03,078
No woman or nothing on earth's
gonna stop him.

469
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:07,182
You've got everything that boy wants
and you sit here feeling sorry for yourself.

470
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,114
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

471
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:12,585
- It's none of my business what you do.
- Wait. Don't go yet, Roy.

472
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:15,953
- Well?
- Um...

473
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:20,929
I'm sorry. I guess I ought
to be ashamed of myself.

474
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:23,328
- Maybe if...
- If what?

475
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,365
Well, I thought, maybe if we...

476
00:30:25,802 --> 00:30:28,168
- Oh, no, never mind.
- Say it.

477
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,033
Well, could I see you sometime?

478
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,003
Whenever you wish.

479
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:35,941
- Lf you get yourself a haircut.
- I'll even get a red tie to match your hat.

480
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:38,809
- That might not be a bad idea.
- Where can I reach you?

481
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:41,507
Call me at the office. Not at the house.

482
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:44,017
For the present,
let's keep this between ourselves.

483
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:46,178
Just as you say.

484
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:56,293
The impudence of the girl.
The plain, brazen impudence.

485
00:30:56,466 --> 00:31:00,698
But the poor girl is bored and unhappy
with Peter away at the hospital so much...

486
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,465
Oh, is she? Well, that's just too bad.

487
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,871
She disgraces the family,
runs off with her sister's husband...

488
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:11,343
...and now we're expected to feel sorry for
her. Well, this is a fine state of affairs.

489
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:13,107
Hello.

490
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:14,775
Anything happen?

491
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:17,613
Your sister has the brass
to write me a letter...

492
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,382
...asking me to send her car down
to Baltimore.

493
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:24,156
I can't bear to think
of my poor child lonely and unhappy.

494
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:26,852
It's too bad about your poor child.

495
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:29,957
Roy hasn't a car.
Perhaps she'd like to use it.

496
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,727
- No, thanks.
- I quite understand, my dear.

497
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:36,600
Besides, it is Stanley's car.
It's just standing idle in the garage.

498
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:38,832
Why don't you send it?
What's the difference?

499
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:42,672
I'll do no such thing. Nothing on earth
can make me send her that car.

500
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,218
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

501
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,416
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye and good luck to you.

502
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:58,220
Thank you.

503
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:19,672
Feel any different?

504
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,819
Mm... Not much.

505
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:24,850
I don't.

506
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:27,419
Let's go dancing.

507
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:31,055
- All right. Where?
- There's a place called The Shanty...

508
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:33,719
...on Macon Street.
I hear there's very good swing.

509
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:35,797
The Shanty it is.

510
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,297
Hey, wait a minute.

511
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:15,901
- Happy?
- Mm-hm.

512
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:23,511
You're sweet.

513
00:33:24,614 --> 00:33:26,309
Darling.

514
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,483
I might even turn out to be a good wife.

515
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:39,561
- Imagine me being a good wife. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

516
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:43,632
Oh...

517
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,133
- Why don't you watch where you're going?
- Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.

518
00:33:47,304 --> 00:33:49,602
Here, let me fix it for you.

519
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:54,105
- That's all right.
- It isn't all right.

520
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:58,213
It's a dirty shame on your nice dress.
Besides, a drink's a drink.

521
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:00,576
Fortunately, there's more
where that came from.

522
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,615
And the next one's on me.

523
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:04,686
Uh, don't bother.
We were leaving anyway.

524
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:07,914
That's too bad. I thought now
that we're acquainted, we could talk.

525
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:10,787
- Peter, I don't wanna go yet.
- Don't you think we ought to?

526
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,327
What'll you have? Oh, champagne.

527
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:14,929
Oh, I guess he can afford it.

528
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:16,224
- Oh, waiter?
- Yes, ma'am?

529
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,094
- A split of champagne.
- Yes, ma'am.

530
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:19,929
Look, Peter. He's sound asleep.

531
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:22,571
Oh, never mind the dormouse.
He works all day.

532
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,003
This is the way he relaxes.
Don't you, honey?

533
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:27,200
- Huh? What's that?
- Never mind. Never mind.

534
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:29,641
He loves to go places,
although nobody knows why.

535
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,906
- Doesn't he dance?
- Can't quite call it that.

536
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:34,550
- You're good. I was watching you.
- I'm crazy about it.

537
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:37,812
- I could die dancing.
- Try it with him sometime. Ha-ha-ha.

538
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:40,081
Well, here's to accidents.

539
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:44,325
We haven't even introduced ourselves.
My name's Betty Wilmoth.

540
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:47,190
- That's the body of Jim Purdy.
- Mine's Stanley Kingsmill.

541
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:49,423
And this is my husband, Peter.

542
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,365
Married? I'd never have guessed it.
You look too happy.

543
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:56,300
- Almost six hours now.
- Just today?

544
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:59,772
Hey, Jim, wake up. This is a party.
They've just been married.

545
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:01,808
- Huh? What's that?
- They've just been married.

546
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:04,071
- Married? Who?
- Our friends, the Kingsmills.

547
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:05,578
Peter and Stanley.

548
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:08,912
Oh, congratulations
and many happy returns.

549
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:13,351
The longest sentence of the evening. It took
a wedding to do it. Here's luck to you both.

550
00:35:13,523 --> 00:35:15,150
Thank you.

551
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:19,361
- Darling, we've got to be going.
- Oh, so soon. That's a shame.

552
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:22,464
- Peter, can't we stay a little longer?
- Please, dear. It's late.

553
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:25,726
Oh, but I'm having fun.
I haven't had fun for such a long time.

554
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:29,338
- I've gotta be at the hospital in the morning.
- Oh, what's the difference?

555
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:30,905
This is a wedding celebration.

556
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,872
That's an awful chic hat you're wearing.
Where'd you get it?

557
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:36,706
- In Richmond. We come from Richmond.
- Let me see.

558
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,543
- Who do I know that lives in Richmond.
- Stanley, come on.

559
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:42,912
- Good night, Miss Wilmoth.
- Oh...

560
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:46,647
- Well, don't be such an old stick.
- Stanley?

561
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,585
I'm staying whether you are or not.

562
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,459
Well, go on. What are you waiting for?

563
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:01,494
Honey, you sure you know
what you're doing?

564
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:04,505
I always know what I'm doing.

565
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,210
3512 Charles Street.

566
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,052
Driver?

567
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:24,318
- Take me back to The Shanty.
- Okay.

568
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:36,132
No, don't take me back.

569
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:38,171
Take me home.

570
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:33,423
Darling.

571
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:41,431
Darling.

572
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,975
Stanley.

573
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,114
I thought you were never coming home.

574
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,981
You ought to be spanked.

575
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:01,619
For being a good wife?

576
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:09,431
For making me love you so much.

577
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,994
Darling.

578
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:14,701
You're everything I want. Everything.

579
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:16,338
Darling.

580
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:17,700
Darling.

581
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:19,273
Am I, darling?

582
00:38:21,678 --> 00:38:24,613
Well, how do I look?

583
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:26,381
Like a human being.

584
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:29,518
Last time I saw, you looked like
something stuffed with straw.

585
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:32,052
Funny what a park bench will do
if you stay long.

586
00:38:32,222 --> 00:38:34,816
Parks are for the very rich
or the very poor.

587
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:37,619
Say, you've got intelligence.

588
00:38:37,794 --> 00:38:41,855
That's a trait every man admires
in another man.

589
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,124
You're good-looking.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

590
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:48,933
I don't want to hear anything
or feel anything...

591
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:51,005
...except the wind blowing in my face.

592
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:53,233
I know how it is.

593
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:57,441
Let's talk about us.

594
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:58,979
What have you been doing?

595
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:02,675
Yesterday I went down to my office
and blew the dust off the top of my desk.

596
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:04,877
- Good.
- My father kept up the rent...

597
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:07,648
...but, uh, he couldn't keep up the clients.
Ha-ha.

598
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:09,519
By the way, where are we going?

599
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:11,159
Not that it matters very much.

600
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:13,659
How about dinner at Williamsburg?

601
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,858
I want to go somewhere
I've never been before.

602
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,831
I don't care how far it is
or how long it takes.

603
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:21,664
I think I know a place.

604
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,068
It's in the Blue Ridge
outside of Lexington.

605
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,868
They call it an inn but it's really a farm.

606
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:29,136
- I hope it hasn't even a name.
- No, it hasn't.

607
00:39:29,312 --> 00:39:32,907
It's an old house on a side road
about 20 miles from nowhere.

608
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:36,984
Out of everywhere into nowhere.

609
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:39,178
Is that a poem...

610
00:39:39,355 --> 00:39:41,323
...or is it a wish?

611
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:51,264
Sorry. You'll have to turn back.
The road's closed.

612
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:54,335
- What's the trouble?
- There's a forest fire west of Hinsdale.

613
00:39:54,504 --> 00:39:57,405
- That's far from here.
- We're setting a check fire just ahead.

614
00:39:57,573 --> 00:40:00,098
- Can we see the fire?
- Lf you climb the hill, lady.

615
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:02,244
- Let's.
- Sure.

616
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:21,093
It's kind of frightening.

617
00:40:21,264 --> 00:40:22,458
Give me your hand.

618
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:25,100
- To keep me from being frightened?
- No.

619
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:27,099
Just because I want to hold it.

620
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,467
- You mind?
- No, of course I don't mind.

621
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:33,071
I'm very fond of you, Roy.

622
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:35,172
I think you're trying to be.

623
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,472
Trying your best.

624
00:40:38,815 --> 00:40:40,908
That fire over there
must be the one they set.

625
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:44,047
That's what we're trying to do, Craig,
isn't it? You and I.

626
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,710
What?

627
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:47,684
Start another fire.

628
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:50,985
That's what we want of each other,
isn't it? That's all we want.

629
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,755
I'd like to think of it as something more.
Something in itself.

630
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,559
- Permanent.
- Oh, don't use that word, Craig.

631
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,065
It frightens me.

632
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:02,568
There's nothing permanent but now.
The moment. That's all there is.

633
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:06,505
There'll be other moments.
And there'll be other days.

634
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:08,303
I'm not going to lose you.

635
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:10,639
You'll only lose me if you try to hold me.

636
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:12,178
Don't do that, Craig.

637
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:15,112
We should've learned that lesson by now,
both of us.

638
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:18,981
Never count on its lasting
and don't ask me to count on it.

639
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:22,124
- I can't think when you're so close to me.
- Then hold me closer.

640
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,486
I don't want you to think.

641
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:37,466
I offered to give him back the ring but there
wasn't anyone else he wanted to give it to.

642
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,973
He didn't want to have it around
to remind him, so I should keep it.

643
00:41:41,144 --> 00:41:44,204
As long as he felt that way about it,
why should I do otherwise?

644
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,540
It was his desire.

645
00:41:46,983 --> 00:41:50,043
- Put the things down there, Betty.
- What time does Peter get home?

646
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,483
Don't worry about him.
He never gets in till late.

647
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:55,681
I could do with a drink, honey. Oh.

648
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:02,155
What are you doing home so early?

649
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,794
- You seem overjoyed.
- How are you, Peter?

650
00:42:05,968 --> 00:42:08,630
Great. How are you?

651
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:12,172
We... We've been out shopping.
Stanley got the cutest hat and...

652
00:42:15,745 --> 00:42:18,680
- Come on in, Betty.
- No, I think I'd better be going.

653
00:42:18,848 --> 00:42:22,682
- No, come on in and have a drink.
- I'd better not. I'll call you tomorrow.

654
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:26,288
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it, honey.

655
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:28,651
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

656
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:30,252
I'll remember that, Peter.

657
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:32,826
- It was such a nice way to treat my friend.
- Friend?

658
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:35,589
She's the best friend I've found
in this place.

659
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:39,826
- Then you'd better get some new friends.
- Maybe I will.

660
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:42,197
But you'll approve of them even less.

661
00:42:42,371 --> 00:42:46,432
- What do you mean by that?
- Exactly what you think I mean.

662
00:42:48,878 --> 00:42:51,972
Stanley, we've got to stop tormenting
each other.

663
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,884
Look, I'm a surgeon.

664
00:42:57,053 --> 00:43:01,820
I've noticed lately when I'm operating,
my hands. I'm not sure.

665
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:03,456
I don't dare slip.

666
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,721
You could give up drinking.

667
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:08,955
There some things you could give up.
Running up bills I can't pay.

668
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:13,535
- Who do you think I am, your Uncle William?
- I do believe you're even jealous of him.

669
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:15,869
Shut that thing off.

670
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:18,300
I won't.

671
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,176
Do you hear me?

672
00:43:21,777 --> 00:43:25,543
- Shut that thing off.
- Keep away from me. I hate you.

673
00:43:25,715 --> 00:43:28,912
I hate the day I married you.
I hate everything about you.

674
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:30,518
You and your righteous airs.

675
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:32,813
Why don't you go back to Roy
where you belong?

676
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:35,822
She's just fool enough to have you.

677
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:46,298
Good afternoon, Miss Roy.

678
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:49,029
- Hello, Parry. How is everything?
- Oh, just fine.

679
00:43:49,205 --> 00:43:52,504
This is the kind of work I like.
Mr. Craig gives me time to study.

680
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:55,542
- What does your mother say?
- Oh, she's mighty proud, Miss Roy.

681
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:57,975
She thinks I'm almost a lawyer already.

682
00:43:58,147 --> 00:44:00,809
- Mr. Craig in?
- Yes, ma'am.

683
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:03,144
You better tell him
I'm here before I go in.

684
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:05,947
Oh, he'd give me a bawling out
if I kept you waiting.

685
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:08,522
- Thanks.
- Darling. I'm glad to see you.

686
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:11,558
- Craig.
- Sit yourself down.

687
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:14,225
I came to bring you a message
from Uncle William.

688
00:44:14,397 --> 00:44:15,864
- Or maybe that's just an excuse.
- Ha-ha.

689
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:18,592
- As if you needed one.
- Uncle William wants to see you.

690
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:21,032
He'll be at the house.
You're coming, aren't you?

691
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:22,796
Why, of course. What does he want?

692
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:24,940
He's never been anxious
to see me before.

693
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:26,836
Maybe he's suffered
a change of heart.

694
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:29,409
I suspect he wants to offer you
some legal business.

695
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,911
Well, I certainly could stand
one rich client.

696
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:35,915
- Make up for a lot of the others.
- Craig, I'm so proud of you.

697
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,379
- Proud enough to marry me?
- Maybe. Someday.

698
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:40,681
How about Christmas?

699
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:42,585
Christmas is too soon.

700
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:46,489
- Well, April then.
- Oh, no. Not April.

701
00:44:47,363 --> 00:44:50,628
I thought that was all over
for both of us.

702
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,395
I think it is, Craig, but I wanna be sure.

703
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,438
In the meantime, let's just be happy.

704
00:45:00,643 --> 00:45:02,907
The doctor says I'm getting older...

705
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:05,343
...although, I'm blamed if I feel it.

706
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:08,642
Anyway, I've got too many interests
to take care of myself.

707
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:12,845
And I've decided to entrust the management
of some of my affairs to others.

708
00:45:13,022 --> 00:45:16,185
I've done a good many things
for Stanley, the rascal.

709
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:18,793
And I figure it's about time
I did something for you.

710
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:22,556
The long and short of it, Craig,
is I believe you're honest and intelligent.

711
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:26,560
And I'd be willing to throw some
of the legal end of my business your way.

712
00:45:26,736 --> 00:45:28,897
That's very generous of you, Mr. Fitzroy.

713
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:32,268
Only one condition
I'm forced to stipulate.

714
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:36,377
You now represent certain persons
I can't approve of.

715
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:38,809
As a young lawyer
you had to take your clients...

716
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:41,677
...where you could find them but now...
- Wait a moment.

717
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:44,217
Just what clients are you referring to?

718
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:47,254
Young man, you don't expect me
to hire you as my lawyer...

719
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:49,618
...and let you bring
condemnation proceedings...

720
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:53,387
...to tear down my own houses?
- Oho. You're one of the property owners.

721
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:56,926
I am. And what's more,
those houses are plenty good enough...

722
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:58,589
...and have been for 50 years.

723
00:45:58,768 --> 00:46:00,065
That's just the trouble.

724
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,961
- Eh? How's that?
- I appreciate your offer, Mr. Fitzroy.

725
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,108
And now I understand
why you're making it.

726
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:07,401
Well, what about it?

727
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:09,441
Well, just as you say...

728
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:13,673
...I can't very well represent you
and be against you at the same time.

729
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,508
Just what do you mean?

730
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:18,279
- You'll give up the other things.
- I couldn't afford to.

731
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:21,218
Why not?
Those people can't pay you any large fees.

732
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,824
No, they can't pay much.

733
00:46:23,993 --> 00:46:25,392
But they're very good clients.

734
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:26,687
Young man...

735
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:30,093
...before you turn this offer down,
you should consider your future.

736
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,931
- You should think of Roy.
- He is thinking of me, Uncle.

737
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:36,405
Well, I am blessed if I know how.

738
00:46:37,006 --> 00:46:40,203
Well, I'm afraid I have to be going.

739
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,701
Good night, Mr. Fitzroy.

740
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:45,278
I'll walk out to the car with you.

741
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:50,151
- Mr. Timberlake.
- Good night, Craig.

742
00:46:56,959 --> 00:46:59,120
Well, can you beat that?

743
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:04,164
Turning down an offer like that
and actually patronizing me to boot.

744
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,528
Asa, what is this world coming to?

745
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:10,695
I doubt if their generation could do
a worse job of it than we've done.

746
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:14,509
Roy, you think I did the right thing,
don't you?

747
00:47:15,344 --> 00:47:19,542
Craig, is it too late for me to change
my mind about what you asked me today?

748
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:21,774
- You mean...?
- Lf the offer's still good...

749
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:25,250
...I'd like to marry you.
Just as soon as we can.

750
00:47:25,421 --> 00:47:27,184
Darling.

751
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:34,494
Hello.

752
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:36,324
Yes.

753
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:37,864
Yes.

754
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:40,058
This is Mr. Timberlake.

755
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:42,428
Baltimore calling?

756
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:51,211
I can't hear you very well.

757
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,608
What?

758
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:54,613
What's the name?

759
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:57,617
Betty Wilmoth?

760
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,947
Yes.

761
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:03,049
Yes.

762
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:09,563
When did it happen?

763
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:11,923
Yes.

764
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:14,201
Yes.

765
00:48:16,372 --> 00:48:19,967
Well, one of us will be there.

766
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:34,712
Roy. Craig.

767
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:37,225
Will you come in here, please?

768
00:48:43,933 --> 00:48:45,867
What is it, Daddy?

769
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:54,172
Roy.

770
00:48:54,343 --> 00:48:55,776
I have bad news.

771
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:58,106
It's about Peter.

772
00:48:58,447 --> 00:48:59,914
He died this afternoon.

773
00:49:00,282 --> 00:49:02,910
- Hey, what's that?
- Peter dead?

774
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:06,453
A friend of Stanley's telephoned me
from Baltimore.

775
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,889
But he can't be dead, Daddy.

776
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:11,754
- Peter couldn't be dead.
- Was it an accident?

777
00:49:13,028 --> 00:49:14,393
No.

778
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:16,588
No, it was not an accident.

779
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,124
Then why? What are you keeping back?

780
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:24,665
She told me
that Peter had killed himself.

781
00:49:25,808 --> 00:49:28,834
Killed himself? But he wouldn't.

782
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:31,707
Why on...? Oh...

783
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,178
Roy, darling.

784
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:35,943
Is that all she said? What about Stanley?

785
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:38,609
Stanley's in a bad way.

786
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:39,913
She found him.

787
00:49:40,256 --> 00:49:45,125
Peter's a coward to do a thing like that.
I've said that all along. Soft. No guts.

788
00:49:45,294 --> 00:49:46,522
Don't you dare say that.

789
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:49,163
It was her fault. She drove him to it.

790
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,702
Roy.

791
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:07,013
Oh, Craig, I'm sorry.

792
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:11,812
Darling, there's nothing you could've done.
That part's out of our lives. Over.

793
00:50:11,987 --> 00:50:13,352
Well, what's done is done.

794
00:50:13,522 --> 00:50:17,014
We've got to do something for Stanley.
Maybe I'd better go to Baltimore.

795
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:19,861
No.

796
00:50:20,629 --> 00:50:22,324
He was my husband.

797
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:24,864
Stanley's my sister.

798
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:26,900
I'll go and do what I can.

799
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:46,381
- Oh, you're Stanley's sister?
- Yes.

800
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:49,718
Please come in.
I'm so glad you're here, Mrs?

801
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:52,417
- Miss Timberlake.
- I'll take your bag.

802
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:54,062
Thank you.

803
00:50:56,498 --> 00:50:59,399
- How is she?
- A little quieter now.

804
00:50:59,568 --> 00:51:02,332
Poor dear,
she was almost out of her mind.

805
00:51:02,504 --> 00:51:04,938
And what of Peter?

806
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:08,338
His brother came down this morning.
He's making all the arrangements.

807
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,946
- I suppose you're taking Stanley back home.
- Lf she wants to come.

808
00:51:12,114 --> 00:51:14,912
I think she ought to get out of this house.

809
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:19,553
I've been doing shopping for her. I had to
go to six places to find a decent black hat.

810
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:21,781
All her hats are so gay, you know?

811
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:23,481
Just like poor Stanley.

812
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:25,058
Oh, was she gay?

813
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:27,422
I was afraid she'd been unhappy.

814
00:51:27,596 --> 00:51:32,329
- Well, she had to keep up, didn't she?
- Yes, I suppose she did.

815
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:36,267
I don't think she's asleep.
We'll go in and see.

816
00:51:42,845 --> 00:51:46,110
Stanley, dear. Stanley.

817
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:51,085
- It's your sister.
- Roy.

818
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:59,459
- Something terrible has happened. Peter...
- Don't talk.

819
00:51:59,628 --> 00:52:02,290
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Please stay with me.

820
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:05,661
When you're rested and feel better,
I'm going to take you home.

821
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,461
- Home?
- Yes.

822
00:52:07,636 --> 00:52:09,900
They don't want me. Nobody wants me.

823
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:14,133
They want you very much.
Mother and Dad.

824
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:17,210
- We all do.
- You don't hate me, Roy?

825
00:52:17,379 --> 00:52:20,212
- No, I don't hate you.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.

826
00:52:20,382 --> 00:52:22,942
I don't know why it happened.
I didn't know at the time.

827
00:52:23,118 --> 00:52:25,518
It's like lightning.
Like being struck by lightning.

828
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:28,953
Don't Stanley, don't. It's all over now.

829
00:52:29,124 --> 00:52:30,955
We have to live as we can.

830
00:52:31,126 --> 00:52:33,686
I couldn't help it.
I never could help anything.

831
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:35,352
You loved me when I was little.

832
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:38,664
- I still love you.
- Why did it happen?

833
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:40,426
Why'd it have to happen to me?

834
00:52:40,602 --> 00:52:43,002
Don't talk about it, Stanley.
Try not to think.

835
00:52:43,172 --> 00:52:44,662
He always wanted me with him.

836
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,298
He never even wanted me to leave
the house, not unless he was along.

837
00:52:48,477 --> 00:52:50,172
He was that way about me.

838
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:53,508
And now he's gone
and I can never see him again.

839
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:57,511
If he'd only told me what he was going
to do, I could've stopped him.

840
00:52:57,686 --> 00:52:59,210
Perhaps he was out of his mind.

841
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:01,288
No, he wasn't out of his mind.

842
00:53:01,457 --> 00:53:05,052
He did it because he couldn't live with me
and he couldn't live without me.

843
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:07,991
I really loved him. If I'd only showed him.

844
00:53:08,163 --> 00:53:10,495
Now it's too late. Too late.

845
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:13,362
Roy, what have I done?
He's gone. He's dead.

846
00:53:13,535 --> 00:53:15,366
Stanley, don't torture yourself.

847
00:53:15,537 --> 00:53:17,061
Life and death happen.

848
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,434
If it hadn't been for me,
he'd still be alive.

849
00:53:19,608 --> 00:53:21,473
He'd still be alive. I can't stand it.

850
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:24,540
Stanley. Stanley, listen to me.

851
00:53:24,713 --> 00:53:26,977
Repeat what I say right after me.

852
00:53:27,149 --> 00:53:29,310
Just say the words.

853
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:34,787
Say them very quietly
and soon you'll go to sleep.

854
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,051
I'm going to get better.

855
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:40,361
I'm going to go on.

856
00:53:40,529 --> 00:53:43,794
I'm going to get better.
I'm going to go on.

857
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:49,598
Everything will be all right.
In time, everything will be all right.

858
00:53:49,772 --> 00:53:52,172
Everything will be all right.

859
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:56,773
Just say those things over to yourself.

860
00:53:56,945 --> 00:54:00,437
Don't think of anything else.

861
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:03,181
And soon you'll go to sleep.

862
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:06,017
Soon you'll go to sleep.

863
00:54:06,188 --> 00:54:08,349
But you'll stay with me. I'm afraid alone.

864
00:54:08,524 --> 00:54:10,719
Don't worry, dear.

865
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:13,525
I'm here with you.

866
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,954
- Do me up.
- Darling, you're not going out in this dress.

867
00:55:48,123 --> 00:55:51,650
I'm not gonna wear black anymore.
It's depressing. It seems to blot me out.

868
00:55:51,827 --> 00:55:53,988
- But what'll people think?
- What they like.

869
00:55:54,162 --> 00:55:56,494
I'm fed up with pretending
something I don't feel.

870
00:55:56,665 --> 00:55:58,656
- Stanley...
- For months, I wished I was dead.

871
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:00,028
I'm tired of wishing it.

872
00:56:00,202 --> 00:56:02,568
I grieved for Peter,
I can't grieve anymore...

873
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:04,865
- Hello, Stanley, Daddy.
- Hello, Roy.

874
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,507
- How are you feeling?
- Not good.

875
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:10,202
Oh, I'm sorry. I won't be in to dinner.
I have to change.

876
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:12,475
It's nice someone's happy.

877
00:56:13,448 --> 00:56:15,245
I wonder what Roy's done to Craig.

878
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:18,580
- What do you mean?
- He's not the least amusing anymore.

879
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:20,551
They seem very happy, Stanley.

880
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:24,392
Well, I'm glad I brought them together.

881
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:26,155
I won't be in until late.

882
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:28,694
Where are you going, dear?
- For a drive.

883
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:30,729
Do be careful, darling.

884
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,963
- Oh.
- Hello, Stanley.

885
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:02,603
I didn't know you were here.

886
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:19,156
- Roy's dressing. She'll be down in a minute.
- Thanks.

887
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:30,997
Don't you dance anymore?

888
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,262
Not very much.

889
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:34,372
You used to be crazy about it.

890
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,802
What's the matter?

891
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:38,842
Oh, we've been sort of busy.

892
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,775
- We?
- Yes. Roy and I.

893
00:57:41,948 --> 00:57:43,575
Oh.

894
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,176
Doing what?

895
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:46,511
Lots of things.

896
00:57:46,686 --> 00:57:48,244
Tonight we're going to the opera.

897
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:50,286
Sound simply fascinating.

898
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:53,357
Just think what you escaped.

899
00:57:53,526 --> 00:57:55,323
Just think what you missed.

900
00:57:56,696 --> 00:57:59,130
Anyway, it's too late now.

901
00:57:59,732 --> 00:58:00,994
Hello, Craig.

902
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:03,135
Hello, darling. I think we'd better hurry.

903
00:58:03,302 --> 00:58:05,998
We have plenty of time.
Why don't you come with us?

904
00:58:06,172 --> 00:58:08,640
No, thank you.
I'll have to keep still at the opera...

905
00:58:08,808 --> 00:58:10,673
...and I'd do anything than keep still.

906
00:58:10,843 --> 00:58:13,403
- We'll see you later.
- I won't be here. I'm going out.

907
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:17,106
- Oh, well, good night.
- Good night.

908
00:58:35,668 --> 00:58:37,192
What is the matter, Stanley?

909
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,530
Stanley, what is it?

910
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:40,535
I can't bear it.

911
00:58:40,706 --> 00:58:44,164
I can't bear to see other people happy...

912
00:58:44,343 --> 00:58:46,311
...when I'm so miserable.

913
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:49,073
Can't you see I'll go out of my mind...

914
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:51,876
...if I have to sit by
and watch other people make love?

915
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:56,181
Can't you see?
Oh, Daddy, I wanna go away.

916
00:58:56,355 --> 00:58:58,880
I wanna go away before Roy's marriage.

917
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:01,583
I can't stand the wedding.

918
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,456
I wish I could fly.

919
00:59:03,629 --> 00:59:06,860
I wish I were rich enough
to buy a plane and fly away.

920
00:59:07,033 --> 00:59:08,864
You can't fly away from life, my dear.

921
00:59:09,035 --> 00:59:12,163
And you just can't sit and wait
for unhappiness to come to an end.

922
00:59:12,338 --> 00:59:13,362
It takes too long.

923
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:15,632
In my day,
we didn't talk about happiness.

924
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:19,244
If it came, we were grateful for it.
We were brought up in the belief...

925
00:59:19,412 --> 00:59:22,142
...that there were things more important.
- What things?

926
00:59:22,314 --> 00:59:24,646
Oh, old fogy, fantastic notions...

927
00:59:24,817 --> 00:59:28,981
...such as duty
and personal responsibility.

928
00:59:46,272 --> 00:59:49,867
It's a chronic condition
and probably nothing serious.

929
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:52,909
But I'd feel better
if he went down to Johns Hopkins...

930
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:54,637
...and had a thorough going-over.

931
00:59:54,814 --> 00:59:58,443
You know how he is. He won't admit it.
He's frightened to death of hospitals.

932
00:59:58,617 --> 01:00:00,744
- Stanley, dear.
- Hello, Aunt Charlotte.

933
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,410
I hope there's nothing wrong.

934
01:00:02,588 --> 01:00:04,681
Nothing that a visit
from you won't improve.

935
01:00:04,857 --> 01:00:08,452
- Run and cheer him up. He's in the library.
- Thank you, I will.

936
01:00:08,627 --> 01:00:10,788
I'll make the arrangements, Mrs. Fitzroy.

937
01:00:10,963 --> 01:00:11,987
Good evening.

938
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:17,360
- Uncle, dear.
- Stanley.

939
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:19,561
I'm so sorry you're not feeling well.

940
01:00:19,738 --> 01:00:21,501
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing at all.

941
01:00:21,674 --> 01:00:23,938
You know what alarmists
these doctors are.

942
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,738
Doctors and wives,
they're the same breed.

943
01:00:26,912 --> 01:00:29,142
A man gets a stomachache
and what do they think?

944
01:00:29,315 --> 01:00:30,942
They think all sorts of things.

945
01:00:31,117 --> 01:00:35,816
I swear you don't look sick. In fact,
you've never looked better. Or younger.

946
01:00:35,988 --> 01:00:39,185
Ha-ha. You're the kind of medicine
a man needs. Not that stuff.

947
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:41,121
I guess I'm...

948
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:43,089
Kill or cure.

949
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:46,331
Kill or cure, eh? Oh...

950
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:53,466
You're the one who could say a thing
like that and get away with it.

951
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:55,869
You're the only one I could say it to.

952
01:00:56,609 --> 01:00:59,442
- You're a rascal. That's what you are.
- So are you.

953
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:03,139
Oh, I know you go to church on Sundays
but you aren't fooling me.

954
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:05,647
- And you probably aren't fooling God.
- Oh...

955
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:09,686
Now, come on, Uncle William. Admit it.
And save us both the trouble of pretending.

956
01:01:09,855 --> 01:01:11,789
Stanley. Ha-ha-ha.

957
01:01:11,957 --> 01:01:13,754
You're the limit.

958
01:01:13,926 --> 01:01:16,360
Say, you know,
I'm feeling better already.

959
01:01:16,529 --> 01:01:17,894
How about a drink?

960
01:01:18,063 --> 01:01:20,122
- You wouldn't dare.
- Oh, wouldn't I?

961
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:22,324
- No.
- You'll see. I'll show you.

962
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:24,901
You've got to pamper
that delicate stomach of yours.

963
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,470
My stomach's as good as yours.
It's those doctors.

964
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,667
The idea of your being sick.
When your time comes, you'll die violently.

965
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:34,074
Like as not,
somebody's husband will shoot you.

966
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:38,881
Uncle, that little glass.
I told you, you were afraid.

967
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:41,212
Oh, I am?

968
01:01:43,489 --> 01:01:44,979
Say...

969
01:01:45,157 --> 01:01:47,352
...maybe you're trying to get rid of me.

970
01:01:47,526 --> 01:01:49,687
One of my heirs, you know?

971
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:51,557
Blessed if I'd put it past you.

972
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:54,858
- Kill the goose that lays the golden eggs?
- Oh... Ha-ha-ha.

973
01:01:55,034 --> 01:01:58,128
- Goose.
- Not on your life.

974
01:01:59,071 --> 01:02:01,005
That's marvelous.

975
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:03,107
Let's sit over here.

976
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:07,772
I haven't laughed so much since...

977
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:10,677
Well, not since before you went away.

978
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:12,817
Here's to us.

979
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:19,322
Uncle, dear, what are you leaving me
in your will?

980
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:22,221
- You little devil.
- No, come on, tell me. How much?

981
01:02:22,394 --> 01:02:24,919
When you ran off with Peter,
I cut you off. Every cent.

982
01:02:25,097 --> 01:02:27,895
Was it moral indignation? Or jealousy?

983
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:29,261
It was what you deserved.

984
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:33,064
Come on, let's not pretend. I've got as
much right to your money as you have.

985
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:35,730
- What?
- You cheated my father out of it.

986
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:39,366
- I did no such thing. That was business.
- That's just a nice name for it.

987
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:42,378
When you went into business,
he had the money and you didn't.

988
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:45,346
When you finished with him,
you had the money and he didn't.

989
01:02:45,517 --> 01:02:50,648
- What do you call that? I call it smart.
- You rascal. Ha-ha-ha.

990
01:02:50,823 --> 01:02:54,452
- Did your father tell you how I did it?
- No. How?

991
01:02:54,627 --> 01:02:58,757
Well, I got him to sink every cent
in new machinery.

992
01:02:58,931 --> 01:03:01,195
I saw the Depression coming
and he didn't.

993
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:03,096
Tobacco prices went to pot.

994
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:05,066
And there he was out on a limb.

995
01:03:05,237 --> 01:03:07,762
But you were partners.
Why weren't you out on the limb?

996
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,500
I was. But not on the same limb.

997
01:03:11,877 --> 01:03:16,075
At the receivership sale, I got someone to
bid on the shooting match, dirt cheap.

998
01:03:16,248 --> 01:03:19,445
Then I built up the business
to what your father never dreamed of.

999
01:03:19,618 --> 01:03:22,280
I gave him a decent job in the factory
and that's that.

1000
01:03:22,454 --> 01:03:25,150
Uncle William, you are wonderful.

1001
01:03:25,324 --> 01:03:27,383
I never knew what you saw in Peter.

1002
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:30,426
Or Craig either for that matter.
No gumption, either of them.

1003
01:03:30,596 --> 01:03:31,995
No one else around.

1004
01:03:32,164 --> 01:03:35,327
They're not up to us, Stanley.
Not a blessed one of them.

1005
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:36,968
What we want, we go after.

1006
01:03:37,136 --> 01:03:38,728
And what we go after, we get.

1007
01:03:38,904 --> 01:03:41,031
There's nothing worth getting here.

1008
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:42,639
Not in this place.

1009
01:03:42,808 --> 01:03:44,935
What are you hatching up
in that head of yours?

1010
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,475
Uncle, dear, I'm so unhappy.

1011
01:03:46,645 --> 01:03:49,170
I wanna get away from here
just as soon as I can.

1012
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:51,111
You'll make a trip? A vacation?

1013
01:03:51,283 --> 01:03:54,411
For longer than that. I wanna live
somewhere, I can't stand it here.

1014
01:03:54,586 --> 01:03:56,486
You'll get over that. Give yourself time.

1015
01:03:56,655 --> 01:04:00,386
No, I won't. You don't know what this
means to me. I'll go mad if I stay here.

1016
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,528
Nonsense.
You can't keep running away from life.

1017
01:04:03,696 --> 01:04:05,596
You've got the courage. Stay and face it.

1018
01:04:05,764 --> 01:04:07,425
Oh, I'm not afraid. It's not that.

1019
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,897
I don't care what people say.
I'm just bored.

1020
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:11,559
And it's horrible to be bored.

1021
01:04:11,737 --> 01:04:15,002
You're a spoiled child
and ought to be spanked.

1022
01:04:15,174 --> 01:04:17,608
- Well...
- I'm not gonna spoil you anymore.

1023
01:04:17,776 --> 01:04:20,904
- And you're not going away again.
- Uncle, dear. Just this one thing.

1024
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,846
I'll do anything else in the world. But I
won't give you money to go away with.

1025
01:04:25,017 --> 01:04:28,214
But why? I don't understand.
You're not telling me the reason.

1026
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:30,548
All right.

1027
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,953
I'll tell you.

1028
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:36,226
I'm lonely, that's why.

1029
01:04:36,695 --> 01:04:38,492
It's bad enough to be old.

1030
01:04:38,997 --> 01:04:40,931
It's worse to be lonely.

1031
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,069
When you ran off with Peter,
I was miserable.

1032
01:04:44,236 --> 01:04:47,069
And you're not running off again.
Don't leave me, Stanley.

1033
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:50,572
Come here and live with us.
That'll be a change for you.

1034
01:04:50,743 --> 01:04:52,404
You can live in this fine house.

1035
01:04:52,578 --> 01:04:54,773
And we'll do lots of things together.

1036
01:04:54,947 --> 01:04:57,882
We'll make trips.
Anything you want. Anything.

1037
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:00,245
No. No. I won't. I won't stay here.

1038
01:05:00,419 --> 01:05:03,684
You're like all the rest of them.
You don't care what happens to me.

1039
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:07,292
- No one cares what happens to me.
- Stanley, come back.

1040
01:05:07,459 --> 01:05:09,893
- No. No.
- Stanley.

1041
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:18,796
- Miss Stanley's here.
- Miss Stanley?

1042
01:05:18,971 --> 01:05:20,700
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

1043
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,408
Come in, Stanley.

1044
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:25,536
Thank you.

1045
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:28,603
Hello, Craig.

1046
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:30,874
What can I do for you?

1047
01:05:31,183 --> 01:05:33,208
My, how very formal.

1048
01:05:33,385 --> 01:05:36,252
- May I sit down?
- Yes, please.

1049
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:42,591
Craig, I've got a favor to ask of you.
Would you explain this to me?

1050
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,558
It's Peter's.

1051
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:51,760
Well, it's very simple.
It's an insurance policy.

1052
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:57,099
Making you beneficiary for the sum
of $ 1000 a year after his death.

1053
01:05:57,276 --> 01:06:01,406
Yes, I know that, Craig. But can I borrow
any money on it before the year's over?

1054
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,878
- Lf it's urgent.
- I want the money to go away.

1055
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:05,107
I'm wretched here.

1056
01:06:05,284 --> 01:06:07,946
No one will help me,
not even Uncle William.

1057
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,554
- That's why I came to you.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Stanley.

1058
01:06:10,722 --> 01:06:12,519
I didn't realize you were so unhappy.

1059
01:06:12,691 --> 01:06:15,785
No one knows
what I've been through, Craig.

1060
01:06:15,961 --> 01:06:17,690
Oh, I know it's mostly my own fault.

1061
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:19,956
But that doesn't make it
any easier, does it?

1062
01:06:20,132 --> 01:06:21,895
I understand.

1063
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:24,228
Well, I'll see the bank this afternoon.

1064
01:06:24,403 --> 01:06:27,099
See if I can't arrange a loan
on your policy.

1065
01:06:27,439 --> 01:06:29,771
Oh, that's very kind of you, Craig.

1066
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:32,809
You're the only one
who's been sympathetic.

1067
01:06:32,978 --> 01:06:37,142
And I guess you've got more reason
than anyone else not to be.

1068
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:38,749
Well...

1069
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:40,885
...it's all over now.

1070
01:06:41,553 --> 01:06:44,420
- Then we're still friends?
- Of course.

1071
01:06:45,557 --> 01:06:47,923
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1072
01:06:54,366 --> 01:06:57,824
Craig, have dinner with me
somewhere tonight.

1073
01:06:58,003 --> 01:06:59,994
Please, I've got a reason.

1074
01:07:00,172 --> 01:07:02,333
- I don't think we'd better, Stanley.
- Why not?

1075
01:07:02,508 --> 01:07:04,806
You're afraid, aren't you?
Afraid of yourself.

1076
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:07,411
Afraid of what you might feel
if you let yourself go.

1077
01:07:07,579 --> 01:07:09,308
Why don't you admit the truth, Craig?

1078
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:11,506
You've never gotten over me,
you never will.

1079
01:07:11,683 --> 01:07:13,878
You'd like to put your arms
around me right now.

1080
01:07:14,052 --> 01:07:16,987
You'd like to kiss me, won't you?
That's the truth, isn't it?

1081
01:07:17,155 --> 01:07:19,919
Well, if you are not afraid,
you can prove it.

1082
01:07:20,092 --> 01:07:23,027
I'll meet you at the Southside Tavern
at 7:00 tonight.

1083
01:07:23,529 --> 01:07:26,555
And since you're so businesslike
these days.

1084
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:28,825
Seven o'clock.

1085
01:07:29,468 --> 01:07:31,561
Southside Tavern.

1086
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:33,637
Stanley.

1087
01:07:35,274 --> 01:07:37,538
I'll be waiting for you.

1088
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:48,714
<i>This is the start
of the final round in this great fight...</i>

1089
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:51,219
<i>...between two boys battling for the title.</i>

1090
01:07:51,557 --> 01:07:53,821
<i>Brown throws a wild right
at Callahan and misses.</i>

1091
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:56,119
<i>Callahan sure with a left
to the chin of Brown.</i>

1092
01:07:56,295 --> 01:07:57,762
Hey, lady. Do you mind?

1093
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:00,922
<i>Callahan countering
with a hard right to Brown's mouth.</i>

1094
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:03,192
- Who's winning?
- The dame.

1095
01:08:03,368 --> 01:08:07,236
<i>Callahan follows him across the ring,
landing a long, looping left to Brown's head.</i>

1096
01:08:07,406 --> 01:08:09,966
<i>- I'd like another drink.
- Brown bounces off the ropes...</i>

1097
01:08:10,142 --> 01:08:12,804
<i>- ... stings Callahan with a short...
- Haven't you a clock?</i>

1098
01:08:12,978 --> 01:08:15,003
<i>- What time is it?
- throwing punches wildly.</i>

1099
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,205
I make it 7:30.

1100
01:08:17,382 --> 01:08:19,646
<i>- of a great battle
between two game boys...</i>

1101
01:08:19,818 --> 01:08:23,185
<i>...who have given everything they have
from the start of this fight.</i>

1102
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:33,659
<i>That, folks, winds up our program
from the stadium tonight.</i>

1103
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:36,198
And we don't even know who won.

1104
01:08:36,768 --> 01:08:39,236
Imagine a dame like that.

1105
01:08:39,905 --> 01:08:42,339
- I hope she breaks her neck.
- I'll drink to that one.

1106
01:09:41,099 --> 01:09:44,091
- Good morning.
- Are you Mrs. Stanley Kingsmill?

1107
01:09:44,269 --> 01:09:47,329
- No, she's my sister.
- I'm Inspector Millett of the 7th Precinct.

1108
01:09:47,506 --> 01:09:50,407
I've been sent to ask your sister
a few questions.

1109
01:09:51,843 --> 01:09:53,936
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

1110
01:09:54,112 --> 01:09:55,977
I wonder if you'd mind
asking me instead.

1111
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:58,844
- You see, my sister hasn't been very well.
- I'm very sorry.

1112
01:09:59,017 --> 01:10:00,712
I'm afraid I'll have to see her.

1113
01:10:00,886 --> 01:10:04,185
You see, it's about an accident.
A very serious accident.

1114
01:10:04,356 --> 01:10:06,824
She hasn't been in any.
There must be some mistake.

1115
01:10:06,992 --> 01:10:11,088
Perhaps we can clear the matter up.
You see, we received a report...

1116
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,995
Roy, what is it? What's happened?

1117
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,498
It's nothing, dear. Don't be frightened.

1118
01:10:16,668 --> 01:10:18,101
This is Inspector Millett.

1119
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,738
I'm mighty sorry to disturb you,
Mrs. Kingsmill.

1120
01:10:20,906 --> 01:10:23,670
But I've been sent here
to investigate an accident.

1121
01:10:23,842 --> 01:10:25,673
What has that got to do with me?

1122
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:28,506
Well, perhaps I'd better tell you
what we know so far.

1123
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,649
Last evening, about 7:30,
a car struck a girl and her mother...

1124
01:10:31,817 --> 01:10:34,945
...as they were crossing Granite Boulevard
and Sawyer Street.

1125
01:10:35,253 --> 01:10:38,017
The woman was badly injured
and the little girl was killed.

1126
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,418
Killed?

1127
01:10:39,591 --> 01:10:40,956
Nobody saw the accident.

1128
01:10:41,126 --> 01:10:44,061
But one woman saw a sport car
speeding away from the spot.

1129
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:45,628
She couldn't get the number...

1130
01:10:45,797 --> 01:10:48,630
...but a car with bloodstains on it
was found in an alley.

1131
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,133
We traced the license number
and, well, it seems the car is yours.

1132
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,468
But how could it be?

1133
01:10:54,639 --> 01:11:00,134
I got home about 7:30
and went to bed early with a headache.

1134
01:11:02,347 --> 01:11:03,974
Oh...

1135
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:05,616
Yes?

1136
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:07,748
What is it, dear?

1137
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:11,749
Roy, it's awful. I can't believe it.

1138
01:11:11,923 --> 01:11:13,185
Believe what?

1139
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:16,725
If someone else was using your car,
you'd better tell us, Mrs. Kingsmill.

1140
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:19,489
- I can't. Please don't ask me.
- You've got to tell us.

1141
01:11:19,664 --> 01:11:22,531
Stanley, dear. It's no use.
You can't protect whoever it is.

1142
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:26,535
They'll find out anyway. It's better
for them to know the truth from the start.

1143
01:11:26,705 --> 01:11:28,104
Well, I can't believe it.

1144
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:30,707
That he'd run away from...

1145
01:11:30,876 --> 01:11:34,004
He just said that the little girl was dead.

1146
01:11:34,179 --> 01:11:36,306
I know it's awful, but it isn't your fault.

1147
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:38,210
But it was. I mean, in a way it was.

1148
01:11:38,383 --> 01:11:40,476
Because, you see,
I'd come in from a drive...

1149
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:44,179
...and instead of taking the car
to the garage as I usually do...

1150
01:11:44,356 --> 01:11:46,256
...I left it out front.

1151
01:11:46,424 --> 01:11:50,053
- You see, he was going to wash it, but...
- Oh, Stanley, it wasn't.

1152
01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:51,252
It couldn't have been.

1153
01:11:51,429 --> 01:11:54,660
I don't understand it either.
He's always so careful.

1154
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,267
It's not like him at all unless...

1155
01:11:57,536 --> 01:11:59,163
Oh, unless he'd been drinking.

1156
01:11:59,337 --> 01:12:02,636
But he doesn't drink. I've never known
him to touch a drop in his life.

1157
01:12:03,008 --> 01:12:05,636
Well, it seems everyone knows
who it is except me.

1158
01:12:05,811 --> 01:12:07,335
Sorry, I'll have to ask you...

1159
01:12:07,512 --> 01:12:08,809
...to give me the name.
- No.

1160
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:12,347
I'd be obliged to take you to the station.
I don't wanna do that unless...

1161
01:12:12,517 --> 01:12:14,678
I can't. I just can't.

1162
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:16,684
His name is Parry Clay.

1163
01:12:16,855 --> 01:12:19,881
He's a colored boy who works
in a law office and does odd jobs.

1164
01:12:20,058 --> 01:12:22,322
- We've known him a long time.
- And his address?

1165
01:12:22,494 --> 01:12:24,121
Wilson Street.

1166
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:26,958
- I don't know the number.
- We'll find it.

1167
01:12:27,132 --> 01:12:29,657
I'm sorry. I understand how you feel.

1168
01:12:29,835 --> 01:12:31,530
Thank you. You've been very kind.

1169
01:12:31,703 --> 01:12:35,298
It's nothing. I just did what I had to do.
You can have the car back any time.

1170
01:12:35,473 --> 01:12:36,940
We've already taken photographs.

1171
01:12:37,108 --> 01:12:38,973
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1172
01:12:43,982 --> 01:12:45,973
We've gotta do something about Parry.

1173
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:48,585
If they send that boy to prison,
it'll ruin his life.

1174
01:12:48,753 --> 01:12:52,245
I'll get Uncle William.
He'll be back from Johns Hopkins tonight.

1175
01:12:52,424 --> 01:12:54,824
In the meantime,
I'll stop off at Craig's office.

1176
01:12:54,993 --> 01:12:57,985
- You've got enough on your mind.
- Nothing's as important as this.

1177
01:12:58,163 --> 01:13:01,724
But it was my car
and that makes it my responsibility.

1178
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:06,132
- You don't have to do anything about it.
- I think, first of all, I'll go to Parry's mother.

1179
01:13:06,304 --> 01:13:10,070
I couldn't have Minerva think we'd let
her down when her boy's in trouble.

1180
01:13:14,946 --> 01:13:18,814
Minerva, I want you to tell me exactly
what happened.

1181
01:13:18,984 --> 01:13:20,417
Do you understand?

1182
01:13:20,585 --> 01:13:23,486
No matter what it is, I've got to know.

1183
01:13:24,155 --> 01:13:26,646
Have you spoke with Miss Stanley?

1184
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:30,485
I was there when she told her story
to the police.

1185
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:33,358
Child, this seems hard to say.

1186
01:13:33,531 --> 01:13:36,557
But what Miss Stanley told
the police about my poor boy...

1187
01:13:36,735 --> 01:13:39,636
...there ain't a word of truth, so help me.

1188
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:42,602
Then Parry had nothing...
Minerva, how do you know that?

1189
01:13:42,774 --> 01:13:46,232
Because Parry come home from office,
and that was about 6:00.

1190
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:49,141
And he stayed home all evening
studying some legal books.

1191
01:13:49,314 --> 01:13:52,750
But he took the car to wash it.

1192
01:13:52,918 --> 01:13:54,408
Didn't he pick it up on the way?

1193
01:13:54,786 --> 01:13:58,586
No, ma'am. Miss Stanley called up
and said she was gonna use the car...

1194
01:13:58,757 --> 01:14:00,384
...and for him not to bother.

1195
01:14:00,926 --> 01:14:02,416
But why didn't Parry say that?

1196
01:14:02,594 --> 01:14:04,892
Why didn't he tell the police?
I don't understand.

1197
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:08,130
The police just come and took him off.

1198
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,634
And he tried to tell him
but they don't listen to no colored boy.

1199
01:14:15,674 --> 01:14:17,505
Minerva, you wouldn't say that unless...

1200
01:14:17,676 --> 01:14:22,170
Miss Roy, I ain't never lied to you
or your daddy all my life.

1201
01:14:22,347 --> 01:14:24,338
And nothing can make me lie.

1202
01:14:24,516 --> 01:14:26,143
Not even Parry.

1203
01:14:26,851 --> 01:14:29,012
Oh, Minerva, I believe you.

1204
01:14:29,187 --> 01:14:31,655
I'll go and get Mr. Craig right away.

1205
01:14:31,823 --> 01:14:32,983
We'll do all we can.

1206
01:14:34,025 --> 01:14:35,754
Yes, ma'am.

1207
01:14:51,343 --> 01:14:53,971
- Craig, I've just been to see Minerva.
- Yes? What about?

1208
01:14:54,145 --> 01:14:57,273
- Parry had nothing to do with the accident.
- What do you mean?

1209
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:59,440
Just that.
He was at home when it happened.

1210
01:14:59,617 --> 01:15:01,710
Minerva told me and I believe her.

1211
01:15:01,886 --> 01:15:04,548
Craig, you're his lawyer.
Parry's put his trust in you.

1212
01:15:04,723 --> 01:15:08,250
- You've got to get him out of this.
- No, I'm not his lawyer.

1213
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,820
I'm not gonna handle the case.
I couldn't get him off.

1214
01:15:11,997 --> 01:15:16,661
Yes, the evidence would be bad if Stanley
were telling the truth but she isn't.

1215
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:19,734
- She wouldn't lie?
- She has before.

1216
01:15:20,005 --> 01:15:24,032
Oh, but not about a thing like this.
She may be wild, but she has feelings.

1217
01:15:24,209 --> 01:15:26,143
She wouldn't set out to hurt anybody.

1218
01:15:26,311 --> 01:15:28,279
No, all she wants is to be happy.

1219
01:15:28,446 --> 01:15:30,380
No matter what it costs somebody else.

1220
01:15:30,949 --> 01:15:32,974
- She's young.
- So is Parry.

1221
01:15:33,151 --> 01:15:36,382
Just because of what Stanley did to us,
you mustn't misjudge her now.

1222
01:15:36,554 --> 01:15:39,022
Letting a boy suffer
for something he didn't do.

1223
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,715
You mustn't accuse Stanley
of anything so terrible.

1224
01:15:41,893 --> 01:15:45,192
After all, she is your own sister.
You mustn't forget that.

1225
01:15:45,363 --> 01:15:47,194
I mustn't let you forget it.

1226
01:15:47,365 --> 01:15:52,325
Is all this defense because Stanley's
my sister or because she's Stanley?

1227
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:54,895
No, don't answer that.

1228
01:15:55,073 --> 01:15:56,836
I don't want to know.

1229
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:57,464
Oh, Roy. How about a Scotch?
I've got a new bottle.

1230
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:02,430
- No.
- No? Why not?

1231
01:17:12,383 --> 01:17:14,442
I could dance all day and all night.

1232
01:17:14,619 --> 01:17:16,917
Then you wouldn't need to drive fast,
would you?

1233
01:17:17,222 --> 01:17:19,850
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- Why do you say that?

1234
01:17:20,024 --> 01:17:21,753
You do drive fast, don't you?

1235
01:17:21,926 --> 01:17:24,394
Peter said I was the best driver
he ever saw.

1236
01:17:24,562 --> 01:17:27,087
- Peter said?
- Yes.

1237
01:17:32,504 --> 01:17:34,699
What do you think
is going to happen to Parry?

1238
01:17:35,106 --> 01:17:37,301
Craig will get him off
with a light sentence.

1239
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:40,410
Then you're certain it was Parry
who was in the accident?

1240
01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:42,512
Naturally. Who else would it be?

1241
01:17:48,786 --> 01:17:51,619
Stanley, what time last evening
did Parry pick up the car?

1242
01:17:52,023 --> 01:17:56,050
Oh, I got home about 7:00.
It must have been some time after that.

1243
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:58,024
Where had you been?

1244
01:17:58,396 --> 01:17:59,829
What business is it of yours?

1245
01:17:59,998 --> 01:18:04,230
Why do you keep asking me questions?
I've told you all I know about it.

1246
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:07,436
Stanley. Stanley.

1247
01:18:08,273 --> 01:18:10,173
We can't always help what we do.

1248
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:13,902
The awful thing is not to face what
we've done, to make someone else face it.

1249
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:15,974
What has that got to do with me?

1250
01:18:16,147 --> 01:18:18,638
For your own sake,
please tell me the truth.

1251
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:21,182
What truth? What are you talking about?

1252
01:18:21,352 --> 01:18:23,946
I'm talking about a woman
in the hospital badly hurt...

1253
01:18:24,122 --> 01:18:26,181
...to be told her little girl is dead.

1254
01:18:26,357 --> 01:18:29,087
Well, it wasn't my fault.
You said it wasn't my fault.

1255
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:32,093
I can't help what...
What someone else does.

1256
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:36,022
Minerva says that Parry wasn't out
of the house last evening after 6:00.

1257
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:38,829
Whenever they're in a tight spot
they lie for each other.

1258
01:18:39,003 --> 01:18:40,334
She says you called Parry...

1259
01:18:40,505 --> 01:18:43,201
...and told him you didn't
want the car washed.

1260
01:18:43,374 --> 01:18:44,534
She lied.

1261
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:47,778
- Parry says the same thing.
- I know that.

1262
01:18:47,946 --> 01:18:50,005
He told Craig that.
Craig didn't believe him.

1263
01:18:50,181 --> 01:18:52,172
- Nobody believes him.
- I believe him.

1264
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:55,216
Oh, you do?

1265
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,314
If you believe him,
it's because you want to believe him.

1266
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:01,117
You hate me and that's your way
of getting back at me.

1267
01:19:01,292 --> 01:19:04,591
You wanted the truth. All right,
here it is and I hope you like it.

1268
01:19:04,762 --> 01:19:07,196
You hated me ever since... Since Peter.

1269
01:19:07,365 --> 01:19:11,301
You put on the forgiveness act but you
weren't fooling me. You were jealous.

1270
01:19:11,469 --> 01:19:14,336
You can't stand the sight of me
because you couldn't hold him.

1271
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:16,996
- Stanley.
- And it's not only Peter. It's Craig too.

1272
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:20,110
You're afraid I could get him back,
and I could if I wanted him.

1273
01:19:20,278 --> 01:19:23,736
All I have to do is lift my little finger.
That's why you're tormenting me.

1274
01:19:23,915 --> 01:19:26,941
Because you're jealous
and you're getting revenge.

1275
01:19:37,895 --> 01:19:39,988
Hello, Roy. Stanley here?

1276
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:41,927
She's in there.

1277
01:19:44,369 --> 01:19:46,234
- Oh, Craig.
- Uh, Stanley.

1278
01:19:46,404 --> 01:19:49,464
We'd better get your story on paper
while it's fresh in your mind.

1279
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:52,735
Suppose we go down to my office
and make out an affidavit.

1280
01:19:52,977 --> 01:19:55,411
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

1281
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,782
Well, whatever you say.

1282
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:05,084
Anyway, it'll be nice to get out
of this house. It's so gloomy here.

1283
01:20:05,957 --> 01:20:09,620
- See you later, Roy, if you're here.
- I'll be here.

1284
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:18,002
But, Craig, this isn't your office.

1285
01:20:18,169 --> 01:20:20,660
I wanna stop here for a few moments.

1286
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:27,541
Come on.

1287
01:20:27,712 --> 01:20:28,906
But it's the jail.

1288
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,014
- Yes.
- Well, you didn't tell me...

1289
01:20:31,182 --> 01:20:34,743
...you're bringing me down here. You
said you're going to take down my story.

1290
01:20:34,919 --> 01:20:37,387
Well, I thought we'd stop
and see Parry on the way.

1291
01:20:37,555 --> 01:20:41,355
If I brought him face to face with you,
he might break down and tell the truth.

1292
01:20:43,428 --> 01:20:44,452
All right, then.

1293
01:20:45,129 --> 01:20:46,653
Come on.

1294
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:04,611
Hey, you. Come on down.

1295
01:21:04,782 --> 01:21:06,682
Somebody for you.

1296
01:21:08,419 --> 01:21:09,818
Parry.

1297
01:21:10,121 --> 01:21:12,646
- I brought Miss Stanley to see you.
- Yes, sir.

1298
01:21:12,824 --> 01:21:14,348
How do, Miss Stanley?

1299
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:15,617
Hello, Parry.

1300
01:21:15,793 --> 01:21:18,091
Now will you tell us exactly
what happened?

1301
01:21:18,496 --> 01:21:20,589
They just come and got me.

1302
01:21:20,765 --> 01:21:22,733
That's all I know.

1303
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:25,001
Miss Stanley, she knows.

1304
01:21:25,436 --> 01:21:29,236
Miss Stanley thought you took the car
on your way home before the accident.

1305
01:21:29,807 --> 01:21:32,970
But, Miss Stanley,
you know that ain't so.

1306
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:36,705
You know you told me not to get the car,
that you were gonna use it yourself.

1307
01:21:36,881 --> 01:21:38,906
You know you did that, Miss Stanley.

1308
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:43,919
It was 6:00 and I was sitting home eating
my supper when the telephone bell rang.

1309
01:21:44,088 --> 01:21:45,851
I remember every word you said.

1310
01:21:46,023 --> 01:21:49,515
You said, "Parry, you needn't bother
to come and get the car tonight. "

1311
01:21:49,694 --> 01:21:52,128
You see, Craig, what's the use?
That's his story.

1312
01:21:52,296 --> 01:21:54,526
That's the thing
he's made up his mind to tell.

1313
01:21:54,899 --> 01:21:56,594
It ain't no use.

1314
01:21:56,768 --> 01:21:59,601
It ain't no use in this world.

1315
01:22:00,271 --> 01:22:04,435
Don't you see, Parry? Mr. Craig wants
to help you and I wanna help you.

1316
01:22:04,776 --> 01:22:07,006
All you've got to do is just...

1317
01:22:07,178 --> 01:22:09,339
Just say you took the car.

1318
01:22:09,514 --> 01:22:14,076
That it was a lovely evening and you went
for a drive and that there was an accident.

1319
01:22:14,252 --> 01:22:16,152
That's all you've got to say.

1320
01:22:16,821 --> 01:22:20,222
And we'll do everything,
everything we can to get you out.

1321
01:22:20,391 --> 01:22:24,418
My Uncle William. He's got money
and influence and I'll go to him.

1322
01:22:24,595 --> 01:22:28,463
And then when you get out,
why, we'll all give you a fresh start.

1323
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:31,295
But, Parry, if you go on lying like this...

1324
01:22:31,469 --> 01:22:33,733
...there isn't anything any of us
can do for you.

1325
01:22:33,905 --> 01:22:37,466
- All you've got to do is just say that you...
- Is tell the truth.

1326
01:22:37,642 --> 01:22:42,511
Yes, only the truth, Parry.
Just say you took the car.

1327
01:22:44,215 --> 01:22:47,582
You see, Parry,
this way it's your word against hers.

1328
01:22:49,187 --> 01:22:51,348
It ain't no use.

1329
01:22:51,522 --> 01:22:54,355
It ain't no use in this world.

1330
01:22:54,859 --> 01:22:58,192
My telling the truth ain't gonna help me.

1331
01:22:58,463 --> 01:23:00,624
There ain't nothing gonna help me.

1332
01:23:05,937 --> 01:23:09,168
Wouldn't you think the sensible thing
to do is to say he took the car?

1333
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,069
Then we could help him.

1334
01:23:29,227 --> 01:23:30,626
Stanley.

1335
01:23:30,795 --> 01:23:33,286
I'd like to make one more stop.

1336
01:23:33,631 --> 01:23:35,724
Well, what for?

1337
01:23:36,367 --> 01:23:40,770
The little girl was carrying a bunch
of pink carnations when she was killed.

1338
01:23:40,938 --> 01:23:43,634
They must have been flowers she liked...

1339
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:46,673
...so I think you should leave some
before the funeral.

1340
01:23:47,144 --> 01:23:49,476
All right, Craig.
I'll order some this afternoon.

1341
01:23:49,647 --> 01:23:52,115
No. It would be better if you left them.

1342
01:23:52,283 --> 01:23:53,375
More fitting.

1343
01:23:53,551 --> 01:23:56,019
But I can't go there, Craig.
Why should you ask me to?

1344
01:23:56,187 --> 01:23:59,520
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to get you to tell the truth.

1345
01:23:59,924 --> 01:24:02,017
I've told you I don't know
anything about it.

1346
01:24:02,193 --> 01:24:05,822
You were driving. It was dusk.
You didn't see the woman and the little girl.

1347
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:08,124
- I don't know anything.
- You lost your head.

1348
01:24:08,299 --> 01:24:09,960
You didn't know what you were doing.

1349
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:12,932
If it's the truth, everybody will know
it was an accident.

1350
01:24:13,104 --> 01:24:14,537
I've told you all I know.

1351
01:24:14,705 --> 01:24:17,435
The very idea,
just because it was Stanley's car.

1352
01:24:17,608 --> 01:24:20,406
We wanna make it easy for you.
We want you to save yourself.

1353
01:24:20,578 --> 01:24:23,547
- You've gotta help. Tell the truth.
- The truth. The truth.

1354
01:24:23,714 --> 01:24:26,774
Stop using that word.
I've told you everything I know about it.

1355
01:24:26,951 --> 01:24:29,715
I signed the affidavit.
Now will you leave me alone?

1356
01:24:29,887 --> 01:24:32,412
Why are you persecuting her?
Who said Stanley...

1357
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:36,253
...had anything to do with the accident?
- I did. Or if I didn't, I say it now.

1358
01:24:36,427 --> 01:24:39,521
That's a lie. I was right here
in this house when it happened.

1359
01:24:39,697 --> 01:24:41,927
- I don't believe that.
- Tell them, you remember.

1360
01:24:42,099 --> 01:24:44,033
Of course, I do. She was up in my room.

1361
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:45,998
- What time was it?
- Time? Well...

1362
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,660
It was about 7:00, wasn't it?

1363
01:24:47,838 --> 01:24:50,932
Yes. I'm sure it was 7
because Stanley brought me my medicine.

1364
01:24:51,442 --> 01:24:55,435
Mr. Timberlake,
was Stanley here at 7:00 last evening?

1365
01:24:58,082 --> 01:24:59,413
No, she wasn't.

1366
01:24:59,584 --> 01:25:02,519
- It was after 7 when she telephoned in.
- That isn't true.

1367
01:25:02,687 --> 01:25:05,383
You're taking Roy's side.
You're both against me.

1368
01:25:05,556 --> 01:25:07,956
Don't you dare say a thing like that.
William will...

1369
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:09,990
I don't care about William.

1370
01:25:10,161 --> 01:25:11,321
That's the fact.

1371
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:15,558
All right. It's your word against ours.

1372
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:17,860
Go ahead, tell them I wasn't here.

1373
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:22,802
Tell them I was out in the car instead.
Tell the police and see who they'll believe.

1374
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:25,303
Stanley.

1375
01:25:32,483 --> 01:25:35,509
You remember this page
from my desk calendar?

1376
01:25:35,686 --> 01:25:39,713
You wrote something.
Seven o'clock. Southside Tavern.

1377
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:43,790
But I didn't go.

1378
01:25:43,961 --> 01:25:46,429
I wanted you to sit there
and wait for me.

1379
01:25:46,597 --> 01:25:50,158
- I stayed here all the time.
- No, you were not here.

1380
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:53,895
You were at the Southside Tavern
until 7:30.

1381
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:55,971
You had three drinks.

1382
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,335
You played rumba music on the jukebox.

1383
01:25:58,776 --> 01:26:00,676
The bartender remembers you.

1384
01:26:00,845 --> 01:26:04,713
Because he wanted to listen to the radio
and you kept running the jukebox.

1385
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,809
Then you asked what time it was.

1386
01:26:07,985 --> 01:26:09,043
And then you left.

1387
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,647
You got into your own car...

1388
01:26:11,822 --> 01:26:13,619
...and you drove away.

1389
01:26:31,475 --> 01:26:33,670
Craig, it wasn't my fault.

1390
01:26:33,844 --> 01:26:37,746
It was so dark, I couldn't see
and not until I'd hit them...

1391
01:26:37,915 --> 01:26:40,383
...and not even then
did I realize what I'd done.

1392
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:42,678
I was so scared.

1393
01:26:42,853 --> 01:26:44,320
Craig.

1394
01:26:44,789 --> 01:26:47,280
Craig, the man at the tavern
couldn't identify me.

1395
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:50,985
Not unless you told him
it was me, could he?

1396
01:26:51,829 --> 01:26:53,729
And you wouldn't do that, Craig.

1397
01:26:53,898 --> 01:26:54,990
Not to me.

1398
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:58,397
You wouldn't let them send me to prison,
would you? You couldn't.

1399
01:26:58,569 --> 01:26:59,661
Not to me.

1400
01:26:59,837 --> 01:27:03,204
Stanley, you're coming with me
to the district attorney's office...

1401
01:27:03,374 --> 01:27:06,207
...and make a statement
that's going to clear Parry.

1402
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:08,542
Everybody, listen to me.

1403
01:27:08,713 --> 01:27:11,341
It's terrible if Stanley did it but it's done.

1404
01:27:11,515 --> 01:27:14,211
- It's too late to change it.
- It's not too late for Parry.

1405
01:27:14,385 --> 01:27:16,910
Get William to do everything
to cut short his sentence.

1406
01:27:17,088 --> 01:27:19,784
Just a moment, Mrs. Timberlake.
This is my responsibility.

1407
01:27:19,957 --> 01:27:22,357
You... You mean that you're going to...

1408
01:27:23,227 --> 01:27:25,092
Come on, Stanley.

1409
01:27:26,097 --> 01:27:27,792
All right.

1410
01:27:28,065 --> 01:27:29,623
I, uh...

1411
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,733
I'll have to change my dress before I go.

1412
01:27:32,903 --> 01:27:34,894
Stanley, I'll do everything I can.

1413
01:27:35,072 --> 01:27:37,905
- We all will, Stanley.
- Thank you.

1414
01:27:38,075 --> 01:27:40,771
My poor baby.

1415
01:27:41,245 --> 01:27:43,270
I'll be all right, Mother.

1416
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:47,442
Come upstairs, Lavinia.

1417
01:27:47,618 --> 01:27:49,882
There's nothing more you can do here.

1418
01:27:56,227 --> 01:28:00,027
Craig, I know how hard all this
must have been for you.

1419
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:01,323
I'm sorry.

1420
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:08,799
- Roy.
- Please don't say anything.

1421
01:28:08,973 --> 01:28:10,099
I already know.

1422
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:11,732
What do you know?

1423
01:28:11,909 --> 01:28:14,207
The way you feel about her.

1424
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:18,337
You thought it was all over,
but it wasn't.

1425
01:28:18,516 --> 01:28:21,610
It's still in you, like an old fever.

1426
01:28:22,186 --> 01:28:26,623
I was just the cool nurse
who sat beside you...

1427
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:30,488
...and stroked your head
until the spell was over.

1428
01:28:30,661 --> 01:28:32,720
Then you thought you needed me.

1429
01:28:32,897 --> 01:28:34,455
Roy.

1430
01:28:34,932 --> 01:28:36,923
I do need you.

1431
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:41,004
And I'm going to go on
needing you as long as I live.

1432
01:29:17,675 --> 01:29:18,937
Police station, operator.

1433
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:42,223
- Good evening...
- Where's my uncle?

1434
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,597
Mr. Fitzroy is in the drawing room.
Doctor and Mrs. Fitzroy are in the library.

1435
01:29:58,315 --> 01:29:59,441
Uncle.

1436
01:30:00,117 --> 01:30:01,675
Uncle.

1437
01:30:01,852 --> 01:30:03,285
Uncle, dear.

1438
01:30:04,221 --> 01:30:06,246
I've done a dreadful thing.

1439
01:30:06,423 --> 01:30:08,983
That accident, it wasn't Parry.

1440
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:10,524
I did it.

1441
01:30:10,694 --> 01:30:13,094
They've found out
and they're gonna tell the police.

1442
01:30:13,497 --> 01:30:15,431
And they'll send me to prison.

1443
01:30:15,599 --> 01:30:17,430
Prison, Uncle.

1444
01:30:18,269 --> 01:30:21,136
Oh, it was an awful thing. I know that.

1445
01:30:21,305 --> 01:30:24,741
But I didn't mean to hurt anybody
and it just happened.

1446
01:30:24,909 --> 01:30:28,003
And then I was so upset,
I didn't know what I was doing.

1447
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:30,509
Uncle, I don't want Parry punished.

1448
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:33,241
Maybe you could fix it
so that he'd get out of prison...

1449
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:37,444
...and then I wouldn't have
to go to the police. I can't face it.

1450
01:30:37,888 --> 01:30:39,753
You're the only one who can save me.

1451
01:30:39,924 --> 01:30:41,482
The only one in the world.

1452
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:44,389
I'll do anything you say.
Just tell me what to do.

1453
01:30:45,095 --> 01:30:46,858
Uncle, I'll come and live here.

1454
01:30:47,031 --> 01:30:49,625
I'll take care of you. I'll make you laugh.

1455
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,826
Remember how we laughed
the other night? Oh, we'll have fun.

1456
01:30:53,003 --> 01:30:55,801
We'll do anything, anything you want.

1457
01:30:57,041 --> 01:31:00,204
Uncle, dear, why don't you answer me?

1458
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:06,213
Why don't you say something?

1459
01:31:06,684 --> 01:31:10,745
Uncle, what's the matter with you?

1460
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:14,190
Six months at the outside.

1461
01:31:14,358 --> 01:31:15,757
That's all he gives me.

1462
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,493
Six months.

1463
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:20,391
- What are you talking about?
- Only six months to live.

1464
01:31:20,564 --> 01:31:23,328
- That's what the doctor said.
- Maybe the doctor's wrong.

1465
01:31:23,634 --> 01:31:27,195
There isn't time. They may be on their way
to the district attorney's office.

1466
01:31:27,371 --> 01:31:30,340
Call him up, Uncle.
He'll listen to you. Say anything.

1467
01:31:30,507 --> 01:31:32,338
Just so they don't arrest me.

1468
01:31:32,509 --> 01:31:34,977
But I'm going to die,
don't you understand?

1469
01:31:35,145 --> 01:31:37,636
- I'm going to die.
- All right, so you're going to die.

1470
01:31:37,815 --> 01:31:39,874
You're an old man. You've lived your life.

1471
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:42,280
I haven't lived mine. Mine's hardly begun.

1472
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:46,389
Think of me, Uncle. Think what'll happen
to me if you don't get me out of this.

1473
01:31:46,557 --> 01:31:48,218
You're not even listening.

1474
01:31:48,392 --> 01:31:50,519
You don't care
what happens to me anymore.

1475
01:31:50,694 --> 01:31:54,528
You'd let me go to prison. All you're
thinking of is your own miserable life.

1476
01:31:54,698 --> 01:31:58,134
Well, you can die for all I care. Die!

1477
01:33:31,662 --> 01:33:33,755
Boy, look at her travel.

1478
01:34:58,315 --> 01:35:01,842
Officer Fallon reporting a wreck
on Revere Boulevard.

1479
01:35:02,019 --> 01:35:05,750
A woman driving a car at high speed
failed to make a sharp turn.

1480
01:35:05,923 --> 01:35:07,857
Crashed through a fence and down a hill.

1481
01:35:08,225 --> 01:35:11,160
<i>License number, 24769.</i>

1482
01:35:11,328 --> 01:35:14,422
Two-four-seven-six-nine.

1483
01:35:14,598 --> 01:35:16,691
<i>- Is she dead?
- Yeah, she's dead.</i>

1484
01:35:18,735 --> 01:35:21,966
Why, that's the Timberlake girl.
We've been looking for her.

1485
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:24,300
No, on another charge.

1486
01:35:33,717 --> 01:35:35,309
Yes?

1487
01:35:37,421 --> 01:35:39,787
Oh, I see.

1488
01:35:41,291 --> 01:35:45,284
Yes, I'll make all arrangements.

1489
01:35:47,598 --> 01:35:50,624
- Craig, if she's arrested we can...
- No.

1490
01:35:52,369 --> 01:35:54,599
It's out of our hands.

1491
01:35:55,072 --> 01:35:57,563
There's nothing more we can do.
