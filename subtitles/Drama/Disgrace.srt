1
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,559
Rogard/Hofhil subtitles

2
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,239
I haven't heard
from my daughter.

3
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,719
Still living with a woman?

4
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,119
Yes, still a lesbian.

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,599
Still on the farm.

6
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,799
She thinks it's safe there.

7
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,479
Nowhere's safe.

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,399
Too many people with nothing to do
but cause trouble.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,519
How's work?

10
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,959
They look through me
when I speak, forget my name.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,599
There's no respect anymore.

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,239
Have you missed me?

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,639
I miss you all the time.

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,399
I’m curious.

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,439
How do you manage this life?

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,119
Is there a husband?

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,039
You better go now.

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,639
I forgot to tell you, my mother's ill.

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,399
I have to take care of her,
so I won't be here next week.

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,439
Will I see you the Thursday after?

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,919
I'm not sure.

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,399
Why don't you ring the agency?

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,879
Give me your number.
I'll ring you direct.

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,799
No. Ring the agency.

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,879
<i>That had usurped upon a living thought,
that never more could be.</i>

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,559
Why did Wordsworth use
the unusual verb form 'usurp upon'?

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,759
Because 'usurp upon' means
to intrude or encroach upon.

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,639
<i>The clouds cleared' the peak was unveiled,
and we grieved to see it.</i>

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,959
Why 'grieve'?

30
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,159
My lunch is wet. Wait.

31
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,799
Oww!

32
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,279
Are you alright?

33
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,439
I'm fine.

34
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,199
Melanie, isn't it?

35
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,439
My favourite season and time of day.

36
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,319
Do you live around here?

37
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,679
Across the line. I share a flat.

38
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,879
I live nearby.

39
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,879
May I invite you for a drink?

40
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,039
OK.

41
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,599
But I have to be back by 7:30.

42
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,639
What is the reason for taking
a course in Romantic Poetry?

43
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,959
It's mainly for the atmosphere.

44
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,799
Are you enjoying the course?

45
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
I'm not that crazy about Wordsworth.

46
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,919
Wordsworth has been
one of my masters.

47
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,679
Maybe he'll grow on me.

48
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,479
Maybe.

49
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,999
But in my experience, poetry speaks
to you at first sight or not at all.

50
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,199
Like falling in love.

51
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,119
What are your career plans?

52
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,879
Stagecraft and design.
I'm doing a diploma in theatre.

53
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,959
I see.
Yeah.

54
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,079
You've got a lot of books on Byron.
Didn't he die young?

55
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,479
They all die young
or dry up or... go mad.

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,839
I must go.

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
Stay longer.

58
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,239
Why?

59
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,719
Because you ought to.

60
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,839
Why ought I?
Why?

61
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,439
Because a woman's beauty
does not belong to her alone,

62
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,519
it's part of the bounty
she brings into the world.

63
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,239
She has a duty to share it.

64
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,399
What if I already share it?

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,839
Then you should share it more widely.

66
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,599
I must leave.

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,359
Shall I walk you home?

68
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:11,593
No.

69
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:13,693
Very well. Goodbye.

70
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,040
Hello.

71
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,832
May I speak to Melanie, please?

72
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,502
Just a minute.

73
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,664
Is something the matter?

74
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,665
Are you worried about the two of us?

75
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,666
Maybe.

76
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:19,667
No need.

77
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,668
I won't let it go too far.

78
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:37,939
I'll give you a ride home.

79
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:56,290
I missed you yesterday in class.

80
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:58,299
Are you alright?

81
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:02,277
Did you get my carnations?

82
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,228
Is there something wrong?

83
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:09,116
Please, tell me.

84
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:11,117
Thanks.

85
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,948
Aren't you going to invite me in?

86
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,103
I think my flatmate is home.

87
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:18,004
What about this evening?

88
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:19,995
I've got rehearsals.

89
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,508
Then when do I see you again?

90
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:25,509
Thanks.

91
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:35,089
Could you do my hair like Oprah's?

92
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:37,994
We don't want much now,
do we, dearie?

93
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,683
Well, I'll go and make
some magic chemicals...

94
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:44,576
But meanwhile, can I get you ladies
some coffee?

95
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,738
I'll have mine white, please.

96
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:47,739
I'll have mine black, please.

97
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,077
Well, that's easy to remember!

98
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:53,769
I've come for the job you've advertised.

99
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:56,406
So? What are you waiting for?

100
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:59,194
There's the broom.
Make yourself useful!

101
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:18,192
No! No! Everything
has to happen much quicker!

102
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:19,565
A la Marx Brothers!

103
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:22,817
Ryan, is this gadget going to work?
I want a loud bang and sparks.

104
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:25,448
Are the others going to work?
There's only one lamp blinking.

105
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:29,356
Melanie, don't pre-empt. I want
to see shock in your body language.

106
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,451
You're coming across
like a limp fish.

107
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:48,290
Not now, my cousin will be back!

108
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,194
So you're the professor, huh?

109
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:03,475
Melanie's told me about you.

110
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:05,921
Indeed. What has she told you?

111
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:08,055
That you fuck her.
- That's enough.

112
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:09,272
What do you want?

113
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,723
Don't tell me that's enough!

114
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,302
You can't do what you want
when it suits you!

115
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:14,199
It's time for you to leave.

116
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,239
Goodbye, Professor Chips.

117
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,759
Just you wait and see.

118
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,119
As we saw last week,

119
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,919
notoriety and scandal affected
not only Byron's life...

120
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,039
but also the way his poems
were received by the public.

121
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,679
<i>At times resign his own
for others' good,</i>

122
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,402
<i>but not in pity, not because he ought,</i>

123
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:12,359
<i>but in some strange perversity
of thought...</i>

124
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,519
<i>that swayed him onward
with a secret pride,</i>

125
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,999
<i>to do what a few
or none would do beside.</i>

126
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,519
<i>And this same impulse would
in tempting time...</i>

127
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,399
<i>mislead his spirit equally to crime.</i>

128
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,439
So...

129
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,759
What kind of creature is this Lucifer?

130
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,799
He does what he feels like.

131
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,839
Doesn't care if it's good or bad,
he just does it.

132
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,159
Exactly.

133
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,559
Good or bad, he just does it.

134
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,999
He doesn't act on principles
but on impulse,

135
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,079
and the source of his impulses
is dark to him.

136
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,679
Read a few lines further.

137
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,159
<i>His madness was not of the head
but heart...</i>

138
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,679
A mad heart.

139
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,039
What is a mad heart?

140
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,199
Never mind.

141
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,119
Note that we are not asked to condemn
this being with a mad heart.

142
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,999
On the contrary,
we are invited to sympathise.

143
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,999
For though he lives among us,
he is not one of us.

144
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,399
He is what he calls himself, a 'thing',

145
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,519
that is, a monster.

146
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,239
Not possible to love...

147
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,959
and condemned to solitude.

148
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,279
Melanie, may I have a word with you
in my office, please?

149
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,519
Melanie...

150
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,119
Would you mind
waiting outside, please?

151
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,759
My dear, I can't have your friend
disrupting my class.

152
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,439
And you have to make up
the test you missed.

153
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
I can't. I haven't done the reading.

154
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,399
Just take the test, Melanie.

155
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,279
Let's set a date.

156
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,719
How about next Monday?

157
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,199
You've got the weekend
to do the reading.

158
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,999
12 o'clock,

159
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,799
here in my office.

160
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,919
Here I am.

161
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:19,598
Professor, what you have done
is not right.

162
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,712
You should be ashamed of yourself.

163
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:26,654
We never thought we were sending
our daughter into a nest of vipers!

164
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:28,479
Won't you come to my office?

165
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,083
So help me God if I have
the wrong end of the stick,

166
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,889
but I don't think so.

167
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:35,295
I can see it from your face.

168
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,290
Excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

169
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,658
Professor Lurie! Professor Lurie!

170
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,116
You can't run away!

171
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,323
You haven't heard the last of it yet!

172
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,359
I was thinking of seeing Lucy
after the inquiry.

173
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,839
Of course I haven't told her.

174
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,159
Well, let me tell you,

175
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,039
everyone already knows
about this latest affair of yours

176
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,679
in the juiciest detail.

177
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,999
Really?

178
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,479
The story is she took sleeping pills.

179
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,399
Come on, David,
we shared a bed for 10 years.

180
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,359
Why should you have secrets?

181
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,799
Was she in love with you?

182
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,039
No, Rosalind, I'm afraid
it wasn't that dramatic.

183
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,959
What an inglorious end
to a brilliant career.

184
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,719
What if you lose your pension?

185
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,119
They can't cut me off without a penny.

186
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,999
You haven't asked me
whether I was in love with her.

187
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,279
For God's sake, David, you're 52!

188
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,159
Will you be able to resume your post?

189
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,959
I'm not sure I want to.

190
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,999
The whole thing is disgusting.

191
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,719
Disgusting and vulgar.
And I don't mind saying so.

192
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,599
David, is there any member
of the committee...

193
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,279
whose participation you feel
might be prejudicial to you?

194
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,319
Not in a legal sense.

195
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,599
Let me remind everyone
this is not a trial but an inquiry.

196
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,039
Now, the first complaint
comes from Miss Melanie Isaacs.

197
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,639
You all have a copy
of her statement?

198
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,279
Yes.

199
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,359
Will Miss Isaacs
be appearing in person?

200
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,039
Miss Isaacs appeared
before the committee yesterday.

201
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,759
Now, if we could push on.

202
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,399
The second and related charge
comes from the Registrar.

203
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,479
The record shows a mark of 70%...

204
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,759
for a mid-term test
which she did not sit.

205
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,119
I'm sure this committee
have better things to do...

206
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,839
than rehash a story
over which there's no dispute.

207
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,479
I plead guilty to both charges.

208
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,519
Pass sentence
and let us get on with our lives.

209
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:12,482
Professor Lurie, we are here
to listen to both sides.

210
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:15,417
Perhaps it would be better
if you were represented...

211
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:19,039
by someone who is more familiar
with our procedure?

212
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,319
Why? I can represent myself
perfectly well.

213
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,039
Despite the plea I’ve entered,
must we continue with this hearing?

214
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,679
We want to give you a chance
to state your position.

215
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,399
I’ve stated my position. I'm guilty.

216
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,439
Guilty of what?
- Of all I'm charged with.

217
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,839
You are taking us in circles.
Have you read Miss Isaacs' statement?

218
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,719
No, but I'm sure it's all true.

219
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,599
Would it not be prudent
to actually read her statement?

220
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,199
No.

221
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,279
There are more important things
in life than being prudent.

222
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,243
Have you consulted anyone?

223
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,808
A priest, for instance, or a counsellor?

224
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,559
Would you be prepared
to undergo counselling?

225
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,799
No. I'm beyond counselling.

226
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,479
I’ve made my plea.

227
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,879
Is there any form
of public statement...

228
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,799
you would be prepared
to subscribe to?

229
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,519
What do you want
the statement to contain?

230
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,159
An admission that you were wrong.

231
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,479
I’ve admitted that. I'm guilty.

232
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,279
There's a difference
between pleading guilty...

233
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,759
and admitting you were wrong.

234
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,239
And that would satisfy you?

235
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,959
An admission I was wrong?

236
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,799
No. First, Professor Lurie
must make his statement.

237
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,279
Then we can decide
if we can accept it.

238
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,679
See if it comes from the heart.

239
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,879
From the words I use, you can see
if it comes from the heart?

240
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,239
Very well.

241
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,479
I took advantage of my position.

242
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,439
It was wrong...

243
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,519
and I regret it.

244
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,039
The question is, does it reflect
your sincere feelings?

245
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,519
That's enough.

246
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,879
Let's play it by the book.

247
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,519
I plead guilty.

248
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,359
I'd become a servant of Eros.

249
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,786
Excuse me, Professor,
can we talk to you for a minute?

250
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,479
What about?
You know, the hearing.

251
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,799
I can't comment on that.

252
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,559
Are you sorry?
- No.

253
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,679
I was enriched by the experience.

254
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,646
He was what by the experience?

255
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,874
He was enriched.

256
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,279
I always forget how far away you live.

257
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,919
Well, you're here now. Nice and safe.

258
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,919
Where's Helen?

259
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,759
Back in Johannesburg, since April.

260
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,199
You didn't tell me you broke up.

261
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,639
Aren't you nervous on your own?
- I’ve got the dogs.

262
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,959
And I’ve started a boarding kennel.

263
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,599
Anyway, if there's a break-in,

264
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,599
I don't see how two people
are better than one.

265
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,279
Very philosophical.

266
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,639
And I have a rifle.

267
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,599
It's never been used, but it's there.

268
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,079
An armed philosopher. I like that.

269
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,839
Did you bring work with you?

270
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,679
I'm thinking of perhaps writing
an opera - Byron's time in Italy.

271
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,919
Petrus...
- Mmm?

272
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,639
This is my father.

273
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,759
Molo. Kunjani.

274
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,239
I have come for the spray.

275
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,639
It's in the kombi.
Wait here, I'll go get it.

276
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,159
I look after the dogs
and work in the garden.

277
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,029
Yes, the dog man.

278
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,359
I'm anxious about my daughter alone.
So isolated.

279
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,719
Yes, everything dangerous today.

280
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,679
But here it is alright, I think.

281
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,679
Thanks.

282
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,359
Petrus helps me out.

283
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,919
He's also co-proprietor.

284
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,599
Since when?

285
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,119
Does he live on the property?

286
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,079
I’ve put electricity in the old stable.

287
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,719
He stays there.

288
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,359
What would you like to do first?

289
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,159
Would you like a cup of tea
or a show-off around the farm?

290
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,039
Show me what you've been up to.

291
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,319
Rosalind rang me,
filled me in with the details.

292
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,879
What happened with the hearing?

293
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,519
They wanted me to go through
some kind of public repentance.

294
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,039
I'd prefer to be put up
against a wall and shot.

295
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,119
So you left the university?

296
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,199
I was asked to resign.

297
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,799
Oh, dear.

298
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,639
Will you miss teaching?

299
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,759
Ah, my daughter, the one who comes
to teach, learns the keenest of lessons.

300
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,679
Those who come to learn,
learn nothing.

301
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,959
Well, we start at 5:00
tomorrow morning, Professor.

302
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,599
Shall I wake you?

303
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,679
If you make me coffee.

304
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,159
I will do that.

305
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,039
Take those to the kombi.

306
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,119
Monica, this is my father, David,
visiting from Cape Town.

307
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,599
Have you ever thought
of getting married again?

308
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,519
I wasn't made for marriage.

309
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,639
Well, you can't keep...
- Preying on young women?

310
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,719
It's not going to get any easier
as you get older.

311
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,159
Do you remember Blake?

312
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,959
He says, 'Sooner murder
an infant in the cradle...

313
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,559
than nurse un-acted desires.'

314
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,639
Good day. How much are your carrots?
- Two rand.

315
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,599
I'll take one, thank you very much.

316
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,279
Thanks.
- Thank you.

317
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,239
'Bye.
- 'Bye.

318
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,999
Why did you quote that to me?

319
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,359
Just that every woman
I’ve been close to...

320
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,319
has taught me something about myself.

321
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,839
To that extent,
they've made me a better person.

322
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,479
500 rand.

323
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,479
Mmm. It's pretty good.

324
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,399
I'm going to stop in on Bev.
I need to collect medicine for the dogs.

325
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,719
Who's Bev?

326
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,439
She's one of my closest friends.

327
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,879
She runs an animal clinic.
All voluntary.

328
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,719
Hello?

329
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,639
Hello, Lucy.

330
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,999
How are you?
- Good. And you?

331
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,799
I'm good.

332
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,519
Bev, this is my father, David.

333
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,999
Nice to meet you, David.

334
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,119
Come in.

335
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,239
Yeah?

336
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,239
Sorry we're late.
That's alright. You're here now.

337
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,201
Hello, Bill.

338
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,079
Lucy, how are you?

339
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,999
I'm well. How are you?
- Fine.

340
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:02,093
Ah, you must be David.

341
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:03,368
I'm Bill.

342
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,466
Come, make yourself at home.
Tea? Sit down, sit down.

343
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,919
We can't stay. I'm just going to get
the medicine for the dogs.

344
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,559
I'll go and get it.

345
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,079
Oh, shit.

346
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,479
He is good.

347
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,279
Mmm! He's a good man.

348
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,519
What's the story with Petrus?

349
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,319
Can he just come in here
and do as he pleases?

350
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,399
We have an understanding.

351
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,279
He got a Land Affairs grant
earlier this year,

352
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,359
enough to buy a hectare
and a bit from me.

353
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,559
We share the dam, and everything
from there to the fence is his.

354
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,039
If he gets a second grant,

355
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,079
he'll build a house
and move out of the stable.

356
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,639
He's very busy.
You should give him a hand.

357
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,919
Give Petrus a hand? I like that.

358
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,639
I like the historical piquancy.

359
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,479
And will he pay me?

360
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,959
I'm sure he will.

361
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,999
Why don't you ask him?

362
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,639
And what can I do for you
while I'm here?

363
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,639
You can help me with the dogs,
you can help Bev at the clinic.

364
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,630
You mean Bev? Help Bev?

365
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,275
I don't think Bev and I will hit it off.

366
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,359
Don't expect to get paid.

367
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,919
You'll have to do it
out of the goodness of your heart.

368
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,639
Hmm, I don't know, Lucy,

369
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,959
these animal welfare people
are a bit like Christians.

370
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,399
Everyone is so cheerful
and well-intentioned,

371
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,679
then after a while you itch to go off
and do some raping and pirating.

372
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,679
Or kick a cat.

373
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,399
Bev tries to set an example.

374
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,959
What are you reading?

375
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,959
Oh.

376
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,679
Hey, mister! Some money, please, sir?

377
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,146
Sir, can I have some money?
Sorry, I’ve got nothing.

378
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,719
Come on.

379
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,550
David, just in time.
Could you hold him from the front?

380
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,879
Come round and take his legs.

381
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,119
There, my friend.
Hey, steady, my friend.

382
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,798
Hey, my friend.

383
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,639
It's OK.

384
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,159
Steady, steady, my friend.

385
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,559
Shh.

386
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,279
Blowflies.

387
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,999
You waited too long.

388
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,279
You can leave him here with me
and I will give him a quiet end,

389
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,279
or come back on Thursday
when the vet is here,

390
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,759
but I think it's too late.

391
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,959
What a pity.

392
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,479
You can't force the owners.

393
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,839
They like to slaughter their animals
their own way.

394
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,879
How do you pay for this stuff?

395
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,759
We get it wholesale.

396
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,959
Hold public collections, donations.

397
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,319
We get a grant
for putting the dogs down.

398
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,879
Who does that?

399
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,679
Dr. Oosthuizen, our vet.

400
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,759
But there are too many of them.

401
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,319
So I help out,
do what's left on a Sunday.

402
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,879
Oh, which reminds me,
check yourself for fleas tonight.

403
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,079
Are they all going to die?

404
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,039
If nobody wants them.

405
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,079
And you don't mind doing the job?

406
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,559
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Settle down.

407
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,319
I do mind. Hey!

408
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,799
I mind deeply.

409
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,937
And I wouldn't want someone doing it
for me who didn't mind. Would you?

410
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,479
Aren't they lovely?

411
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,879
They come back every year,
the same three.

412
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,199
I'm so lucky to be visited -
the one chosen.

413
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,919
Animals are creatures of habit.

414
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,199
Come on, Juzzi.

415
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,479
When you were small,
our next door neighbour had a dog,

416
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,599
a golden retriever, remember?

417
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,999
Dimly.
It was a male.

418
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,919
And whenever a bitch went past,

419
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,959
it got excited, unmanageable.

420
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,559
And with Pavlovian regularity,

421
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,119
its owner would beat it,

422
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,679
so that at the mere smell of a bitch,

423
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,439
the dog would run around the garden...

424
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,599
with its ears fiat
and its tail between its legs,

425
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,639
whining and trying to hide.

426
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,159
I don't see the point.

427
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,839
Well, you can punish a dog
for chewing a slipper,

428
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,719
the dog can accept that.

429
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,719
But desire is another story.

430
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,559
Is that the moral?

431
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,279
Males must be allowed to follow
their instincts unchecked?

432
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,479
No, that's not the moral.

433
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,479
What was ignoble about the spectacle,

434
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,319
was that the poor dog had begun
to hate its own nature.

435
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,159
It no longer needed to be beaten,
it punished itself.

436
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,639
At that point, it would’ve been
better to shoot it.

437
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,759
Have you always felt this way?

438
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,599
No.

439
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,959
At times I’ve feel just the opposite.

440
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,239
That desire is a burden
we could well do without.

441
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,999
Hey, what've you got there?

442
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,719
Should we be nervous?

443
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,679
Stay.

444
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,439
Petrus!

445
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,439
Petrus!

446
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,919
Hamba!

447
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,039
Quiet!

448
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,559
What do you want?

449
00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:30,079
We must telephone.
His sister accident.

450
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,785
What kind of accident?
- A baby.

451
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,776
Where are you from?
- Erasmus kraal.

452
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,559
Why aren't you ringing
from the forestry station?

453
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,889
Is no-one there.

454
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,799
Hold on.

455
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,639
Inside.

456
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,279
Quiet. Quiet!

457
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,759
You stay, you come in.

458
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,439
Lucy...

459
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,239
Lucy!

460
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,039
Vulani!

461
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,639
Vulani!
Get him!

462
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,359
Get him!

463
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,399
Lucy!

464
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,519
Ahh!

465
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,719
Lucy.

466
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,839
Lucy.

467
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,519
Lucy!

468
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,519
No.

469
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,399
Lucy.

470
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,159
Lucy.

471
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,719
What on earth did they do to you?

472
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,519
They've stolen your car.

473
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,977
And let down the tyres of the kombi
and they smashed the phone.

474
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,599
I'm walking over to Ettinger's.

475
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,738
You say what happened to you and
I'll say what happened to me, please.

476
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,599
I never go anywhere without my Beretta.

477
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,119
At least you can save yourself,

478
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,559
because the police won't -

479
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,359
not anymore, you can be sure.

480
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,970
I told Lucy to install bars like me,
and a security gate with a fence.

481
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,719
And to buy a pistol
and a two-way radio.

482
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,999
My father's been severely burnt.

483
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,685
I was wondering
when he could see a doctor.

484
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:36,519
You'll have to wait in line.

485
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,399
Thanks.

486
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,901
Ettinger's going to take me
to the police station.

487
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,919
Won't the police want to see me too?

488
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,919
I don't think there's anything
you can tell them that I can't.

489
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,439
Or is there?

490
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,719
You're lucky
that there's no damage to the eye itself.

491
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,719
If they'd used petrol
instead of methylated spirits,

492
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,039
now, that would've been
a different story.

493
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,159
The burns on your scalp
aren't serious.

494
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,799
You just need to keep an eye out
for infection.

495
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,319
David?

496
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,159
Shocking. It's absolutely shocking.

497
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,359
Lucy's at our place.
- I'm alright.

498
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,039
It takes you back, you know.

499
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,919
It's like being in a war
all over again.

500
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,399
Has Lucy been to the police
and the doctor?

501
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,879
Yes, yes.

502
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,519
There's a bulletin out for your car.

503
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,332
I'll attended to it.

504
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,479
Lucy...

505
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,039
Lucy... Lucy?

506
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,239
Lucy?

507
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,919
I have to speak to Lucy.
I want to see Lucy.

508
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,479
I had a dream. I'm sorry,
I thought you were calling me.

509
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,079
I wasn't. Go to bed.

510
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,479
Try and sleep now.

511
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,919
How is she?

512
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,159
This is not an easy thing to talk about,
but have you seen a doctor?

513
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,039
There's a risk...
I saw my doctor last night.

514
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,199
And is he taking care
of all eventualities?

515
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,199
She. She, not he.

516
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,460
How can a doctor take care of
all eventualities? Have some sense.

517
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,279
What are our plans for today?

518
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,079
To go back to the farm and clean up.

519
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,999
We can't just pick up
where we left off.

520
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,879
Why not?
Because it's not a good idea.

521
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,439
Because it's not safe.

522
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,519
It was never safe.

523
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,239
And it's not an idea, good or bad.

524
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,039
I'm not going back for the sake
of an idea, I'm just going back.

525
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,199
Lucy, things are changing.

526
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,159
Guns and gates don't save you.
Ettinger is wrong.

527
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,319
No, no.

528
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,959
We are not going back.

529
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,839
Petrus is back...

530
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,759
with a load of building material
and a woman.

531
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,679
Oh, good.

532
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,319
That's his new wife.

533
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,119
Why didn't he tell you
he was going away?

534
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,119
His timing is a bit suspicious.

535
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,479
I can't order Petrus about.
He is his own master.

536
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,719
Lucy...

537
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,519
there's no shame
in being the object of a crime.

538
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,359
Are you trying to remind me
of something?

539
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,239
Remind you of what?

540
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,743
Of what women undergo
at the hands of men?

541
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,639
Nothing could be further
from my thoughts.

542
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,119
As far as I'm concerned...

543
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,519
what happened to me
is purely a private matter,

544
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,119
this place being what it is.

545
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,119
This place being what?
This place being South Africa.

546
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,959
You must have heard...

547
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,319
we had a big robbery on Wednesday
while you were away.

548
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,639
Yes. I heard.

549
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,679
Very bad. Very, very bad.

550
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,039
But you are alright now.

551
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,999
Oh, I'm alive.

552
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,239
As long as one is alive, one is alright.

553
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,919
Is that what you mean?

554
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,639
Will Lucy go to the market tomorrow?

555
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,359
She will lose her stall
if she does not go.

556
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,959
Like peasants everywhere.

557
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,279
Honest toil and honest cunning.

558
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,799
Petrus wants to know
if you're going to the market,

559
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,519
otherwise, you might lose your stall.

560
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,039
Don't you think you could tie them
where they could graze?

561
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,159
They are for the party.

562
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,919
On Saturday I will slaughter them
for the party.

563
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,959
You and Lucy must come.

564
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,919
It's a big party.

565
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,959
Why is Petrus having a party?

566
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,359
Because of the land transfer, I guess.

567
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,959
It's a big day for him.

568
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,359
We should put in an appearance,
take him a present.

569
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,359
I don't like the way he does things,
bringing the beasts home...

570
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,159
to acquaint them with the people
who are going to eat them.

571
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,959
Wake up, David.

572
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,759
This is the country.

573
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,439
You must open it.

574
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,639
It's a bedspread.

575
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,639
Lucy is our benefactor.

576
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,119
When is the baby due?

577
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,199
October. We hope it is a boy.

578
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,679
What have you got against a girl?
- A girl?

579
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,359
Very expensive.
Always money, money, money.

580
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,079
I'm going to dance.

581
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,439
Thank you.

582
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,479
They're here!
- Who's here?

583
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,959
I saw one of them out the back.

584
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,159
I don't want to kick up a fuss,
but can we just leave at once?

585
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,679
I know you!

586
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,799
Do you know who this is?

587
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,479
What is the trouble?

588
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,239
He is one of them. Ask Lucy.

589
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,519
Ask him why the police
are looking for him.

590
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,239
He says he does not know
what you're talking about.

591
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,879
He's lying.

592
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,119
I'm going to telephone the police.

593
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,038
If you call the police,
it will destroy the evening for Petrus!

594
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:04,759
Really?

595
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,239
Lucy, I fail to understand...

596
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,919
why you did not lay real charges
against them in the first place.

597
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,479
And why are you protecting Petrus?

598
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,039
Petrus is with them!

599
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,079
Don't shout at me! This is my life!

600
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,159
I'm the one who has to live here!

601
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,719
Lucy, if you're too scared
to call the police now,

602
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,959
we should never have involved them
in the first place.

603
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,159
We should've just kept quiet
and waited for the next attack,

604
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,759
or cut our own throats.

605
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,479
Stop it, David!

606
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,839
You don't know what happened.

607
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,639
I don't know?

608
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,439
Why do you keep saying that?

609
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,119
You don't begin to know.

610
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,639
Lucy, please,

611
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,519
if you buckle now, you won't be able
to live with yourself.

612
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,559
If you show you're afraid,
you're finished.

613
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,079
Please let me call the police.

614
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,759
No.

615
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,839
Can I borrow some tools?
I have to put in my PVC pipes.

616
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,519
And could you help me fit
the regulator?

617
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,759
I don't know anything
about regulators or plumbing.

618
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,319
It is not plumbing, it is pipe fitting.

619
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,799
Just laying pipes.

620
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,359
Lucy has given her permission
for the pipes to cross her land.

621
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,039
She is forward-looking, Lucy.

622
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,679
Not backward-looking.

623
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,999
Petrus, the boy... what's his name?

624
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,479
Yes. He is angry.
You are calling him a thief.

625
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,479
It is hard for me,
as I must keep the peace.

626
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,599
I have no intention
of getting you involved.

627
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,239
I need the boy's name
and the police can take care of it.

628
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,919
But the insurance will give you
a new car, new TV.

629
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,079
The insurance
will not give me a new car.

630
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,959
They will give me a percentage
of what the old car was worth,

631
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,839
if they're not bankrupt by now
with all the car theft in this country.

632
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,559
Besides, it's Lucy that's the issue,
you know what happened to her.

633
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,479
Yes, I know what happened.

634
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,919
But now it is alright.

635
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,399
Who says it's alright?

636
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,879
I say.

637
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,799
I will protect her.
You didn't the last time!

638
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,039
And now, one of them is your friend.

639
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,919
The boy is not a criminal.

640
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,479
He is not guilty.

641
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,479
He is too young.

642
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,479
What can I say? You know everything.

643
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,959
Do you need me any longer?

644
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,639
No, now it is easy.

645
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,039
Now I must just dig the pipe in.

646
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,319
You underestimate Petrus.

647
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,079
He slaved to get
that market garden going for Lucy.

648
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,159
I'm not saying she owes him everything,
but she owes him a lot.

649
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,959
In my opinion,
he's itching for Lucy to pull out.

650
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,519
Made sure he wasn't home,
no warning, nothing.

651
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,559
Now he's turning a blind eye.

652
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,679
Poor Lucy.

653
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,679
First Helen leaves, now this.

654
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,679
She's been through such a lot.

655
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,959
I know what Lucy's been through,
I was there.

656
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,319
But you weren't there, David.

657
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,039
She told me. You weren't.

658
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,279
I'm ready.
Can you bring in the next dog?

659
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,959
Hello, my girl.

660
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,639
Hello.

661
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,279
Hello, my fat friend.

662
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,639
Come on.
That's it.

663
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,879
That's my girl.

664
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,319
Come on. Good girl.

665
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,919
That's my girl. Good girl.

666
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,799
Come on, sweetheart.

667
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,599
Here we go. Good girl.

668
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,879
Come on.

669
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,639
That's it, sweetheart.
That's my girl.

670
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,839
I'll do that.
You'll be wanting to get back.

671
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,719
I'm in no hurry.

672
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,639
You must find it dull here.

673
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,399
Miss your own circle of friends,
particularly your women friends.

674
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,079
Women friends didn't bring me
much luck.

675
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,319
Do you regret it?

676
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,559
No. Of course not.

677
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,959
In the heat of the act,
there are no regrets.

678
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,599
You must know that.

679
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,039
You must find Grahamstown
very quiet by comparison.

680
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,879
At least I'm out of the way
of temptation.

681
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,399
David Lurie speaking.

682
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,519
Can we meet at the clinic
at 4:00?

683
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,799
I'll be there.

684
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,599
<i>She walks in beauty...</i>

685
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,079
<i>like the night...'</i>

686
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,959
Ah, I forgot...

687
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,799
a Detective-Sergeant
Esterhuyse rang.

688
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,359
They found your car.

689
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,079
Oh, that's wonderfuI news.
I'd given up. Is it driveable?

690
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,239
Yes, he said you can take it home.

691
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,399
Oh, come on, let's get out of here.

692
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,719
Come on.

693
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,919
This is the car we found, sir,
that fits the description you gave us.

694
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,559
Unfortunately, this is not my car.

695
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,079
A lighter colour.

696
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,039
OK. thanks.
Oh, well.

697
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,079
Yeah, it's a mistake.

698
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,439
Anyway...
- Alright.

699
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,239
It's all a mistake. A waste of time.

700
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,599
They have a Corolla,
but it's not mine.

701
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,039
If they're caught and
there's a trial, would yo testify?

702
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,759
Are you ready for that?

703
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,639
Lucy...

704
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,759
it's time to face your choices.

705
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,279
Can't we talk about it rationally?

706
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,799
I can't talk anymore, David.

707
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,359
I just can't.

708
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,479
Lock the house,
pay Petrus to look after things,

709
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,559
go to Holland, see your mother.

710
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,199
I'll pay for it.

711
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,599
If I go...

712
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,999
I won't come back.

713
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,159
Is that such a bad thing?

714
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,321
There are some things
you just don't understand.

715
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,719
Don't pull over here.

716
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,799
It's a bad stretch.

717
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:35,279
On the contrary,
I understand all too well.

718
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,159
You were raped by three men...

719
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,199
and I did nothing.

720
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:50,305
If they'd come two weeks earlier,
I would've been alone.

721
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,639
They've done it before.

722
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,639
They do rape.

723
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,919
Stealing is a sideline.

724
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,739
Are you afraid
they're going to come back?

725
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,799
I think they've marked me.

726
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,479
Then you can't possibly stay!

727
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,079
Maybe they see me
as owing something...

728
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,199
and they see themselves
as debt collectors.

729
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:33,117
Lucy, don't try and work out
how they see things.

730
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,279
Maybe...

731
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,817
hating a woman, for a man,
makes sex more exciting.

732
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,319
When you trap a woman...

733
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,079
hold her down...

734
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,795
it must be a bit like killing.

735
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,839
You're a man.

736
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,959
You should know.

737
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,319
Perhaps.

738
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:16,486
Sometimes.

739
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,239
For some men.

740
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,119
I think you should give her
some room.

741
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,559
Go back to Cape Town for a while.

742
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,959
Things have a way
of working themselves out.

743
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,919
Everything will be alright.

744
01:19:43,853 --> 01:19:45,174
Hello.

745
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,559
I'm looking for Mr. Isaacs.
My name is Lurie.

746
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,135
He's not home yet.

747
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,079
When do you expect him home?

748
01:19:52,194 --> 01:19:53,704
Any minute now.

749
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,527
Hi.
I'm Desiré.

750
01:20:12,528 --> 01:20:15,303
You can come inside for him if you like.

751
01:20:41,278 --> 01:20:44,266
Where are you from?
- Cape Town.

752
01:20:44,267 --> 01:20:47,697
My sister's in Cape Town.
She's at the university.

753
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,719
I'm David Lurie. Do you remember me?

754
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,279
Desiree, come.

755
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,399
So what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

756
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,559
You've heard Melanie's side
of the story.

757
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,799
I would like to give you mine.

758
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,479
It began without premeditation
on my part.

759
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,599
One of those sudden little adventures
that men of a certain kind have.

760
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,159
Excuse me for talking this way,

761
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,239
I'm trying to be frank.

762
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,999
However, something unexpected
happened...

763
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,839
Melanie struck up a fire in me.

764
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,919
I ask myself, what on earth
you think you are up to...

765
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,839
coming to my house
and telling me stories?

766
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,239
I'm sorry. It's outrageous, I know.

767
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,319
How is Melanie?

768
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,319
Melanie's well.

769
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,359
She's resumed her studies.

770
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,799
She continues with her theatre work
in her spare time.

771
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,599
So Melanie's alright.

772
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,279
Is there something else
you wanted to tell me, Mr. Lurie?

773
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:44,279
I am truly sorry for what I put your
daughter and your family through.

774
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:51,839
The grief I have caused you
and Mrs. Isaacs.

775
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,439
So at last you have apologised.

776
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,839
I say to myself, we are all sorry
when we are found out.

777
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,719
But the question is what are you
going to do, now that you are sorry?

778
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,039
May I pronounce the word 'God'?

779
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,319
What does God want from you,
besides being very sorry?

780
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,919
Why do you think
you are here, Mr. Lurie?

781
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,959
You were passing through George
and you thought...

782
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,479
'Why not?'
- No...

783
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,479
I came to George to speak to you.

784
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,999
You are not hoping that we are going
to intervene on your behalf...

785
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,999
with the university, are you?

786
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,639
To intervene?

787
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,519
Because the path you are on,
Mr Lurie,

788
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,319
is one that God
has ordained for you.

789
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,719
It is not for us to intervene.

790
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,959
No. I don't want you to intervene.

791
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,879
I ask you all forgiveness.

792
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,879
Mmm. Mmmm!

793
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,399
And what have we here?

794
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,479
A bit too much oomph!

795
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,039
I suppose you want it straightened?

796
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,119
Could you do my hair like Oprah's?

797
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,319
Oh, she's not asking for much, eh?

798
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,999
I'll tell you what, I'm going to go
and mix up some magical chemicals.

799
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,186
Can I get you ladies some coffee?

800
01:27:19,187 --> 01:27:20,890
I'll have mine white, please.

801
01:27:20,891 --> 01:27:23,273
I'll have mine black, please.

802
01:27:23,308 --> 01:27:24,959
Well, that's easy to remember!

803
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,479
And one cappuccino coming up.

804
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,319
I’ve come for the job
you've advertised.

805
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,839
Oh, is it?
Well, what are you waiting for, girl?

806
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,519
Pick up the broom
and make yourself useful.

807
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,479
Jesus Christ!

808
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,079
Oh, girls!

809
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,479
We have until the end of the month
to pay the rent!

810
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,439
Oh! That savage, savage Indian!

811
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,399
What are we going to do, Sidney?

812
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,439
We're not going to panic.
We are the cowboys.

813
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,479
You know, I’ve got
enough chemicals back there

814
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:39,919
to make an exploding onion bhaji!

815
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,919
And we're gonna stick that
right up his... turban.

816
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,399
I’ve got a better idea!

817
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,959
Brilliant! Genius!
The girl's a nutcracker!

818
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,719
Are you going to explain
this childish behaviour?

819
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,682
Haven't you learnt your lesson?
- What was my lesson?

820
01:29:06,683 --> 01:29:07,683
Stick with your own kind.

821
01:29:08,203 --> 01:29:10,621
Melanie will spit in your eyes
if she sees you again.

822
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,976
Keep away from her.

823
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:20,402
Find yourself another life, professor!

824
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,426
Hey, Boosie,
you can have him. It's your turn.

825
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,879
Hi.

826
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,359
Hi, big boy.
You looking for a good time?

827
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,199
Hello?

828
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,679
Oh, we have a grumpy one.

829
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,479
Hi. Hello?

830
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,159
Thank you. Goodnight.

831
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,839
Goodnight.

832
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,519
Are you OK?
I'm fine.

833
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,279
I'm very busy.

834
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,839
Ring me anytime.

835
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,719
I miss you, Lucy.

836
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,199
Goodnight.

837
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,839
Goodnight.

838
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,319
Why are you going to Durban?

839
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,959
Are you applying for a job there?

840
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,879
I lied. I wanted to see
if you were alright.

841
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,119
I missed you.

842
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,879
I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

843
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,479
I'm pregnant.

844
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,559
From that day?

845
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,599
From that day.

846
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,479
But I thought you said you'd taken
care of it with that woman GP.

847
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,159
I'm not having an abortion.

848
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,839
Are you telling me
you're going to have the child?

849
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,119
Yes.

850
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,479
A child from one of those men?

851
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,039
Yes.

852
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,519
But why, Lucy?

853
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,999
I'm a woman, David.

854
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,359
Do you think I hate children?

855
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,879
Must I choose against a child
because of who the father is?

856
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,119
And your mind's made up?

857
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,119
Yes.

858
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,799
Very well.

859
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,919
I will stand by you no matter what.

860
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,919
I'm going for a walk.

861
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,079
By the way, the boy's back.

862
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,839
The boy?

863
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,399
The boy you had a row with
at Petrus's party.

864
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,519
He's staying with Petrus.

865
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,279
Helps him out.

866
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,799
His name is Pollux.

867
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:06,199
Anyway, he turns out to be
the brother of Petrus's wife.

868
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:14,319
So, Pollux returns
to the scene of the crime...

869
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,199
and we must all behave
as if nothing's happened.

870
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,359
I want you to stay clear of him.

871
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,199
I suspect there's something
wrong with him,

872
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,799
but I can't order him
off the property.

873
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,679
It's not in my power.
Particularly...

874
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,279
Particularly what?

875
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:34,839
Particularly when he may be the
father of the child you are carrying.

876
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,959
Molo.

877
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,399
I'm looking for Petrus.

878
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,799
Ah, David. You are back.

879
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,679
How was Cape Town?

880
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,159
Good, good. Lucy tells me
the boy is back - Pollux.

881
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,319
He is my relative.

882
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,519
You told me you didn't know him.

883
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,159
You lied to me.

884
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,679
You come look after your child.

885
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,679
I also look after my child.

886
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,479
Your child? So now he's your child?

887
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,359
Yes, he is a child.

888
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,879
He is my family, my people.

889
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,079
You say it is bad what happened,
I also say it is bad,

890
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,079
but now it is finished.

891
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,559
It's not finished.

892
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,639
It will go on long after I'm dead
and you're dead.

893
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,119
He will marry Lucy.

894
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,119
But he is too young -
too young to marry.

895
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,079
He is a child.

896
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,719
A dangerous child. A jackal.

897
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,479
Yes, too young to marry.

898
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:38,279
Maybe one day he can marry,
but not now.

899
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,199
I will marry.

900
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,719
You will marry whom?

901
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,199
I will marry Lucy.

902
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,399
Lucy, this is preposterous!

903
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:02,279
He's not offering a church wedding,
he's offering an alliance, a deal.

904
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:03,759
I contribute the land,

905
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,479
and in return I'm allowed
to creep in under his wing.

906
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,519
Otherwise, I'm without protection.

907
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,079
What about the personal side?

908
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,079
I don't think Petrus
wants to sleep with me.

909
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,039
And you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

910
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:17,759
Good, then I will go and tell him
that we refuse his offer.

911
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,519
Wait!

912
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,319
Say I accept his protection.

913
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,119
If he wants me to be known
as his wife, so be it.

914
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:33,279
But then the child becomes his too,
part of his family.

915
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:37,879
As for the land, say I will sign
the land over to him.

916
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,999
But the house remains mine.

917
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,559
I'll become a tenant on his land.

918
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,919
No-one is to enter the house
without my permission, including him.

919
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,239
And I keep the kennels.

920
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,159
Lucy, it's not workable.

921
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,519
I'm not leaving, David.

922
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,079
Go and tell Petrus what I have said.

923
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,759
How humiliating to end like this.

924
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,799
Yes, I agree.

925
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,599
Like a dog.

926
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,279
Yes.

927
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,959
Like a dog.

928
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,319
You animal!

929
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,359
You swine! You filthy swine!

930
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,199
David! Stop it!

931
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:40,879
Easy...

932
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,519
Are you alright?

933
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,399
Come, let's go and wash it.

934
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,467
We will kill you!

935
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,519
This can't go on, David.
- He was spying on you.

936
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,839
He's a disturbed child!

937
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,879
Is that an excuse
for what he did to you?

938
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,199
He should be in an institution.

939
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,559
Well, he's here and he's a fact of life!

940
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,799
Everything had settled down
before you came back, David.

941
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,559
Then I'd better pack my bags.

942
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,199
Is this just a visit
or are you here for a while?

943
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,479
Oh, I'm back
for as long as necessary,

944
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,759
but I won't be staying with Lucy.

945
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,159
Anyway, I'm looking for a room,

946
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,679
so if you hear of anything, let me know.

947
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:25,599
<i>She walks in beauty...</i>

948
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:33,399
<i>like the night of cloudless climes
and starry skies...</i>

949
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:38,879
<i>and all that's best
of dark and bright.</i>

950
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:42,599
<i>She walks in beauty...</i>

951
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:56,359
<i>and in your eyes thus mellowed,</i>

952
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,959
<i>Her eyes thus mellowed...</i>

953
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:19,279
Thank you.

954
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,679
Was that the last?

955
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,679
One more.

956
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,159
I thought you would save him
for another week.

957
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,759
Are you giving him up?

958
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,199
Yes.

959
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,754
Lucy?

960
01:46:00,946 --> 01:46:02,323
Lucy?

961
01:46:06,096 --> 01:46:09,736
Hello, Milo. Good boy. That's fine.

962
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,359
I didn't hear you.

963
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:25,919
Where's the truck?

964
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,999
I parked up the road, took a walk.

965
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,693
Will you come in for some tea?

966
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:15,996
<i>She walks in beauty, like the night</i>

967
01:48:15,997 --> 01:48:24,965
<i>Of cloudless climes and starry skies,</i>

968
01:48:25,727 --> 01:48:34,641
<i>And all that's best of dark and bright</i>

969
01:48:34,642 --> 01:48:44,653
<i>Meet in her aspect and in her eyes;</i>

970
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:54,594
<i>Thus mellow'd to that tender light</i>

971
01:48:54,680 --> 01:49:03,747
<i>Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.</i>

972
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:29,162
<i>One shade the more, one ray the less,</i>

973
01:49:29,508 --> 01:49:33,839
<i>Had half impair'd the nameless grace</i>

974
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,488
<i>Which waves in every raven tress</i>

975
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:45,157
<i>Or softly lightens o'er her face,</i>

976
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:51,199
<i>Where thoughts serenely sweet express</i>

977
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:58,489
<i>How pure...</i>

978
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:13,479
<i>how dear their dwelling place.</i>

979
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:56,661
<i>And on that cheek and o'er that brow</i>

980
01:50:56,696 --> 01:51:04,130
<i>So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,</i>

981
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:16,998
<i>The smiles that win, the tints that glow...</i>

982
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:52,839
<i>But tell of days in goodness spent, -</i>

983
01:51:54,040 --> 01:52:03,119
<i>A mind at peace with all below,</i>

984
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:17,047
<i>A heart whose love is innocent.</i>
