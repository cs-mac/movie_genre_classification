1
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,916
Hats, shoes, bottles...

2
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,545
...or used clothes
you want to sell.

3
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:30,622
Hats, shoes, bottles or used
clothes you want to sell

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,367
Birds for sale.

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:51,479
Birds for sale.

6
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:18,140
Tamales, get your
hot tamales.

7
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,510
Come get your hot tamales.

8
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,774
HEROES HOSTEL

9
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,442
Camella is not a thief.

10
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,911
Why is her mother in jail, then?

11
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,674
- She took my buttons.
- Made of shells.

12
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,182
You showed them to me yourself.

13
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,116
Shells?

14
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,746
I took them off
Chácharas old coat.

15
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,724
Tell it to her face,
get it off your back.

16
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,658
Do you think I'm scared of her?

17
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,060
If I see her I'll make her...

18
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,121
...swallow them and pull
them out of her stomach.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,068
The wires should be on the front.

20
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,336
Yes, that would be more practical.

21
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,739
The blueprints of the project...

22
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,004
...will be ready this week, Mr. Pablo.

23
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,745
Excuse me, sir.

24
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,271
Is there going to be
electricity here?

25
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,916
Will they charge for it?

26
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,283
They're bringing it
for free, you fool.

27
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,190
I can't afford candles,
how can I buy bulbs?

28
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,059
Electricity is a public utility.

29
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,694
There is no such thing here.

30
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,212
This is a poor neighborhood.

31
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:43,730
Let's get it, it's on the table.

32
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,998
First come, first serve.

33
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:45,965
Get out.

34
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,034
Nobody comes in my kitchen.

35
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,501
Mrs. Chanfa.

36
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,154
Mrs. Chanfa.

37
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,471
Come up, please.

38
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,141
Now what happened
to the blessed soul?

39
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,904
Mrs. Chanfa!

40
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,179
Stop shouting, I'm not deaf.

41
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,703
I'm coming.

42
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,679
You!

43
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,777
You've got to do something.

44
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,555
You must react.

45
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,093
If you don't pay me tonight,
you'll lose your house.

46
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,355
Mrs. Chanfa, guess what.

47
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,440
Anything, coming from you.

48
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,677
What disease is it this time?

49
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,666
Well, look here.

50
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,511
The fact is, I was robbed.

51
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,845
All the clothes from the trunk.

52
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,022
Look.

53
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,725
I have nothing to wear
but the cloak.

54
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,693
And only because I had it on.

55
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,724
Plus...

56
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,195
...the little bit of food
there was in the kitchen.

57
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,293
What more did you want?

58
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,268
The alms from yesterday's mass.

59
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,334
I curse your moment of birth,
I am tired of you.

60
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,869
What will it be, you big fool?

61
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,210
A piece of bread...

62
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,047
...or some tortillas
to keep me on my feet.

63
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,776
The rest doesn't matter.

64
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,318
If you can spare it,
may God repay you.

65
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,785
What if I can't...

66
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,782
...or don't want to?

67
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,382
Then, I won't eat.

68
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,324
It wouldn't be a first.

69
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,630
Anyway, who was the wretch
who stole from you?

70
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,564
Chona, no doubt about it.

71
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,494
She came in to clean
house and make coffee.

72
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,604
I thanked her,
and when I remembered...

73
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,438
...there was nothing...

74
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,462
Did you hear?

75
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,009
They called your cousin a thief.

76
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,708
Who?

77
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,710
The priest up there.

78
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,947
People walk in
and out of his home.

79
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,482
Be they thieves...

80
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,016
...or whatever...

81
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,386
Where are you going, doll?

82
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,421
Even manure smells better
than that woman's perfume.

83
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,025
I'd better go.

84
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,715
Look who dared spread poison.

85
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,441
That rotten priest.

86
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,748
He said she stole from him.

87
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,219
Chona may be a street
walker like us...

88
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,052
...but she's better than her mother!

89
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,319
What did they steal,
vinegar face?

90
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,418
Not your bones, I presume.

91
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,329
Look at that.

92
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,596
The almighty bishop.

93
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,366
Even flies refuse to
stand on his skin.

94
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,136
The sacred grave of
11 thousand virgins.

95
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,535
That's what Chona took.

96
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,256
Wash your mouth out before...

97
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,908
...you talk to honest people.

98
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,560
Out, you've said enough.

99
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,137
But he insulted my cousin.

100
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,712
Get out, the three of you.

101
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,648
Don't you dare bother the priest.

102
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,583
Don't yell,
I'm not your sister.

103
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,811
Come on.

104
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,220
I'm leaving.

105
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,455
Because I feel like it...

106
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,323
...you damned slave drivers.
Because we're poor.

107
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,195
Stop running, they won't bite.

108
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,663
Pretending to be so good.

109
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,630
Damnation.

110
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,925
Let's go.

111
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,369
Thank you very much, sir.

112
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,667
You're welcome, Father.

113
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,509
Should I report the theft?

114
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,044
I don't have the habit.

115
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:18,908
The habit?

116
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,747
You've been robbed so many times?

117
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,215
Yes sir, many.

118
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,147
Always.

119
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,414
Excuse me.

120
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,384
Sorry, Father.

121
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,288
May I ask you some questions?

122
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,812
Sure, certainly.

123
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,724
Come right in...

124
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,128
...make yourself at home.
There's a staircase.

125
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,863
Everybody comes in and out.

126
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,558
If you like, come in.

127
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,560
Come in.

128
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,937
We hope we're not interrupting.

129
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,037
Not at all.

130
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,339
Make yourselves at home.

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,009
I heard you are not
troubled by the thefts.

132
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,560
I don't keep anything, see?

133
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,110
I don't know what keys are.

134
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,006
Besides, my few possessions...

135
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,815
...that I had, rather...

136
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,114
...aren't worth the
effort of locking up.

137
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,751
But please, sit down.

138
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,092
Are you an orthodox priest?

139
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:06,992
No, sir.

140
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,427
I am Roman Catholic and Apostolic.

141
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,961
I profess my ideas with conviction...

142
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:14,093
...as I do my faith in Christ our Lord.

143
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,699
Things don't belong to anybody.

144
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,569
They are for whomever need them.

145
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,507
I'm surprised to see a
priest living in this hostel.

146
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,975
My neighbors are poor.

147
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,009
So am I.

148
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,545
That's why I live among them.

149
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,078
Oh, sorry, Father.

150
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,447
I've come to trouble you.

151
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,815
What do you need, woman?

152
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,580
The boys broke the pot,
I came to get yours.

153
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,500
- Take it.
- Thank you.

154
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,181
You aren't Mexican, are you?

155
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,056
My parents were Spaniards...

156
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,692
...and I went to school in Spain.

157
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,353
Where do you preach?

158
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,752
I rarely step into the pulpit.

159
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,634
I speak low and familiarly
to those who want to listen.

160
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,969
And to whoever is close by...

161
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,169
...I speak my mind.

162
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,159
How do you support yourself?

163
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,703
From paid masses.

164
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,273
When there are any.

165
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,126
I'm taking this wood, Father.

166
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,978
You're not using it, anyway.

167
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,206
Fine, woman.

168
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,448
No offense, but your
life seems very precarious.

169
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,043
Quite so.

170
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,521
But due to my conformity
I am not bitter.

171
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,454
So...

172
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,157
...you challenge outrage...

173
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,524
...hunger, poverty...

174
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,720
...persecution and slandering.

175
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,390
I do not challenge them.

176
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,495
I withstand them.

177
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,332
From what you've said...

178
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,135
...I presume you won't
improve your condition...

179
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,228
...or ask your superiors for anything.

180
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,807
That is correct, I do not intend...

181
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,172
...and I do not ask.

182
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,045
You eat when you need to,
if not, you don't.

183
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,013
Exactly, I do not eat.

184
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,542
And if it is necessary,
I ask for charity.

185
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,350
Don't you think that the
dignity of a priest...

186
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,315
...cannot be reduced
to asking for charity?

187
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,651
Oh no, sir.

188
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,028
Charity does not
degrade the recipient.

189
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,996
Nor does it affect dignity.

190
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,931
But, sirs...

191
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,492
...haven't we spoken
enough about me?

192
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,209
If we, moved by your
sad situation were to...

193
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,905
...place some coins
in your hands...

194
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,703
...would you take them?

195
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,349
It was a pleasure, Father.

196
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,736
Likewise, sir.

197
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:14,986
At your service.

198
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,477
Thank you very much, sir.

199
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,568
If you want to die,
use the beam.

200
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,536
That won't crack.

201
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,963
Stay still, mule.

202
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,439
Even if you really
want to die...

203
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,672
...he doesn't deserve
such a favor.

204
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,645
Leave me alone.

205
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,977
I don't feel like it.

206
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,674
Now, you listen to me.

207
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,578
I don't want
stories in my house.

208
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,452
If you want to be in the newspaper...

209
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,853
...jump in front of a train,
the audience is bigger.

210
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,525
You'd better get to work
and stop thinking...

211
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,493
...things you shouldn't.

212
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,995
He's back, isn't he?

213
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,625
No, but he said he would
pay me what you owe.

214
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,101
Come on, woman.

215
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,333
Cheer up, and come
help me in the kitchen.

216
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,913
Take Father Nazario's
breakfast upstairs.

217
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,881
He might give you good advice.

218
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,175
You want one?

219
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,751
Eat, woman.

220
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,222
Why don't you eat? That's
why you get those attacks.

221
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:56,847
Want some?

222
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,054
No.

223
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,317
Don't eat, go ahead and die.

224
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,132
Good morning.

225
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,868
God bless you, Father.

226
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,534
May He repay you.

227
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:12,200
I'm fine this time.

228
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,064
Wait.

229
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,874
Take some of this.

230
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,818
God bless you,
and may he give you more.

231
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,257
Not so much, or else...

232
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,849
Thank you very much.

233
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,832
What's wrong?

234
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,969
Who are you?

235
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,973
Oh, I know.

236
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,443
You live beneath this room.

237
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,711
Why are you crying?

238
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,650
You yelled in your sleep.

239
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,861
Bad dreams.

240
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,422
You've been deceived, right?

241
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,360
Go back to your town...

242
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,561
...to your people.

243
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,706
Why did you return, Pinto?

244
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:59,604
Where are the clothes to wash?

245
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,684
Your burner.

246
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,924
Well.

247
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,595
- Will you return?
- No.

248
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,568
Are you leaving forever?

249
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,029
Didn't you know?

250
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,260
Celery.

251
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,950
A mixed one for me.

252
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,144
Half.

253
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,876
One liter, lime.

254
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,987
Have a drink, cheer up.

255
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,724
Come on, it's celery spirits.

256
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,191
I can't hold it.

257
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,927
Why do you think we drink?

258
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,121
To get drunk.

259
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,180
I'm glad you looked for me.

260
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,822
We're from the same town.

261
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,463
What you have to do now...

262
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,262
...is come live with me.

263
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,199
I considered being a maid.

264
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,104
Look...

265
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:36,006
See who's coming in,
look at her blouse.

266
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,408
Good evening.

267
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,613
Greet me.

268
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,917
How dare you greet me, you thief?

269
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,557
Where did you get those buttons?

270
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,794
At a store.

271
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:56,995
I bought them.

272
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,381
My drawer is not a store.

273
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,766
Come here, I'll teach you.

274
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,133
So, the sows are
feeling brave this morning.

275
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,521
What am I, disabled?

276
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:08,806
- Whore.
- Madame.

277
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,276
You're going to get it...

278
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,903
...you hussy.

279
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,212
Up front, don't be a...

280
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,016
Let me go, I'm going to kill her.

281
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:17,948
Let her go.

282
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,343
You'll see.

283
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,216
Let me go

284
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,179
Let me go.

285
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,291
Let me go.

286
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,893
You wretch, scoundrel.

287
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,592
You tramp...

288
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,999
Leave her to me.

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,614
Leave this one to me.

290
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,229
Leave this one to me.

291
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,504
Kill her.

292
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,665
I'll kill her.

293
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,515
What are you doing here?

294
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,484
I can't be apart from you.

295
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,540
Hussy.

296
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,219
You're so pretty.

297
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,586
You've taken over my thoughts.

298
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,140
This is how I wanted to see you.

299
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:02,457
Begging for what I won't give.

300
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,729
You always want the same thing.

301
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,298
I'm going to bleed you,
and then I'll go.

302
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,063
I'll go to others who
are worth more than you.

303
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,839
You like me, don't you?

304
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,709
I've robbed your will...

305
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,804
You can't leave me
even if you wanted to.

306
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,175
Pig.

307
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,252
Good evening, Father, it's Ándara.

308
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,271
What do you want at this hour?

309
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,272
Which Ándara are you?

310
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,470
The one who insulted
you this morning...

311
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,611
...and said the dirtiest things.

312
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,547
Oh, you're one of the three...

313
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,114
Exactly.

314
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,752
I'm telling you that my
cousin Chona is a thief.

315
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,151
And you're a saint.

316
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:09,821
Well, I'll be.

317
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,551
What are you doing here?

318
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,258
They're following me.

319
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,196
I have taken a life.

320
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,322
Heavens!

321
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,664
Why did you come here to hide?

322
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:26,163
Because they won't
find me here.

323
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,100
I haven't said
I'll let you stay.

324
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,337
I'm wounded.

325
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,944
Just look at you.

326
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,944
You poor soul.

327
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,550
How much blood have you lost?

328
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,651
Let me fix that wound.

329
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,989
Who did this to you?

330
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,865
That damned Camella...

331
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,061
...with a knife she was hiding.

332
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,300
Anyway, why do you
want to know?

333
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,568
To turn me in?

334
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,574
Tell me how it happened.

335
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,601
I'll decide if I should
help you or turn you in.

336
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,512
All because of some buttons
that tramp stole from me.

337
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,113
When I confronted her she
reacted, and I cut her face.

338
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,491
Then she called me a whore,
and I took it.

339
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,630
Oh, but then she called
me a drunk and a madame...

340
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,029
...and I couldn't take that.

341
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,432
She pulled out a knife...

342
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,168
...and cut me right here.

343
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,736
I took it from her...

344
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,432
...and stabbed her over here.

345
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,939
Excuse me.

346
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,239
And over here.

347
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,010
That must have made her mad.

348
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,496
If I didn't kill her
I came real close because...

349
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:43,982
...she hollered like a pig
when they took her.

350
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,383
You fool.

351
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,386
Do you realize what you've done?

352
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,753
Sure I do.

353
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,356
I may be a street walker,
but I've got my pride.

354
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,191
Oh, heavens.

355
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,160
Shut that infamous mouth.

356
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,844
You talk about pride after you...

357
00:19:57,845 --> 00:20:00,328
...committed the sin of homicide?

358
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,130
You should worry about your guilt...

359
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,133
...before it's too late.

360
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,431
Don't say that, Father.

361
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,436
Oh, mother, it hurts so much.

362
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,478
Do you have vinegar
for the wound?

363
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,570
Vinegar...

364
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,415
Where do you think you are?

365
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,050
I have no such luxuries.

366
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,483
Do something...

367
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,245
...because it's getting very bad.

368
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,409
Why am I seeing black?

369
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,145
Why don't we let some air in?

370
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,947
Don't turn me in, Father.

371
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,377
I'd rather die.

372
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,485
You are good, I am evil.

373
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,686
Don't turn me in.

374
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,092
I won't turn you in.

375
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,396
If you are not found,
it's up to God.

376
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,624
As long as you're here,
I will help you.

377
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,094
But it they should ask...

378
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,430
I cannot lie.

379
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,600
Go on, Father. Make a broth.

380
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,745
Put some herbs in it.

381
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,181
Forget the herbs, you poor wretch.

382
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,617
Think of your sins.

383
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,348
Your conscience must
be very heavy.

384
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,057
Put your fate in God's
and the Virgin Mary's hands.

385
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,494
I am here to help you.

386
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,630
If you think of more
serious things...

387
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,330
...than Camella...

388
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,029
Your dignity...

389
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,031
...and herbs.

390
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:49,308
Et tibi Pater: Quia peccavi nimis
cogitatione verbo, et opere...

391
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,658
Mea culpa

392
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,007
Mea culpa

393
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,269
Mea maxima culpa

394
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,293
Let go of my son.

395
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,797
Nobody lays a hand on him...

396
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:12,563
...except me.

397
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,298
He mustn't steal my sugar.

398
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,101
Take him away, he's had dessert.

399
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:17,368
Is the girl yours?

400
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,304
No, she's your mother's.

401
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,239
Hey, don't get mad...

402
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,073
One-eye.

403
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,668
A cup of coffee,
make it strong.

404
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,707
Father Nazario.

405
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,002
Father Nazario.

406
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,771
Let's go, uncle, he is not in.

407
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,363
I must go.

408
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm going to give him
the alms for today's mass.

409
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,469
Next week I may
have something more.

410
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,787
Thank you so much, Mr. Angel.

411
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,476
You are always very helpful.

412
00:23:27,477 --> 00:23:29,164
You deserve it, Mr. Nazario.

413
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,165
Here you are.

414
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,779
I could use some broth, Father...

415
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,441
...but above all, some tequila.

416
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,984
It's good for inner
and outer wounds.

417
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,848
Go get it and come back soon.

418
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,014
If you want something, ask.

419
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,455
This is not a hostel
for criminals...

420
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,457
...and I don't take orders from you.

421
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,664
I'll go if I want to.

422
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,433
And I'll do as I please.

423
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,201
I have a coin in my pocket.

424
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,896
Take it.

425
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,664
I don't need your coin.

426
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,963
If I did, I would ask you for it.

427
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,935
Get the tequila at a distant bar.

428
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,848
Not at Chato's. You're too innocent,
and he's too talkative.

429
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,874
They would throw me out.

430
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,953
Save your advice,
I know where to go.

431
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,384
Try not to make noise.

432
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,599
Oh, St. Anthony.

433
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,975
They may ask the blessed priest...

434
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,340
...to tell them everything.

435
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:39,705
Don't let them find me...

436
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,678
...and I'll light a candle
for you on Tuesdays.

437
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,372
Don't get mad if I say...

438
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,208
...that I don't believe in hell.

439
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,709
Tripas told me...

440
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,844
...and he has read a lot.

441
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,715
Pick between Mr. Tripas' opinion...

442
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,915
...and mine.

443
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:21,052
No, no Father.
You are more knowledgeable.

444
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,917
Where does it end?

445
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:28,527
When you're lying on a mat
do you know you're dead?

446
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,530
Your soul knows it,
and it's immortal.

447
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,131
I have some more questions.

448
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,768
Well. Maybe since you
know so much...

449
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,360
...you can teach me.

450
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,837
How are people born?

451
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,669
Why do chicks hatch from eggs
looking like chickens?

452
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,169
Why are three buzzards bad
luck, and two are good?

453
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,678
How come mice, small as
they are, are so cunning...

454
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,485
...while rats are big and stupid?

455
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,149
Something else...

456
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,326
Why are souls released
from Purgatory...

457
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,385
...when you give priests money?

458
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,656
Come on, tell me.

459
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,597
Your head is full
of confusion, child.

460
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,729
And superstition.

461
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,163
Alas...

462
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,473
...since there is nothing to do...

463
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:17,308
...I will answer your questions.

464
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,305
One by one.

465
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,146
I'll begin my clearing
up the first...

466
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,310
...which is the easiest,
yet most mysterious.

467
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,007
Why are we born?

468
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,401
You really got ahead.

469
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,021
Don't come in, I'm bathing.

470
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,439
Wait, I'll be done in a minute.

471
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,244
Why are you so late?

472
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,540
I've been worried sick.

473
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,016
You had to be a man.

474
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,009
I have no reason to explain
my actions to you.

475
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,137
You filled the house
of your perfume.

476
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,105
Don't you like it?

477
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,202
I prefer the smell
of wild flowers, child.

478
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,211
You cannot come in, Father.

479
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,949
What is it?

480
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,382
Why do you cover your face?

481
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,182
Tell me, what happened?

482
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,196
I'm ashamed of you seeing me.

483
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,798
You should have been
more ashamed before.

484
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,661
This is who you should be.

485
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,063
Not the other one.

486
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,502
I'm almost out of pain, Father.

487
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,196
I can go now.

488
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,208
I'm not throwing you out.

489
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,310
But if you're cured, you should go.

490
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,677
It isn't right to have
a woman in my room.

491
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,544
Do you think I don't know that?

492
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,487
You won't have to see me tomorrow.

493
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,749
You'll never see me again.

494
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:15,382
Tamales, hot tamales.

495
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,324
Tamales, Father.

496
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,034
Tamales, get your hot tamales.

497
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,870
I just found out where she is.

498
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,201
And she's really close, too.

499
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,575
Pay me to keep quiet.

500
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,735
I will not.

501
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,842
You Judas.

502
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,474
You'll sell a friend
out for money?

503
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,075
Friend...

504
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,283
I want money,
I've had enough lectures.

505
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,587
So, will you pay me?

506
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,645
No.

507
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,607
I'm going straight to the police.

508
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:48,284
Each will fight for his own life

509
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:49,960
What evil has Ándara done you?

510
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,657
You will never set
foot in my house again.

511
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,505
Cinnamon.

512
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,996
Cinnamon, come here.

513
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,738
Ándara.

514
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,672
Ándara.

515
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,676
Open up, for Christ's sake.

516
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,547
Father Nazario, open up.

517
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,742
Wait.

518
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:14,984
What for?

519
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,834
Cinnamon turned her in.

520
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,569
The police will be here soon.

521
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,266
If they find her with you
they'll take you in, too.

522
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,475
Come with me now that it's dark.

523
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,274
You can hide in my room.

524
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:41,073
They'd find her there, too.

525
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,646
Let them.

526
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,449
Let them take me in, too.

527
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,150
I hope they hang me.

528
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,850
That's all I'm good for.

529
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,260
What's wrong with you, Mrs. Chanfa?

530
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,750
The farce is over.

531
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,999
I threw you out the day before
yesterday because of the smell.

532
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,593
I didn't say anything
on account of the priest.

533
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,364
Go, they shan't catch you
in this house.

534
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,138
Use the other staircase.

535
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,275
What will they do to the priest?

536
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,141
Go on, now.

537
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,941
Wash the floor you stepped on so...

538
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:14,741
...they don't smell you were here.

539
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,782
And you, you must leave right away.

540
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,285
They will come around asking
if we saw you...

541
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,255
...and we still have to scrub
all this and you're in the way.

542
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,492
I was on my way to Angel's
house to discuss...

543
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,016
So, go over there now.

544
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,580
Lend me the sponge...

545
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,998
...and bring some water.

546
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,488
Lend me a sponge.

547
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,008
You are going to help me.

548
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,943
Bring all the petroleum you can.

549
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,492
Hurry up.

550
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,462
I'll be in the kitchen
like nothing happened.

551
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,385
What are you doing?

552
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,898
The smell that was here...

553
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,968
...it'll go away with fire.

554
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,559
Fire!

555
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,967
Fire!

556
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,709
How's the manufacture coming along?

557
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,142
Good morning, Mr. Ángel.

558
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,934
Do these suit you?

559
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,780
They're fine, thank you.

560
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,584
Look, Mr. Nazario.

561
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,586
The friendlier, the clearer.

562
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,490
Do you know where I've been?

563
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,684
To see the judge.

564
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,689
And do you know what he said?

565
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,027
That you are nuts.

566
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:29,197
How could you admit
you knew about the fight...

567
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,528
...and that you hid that woman?

568
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,166
There is only one way
of telling the truth.

569
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,304
Telling it.

570
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,810
Now they're saying you had
a scandalous, dishonest...

571
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:41,506
...and dirty relationship
with that woman.

572
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:42,613
Slander.

573
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,814
Plain slander.

574
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,612
I know you wouldn't dare.

575
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:49,353
Besides, if you were to
succumb to such a demon...

576
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,446
...it wouldn't be
with that ugly creature.

577
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,950
Here's the chocolate.

578
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,389
Sit down, Mr. Nazario,
I have more to say.

579
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,575
To top things off, they are...

580
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,545
...implicating you in the
fire that destroyed the hostel.

581
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:15,876
In the fire?

582
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,047
Me?

583
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,640
Yes, sir. You.

584
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,041
So, what are you going to do?

585
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,833
God is my tribunal.

586
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,282
I submit to Him.

587
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,723
I will accept in resignation...

588
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,957
...the pain that human evil...

589
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,380
...may afflict upon me.

590
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,897
The Bishop is aware.

591
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,492
There may even be
an investigation.

592
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,829
That will cost you
your preaching.

593
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,067
What do you say to that?

594
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,078
That I shall obey with resignation...

595
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,079
...my boss's determination.

596
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,914
But if you are relieved of your...

597
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,151
...license while in this house,
it would be...

598
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,483
...very painful for my mother.

599
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,777
She cares deeply for you, and...

600
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,185
...I would prefer to
spare her the pain...

601
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,192
...and that vendetta.

602
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,227
You are right.

603
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,862
I have to spare that lady...

604
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,366
...who has been so kind
as to put me up...

605
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,765
...in her home such sorrow.

606
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,161
I shall leave at
this precise moment.

607
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,138
Fortunately, everything I possess...

608
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,503
...is on me.

609
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:16,873
So...

610
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,308
...after expressing to you
my utmost gratitude...

611
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,105
Heavens, Mr. Nazario,
this is not a game.

612
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,607
Sit down and
drink your chocolate.

613
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,580
Do you know where you're going?

614
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,388
If they are taking my license...

615
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:38,018
...I shall do what I always wanted.

616
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,254
Move to the countryside.

617
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,988
Where I will feel close to God.

618
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,201
All right.

619
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,204
But how will you support yourself?

620
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,432
I'll beg.

621
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,300
What?

622
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,406
A priest, begging?

623
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,677
Don't forget priestly dignity.

624
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,701
Don't worry.

625
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,108
Nobody will notice...

626
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,077
...that I am a priest.

627
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,309
Good afternoon, sir.

628
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,344
Would you give me charity
in the form of food?

629
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,576
We don't feed bums here.

630
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,950
I can work in exchange.

631
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:38,082
Now, that's different.

632
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,881
Wait.

633
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,587
Hey, you.

634
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,759
Give him a cart.

635
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,008
Thank you.

636
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,935
They denied my
cousin work yesterday.

637
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,099
Of course.

638
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,871
He demanded a salary.

639
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,673
He wouldn't work for food.

640
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,837
There are ten men in town
waiting their turn.

641
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,080
What shall we tell this one?

642
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,308
Leave it to me.

643
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,241
All right.

644
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,089
You know.

645
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:22,884
What is it?

646
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,026
Where are you going?

647
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,608
I'm sorry, sir.

648
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:26,955
I am on my way.

649
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,954
Pretty good, huh?

650
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,960
What did they say?

651
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,524
Who was the brave man
who threw you out?

652
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,598
If you can, answer me.

653
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,430
I'm the one who threw him out.

654
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,704
Working for food
is bad for all of us.

655
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,104
- Of course it is.
- That's why.

656
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,141
And that's just in the meantime.

657
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,943
What a scoundrel.

658
00:40:16,944 --> 00:40:18,908
Careful, his hand.

659
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,334
A coin, for the love of God.

660
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,339
May God repay you.

661
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,485
Father Nazario.

662
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,160
Hello, Beatriz.

663
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,432
It's a miracle I should find you.

664
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,599
Why, child?

665
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,363
It's a big world.

666
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,239
What happened,
why are you like this?

667
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,900
I am on a pilgrimage.

668
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,631
Barefoot?

669
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,511
I spent the night
with a poor family.

670
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,072
I gave my boots to the
eldest, who was ill.

671
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,994
And the rest of the things?

672
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:27,441
You must have had something.

673
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,610
A man with the venerable
look of a priest...

674
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,919
...took my bag and my blanket.

675
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,150
It wasn't worth a dime anyway.

676
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,385
What are you doing here?

677
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,356
I live with my widowed sister.

678
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,323
Ándara is also with us.

679
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,266
In God's name.

680
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,531
So that fool is here?

681
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,434
It was good seeing you.
God be with you.

682
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,709
My house is close by.

683
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,079
- Come with me, Father.
- Sorry.

684
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,447
I must beg for a blanket and food.

685
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,416
- Some other day.
- We will give it to you.

686
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,785
My sister has her husband's clothes.

687
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:03,087
Help us, Father.

688
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,520
Help us.

689
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,774
My niece is terribly ill.

690
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,725
Ándara says over and over...

691
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,662
"If blessed Father Nazario
were here, he would cure her."

692
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,531
To the point where my sister...

693
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,232
...wanted to go look for you.

694
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,563
You believe that crazy woman?

695
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,505
Please, Father.

696
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,768
My sister is suffering.

697
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,274
Please come and comfort her.

698
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:27,772
All right.

699
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,414
I cannot refuse
saying some words of comfort...

700
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,407
...and praying to God for her.

701
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,514
Not a word about anything else.

702
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,159
Josesa.

703
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,771
Here comes Father Nazario.

704
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,438
Father Nazario.

705
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,940
Our Lady of Guadalupe.

706
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,309
I don't want him to see me.

707
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,401
Well.

708
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,242
Put that on the girl.

709
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,827
God called you to
this house, Father.

710
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,991
- I know you're a saint.
- Don't say that.

711
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,033
So, how is your daughter?

712
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,567
She's slipping away, Father.

713
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,538
If you don't do something,
she won't see tomorrow.

714
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:30,274
Only God and science
can help her.

715
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,208
Come Father, sit down.

716
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,676
What ails the girl?

717
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,574
High fevers are devouring her.

718
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,616
The day she fell ill...

719
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,965
...I felt something bad approaching...

720
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:44,313
...because an owl chirped all night.

721
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,312
And when I went out...

722
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,287
...three dogs howled.

723
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,093
One after the other.

724
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,795
- Has a doctor seen her?
- Yes, Father.

725
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,194
He sent her this.

726
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,887
She's already taken two bottles.

727
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,262
They gave her a cleansing,
but it didn't work.

728
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,629
Oh, Father.

729
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,304
I have prayed so.

730
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,573
Follow the doctor's orders.

731
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,270
You must have resignation
and trust in God.

732
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,208
Only a miracle can save her.

733
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,316
God began by bringing
you to this town.

734
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,683
You arrived barefoot...

735
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,118
...just like our Lord Jesus Christ.

736
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,888
Save my daughter, Father, save her.

737
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,226
If I didn't see the pain
impairing you...

738
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:23,853
...I would leave right now.

739
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,980
How can I do that
which science cannot?

740
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:29,366
I know that you can perform miracles.

741
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,433
You can.

742
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,902
Yes, it's obvious
that you're a saint.

743
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,973
Say the Consecration
prayer, and she shall heal.

744
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,073
Do it, Father.

745
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,076
What this poor mother has to say.

746
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:40,109
A miracle.

747
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,340
- Perform a miracle.
- Blasphemy, ignorant.

748
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,646
A miracle, me?

749
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,115
Yes, sir. A miracle.

750
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,665
If you refuse, it'll only...

751
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,580
...be because you don't want to.

752
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,814
It had to be you, you fool.

753
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,059
Who do you take me for?

754
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,759
Am I an impostor?

755
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,728
Do I try to deceive people?

756
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,499
Don't mention miracles,
don't tease me.

757
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,334
Have compassion on me.

758
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:05,568
Help my sister.

759
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,005
- Doesn't it pain you to see her?
- Quiet.

760
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:09,666
I am not a healer.

761
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,171
If God chooses to take her,
it is best for her soul.

762
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,244
That is manifested by pain.

763
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,480
I can only pray with you.

764
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,250
Where is she?

765
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,650
Over here, Father.

766
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,801
Lord, restore this
innocent soul's health.

767
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,973
I offer you in turn
my health and my life...

768
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,010
...and I humbly accept all
obstacles and calamities...

769
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,115
...all diseases and pain...

770
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,353
...that may afflict a man.

771
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,053
Help us, our Lord of Chalma.

772
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:08,131
Aid us, Lord, aid us.

773
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,466
Go away, devil, respect this house.

774
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,935
Out with you Satan,
there is nothing for you here.

775
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,903
Help us on the Holy Cross,
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

776
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:19,042
Do not forsake us, protect us.

777
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,612
Do not leave us.

778
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:22,879
Help us.

779
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,649
On Heaven as it is on Earth...

780
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,344
Free us.

781
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,216
Holy, Holy, Holy.

782
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,295
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

783
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,328
Thy kingdom come.

784
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,166
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in Heaven.

785
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,900
Give us this day our daily bread.

786
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,369
Forgive our trespasses
as we forgive...

787
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,870
...those who trespass against us.

788
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:48,531
Lead us not into temptation.

789
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,207
Deliver us from evil. Amen.

790
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,844
Our Father who are in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

791
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:55,144
Thy kingdom come.

792
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,015
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in Heaven.

793
00:46:58,016 --> 00:46:59,482
Give us our daily bread...

794
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,274
Father Nazario...

795
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,346
...the girl is well.

796
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,781
At dawn she was dying...

797
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,286
...and suddenly she
asked me for food.

798
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,983
I touched her forehead,
it was no longer burning.

799
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:42,892
Don't go, Father.

800
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,544
The news has spread.

801
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:45,836
They want to touch her.

802
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:47,128
All right, all right.

803
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,660
You don't need to talk
nonsense.

804
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,070
Get up woman,
stop thinking tall tales.

805
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,001
I said you wouldn't convince him.

806
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,812
It's a miracle. A miracle.

807
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:05,879
I'm leaving, you're insane.

808
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,650
Devote your prayers...

809
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,017
...to giving thanks for
the grace you were granted...

810
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,118
...and to God.

811
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,280
Where are you going?

812
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,283
Wherever you go, Father...

813
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,187
...we will follow...

814
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,791
...because we want
to be pilgrims, too.

815
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,419
And as good and saintly as you.

816
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,295
I admire your intention...

817
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:55,754
...but do me a favor
and be saintly on your own.

818
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,000
Do you think I'm mad enough
to take you along?

819
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,106
Just look...

820
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,904
...at what was upon me.

821
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,757
It must have broken a leg.

822
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,776
That damned beast.

823
00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:24,794
Patience, Colonel.

824
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,332
I told you not to use this one.

825
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,232
That's all we needed.

826
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,100
But these animals think
they're smarter than us.

827
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,171
It chose a hell of a time
to get a cramp.

828
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,008
Good morning, gentlemen.

829
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,648
May I help you?

830
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:45,514
Go ahead.

831
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,813
Take the head,
I'll take this side.

832
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,597
Hey you, donkey.

833
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,840
What's wrong with you?

834
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,043
Don't you know a colonel
and especially a priest...

835
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:15,705
...should always be greeted?

836
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,347
You won't believe it, boss.

837
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,051
I was figuring out
how much I sold...

838
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,780
...and I wasn't looking.

839
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,419
Well, so you learn to look...

840
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,352
...walk by again and greet us.

841
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,758
Let's go!

842
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,639
- Good morning, boss.
- Good morning.

843
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:57,783
Sir...

844
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,989
...you may think of me as you please...

845
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,192
...but I believe that such treatment...

846
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:04,490
...is anti-Christian and rude.

847
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,593
This is a man, not an animal.

848
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,632
A son of God, as much as you.

849
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,069
And he has his dignity
in spite of any...

850
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,037
...past, present or future despot.

851
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,805
After relieving my conscience so...

852
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:19,802
...I will go.

853
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,609
What kind of scoundrel is that?

854
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,107
Forget it, Colonel.

855
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,649
He's a heretic.

856
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:32,155
One of those eccentric preachers...

857
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,316
...they send from the north.

858
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,625
Forget him and arrange the horse.

859
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:40,992
We've been here over an hour.

860
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,013
Why are you following me?

861
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,056
The road belongs to everybody.

862
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,193
We want to do penance
and learn good things from you.

863
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,262
I said, if you want to do penance...

864
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,820
...to do it on your own.

865
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,827
Each to his own conscience.

866
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,363
Each to his own solitude.

867
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,069
We will not get in the way.

868
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,832
Well!

869
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,571
We truly are fond of him...

870
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,164
...and he pays us in this manner.

871
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,409
If you abandon us who
knows what will happen.

872
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,069
All right.

873
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,144
Come along.

874
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,908
But you must promise
to act decently.

875
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,413
To be obedient...

876
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,614
...and leave me alone.

877
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,063
I believe in God the
Father Almighty.

878
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,103
Creator of Heaven and Earth.

879
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:54,837
Means that I believe...

880
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,207
...without a doubt,
in the Lord our Father...

881
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,801
...the first person
of the Holy Trinity.

882
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:00,838
Who...

883
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,779
...through His virtue of
omnipotence...

884
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,014
...created from nothing.

885
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:04,912
That is...

886
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,315
...where there was nothing...

887
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,114
...the Earth and everything in it.

888
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,320
Is God everywhere?

889
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:13,688
Yes, everywhere.

890
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,659
Is He here, too?

891
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,216
Yes.

892
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,565
Then, eating this is
like Communion, isn't it?

893
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:22,554
No, child.

894
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,466
When the priest consecrates...

895
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,992
...the Lord descends into the bread.

896
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,005
Just as you would.

897
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:29,733
Father...

898
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,533
...if I take Communion,
will the demons get out?

899
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,244
What demons would those be?

900
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,243
The ones she has inside.

901
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,048
The poor thing is full of them.

902
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,916
My sister says I have
heart spasms.

903
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,484
That's a curse.

904
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,338
Somebody who wishes you evil.

905
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:47,098
How many times must I tell you...

906
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,740
...that those are only superstitions?

907
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:50,382
When I felt short of breath, I felt...

908
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,893
...a ball of fire in my stomach.

909
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,394
And I felt like killing.

910
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,561
That's not witchcraft or demons.

911
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,693
It's a well known illness.

912
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,562
It stems from imagination.

913
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,564
And the cure comes
from imagination.

914
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:06,742
Plus...

915
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,041
...a healthy life...

916
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,178
...and exercise.

917
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,012
Reject sorrow.

918
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:12,845
Pray.

919
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,410
You'll get over it.

920
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,077
I think they are demons.

921
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,696
What's wrong?

922
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:37,741
Why are you fleeing?

923
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:39,265
Listen.

924
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:42,444
Why are you fleeing?

925
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,111
Why?

926
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,209
What are you doing, Father?

927
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,044
Beatriz.

928
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:52,819
Ándara, come here.

929
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,451
Don't touch him.

930
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,392
Don't touch him, Mr. Nazario,
it's the plague.

931
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,118
Everybody is leaving town,
it is infected.

932
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,594
Let's go back.

933
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,128
Run, Father.

934
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,814
Please.

935
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:02,357
Could you show us to
town hall, sir?

936
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,093
I am the municipal authority.

937
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,090
And I order you to go away.

938
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,366
We cannot support beggars.

939
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,368
We haven't come to beg, sir.

940
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,403
We just want to help.

941
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,895
Caring for the sick,
burying the dead.

942
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,340
Cleaning.

943
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,043
In that case, you can stay.

944
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,011
We need a lot of help.

945
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,912
Where shall we begin?

946
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,248
Go to any house.

947
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,405
You'll be needed.

948
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:04,820
Help me.

949
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,652
Ándara, open that window.

950
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,418
Did you hear me?

951
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,964
Beatriz, come here.

952
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:20,894
Here.

953
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,904
Take the child.

954
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:27,309
Ándara...

955
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,808
Go look for milk.

956
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:30,306
- Where?
- Anywhere.

957
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:15,749
Juan...

958
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,328
What about the government support?

959
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,428
Is it coming or not?

960
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,997
I saw them from the hill.

961
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,021
It was about time.

962
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,398
Where's Lucía?

963
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,784
Somebody's caring for her.

964
00:58:24,785 --> 00:58:26,169
Hey, how many are coming?

965
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,727
Wait, Juan!

966
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,967
...sed pro tua pietate
prosit mihi ad...

967
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,977
...tutamentum mentis et corporis,
et ad medelam percipiendam:

968
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:38,714
Qui vivis et regnas Deus, per omnia
saecula saeculorum. Amen.

969
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:46,556
Think that this life...

970
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:47,989
...is only a road.

971
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,189
Withstand your pain...

972
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,729
...and prepare your soul
for the joy...

973
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,697
...of being in God's presence.

974
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,056
Not Heaven.

975
00:58:58,234 --> 00:58:58,859
Juan.

976
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,597
Leave the passions
of this world behind, child.

977
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,906
The Lord has given you time...

978
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,641
...to examine your conscience.

979
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:07,943
Think of Heaven that awaits you.

980
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,545
Not Heaven.

981
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,808
As a priest I tell you...

982
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,147
...that you can save
yourself if you repent.

983
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,351
Juan.

984
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,607
We've come to help.

985
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,345
Lucía.

986
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,212
Lucía, it's me.

987
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,913
I am here again.

988
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:53,921
I won't leave anymore.

989
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,424
Help is here,
they will cure you.

990
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,184
Soon you will be fine.

991
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,123
You can go now.

992
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,229
- You are no longer needed.
- I'm a priest.

993
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,234
I beg you to let me help
you through these times.

994
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:08,899
Juan.

995
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,871
Tell them to go away.

996
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,856
Didn't you hear?

997
01:00:14,857 --> 01:00:16,169
They must go!

998
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,270
I have failed, child.

999
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,708
May the Lord have
pity on the soul.

1000
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,515
I wanted that, too.

1001
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,077
There is nothing
for us to do here.

1002
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,492
Look at what a delicious avocado.

1003
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:10,994
The legs are short.

1004
01:02:10,995 --> 01:02:12,629
Let's break the pinata.

1005
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,447
Lower it, I can't reach.

1006
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:16,264
Now take it, you thieves.

1007
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,426
Whoever touches it will be sorry.

1008
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,431
Mr. Sabás.

1009
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,438
They want to rob and kill me.

1010
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:23,996
Mr. Sabás.

1011
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,336
Don't let them, Ujo.

1012
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,978
Don't let them.

1013
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:34,449
Thank you.

1014
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,213
Thank you, Mr. Sabás.

1015
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,384
Charitable souls...

1016
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,725
Won't you give me something?

1017
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,066
What a stingy old woman.

1018
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,601
She won't give a glass of water.

1019
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,264
I'll mark the best
doors for you, Ándara.

1020
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,807
But I don't want to
trouble you, shorty.

1021
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:59,541
No trouble.

1022
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,510
I am fond of you, Ándara.

1023
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,236
This is...

1024
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,614
- What did you bring?
- Lots of stuff.

1025
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,810
I have more at home.
Do you want to go over?

1026
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,120
Let's sit in the street
to avoid gossip.

1027
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,088
Would you like me to carry you?

1028
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,324
You're ugly.

1029
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,555
Ugly, but I'm fond of you, Ándara.

1030
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,464
Since I saw you at the
church yesterday.

1031
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,962
Nobody loves...

1032
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:24,460
...that ugly woman.

1033
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,228
She must be for me.

1034
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:27,427
So, if you...

1035
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,739
? Do you think you're pretty?

1036
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,832
A legless tadpole.

1037
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,538
That's what you are.

1038
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,946
Say what you will, I am fond
of you and want to help.

1039
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:39,471
Sit down, we have to talk.

1040
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,949
Good morning.

1041
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,620
I'm going to wash these clothes.

1042
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,112
Wait here, we will go
up the hill together.

1043
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,329
She sure is good-looking.

1044
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,499
She hasn't worked the streets.

1045
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,551
Hey, you repugnant shorty.

1046
01:03:58,552 --> 01:04:00,602
Relax, no insult intended.

1047
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,367
I don't care if you're public,
I want you at my side.

1048
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,435
But listen.

1049
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,108
You should beat it,
get out of town.

1050
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,375
What, Ujo?

1051
01:04:08,376 --> 01:04:09,374
Pinto...

1052
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,743
Mr. Sabas' cousin,
is spreading stuff about you.

1053
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,744
Pinto is here?

1054
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,544
He came to buy some horses.

1055
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,854
He said the feds are after you,
you're criminals.

1056
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,325
I tell you he's seven years old.

1057
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,370
I don't want him, he's eight.

1058
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,496
No he's not.

1059
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,039
I'm not deceiving you, Pinto.

1060
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,240
I saw when he was born.

1061
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:40,243
He's gentle, does no tricks.

1062
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:41,904
Try him out.

1063
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,248
I knew you were around here.

1064
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,514
Garbage.

1065
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,714
A priest's lover, no doubt.

1066
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,409
You brag about being
a pilgrim apostle.

1067
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,929
But I know you,
I know what you are.

1068
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,897
You big hussy.

1069
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,827
Wait.

1070
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,971
Even if it's just courtesy,
listen to me.

1071
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,266
Had you forgotten me?

1072
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,313
I hadn't forgotten you, either.

1073
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:54,212
Although you're not worth it.

1074
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,978
I saw you with
that sanctimonious bum.

1075
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,955
I want you to leave him.

1076
01:05:58,956 --> 01:05:59,887
You hear?

1077
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,892
He's good, I will not leave him.

1078
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:03,925
Now you know.

1079
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,417
Remember I have a bad temper.

1080
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,965
Tomorrow at eleven
I'm leaving for your town.

1081
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,557
From there, to the capital.

1082
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,561
You're coming with me.

1083
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,562
I'm thirsty.

1084
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,699
Give me some water.

1085
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:28,875
Now, come.

1086
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,816
Come where we can talk.

1087
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:42,193
Leave me alone Pinto,
for the love of God.

1088
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,060
If it's an order I'll go,
but I don't want to.

1089
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,098
I want to be good.

1090
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:48,930
Let me be good, Pinto.

1091
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:52,575
Stop Pinto, I won't go.

1092
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:53,473
I won't.

1093
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,176
All right, woman.

1094
01:06:57,177 --> 01:06:58,541
Tomorrow, then.

1095
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,081
I'll wait for you
at the town exit.

1096
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,951
You're advised.

1097
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,920
Don't fail me, or else...

1098
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,916
Oh, get out.

1099
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,920
Get out!

1100
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,804
Because night carries
yesterday's sorrow...

1101
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:24,864
...and the hope and joy
of a new day.

1102
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,672
That's what death is like.

1103
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,667
Joyous and sorrowful.

1104
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,348
Joyous because it frees
us of life's chains.

1105
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:33,581
And sorrowful...

1106
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,613
...because we love our flesh...

1107
01:07:35,614 --> 01:07:37,645
...and it hurts us to leave it.

1108
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,484
What's wrong, Beatriz?

1109
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,535
You had a bad encounter.

1110
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:54,025
Didn't you, child?

1111
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,065
Did you see us, Father?

1112
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,275
Then, how can you guess?

1113
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,034
That's not guessing.

1114
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,268
It's knowing.

1115
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,050
You are always the most pious.

1116
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,758
Today you were distracted
at prayer.

1117
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,248
Distant.

1118
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,652
The squalls of passion
are difficult to hide.

1119
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,031
I know you're struggling
against Satan.

1120
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,798
When he looks at me, I obey.

1121
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,240
I was about to go with him.

1122
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,135
And I don't want to, Father.

1123
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,079
Can you explain that?

1124
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,771
It's a bad passion, child.

1125
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,610
Mortal flesh avoids domination.

1126
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,287
What can I do to kill
that weed, Father?

1127
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,049
Love.

1128
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,851
And not only one thing...

1129
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:49,280
...or one single human being.

1130
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,289
But all of God's creation.

1131
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,826
Is that how you love, Father?

1132
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,198
Is that how you love Ándara...

1133
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,132
...and I?

1134
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,600
Yes, like that.

1135
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:00,869
God knows...

1136
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,633
...how can we flee, Father?

1137
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,539
Climbing down the hill...

1138
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,474
...nobody will see or hear us.

1139
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:08,810
Flee?

1140
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,645
Thieves flee.

1141
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,638
Not those who give
everything to people in need.

1142
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,182
I know that due to our
humble condition...

1143
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,253
...human justice will
not care for us.

1144
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,318
But the Divine...

1145
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,220
...will not forsake us.

1146
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:43,810
A while ago I got a
bad feeling in my head.

1147
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,408
A premonition?

1148
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,147
Oh, Father.

1149
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:52,384
I think we're going
to have hard times.

1150
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,289
I think so, too.

1151
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,281
We will suffer much.

1152
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,990
When that happens, I only
hope I am at your side.

1153
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,126
If I can carry your load
on my back...

1154
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,993
...I certainly would, because...

1155
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,000
...that's how much I trust you.

1156
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,998
I am fond of you, too.

1157
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,576
If you should get lost like sheep...

1158
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:14,770
...I would search for you.

1159
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,312
Promise me whatever happens...

1160
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,076
...you won't make me leave your side.

1161
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,582
I am very tired, Father.

1162
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,665
What is it, Ándara?

1163
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,730
What's wrong?

1164
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,365
Come here.

1165
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:48,340
Come.

1166
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:55,806
Sit down.

1167
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,945
Tell me what it is.

1168
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,124
She has her pride...

1169
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,694
...and doesn't like a
"nobody" offending her.

1170
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:06,991
And you...

1171
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:08,678
You love Beatriz more.

1172
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:10,228
And it isn't fair.

1173
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:11,467
I love you two the same.

1174
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:13,067
No, sir.

1175
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,504
You say nice things
to Beatriz...

1176
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:16,493
...and to me...

1177
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,663
...since I am such a dunce...

1178
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,975
You just call me a fool.

1179
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,044
Don't say that, child.

1180
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,702
I love you both the same.

1181
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:28,208
And stop thinking those things.

1182
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,003
- Ándara.
- Ujo, a tamale.

1183
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,539
Your body fell off today.

1184
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,648
You've only brought your head.

1185
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,287
I came to tell you
that I am going with you.

1186
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:06,622
Because I care for you.

1187
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:07,955
Because you have robbed...

1188
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,754
...my heart and put it
in my mouth, honey pie.

1189
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:11,859
Beatriz...

1190
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,345
...Ujo is coming with us.

1191
01:12:13,346 --> 01:12:15,288
He says he cares for me.

1192
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,230
Love is the prettiest thing.

1193
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,358
Do you truly love her, Ujo?

1194
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,766
Yes, I do.

1195
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,762
You, ugly.

1196
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,399
You, public.

1197
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,042
I had never cared for anyone.

1198
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,140
But as soon as I saw you...

1199
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,003
What a love.

1200
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:32,714
See?

1201
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,273
He is my sweetheart.

1202
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,242
There they are.

1203
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,428
We caught them together.

1204
01:13:04,429 --> 01:13:06,212
Ujo, you'll lose your girl.

1205
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,849
Who are you looking for?

1206
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,484
You, a hussy and a renegade.

1207
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,989
Stop teaching bad habits.

1208
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,525
If you've come to arrest us...

1209
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:18,117
...we will not resist.

1210
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,812
No need for such an upheaval...

1211
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,697
...to catch 3 harmless people.

1212
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,233
It's against you, and a certain...

1213
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,395
...Ana de Ara, I have a
warrant for your arrest.

1214
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:32,337
Let's go.

1215
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,015
One woman is not enough.

1216
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:41,107
Now you have two.

1217
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,651
We are Christian.

1218
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:43,675
Bully.

1219
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,920
Coward, you wretch.

1220
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,589
Don't you see he has no defense?

1221
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,456
Grab her.

1222
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:49,858
Here, make more fire.

1223
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:50,940
Stronger.

1224
01:13:50,941 --> 01:13:52,021
Beat him.

1225
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:53,995
Let me go.

1226
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,164
You've beaten my sweetheart.

1227
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:55,897
Sure.

1228
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:58,765
- Did they hurt you, Father?
- It doesn't matter.

1229
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:01,003
Let me go, stop it.

1230
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:01,936
Ándara.

1231
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,336
I said let go.

1232
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,268
You see.

1233
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:05,039
You see.

1234
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,607
Because you didn't obey me.

1235
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,576
Get out of here, you dirty frog.

1236
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,308
Calm down, Ándara.

1237
01:14:11,309 --> 01:14:12,438
You have done wrong.

1238
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,209
Apologize to your victim
for God's forgiveness.

1239
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,755
Scumbag, sorry, damn it.

1240
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:21,188
Come on, let's go.

1241
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,058
Stay here, Beatriz.

1242
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,055
They only want us.

1243
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:47,006
Careful.

1244
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,350
Sergeant.

1245
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,285
Don't you remember me?

1246
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,287
Yes.

1247
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:54,622
From your village.

1248
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:55,988
What will they do to us?

1249
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,339
Soon, in a moment, a rope
of prisoners...

1250
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,554
...will parade down
your own village.

1251
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:03,098
- You'd better go alone.
- Sergeant.

1252
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:05,099
Let Father Nazario escape.

1253
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,801
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1254
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,396
He's done nothing,
I swear he's a saint.

1255
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,601
Ándara.

1256
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,979
Ujo.

1257
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,143
You behaved very poorly.

1258
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,146
You sure kicked me there.

1259
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,484
But, in spite of your cruelty...

1260
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,120
...I care for you.
That's why I'm here.

1261
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:27,088
I kicked you?

1262
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,616
Forgive me, shorty,
I care for you too.

1263
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,495
I got carried away
and didn't see what I was doing.

1264
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:35,597
When you hit the
man with the pole...

1265
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:38,165
I couldn't believe it was you.

1266
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,930
You were spitting fire,
but you looked pretty to me.

1267
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,970
You are so ugly...

1268
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,939
...but you looked pretty.

1269
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,943
Look, my little snail.

1270
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:49,745
Get down, midget.

1271
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:51,812
Let me go, let me go.

1272
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,879
Let me go, let me go.

1273
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,790
Get some rest.

1274
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,438
Here, for the girls.

1275
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:17,735
What about me?

1276
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,737
There is nothing for the men.

1277
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,608
Listen, Corporal.

1278
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:25,745
Untie our hands for a while.

1279
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,584
Let's see, give us some
water, we're dry.

1280
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:30,108
Do you have a cigarette?

1281
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,286
A cigarette, please.

1282
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:33,822
Let me have one, come on...

1283
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,122
Whoever catches it first.

1284
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,489
Quiet, there's enough for all.

1285
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:40,691
Here.

1286
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,392
- Stay still.
- Water.

1287
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,930
Water.

1288
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,980
You have it in there.

1289
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:23,654
You dunce, now do you see why...

1290
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:25,406
...I told you to come with me?

1291
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,669
Don't make that face.

1292
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,444
I have a horse outside.

1293
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:30,911
Hurry, we're leaving.

1294
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,039
- Where to?
- Wherever I decide.

1295
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,446
Be grateful I even
searched for you.

1296
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,474
What are you waiting for?

1297
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:41,618
Where are you going?

1298
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,426
I'm not going with you,
I'm staying.

1299
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,826
Listen, don't try my patience.

1300
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,963
I won't leave him, kill me.

1301
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,088
If he's insulted, so am I.

1302
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:53,200
If he's hungry, so am I.

1303
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:56,065
If they hurt him,
I hope I get beat, too.

1304
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,305
If I can't be in jail with him...

1305
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,831
...I'll wait at the gate
until that saint gets out.

1306
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,874
I'm going to kick that
devotion out of you.

1307
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,714
I will be in your town tonight.

1308
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:07,147
I'll talk to your mother.

1309
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:10,010
If she can't talk you
into going with me...

1310
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,652
You will be sorry.

1311
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,026
Well, let's go.

1312
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:25,897
All right.

1313
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:27,394
See you there.

1314
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,421
She is stubborn.

1315
01:18:29,422 --> 01:18:31,039
Leave her to me.

1316
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,049
Everybody ready?

1317
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,984
Come on, what's the hurry?

1318
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:45,887
Stop complaining, it's useless.

1319
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,723
Shut your mouth.

1320
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:48,519
Ándara.

1321
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,183
I thought you didn't
want to say good-bye.

1322
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,190
Hurray for the couple.

1323
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,592
What are you laughing at?

1324
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:59,099
You are making do with
so little, doll.

1325
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:00,968
Go ahead, laugh.

1326
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,493
I care for you, Ándara.

1327
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:10,394
Forward.

1328
01:19:10,395 --> 01:19:11,310
March.

1329
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,175
Come on, out.

1330
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:17,776
Good-bye, Ujo.

1331
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:26,319
Good-bye.

1332
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,092
Good-bye, Ujo.

1333
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:34,295
Good-bye, shorty.

1334
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:01,252
Sergeant.

1335
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,234
Somebody take this girl.

1336
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,236
Let's see, the priest.

1337
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,783
Go on.

1338
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,781
Let's go!

1339
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,049
Why are you taking her so?

1340
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,057
The old man is her grandfather.

1341
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,493
The sergeant says he kidnapped her.

1342
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,533
They are going to drop her off.

1343
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:39,431
Hey.

1344
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:44,365
If you're a priest, hear their
confession so we know their sins.

1345
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,665
Hear your mother's confession!

1346
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:49,468
Sergeant.

1347
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:52,172
This woman is disrespecting me!

1348
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,886
Hand me the newest one,
naughty priest.

1349
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:07,595
Sergeant.

1350
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:11,123
Aren't you sick to see
him treated that way?

1351
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,405
Hand some over, you're tired.

1352
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,897
Come on, man.
Give us a little taste.

1353
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:25,212
Save some for the poor.

1354
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,015
That's enough rudeness.

1355
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,782
You will be quiet.

1356
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:36,948
Get up.

1357
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,526
Forward... march.

1358
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,332
We'll meet later.

1359
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,995
What will you get
for being so stingy?

1360
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:03,032
Go on inside.

1361
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:04,249
Women over here.

1362
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,460
Don't cry, mother.

1363
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:22,537
How? You're a prisoner.

1364
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:24,172
I am not a prisoner.

1365
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:25,806
I chose to be here.

1366
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,866
They have nothing against me.

1367
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,144
What about the shame of...

1368
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,443
...seeing you parade
with criminals?

1369
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,741
We were always honest people.

1370
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,416
Death is better
than seeing this.

1371
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,950
Humiliation is good
for the soul.

1372
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:41,922
What are you talking about?

1373
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,619
That is what the priest says.

1374
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,094
Forgive me, honey...

1375
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,723
...but a priest who
travels with women...

1376
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,798
...is no saint.

1377
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,798
Well, yes he is.

1378
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:55,934
You should have seen him.

1379
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,806
He cured the girl
just by touching her.

1380
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:03,044
And those who had the plague.

1381
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:05,604
He lead them to Heaven.

1382
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,842
How else could it be?

1383
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,649
His angelical voice
dives into your bones.

1384
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:15,613
If he touches your clothes...

1385
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,051
...you start shaking
as if you wanted to die...

1386
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,757
...and go to Heaven
to be with him forever.

1387
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,068
Oh, darling.

1388
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:31,033
You love that man.

1389
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,540
You love him like a man.

1390
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,009
Liar!

1391
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,278
It's a lie!

1392
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:51,984
- Oh, no.
- Pinto!

1393
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,962
Take her away, she's ill.

1394
01:23:53,963 --> 01:23:55,847
I'm dying.

1395
01:23:55,848 --> 01:23:58,274
No, don't see.

1396
01:23:58,275 --> 01:24:00,701
Lie, it's a lie.

1397
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,108
You are worse than a dog.

1398
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:12,180
Oh, I am so ashamed
I could die.

1399
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:14,410
I'm dying.

1400
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:16,183
Don't believe it, Father.

1401
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:19,354
It isn't true,
don't believe it.

1402
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:20,981
Don't believe it.

1403
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,338
I said we'd meet later.

1404
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,825
Come, I'll teach you
another rosary.

1405
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:43,311
Punch his mouth so
he preaches better.

1406
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:44,896
Hey you, what's worse?

1407
01:24:44,897 --> 01:24:46,934
Being a whore or a madame?

1408
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:48,972
He can say what he pleases.

1409
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,752
And he will say it here.

1410
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,905
Father, give some Holy Bread.

1411
01:24:53,906 --> 01:24:56,057
Go on, give your Communion.

1412
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:57,490
You scoundrels.

1413
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:58,952
You're blind.

1414
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,395
Insult me, not the
sanctity of mass.

1415
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,026
Cowards.

1416
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,330
Abuse your strength, but don't
offend the majesty...

1417
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:08,570
...of the Lord, your creator.

1418
01:25:08,571 --> 01:25:10,629
We'll se who's a coward.

1419
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:11,567
You wimp.

1420
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:13,832
Go on, give him his communion.

1421
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:20,436
I thought the priest could
fight, but he's chicken.

1422
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,421
For the first time in my life...

1423
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:32,592
...it's hard for me to forgive.

1424
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:38,823
And I forgive you,
it is my Christian duty.

1425
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:41,398
I forgive you.

1426
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,800
But I also scorn you.

1427
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,776
And I feel guilty about
not knowing how...

1428
01:25:48,777 --> 01:25:50,141
...to separate scorn...

1429
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:52,072
...from forgiveness.

1430
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,441
Keep your forgiveness.

1431
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,746
Now, a little stroll.

1432
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:07,451
He'll need bandages
for Sunday mass.

1433
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:14,902
Stop.

1434
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:16,237
He's not defending himself.

1435
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:17,471
Who asked you?

1436
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:20,236
It's not manly to
beat someone that way.

1437
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,434
What, did you get cold feet?

1438
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:28,382
Who didn't like it?

1439
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,050
Let's stop here.

1440
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:46,899
Thank you.

1441
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:49,494
Thank you.

1442
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,300
You are good.

1443
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,306
Me, good?

1444
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:56,971
No, I'm quite the opposite.

1445
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,510
Have you committed many crimes?

1446
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,018
I don't know.

1447
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,492
Only two.

1448
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,988
And burglarized many churches.

1449
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,065
Don't you felt pain sometimes...

1450
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,063
...about what you did?

1451
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,966
When I'm alone.

1452
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,538
But then my friends come, and...

1453
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,075
Do you have any relatives?

1454
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:33,405
I might as well not.

1455
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,712
My mother is in jail.

1456
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:37,717
Go with God.

1457
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:41,649
Would you like to be good?

1458
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,147
Yes...

1459
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:45,583
...but how?

1460
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,422
All you have to do is say:

1461
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:49,826
"I want to be good".

1462
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:53,699
And be truly determined
to be good.

1463
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,167
You'd like to change your life.

1464
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:02,699
Would you like to change yours?

1465
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:04,971
How?

1466
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:09,611
Look, all...

1467
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,943
All I do are bad deeds.

1468
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:14,346
And...

1469
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:17,354
...what good is your life?

1470
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,356
You, on the good side,
and me on the bad side.

1471
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:24,724
Neither of us are
much good at all.

1472
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:31,137
Do you have any money?

1473
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:34,604
I'll keep it for myself.

1474
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:36,966
You don't need it.

1475
01:28:57,799 --> 01:28:59,164
Attention.

1476
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,058
Get your things, we're
leaving in five minutes.

1477
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:05,933
Line up outside.

1478
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:09,802
Sergeant.

1479
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,379
Where is Father Nazario?

1480
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,375
Isn't he coming with us?

1481
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,013
Where is he?

1482
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:26,019
The Bishop, made an agreement
with civil authorities.

1483
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:28,024
You will not be on the rope.

1484
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,113
You'll be taken separately.

1485
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,998
Alone, by a man out of uniform.

1486
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,717
That was all they could do.

1487
01:29:34,718 --> 01:29:36,835
No doubt it will spare shame.

1488
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,966
Don't you want to know
the status of your case?

1489
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,604
At least you'll admit
to your recklessness.

1490
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,611
All your madness.

1491
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:52,086
No wonder they say you
are unresigned.

1492
01:29:52,087 --> 01:29:54,054
A rebel spirit.

1493
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:58,719
It will be difficult
to adjust to reality.

1494
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:04,265
To make you see that your habits
contradict those of priests.

1495
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:06,214
Your ways confront the Church...

1496
01:30:06,215 --> 01:30:08,163
...which you claim
to love and obey

1497
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:14,068
Do you need anything?

1498
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,282
Father!

1499
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:32,356
Father.

1500
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:34,859
What did they do to you?

1501
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,190
Who hurt you?

1502
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:40,066
Where are you taking him?

1503
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:41,927
Good-bye, child.

1504
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:43,804
Sergeant.

1505
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,339
I want to go where he goes.

1506
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,203
Take them away.

1507
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:47,808
- Let's go.
- Father!

1508
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,211
No, let me go with him. Father.

1509
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:52,613
Don't leave me alone, Father.

1510
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:54,375
Father.

1511
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:40,326
That fat frog-eyes
was the one who beat him.

1512
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:43,528
And skinny bones
defended him.

1513
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:51,402
May God bless you
and grant you all graces.

1514
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:55,265
And to you, frog...

1515
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:58,212
...may your children rot
before they are born.

1516
01:31:58,213 --> 01:32:00,280
May your throat choke in pus...

1517
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:04,547
...and may you die
a long, painful death.

1518
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,133
Is he arrested?

1519
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:03,834
Give me another apple.

1520
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:10,250
Can I give you something?

1521
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:20,292
Take this charity,
and may God be with you.

1522
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:33,207
Take it.

1523
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:34,073
No.

1524
01:33:34,074 --> 01:33:34,939
No.

1525
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,552
May God repay you, ma'am.
