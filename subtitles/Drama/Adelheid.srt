1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,911
Based on a novel by Vladimír Körner.

2
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,154
What's the matter?

3
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,356
Sit still. Where are you going?

4
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,873
Where are we, Dad?

5
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,190
- Go and have a look!
- That's impossible.

6
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,872
Stop crying.

7
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,996
We're in the middle of nowhere.

8
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,150
The train goes no further.
You'll have to get off.

9
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,470
Have your identity cards ready.

10
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,869
- Am I to walk with the child?
- Quiet.

11
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,349
How are we going
to carry the luggage?

12
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,309
How stupid!

13
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,797
- Fero, help me.
- Get out of the way.

14
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,791
Damn you!

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,798
The Jerries will help you -
it isn't far to the village.

16
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,196
Show her the way!

17
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,515
- It takes a lot of courage...
- Marian, come on.

18
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,591
Are you alone?

19
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,275
Go and report to the National
Committee at the Mayor's.

20
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,273
You heard me. That goes for you too.
Report to the police officer, Hejna!

21
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,634
Why don't you get out of the way?

22
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,712
- Let's see your papers!
- Get a move on, old man...

23
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,795
Stop fooling around
and show us your papers.

24
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,193
Jindra, come here!

25
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,388
Look at that stupid face.

26
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,994
Must be a Jerry.
Look at his boots.

27
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,836
Gestapo-style.

28
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,151
Nonsense.

29
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,959
I know the style, they're Canadian.

30
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,871
Get up!

31
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,916
Get up, I said.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
Kindly leave me alone.

33
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,437
He can't be serious.

34
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,790
Did you hear that?

35
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,553
Let's take him outside.
Shall we?

36
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,235
- Don't touch me, I don't feel well.
- Start moving!

37
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,880
Stop fooling around, I told you...

38
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,076
I told you not to touch me.

39
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,594
You must be joking.

40
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,237
What's in that bag?

41
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,752
Watch out, he has a gun!

42
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,068
Bastard!

43
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,835
How do you feel?

44
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,992
All right. It's stopped bleeding...

45
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,794
Are you insisting
that these papers are yours?

46
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,278
Victor Chotovicky, Lieutenant...

47
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,996
"Member of the Czechoslovak Forces,
served in Great Britain with the RAF,

48
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,678
"is to take over the management
of Alfred Heinemann's property

49
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,910
"at Schwarzbach.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,434
"The above named officer
will make an inventory.

51
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,795
"He is under direct orders
of the Regional Committee at Olomouc

52
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,189
"and the Ministry of Defence."

53
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,359
May I?

54
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,352
Signed Vymazal, Squadron Leader...

55
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,113
To begin with,
not Schwarzbach but Cerny otok.

56
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,993
Papers like this are a dime a dozen.

57
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,396
I could have you locked up.

58
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,835
You don't happen to have
a glass of milk?

59
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,639
No, I never drink the stuff.

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,994
What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?

61
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,749
Nothing.
Really, nothing.

62
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,191
Will you have a drop of this?

63
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,397
That would kill me. I have ulcers.

64
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,075
You served in the RAF with ulcers?

65
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,271
I worked in the store.

66
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,312
Where?

67
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,431
In Aberdeen, Scotland.

68
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,435
And what's this for?

69
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,511
We all got it as a parting present.

70
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,276
We got nothing.

71
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,029
I've got to requisition this.

72
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,315
You don't have a permit...

73
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
And who issues such permits?

74
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,917
I do.

75
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,631
Is it American?

76
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,472
The cigarette, I mean.

77
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,080
English, it was part of my rations.

78
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,997
Hejna speaking.

79
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,794
Yes, Squadron Leader.
Yes, he's here.

80
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,592
Damned!

81
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,717
Yes, I hear.

82
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,316
I understand. You can trust me.

83
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,276
Yes. Goodbye.

84
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,716
Damn! The idiots!

85
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,675
That seems to be correct.

86
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,675
I am sorry.

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,991
I know Squadron Leader Vymazal.

88
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
- We met during the mobilisation.
- I see.

89
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,437
I am sorry. The boys will apologise.

90
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,077
I'd rather they didn't.

91
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,075
I hope you understand -

92
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,833
there are all sorts of trash
coming to settle here -

93
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,798
but I'll teach them
that we aren't in Texas!

94
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,791
This isn't Sorrento!

95
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,957
Isn't Sorrento in Italy?

96
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,600
Never mind. I won't have it.

97
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,910
This is going to be a village
like any other.

98
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,391
I understand.

99
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,630
Just a minute, Lieutenant.

100
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,990
Put this in your bag
and choose an M.G.

101
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,832
<i>Inspector!</i>

102
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,751
<i>Mr Hejna!</i>

103
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,718
<i>Franz Hallmeier set fire to his house!</i>

104
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,873
That's what we have to cope with
every day.

105
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,151
I'd like to...

106
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,675
<i>- Fire!
- Here you are!</i>

107
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,790
- Fire!
- Coming!

108
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,074
Take some ammunition too...

109
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,230
Where's the fire-brigade?

110
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,914
Sorry, Inspector,
we can't get to the water

111
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,276
because of Hallmeier's livestock.

112
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,397
- Where are Karel and Jindra?
- They are here.

113
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,393
But the herd is wild with fear.
They are waiting for you. Come on.

114
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,074
I am no bullfighter, stupid!

115
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,394
Stay here, just in case.

116
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,791
There's been too much of this.

117
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,758
I'm going to take hostages
the way they used to.

118
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,711
Where do I get the keys?

119
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,395
You fool! Even the gate is missing.

120
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,672
I'll send one of the boys along.

121
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,557
Don't.

122
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,037
I want to be alone.

123
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,953
If you want to be alone, Lieutenant,
take the M.G.

124
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,957
I won't.

125
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,516
And don't call me Lieutenant.

126
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,311
Mr Chotovicky,
why did you come here?

127
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:02,277
<i>One day Ulrich saw a monster
under a tree</i>

128
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,758
<i>20 heads, and a beautiful...</i>

129
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,189
This is the end of the road.

130
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,912
Sir!

131
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,473
Sir!

132
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,388
What are you doing there?

133
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,830
You mustn't go there!

134
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,631
What are you doing there?

135
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,358
I'm looking for Heinemann's house.

136
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,118
What?

137
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,108
Heinemann's house!

138
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,556
Get back to the road!

139
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,591
There are landmines everywhere!

140
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,432
You won't give up, Basler?

141
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,715
I'm going to report you!

142
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,795
Leave them alone,
they haven't noticed me.

143
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,710
Are you Czech?

144
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,272
Yes. We're the only Czechs here
who've lived with them during the war.

145
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,632
Where did you get this?

146
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,312
I am a victim of love.

147
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,198
- What?
- Never mind.

148
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,996
I know what they are capable of.

149
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,198
They even mined under the corpses
before they left.

150
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,395
We couldn't give them a decent burial.

151
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,118
Could you let me have some milk?

152
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,957
Why not?
We are getting a seventh cow.

153
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,833
Dad and I have to manage alone now.

154
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,710
Our Vilma has gone off to Opava.

155
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,715
We are going to get Germans
to help with the farm.

156
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,551
Vilma is my big sister.

157
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,752
- I have no mother.
- You have no mother?

158
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,273
No. She died.

159
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,238
Dad keeps complaining
and running off to the doctor.

160
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,830
Mother never said a word,
and then she died.

161
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,430
You are kind.

162
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,876
- How old are you?
- Only 15. What's this?

163
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,314
Chewing gum.

164
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,990
An American invention.

165
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,308
What about you, do you have a family?

166
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,868
Don't chew so hard, yourjaws will hurt.

167
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,074
No. I don't have one.

168
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,470
That's all right.
You don't have to worry.

169
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,391
What are you doing here?

170
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,072
Answer me!

171
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,188
Don't you understand Czech?

172
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,517
You're German.

173
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,558
A pass to be back in the camp at 4:00.

174
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,157
All right.

175
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,071
How did you get in?

176
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,639
I don't understand Czech.

177
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,592
Oh, I see...

178
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,668
Only one? Or are there more?

179
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,593
That's all.

180
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,832
- Two?
- Yes, only two.

181
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,877
My God!

182
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,990
What's the matter with you?

183
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,911
Sorry.

184
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,597
I just woke up.

185
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,433
Just now?
What have you been doing all night?

186
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,112
I slept.

187
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,237
I slept for 15 hours.

188
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,829
I'm still dazed.

189
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,913
Everything's rotten, Lieutenant.

190
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,836
Is your package in order?

191
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,313
Quite. You can keep the booze.

192
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,038
All I want is the fruitjuice.

193
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,148
Thanks. That's something special
and you don't want to be paid?

194
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,232
No.

195
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,713
I think we're going to get along.

196
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,950
I am sure we will.

197
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,757
Autumn is lovely up here.

198
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,515
Yes. That's what I need.

199
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,551
Peace and quiet, long walks.

200
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,189
To be cut off
from the rest of the world.

201
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,475
This isn't quite the rest of the world.

202
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,150
This isn't quite the right place.

203
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,151
Why isn't it?

204
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,834
You'll be enjoying your peace and quiet

205
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,798
till I find you
with your throat cut one day.

206
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,677
You can't be serious.

207
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,431
Do you find her to your satisfaction?

208
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,550
She knows what to cook.

209
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,509
Her dad had something wrong
with his liver.

210
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,638
He was on a diet too.

211
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,278
He'll hang all right.

212
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,392
Who?
Her dad, Heinemann?

213
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,916
I took him to Olomouc myself.

214
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,390
- What?
- The girl is his daughter.

215
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,357
Didn't you know?

216
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,074
The daughter of the great Fascist,
Heinemann.

217
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,238
You can have someone else
if you're afraid of her.

218
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,472
- Nonsense.
- This used to be a Jewish residence.

219
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,994
Heinemann took over
and played the baron.

220
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,358
I always say what you don't earn
with honest work isn't blessed.

221
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,754
I never requisitioned even a radio
and I was the first to get here.

222
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,034
The girl must take after her mother.

223
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,509
Her mother was a decent,
religious woman.

224
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,194
But I wouldn't trust anyone nowadays.
Come!

225
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,597
Come.

226
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,829
I'll show you something.

227
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,232
Nasty, isn't it?

228
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,675
This is what they called the stocks
in the Middle Ages.

229
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,630
Later they used it for the dogs.

230
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,474
Heinemann used it
for Polish prisoners in winter.

231
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,393
Well...

232
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,319
They say he beat people
to death right here.

233
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,756
Was she there?

234
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,231
Well, yes. God only knows
what she's witnessed.

235
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,790
We all get what's due to us.

236
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,111
The old man will hang
and his daughter scrubs floors.

237
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,119
That's what I call justice.

238
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,958
Could I keep her here, Inspector?

239
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,756
Keep what?

240
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,198
The girl, to live here. I am supposed
to eat every two hours.

241
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,354
Oh, all right, I understand.

242
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,593
Wait! Take your coat off,
you are going to stay here.

243
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,075
Don't argue, you're staying here.

244
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,919
- What is she saying?
- She doesn't want to stay.

245
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,316
She says
she'd rather stay in the camp.

246
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,755
She doesn't want to stay.

247
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,515
Pity, I've been treating her well.

248
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,476
You shouldn't.

249
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,029
Don't be too soft on her.

250
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,998
As long as her dad is at our mercy
she's going to be good, I bet.

251
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,796
I've made up my mind.

252
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,075
You are going to stay here!

253
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,429
Deal with her in your own way,
Lieutenant.

254
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,271
Just don't take it seriously.

255
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,191
Don't take it seriously.

256
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,754
I'll be back.

257
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,431
Why did you get up?

258
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,751
Sit down.

259
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,390
What's your name?

260
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,677
Adelheid.

261
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,117
Good morning.

262
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,990
Is this your room?

263
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,276
Yes, it was my room.

264
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,632
Is that you?

265
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,312
Yes.

266
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,233
My father. My mother is dead.

267
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,716
My brother was killed in Russia,
near Schitomir.

268
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,957
Would you?

269
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,112
No.

270
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,834
Bastards!

271
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,671
Wait...

272
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,431
...to wait...

273
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,672
I wait...

274
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,759
Bed...

275
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,471
And wait in bed...

276
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,749
Wait in my bed...

277
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,470
Shall I make a fire in the bathroom?

278
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,555
- What?
- In the bathroom.

279
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,075
The bathroom... yes, do.

280
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,875
Go to my room.

281
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,916
And wait in my bed.

282
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,634
Stop drinking and get to work.

283
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,959
We want this to be a happier place.

284
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,358
You've tidied up the library.

285
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,431
You've done a good job.

286
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,151
What about this?

287
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,955
Save it, every drop is precious.

288
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,713
- Do you drink?
- I'll be damned.

289
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,395
- Submarine fuel, that's what it is.
- Where did you find it?

290
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,477
Behind the books.

291
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,516
A bottle for each classic.

292
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,556
That's fate.

293
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,518
I've been searching
the cellar, the attic,

294
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,068
but never the library.

295
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,996
Sorry, I refuse to burn books.

296
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,318
I've finished. Let's go.

297
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,837
That's the stuff.

298
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,399
I say,
Johann Strauss was a great artist -

299
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,789
a man of high principles

300
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,953
and above all, a great lover.

301
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,029
Above all...

302
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,108
Don't overdo it.

303
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,510
The first sip is the strongest.

304
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,679
Tell her to have a drink, too.

305
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,990
Miss Heinemann!

306
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,677
Come here.

307
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,992
Cheers.

308
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,995
A true German woman,

309
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,150
keeps up with the men,
come what may.

310
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,749
The only good thing she learned.

311
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,832
Cheers!

312
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,309
Listen to what they're playing!

313
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,992
Listen...

314
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,598
I know these waltzes.

315
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,272
<i>The first one's called
"Nur für Natur".</i>

316
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,035
Then the one about...
the dangerous cousin.

317
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,556
This one...

318
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,274
...is from "The Merry War".

319
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,351
<i>"Der lustige Krieg".</i>

320
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,030
Do you mind if I take my jacket off?

321
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,951
I don't mind.

322
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,591
What are you doing, you idiot?

323
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,275
I just want to find out
where the shooting is...

324
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,794
Stop fiddling with it, you fool.

325
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,710
And don't give her any more booze.

326
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,792
The silly laughs shows
she's had enough.

327
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,275
She ought to eat something.

328
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,316
Go and eat something.

329
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,393
Turn the record over, quickly.

330
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,835
Picking on me again. As always.

331
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,319
Damn. Let go!

332
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,917
That's enough!

333
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,474
Where have you been, Lieutenant?

334
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,513
Hungary, Yugoslavia,
via Port Said to England.

335
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,111
Had a good time, did you?

336
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,998
I was stuck in Scotland
till the end of the war.

337
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,438
- Did you meet any black girls?
- I did.

338
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,319
Black, Jewish... and Arab.

339
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,318
Thanks.

340
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,834
I met a black girl
with dyed blonde hair.

341
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,073
What? That's a joke.

342
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,195
Which one was better in bed?

343
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,589
I don't know.

344
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,114
I didn't put them to the test.

345
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,432
I never... had a black girl.

346
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,917
Slovak girls, yes, even German,

347
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,913
and a Ukrainian
working in the cotton-mill.

348
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,355
But a black girl...

349
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,710
What's wrong?
You need some fresh air.

350
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,870
Tell him to get out.

351
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,632
A black girl...

352
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,074
Will you have a drink with me?

353
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,629
I have to eat something.

354
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,756
I have to eat all the time
though I've never enjoyed it.

355
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,200
I hate it all: food, cigarettes, drinks.

356
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,231
You talk like a fool.

357
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,110
Were you worried?

358
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,191
I told you to keep your trap shut.

359
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,272
Were you worried
one of the girls would give you VD?

360
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,351
Shut up!

361
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,593
- Have you ever been drunk?
- How drunk?

362
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,355
So drunk you had a complete blackout.

363
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,431
A long time ago.

364
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,310
Before my mother died.

365
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,035
I inherited the weak stomach from her.

366
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,111
Nonsense.

367
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,716
I was looking forward to going home.

368
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,272
And now I've found only strangers.

369
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,351
I don't understand anyone.

370
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,031
There are things
one shouldn't think about.

371
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,078
Switch the light off, my eyes hurt.

372
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,675
So you won't have a drink?

373
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,870
I've had enough.

374
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,478
What's this supposed to be?

375
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,915
What got into you?

376
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,111
Look at her, how she stares!

377
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,319
The beast! I'd like to kick her.

378
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,189
Go to my room
and wait for me in bed.

379
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,154
So that's the way things are.

380
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,748
Why not? I agree.

381
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,313
That's the easy way.
Otherwise, just hit her!

382
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,473
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

383
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,109
That's your business.
I don't mind.

384
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,589
Much has been drunk here
in the past.

385
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,037
OK...

386
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,990
I can take it.

387
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,718
Captain Andrejs
was a better drinking partner.

388
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,270
A great guy, a partisan,
served in Beneš' army...

389
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,558
Six years in the underground...

390
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,154
We took over... together.

391
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,274
Damn!

392
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,189
So you've been shooting
at the pictures?

393
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,077
Only for fun.

394
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,117
- Let go, Lieutenant.
- Don't call me Lieutenant!

395
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,519
Get out! You too!

396
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,153
- I haven't done anything.
- That's even worse.

397
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,590
I don't want to see anyone.

398
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,750
Please go.

399
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,117
Go, go.

400
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,835
The lady is through.

401
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,033
I want her back at the camp
by 8:00 am.

402
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,112
That's for your information,
Lieutenant Chotovicky.

403
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,794
As you wish.

404
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,395
That's what I've been expecting
but the lady stays.

405
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,918
Good night.

406
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,868
I told you to watch out.

407
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,477
Good night.

408
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,678
Beyond the grave we will remain

409
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,749
in friendship and fidelity.

410
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,752
Deep, holy nature, let me be a child,

411
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,513
to sleep like a child and in peace.

412
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,311
God's Sun, walking alone

413
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,595
in the blindness of passing time,

414
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,797
goes to the crossroads in the field,
where we will part,

415
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,871
where lies a cross...

416
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,071
Do you understand Czech?

417
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,276
My diary, where did you find it?

418
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,588
I am glad you don't understand me

419
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,635
as if I were talking to a dog.

420
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,870
When I woke up next to you
in the morning

421
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,831
I thought I had come home.

422
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,835
I dreamt my parents were standing

423
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,478
in the yard,

424
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,875
and shut the gate when they saw me.

425
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,951
Adelheid?

426
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,993
Are you here?

427
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,990
Sitting in the dark?

428
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:46,876
The table in our kitchen
was made of lime-wood.

429
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,114
When they carved up a pig,
it was streaked with blood.

430
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,872
But if you scrubbed it with sand,
it was as white as snow.

431
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,638
Our dog used to lie under the table.

432
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,154
I used to throw
fatty scraps of meat to her.

433
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,433
- Shall I leave the light on?
- Yes, maybe.

434
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,634
Why do you close your eyes?

435
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,272
I couldn't...

436
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,955
Come, come...

437
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,557
Hey!

438
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,438
What did you tell her?

439
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,637
Don't you understand?
What did you tell her?

440
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,789
Old Heinemann was hanged yesterday
in Olomouc.

441
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,073
- Adelheid!
- No!

442
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,950
Is that you, Adelheid?

443
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,028
We seem to have a visitor.

444
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:55,398
- Who else has a key?
- The third key...

445
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,749
Sorry. Get dressed quickly.
I need a hot drink.

446
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,315
I feel awful.

447
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,749
Go to hell!

448
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,796
What are you here for?

449
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,028
Oh, dear God...

450
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,070
Go away! Go!

451
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,549
It will soon pass.

452
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,515
At last, I feel I have come home.

453
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,349
Do you understand?

454
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:32,634
Adelheid! Are you listening?

455
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,514
What's the matter?

456
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,228
It's snowing.

457
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:58,630
Sorry to bother you
but I have a serious reason...

458
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,194
There's a serious reason...

459
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,475
What reason?

460
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,194
A reason
that concerns the young lady.

461
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,671
As you know, she's the daughter
of the biggest Nazi in the region.

462
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,154
He's dead.
And you already told me.

463
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:26,518
I've just learned that she went
to a convent school at Beuthen.

464
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,388
- Do you know what that means?
- I don't.

465
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,392
They only took the best.

466
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:38,315
I've seen a lot
but I've never seen worse whores.

467
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,672
- Do you want to know the details?
- Anything else?

468
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,799
Yes. Hansgeorg Heinemann.

469
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,036
What about him?

470
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,556
He died, in Russia.

471
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,357
Quite a number of corpses
have come back alive.

472
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,752
Would you mind
if I stayed here overnight?

473
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,637
You're welcome.

474
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,077
I'm glad I don't have to explain.

475
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:27,314
My people are keeping watch
on the village, but you are alone.

476
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,875
What's going to become of her?

477
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,632
That depends.

478
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,474
Was someone shooting here
yesterday?

479
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,835
Someone's always shooting.

480
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,595
Right now, I want to catch
young Heinemann.

481
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,317
Will you let her stay?

482
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,709
- For the time being.
- For how long?

483
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:59,033
Till we catch him. A day or two.
We are sure to get him by then.

484
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,271
- And then what?
- How should I know?

485
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,550
I said that depends.

486
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,956
I had to report it.

487
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,678
What do you want
so as to leave her alone?

488
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,071
Two bottles of Cognac.

489
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,915
I'll get them for you.

490
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,313
And to knock your teeth in,
Mr Chotovicky.

491
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,035
Excuse me. I'm making a cup of tea.

492
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,671
You are a bastard!

493
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,076
You make me sick.

494
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,990
To buy a woman
for two bottles of Cognac.

495
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,591
Your hands are cold.

496
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,151
Have a drink.

497
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,711
Are you afraid?

498
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,232
No.

499
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,549
Let go, please.

500
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,630
Don't be afraid.

501
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,154
Everything's going to be all right.

502
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,673
You will see.

503
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,634
Everything's going to be all right.

504
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,553
You don't happen to have ointment
to put on these cursed frostbites?

505
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,238
Hans!

506
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,035
Hansgeorg!

507
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,670
What have you done?

508
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,432
Beast!

509
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,157
Beast!

510
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,630
Come, Victor.

511
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,960
You still want to talk to her?

512
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,917
Here.

513
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,829
Thanks.

514
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,191
They want to take you to Olomouc.

515
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,111
I am supposed to give evidence.

516
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,591
You don't have to be afraid.

517
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,917
I will not say anything.

518
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,679
I don't want to hurt anyone.

519
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,911
I am sorry for you.

520
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,274
All I want to know is...

521
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,751
Shall I translate?

522
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,869
...did you hate me all the time?

523
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,437
Even when...

524
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,752
...I had that attack
and you came to help me?

525
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,192
When?

526
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,638
No, I didn't, then...

527
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:58,234
Do you remember the day after...

528
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,595
She remembers the first day...

529
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:03,877
You watched me chop wood...

530
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,315
...when you came down, you blushed.

531
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,234
Later, I found you had slipped
a pack of cigarettes in my bag.

532
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,833
I was surprised.

533
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:25,228
The pills you had to take,
you always broke them up.

534
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,233
I didn't quite know
what you wanted from me.

535
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,159
You seemed so shy... and then...

536
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:43,514
Then you sent me upstairs
to wait for you in bed.

537
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,036
Then you were just like all the others.

538
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,109
That can be changed!

539
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,676
I can't stay alone.

540
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,235
I have no one else...

541
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,632
What?

542
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,795
She wants to know what you said.

543
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,553
Tell her I have no one, only her.

544
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,637
Tell her that.

545
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,480
Don't be afraid, Adelheid.

546
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,512
I can help if you want me to.

547
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,354
Do you hear, Adelheid?

548
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,312
- What are you staring at?
- Get it over with, Lieutenant.

549
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,395
Come. Let's go.

550
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,915
Take this little exhibition away,
will you?

551
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,674
Exhibits, Captain!

552
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,990
Take them away.

553
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:00,837
If we reach the town in daylight,
we have to go.

554
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,071
I've seen enough.

555
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:07,835
- Are you through with her?
- I've finished, Captain.

556
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,275
Captain! We're in trouble, Captain!

557
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,954
She won't open the door.

558
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,793
She asked to...
I sent Šterba to watch the wndow

559
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,270
in case she'd try to escape.

560
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,230
I've been here watching the door.

561
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,630
That's terrible!

562
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:21,077
Date, place, time of death...
Let's say 3:25...

563
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,712
Here.

564
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,875
Come and read the statement.

565
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,196
Here you are.

566
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,351
Do you want me to read it to you?

567
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:54,479
Protocol about the suicide
of Adelheid Heinemann -

568
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,358
spinster, date of birth...

569
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,590
That's beside the point.

570
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:06,549
Cause of death:
suicide by strangulation...

571
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:10,758
The dead woman was wearing
a reddish fur coat without a collar.

572
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,879
Her face was pressed
against the right side of the wall.

573
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,757
Under the fur coat,

574
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,308
the dead woman
was wearing blue trousers,

575
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:22,153
<i>white socks and ski-boots,</i>

576
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:25,152
<i>a grey sweater
buttoned on the left shoulder.</i>

577
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:31,793
<i>The fur coat was unbuttoned.
One of its three buttons was missing.</i>

578
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,950
<i>In the pockets was 657 crowns,</i>

579
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,110
<i>five gold coins and a ticket</i>

580
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:41,035
<i>from Cerná Voda to Orlice
worth 27 crowns, dated 21 December.</i>

581
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,475
<i>On her left wrist
she wore a gold watch.</i>

582
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,551
<i>The watch stopped at 7:13.</i>

583
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,790
<i>Under the grey sweater,</i>

584
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,873
<i>the dead woman was wearing
a white slip, undamaged, a bra,</i>

585
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,669
<i>briefs, suspender belt,
home-made stockings...</i>
