1
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:38,457
This magazine says there's a new hospital

2
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:40,964
for a new kind of artificial insemination.

3
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:43,968
The success rate is 30% higher.

4
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:45,326
You want a baby?

5
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,253
I know it'll cost money...

6
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,693
It's not the money, go ahead if you want,

7
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:53,686
but don't expect me to be part of it.

8
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,575
What are you saying?

9
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,457
To put it bluntly,

10
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,325
I'd rather be with them than you.

11
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:05,294
You both look about the same in size,

12
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,963
but at least there's some novelty in them.

13
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,296
When I met you, you said you'd bring me
fortune and children.

14
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,459
Am I rich? In my dreams!

15
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:15,377
You can't even lay an egg.

16
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,298
Stop lying to me.

17
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:17,371
You said I shouldn't con people,

18
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,445
or my children will get retribution.

19
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:20,445
But you're the biggest con artist,

20
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:21,535
liar of the century!

21
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,888
Con artist, liar...

22
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:30,763
Don't have a fit over this!

23
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:35,971
We're out of soya sauce. I'll go get it.

24
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:41,021
This is good, Sis.

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,684
What are you eating? Alright...

26
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:05,248
Excuse me, auntie.

27
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:15,325
Auntie? Do I look that old?

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Fatty! What a coincidence!

29
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,662
What's wrong? You're all teary-eyed!

30
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,932
My husband doesn't want me!

31
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:40,768
It's OK! Thanks!

32
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,221
She removed her husband's name.

33
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,964
Is she divorced or is he dead?

34
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,216
Have you ever seen her husband? I haven't.

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,250
I know she has 2 sons who are
quite good looking.

36
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:55,324
The picture on her desk? I know that.

37
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:57,856
She's always so secretive, what a weirdo!

38
00:03:57,996 --> 00:03:59,612
That's enough!

39
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:11,124
Mrs Lam...Sorry, Miss Luk.

40
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,940
You have 10 minutes before the
press conference.

41
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:14,453
LY wants to know if you're ready.

42
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,303
Tell him I'm ready.

43
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:21,129
I must admit, today's media
have more sources,

44
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:23,577
and more channels of distribution.

45
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,685
That's why their reaction to each story

46
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:27,612
is much quicker than the Government.

47
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,125
Our colleagues of the Resource Centre

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,009
only wish to verify it.

49
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:34,452
I emphasise we have no intention
to interfere with the freedom of the press.

50
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:37,095
You think this is strictly a human error?

51
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,689
Because Mrs Lam was at karaoke.

52
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,525
That's why the press release was late?

53
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:43,128
Incorrect account of an incident
may constitute libel.

54
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:44,737
We have pictures to prove it.

55
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:46,657
Unless Mrs Lam doesn't recognise herself.

56
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:51,167
Care to comment, Mrs Lam?

57
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:53,245
I heard you became single again recently.

58
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:54,970
Is that why you went drinking?

59
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,372
LY is your boss.

60
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,047
Did he spend time to console you?

61
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:01,088
Mrs Lam and I will not answer
any personal questions.

62
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,684
Rumour has it you'll quit your job
to run for councillor.

63
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:04,648
Will you two work hand in hand?

64
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:05,932
That's a personal question.

65
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,323
Rumour has it after you leave
the Government,

66
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:08,890
you will go into politics.

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,652
As your star assistant, will Mrs Lam
follow you?

68
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:15,687
That's all for today. Thank you.

69
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,211
<i>Wait...</i>

70
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,220
Mrs Lam, care to comment?

71
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,579
Mrs Lam, say a few words...

72
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:27,729
Come into my office. I want a word with you.

73
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,971
Are you really that stupid?

74
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:35,248
You knew karaokes are flooded
with reporters.

75
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,404
You let them take pictures of you
when you were blasted,

76
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:40,370
at a time when you had
just announced your divorce.

77
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:42,729
You know I hardly go to those places.

78
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:45,247
It just so happened I went with
my old classmates.

79
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:46,400
No excuse!

80
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:47,572
OK...

81
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:49,653
You should know very well,

82
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,048
what you do affect not only you

83
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:54,293
but also affect me.

84
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:57,243
People in politics must
sacrifice their personal lives.

85
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,450
If you want to be the woman
behind me,

86
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:02,301
you must behave yourself in public.

87
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:06,504
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

88
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,651
I haven't had a chance to ask you,

89
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,296
you've been divorced for some time.

90
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:13,041
Why did you choose to announce it now?

91
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:14,326
Precisely because it has been so long,

92
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:15,893
I don't want to hide anything anymore.

93
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,526
Don't tell me you were doing it for me.

94
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:27,759
No, I want no more constraints,
no more secrets.

95
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:30,376
It has nothing to do with you.

96
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,885
The media will be in hot pursuit.

97
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,046
Except for official business,

98
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,247
it's best we don't see each other.

99
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,249
I won't drop by at night anymore.

100
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:52,778
You look so cool with that poker face,

101
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,173
I want to eat you alive!

102
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:12,966
When will you hand in your resignation?

103
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:15,326
I want to think it over.

104
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:16,685
I need to make some plans.

105
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,778
I thought we agreed.

106
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,610
What's there to plan?

107
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,170
You know if I quit now, I'll lose everything

108
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,248
housing, medical insurance, pension...

109
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:30,734
My sons are still in school in the UK.

110
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,658
I don't want them affected.

111
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:36,969
I need you to help me set up the office.

112
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:40,010
You know how long I have been
planning for this.

113
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:44,932
I can only make this happen with your help.

114
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,219
You can't be so selfish

115
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:48,210
and only think of yourself.

116
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:49,962
You have to think of me.

117
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:01,251
Fine! I get it...

118
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:04,494
I didn't realise our mutual
trust is so fragile.

119
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,298
Let's pretend nothing happened

120
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:08,450
and I haven't said anything, OK?

121
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:14,017
What does that mean?

122
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,503
I said I needed to think about it.

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,726
I didn't say I wouldn't help you.

124
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,250
I have work to do. We'll talk later.

125
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,971
You should get back to work too.

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,572
OK? OK!

127
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,656
Hey, gorgeous!

128
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,064
Does he have to run off like that?

129
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,497
Can't even stay for a chat?

130
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:15,889
All by yourself?

131
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,779
It's hot!

132
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:39,968
Do you mind?

133
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,007
Let's find something to do.

134
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:05,087
(Chun-lei calling...)

135
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,805
When will you grow up?

136
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:15,782
Even a kid knows drugs can
ruin your life.

137
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:19,057
Why don't you kick the habit?

138
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,339
You sound more like my Mom than my Mom.

139
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:26,650
Mom my foot! How can you laugh?

140
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:29,291
Are you scared?

141
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:30,810
Not as much as you should be.

142
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,929
The marijuana fell out of your pocket.

143
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:35,857
The cops already said they wouldn't
press charges against me.

144
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:39,376
But after this incident,

145
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:43,884
I must carry my ID card even when
I take out the garbage.

146
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,334
I'm so glad to see you.

147
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:50,602
The paperwork is done. Let's go.

148
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:54,776
Bye, gorgeous! Let's do it again.

149
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:15,172
Thanks! You were the first name
that came to my head.

150
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,885
After all you're a government official.

151
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:26,214
Have you eaten? Happy hour on me?

152
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:30,572
Why were you arrested?

153
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:34,656
Pure bad luck! I went out to buy a beer.

154
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,166
The cops asked for my ID

155
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,884
and brought me back to the police station.

156
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:39,886
Don't lie to me.

157
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,605
I really forgot my ID.

158
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:46,173
You forgot to bring it to check into
a love motel.

159
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,894
Who was that guy? He's a delivery boy!

160
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,762
A delivery boy in possession of marijuana.

161
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,400
I can't believe you could be so indiscreet
at your age.

162
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,972
Jenny, what happened to you?

163
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,446
I told you it's bad luck.

164
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:02,219
I haven't done this in 10 years.

165
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,732
I got arrested the minute
I wanted to get laid.

166
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,328
Chatty, believe me...

167
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:08,371
Sorry, don't call me Chatty on the street.

168
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:12,686
OK, Mrs Lam. I don't usually do this.

169
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:15,659
I've been really dry lately,

170
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:17,804
so I let myself do something so stupid.

171
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,533
You were quite the free spirit
even back then.

172
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,813
You always knew how to had fun.

173
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,502
I can't believe you'd come to this
at your age.

174
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,047
Forget it.

175
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:35,528
It's late. Go home, take a shower
and go to bed.

176
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:40,143
Next time, don't call me.

177
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:42,142
I don't want reporters on my tail.

178
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,934
I'll pay you back later...

179
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:54,371
Anyway, thank you,

180
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,408
Please leave a message, we'll reply ASAP.

181
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,685
Honey, it's Mom!

182
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,942
Is it cold in the UK?

183
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:20,214
Big Bro, remind your kid brother
to stay warm.

184
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:24,142
He has a sensitive windpipe.
It'll mean trouble if he catches a cold.

185
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,807
Call me when you guys get this message.

186
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:33,093
I really miss you two. Love you.

187
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:55,294
(Chu-lei calling...)

188
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,575
Hello? Surprised? Mrs Lam

189
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:02,289
Yuen-chau! Hello? Are you OK, Chatty?

190
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:05,165
Say something! Hello? What is it?

191
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:22,168
It's late. What on earth do you want?

192
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,611
Precisely because it's late, I want to
make sure you're OK.

193
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,852
I heard something break. Are you OK?

194
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:27,326
I'm fine!

195
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,737
You have a nice ﬂat.

196
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:36,455
Must be nice to be a civil servant.

197
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:39,783
Why did you get so drunk?

198
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:43,008
I'm OK!

199
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,326
Drink some water.

200
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,291
Here...

201
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:57,779
I know him. He's your boss LY.

202
00:15:59,277 --> 00:16:00,859
Your boys are so big!

203
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,609
Just the boys? No pictures of your husband?

204
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,058
I won't answer personal questions.

205
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,163
I'm not Mrs Lam anymore.

206
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,450
No more Lam Luk Yuen-chau.

207
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:22,423
My name is Luk Yuen-chau. That's me.

208
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:27,656
No wonder you're drunk!

209
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:36,174
Your phone is ringing! You have a message.

210
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,210
(LY: I miss the way you moan in bed.)

211
00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,172
Chun-lei!

212
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:02,240
Slow down. There's no hurry.

213
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:03,731
I can't carry you if you pass out.

214
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,295
Don't tell them about my husband.

215
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:10,731
Come on, he said you're worse than a hippo.

216
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,889
A creep like that belongs to the landfill.

217
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:16,928
Don't worry. The girls are on your side.

218
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:19,687
I know they are.

219
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:21,138
According to the Book of Reincarnation,

220
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:23,528
I'm here to pay a debt in this life.

221
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,778
Nothing I can do can change that.

222
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,372
If you make a big deal out of this,

223
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,164
what will happen to me?

224
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:32,651
Don't be so superstitious!

225
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:35,300
You know that's how I am!

226
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:38,652
Will you help me, Chun-lei?

227
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,240
Do I have a choice? We're best friends.

228
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:44,778
I'll pretend nothing happened, OK?

229
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,574
Thank you!

230
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:51,698
Argh!
What is it?

231
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,932
Chatty?

232
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,523
Why didn't you go HP?

233
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:58,807
We're waiting for you.

234
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:00,727
Let's go!

235
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:11,854
Jenny, open UP!

236
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,502
Happy birthday to you,

237
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,443
happy birthday to you,

238
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,652
happy birthday to Jenny,

239
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:23,729
happy birthday to you!

240
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,523
Thanks!

241
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:26,728
Make a wish!
Make a wish!

242
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,093
I wish Benny would get run over by a oar.

243
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,447
What?

244
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:36,936
Benny? Is he the guy from the band
whom you saw kissing your Mom?

245
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:38,609
What has he done to you?

246
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:41,296
Whatever it is, you shouldn't curse him.

247
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:42,575
You'll get retribution.

248
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,087
The creep deserves retribution!

249
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:46,453
He said he wanted to many my Mom,

250
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,695
but he doesn't want to bring me
with them to the Philippines.

251
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:51,053
That's terrible!

252
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:51,778
How can he do that?

253
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:52,803
If she thinks I'm a burden,

254
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:54,700
she shouldn't have given birth to me.

255
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,782
I don't know who my real father is.

256
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,497
If she leaves me, what will happen to me?

257
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,696
Don't let your imagination run wild.

258
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:04,965
Auntie loves you, she won't leave you.

259
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,500
I'm not much better.

260
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:09,776
As much as my Mom loves my Dad,

261
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,217
she couldn't marry him.

262
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:15,413
People keeps calling her a tramp,

263
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:18,568
and they look down on me.

264
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:21,372
I'm very unhappy about it.

265
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:23,730
Don't start, Cyndi!

266
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,648
You're still better off than me.

267
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,805
You still have your Mom.

268
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,781
My parents are dead,

269
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,735
leaving me all alone living under
someone else's roof.

270
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:38,018
Don't CW!

271
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:41,007
Auntie gives me such a hard time,

272
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,599
even her son bullies me.

273
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,340
My brother bullies me too.

274
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:47,501
He pulls my hair and calls me BBQ pork girl!

275
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,218
Your brother is a real creep.

276
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:52,652
I feel like Nobita and he's Takeshi Goda,

277
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,776
only there's no Doraemon to save me
when he bullies me.

278
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,060
I'll be your Doraemon.

279
00:19:57,118 --> 00:20:00,133
If he bullies you again, I'll be the first
to stand up to him.

280
00:20:00,557 --> 00:20:04,164
But Fatty looks more like Doraemon than you.

281
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:08,060
Don't you make fun of me!

282
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,778
Come on, it's just a joke. You don't, OK?

283
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:14,732
You don't know my sad story.

284
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,609
How sad? You're always smiling.

285
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,570
You don't know because you're new at school.

286
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,598
Siu-sze and I went to the same
primary school.

287
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,523
She knows why I'm called Fatty.

288
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:27,728
Because I once weighed almost 200 lbs.

289
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:28,974
You're exaggerating!

290
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,135
One time when I had a high fever,

291
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,291
my parents couldn't carry me.

292
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:38,130
They had to borrow a hand trolley
to take me to a doctor.

293
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:40,569
Everyone on the street was staring at me.

294
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,734
I want to cry every time I think about it.

295
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,725
But you're skinny now.

296
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,803
But I didn't grow an inch!

297
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:51,418
The other day, Mom went to see
the doctor with me.

298
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:52,371
She asked the doctor...

299
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:53,446
What?

300
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:56,500
If I were a dwarf!

301
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:59,017
That's hilarious!

302
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:01,163
How embarrassing!

303
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:05,291
Don't laugh! It's not funny!

304
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:08,243
It's sad, but I top the cake.

305
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,857
My Dad is a Superintendent of Police
with the Correctional Services.

306
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:11,292
My Mom is the principal of a
government school.

307
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:13,882
My sister is a top Arts student with 8 "A"s!

308
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,451
My brother is worse, he's a
straight A student in 9 subjects.

309
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:17,568
Imagine the pressure on me!

310
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,522
There are rules for everything at home.

311
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,569
I feel like I'm living in jail.

312
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:23,529
They have a say in everything and I don't.

313
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:26,366
I was not allowed to watch EYT.

314
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,573
It's quiet like the library after dinner.

315
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:33,291
My Christmas presents are always
literary classics or encyclopedias.

316
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,731
Alright, we get the picture...

317
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:37,852
Now we know why you couldn't
keep your mouth shut at school.

318
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,521
Siu-sze, you have no war stories to tell,

319
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:41,521
you must be so happy.

320
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,057
You're so lucky.

321
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:47,521
That's what you think. I have my problems.

322
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,522
Like what?

323
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:52,495
People make fun of me all the time.

324
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,138
About what?

325
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:59,851
They say I'm ﬂat like an ironing board.

326
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:01,529
What?

327
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:02,852
Is it true?

328
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:23,703
Happy birthday to you,

329
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:26,093
happy birthday to you,

330
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,812
happy birthday to ]en...

331
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,297
Thank you.

332
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,135
You didn't make a wish!

333
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,776
I'm too old for that.

334
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,168
It's always health and world peace, right?

335
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,652
The same to you, OK?

336
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:41,134
Same to you...

337
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:56,702
You all seem a bit weird today.

338
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,805
We haven't celebrated a birthday in years!

339
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:03,165
I told you we're too old for this.

340
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:08,527
Can we help you?

341
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,293
Honey, what are you doing here?

342
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:13,524
She just finished her piano lesson.

343
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:15,137
I thought we'd come for a visit.

344
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:16,603
Let me introduce you...

345
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,322
My husband Wong Kwok-leung,

346
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,856
my daughter Wong Ho.

347
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,008
Hello!

348
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:21,656
Say hello!

349
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:22,694
Hello, everyone!

350
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,523
Hello!

351
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:26,138
You're lucky she's grown up.

352
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,928
It's nice to have a daughter.

353
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,170
Pretty too! Youth is everything!

354
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,657
A family of three, very nice.

355
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,214
Luckily she takes after her Mom,

356
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:39,855
and not a water buffalo like me.

357
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:42,216
Are you saying Grandma gave birth
to a water buffalo?

358
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:43,601
I'll tell her!

359
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,568
Good! Get Daddy in trouble!

360
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,340
This place is nice.

361
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,413
I'll show you around.

362
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:53,605
Wow, your idol...

363
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:56,058
Cut the cake, I'm dying of hunger!

364
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:59,370
Bite your tongue, don't say "die".

365
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:01,697
No holds barred in here...

366
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:07,007
Don't repeat what was said tonight.

367
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,778
Whoever repeats it

368
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,803
will be an old maid forever.

369
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,891
Why are you looking at me?

370
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,529
What do you think?

371
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,695
I swear I won't say a word, OK?

372
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,365
I wonder what will become of us?

373
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,559
I want to be tall and skinny like a model.

374
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,468
Prettier than the lot of you.

375
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:34,062
You think we'll be in university together?

376
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,110
You think we'll be in university together?

377
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:39,286
That'd be great. We'll remain inseparable.

378
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,290
Auntie would put her son through school
if she had the money,

379
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,937
I won't get a chance.

380
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:46,812
I think we'll all be housewives with 2 kids,

381
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:48,852
holding one in the front, one on our back.

382
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:51,338
What a spectacle!

383
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:52,726
You'd never agree to it.

384
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,724
Ca" YOU give up your forest?

385
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,443
I'm just saying that.

386
00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:58,775
We'll see when the time comes.

387
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,723
For now, I'm happy to have you all.

388
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:05,215
We'll celebrate your birthday with you
every year.

389
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:07,499
We'll always be happy like tonight. Agreed?

390
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:08,973
Agreed!

391
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:14,526
We'll always be best friends,

392
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:17,287
stay the same for 50 years like Hong Kong.

393
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,652
50 years!

394
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:30,052
The sky next to the meteorite is my home.

395
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,337
The dark sky is my origin.

396
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:44,133
I live my life for you...

397
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:54,242
Someone on the street
met me by accident.

398
00:25:54,273 --> 00:26:01,009
She was next to me, leaning against me.

399
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:07,416
Someone on the street lit up
the fire in my heart

400
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:09,851
and gave me warmth

401
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:13,691
that blossomed in my heart.

402
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:18,161
I close my eyes and pretend I'm in the past

403
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:21,575
Your heart is close to mine.

404
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,888
Let my love run free

405
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,976
as if I owned everything

406
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,498
that would stay with me forever...

407
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:34,780
Anything about my daughter?

408
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:37,443
We've found 5 potential targets.

409
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:40,286
Really? Where?

410
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,445
One each in California, Hawaii,
the UK, New Zealand

411
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,695
and the last one in Mauritius.

412
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:47,653
All over the world?

413
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:49,646
That proves the strength of our company.

414
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:52,136
Our top-notch staff is stationed
throughout the world.

415
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:54,932
You should have complete faith
in our efficiency.

416
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,850
But you can't confirm she's my daughter.

417
00:26:56,877 --> 00:27:02,691
That's why we need to escalate
our operation to zero in on the target.

418
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,245
Additional charges?

419
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,935
Of course!

420
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,725
We have to go abroad and look,

421
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,931
which requires additional manpower
and expenses.

422
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:16,728
Don't worry. We can offer
an international VIP discount.

423
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:19,371
5 locations, buy 4 get 1 free.

424
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:23,860
I can't afford that.

425
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,811
That's such a shame!

426
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,290
Because of a little money,

427
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,493
you and your daughter will be
forever apart,

428
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,441
and can't be reunited.

429
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:35,081
Such a lovely daughter,

430
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:39,849
will be without the love
of her birth mother.

431
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:42,726
Keep looking.

432
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,130
And the fees...

433
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:45,566
I'll have it ready soon.

434
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:06,262
Hello! Did I scare you?

435
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:10,809
No! Why would I be? I wasn't doing anything.

436
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:12,411
You slammed the drawer so hard,

437
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:13,882
did your fingers get caught?

438
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:16,723
Are you blind? I didn't close any drawers.

439
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,855
What are you doing limping around?

440
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:22,521
I wanted to see how
the new fitting was going.

441
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,157
Ka-lai! You're back!

442
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,934
Hello!

443
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,776
<i>“Ms your m?</i>

444
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:29,573
Fine! I have one more appointment.

445
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:30,929
I'm so relieved!

446
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,055
Ka-lai wants to see how the
renovation was going.

447
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:35,364
Show her around.

448
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:39,491
Come...I have good news for you.

449
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,130
We'll be filming a commercial...

450
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:48,616
I'm out of lives. Send me a few...

451
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:55,081
What game are you playing?

452
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:58,265
You have abandoned the Black Holes Crush
long enough.

453
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:02,979
Frdbook? You have friends other than me?

454
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:09,808
I see, Princess Leia!

455
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,332
You've been busy looking up
her Frdbook?

456
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,568
I want to know what she's doing.

457
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:19,568
Waiting won't get you anywhere.

458
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,090
Is this how you woo a girl?

459
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,005
You should do it like you study
the black holes.

460
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,211
Be daring with your theories
and verification.

461
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:26,367
Let me help you.

462
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,649
Hey! What are you doing?

463
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,896
Say "I like you"...Send a rose...

464
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:30,845
Come on, delete it!

465
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:31,643
Give her a banana too.

466
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:36,408
She checked in at Chat Kee.

467
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:37,972
Go find her.

468
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,936
But I don't like beef brisket,

469
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:43,654
I only like wonton noodles.

470
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:48,056
You're going there to meet her,
not to eat.

471
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:50,083
You can eat anything after you meet her.

472
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:53,370
Even wonton rice, you moron!

473
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:58,006
Get going! You need a push? Go!

474
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:13,332
Are you alright? Chi-kin?

475
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:18,363
Luckily you're not holding ﬂowers,

476
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:21,128
or Pd think you came to propose!

477
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:26,050
You came for beef brisket noodles?

478
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,340
Yes, can I join you?

479
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:31,213
I'm done and I'm leaving.

480
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,619
There's a seat over there...Hurry!

481
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:37,441
I have to go, bye!
Bye!

482
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,768
How many of you, Sir?

483
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:53,721
Zero.

484
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,534
The Science Museum has an exhibition
on forests in Norway.

485
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,850
Interested in taking a look at my home town?

486
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:09,618
Yes!

487
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:14,132
You'll have to slow down for this cripple.

488
00:31:14,193 --> 00:31:15,979
I can even be your crutch!

489
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:20,007
Careful!

490
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,850
Lower your arm a bit, OK!

491
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:33,132
Give me a smile...good!

492
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,490
She's so beautiful!

493
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:37,645
I must compliment my good judgment.

494
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,260
When I first met Dan-dan,

495
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:42,216
I knew she'd be the ideal spokesperson
for my product.

496
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:47,532
What woman doesn't want to look like her?

497
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:49,088
She has the skin of a young girl,

498
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:51,208
and the body of a mature woman.

499
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:52,695
But my aunt's age.

500
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:54,776
Exactly! How did you know?

501
00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:57,134
That's precisely the reason I like her.

502
00:31:57,193 --> 00:32:01,130
I want this commercial to tell
all the aunts in the world,

503
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:03,368
when you use this product,

504
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:05,978
your husbands won't run off.

505
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:07,414
Isn't it a great idea?

506
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:09,723
Right...too great! Don't worry, Mr Wong

507
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:10,971
when the commercial goes on air,

508
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:13,182
even grey goods traders will fight for it.

509
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:14,532
I hope so!

510
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:17,010
Mr Wong! Thanks for coming.

511
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:19,415
Thanks for your help, Dan-dan.

512
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,930
Are you filming the commercial
the day after tomorrow?

513
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:25,050
The director told me you could dance.

514
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:28,570
No, the day after tomorrow is too soon.

515
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:29,338
Really?

516
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:31,648
Miss Dan-dan changed our storyboard.

517
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:34,283
She wanted to add other women.

518
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,615
You're not the star?

519
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,130
I'm too beautiful.

520
00:32:37,193 --> 00:32:38,979
No one would believe I need "Hero".

521
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:41,536
If we add a few housewives,

522
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,338
women who see the shocking difference

523
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,260
won't want to look like them.

524
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,341
They'll use Hero so that
they can look like me.

525
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,568
The commercial will be very entertaining.

526
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,181
And it'll work for sure.

527
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:55,853
Trust me, please!

528
00:32:56,067 --> 00:33:00,129
Of course I do! Lun...

529
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,086
Just do as Dan-dan say.

530
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:04,822
I'll sort it out.

531
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:22,608
Are you serious?

532
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:25,458
These women are 20 x Z, not under 20.

533
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:26,684
How can they wear this uniform?

534
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,608
To show them like this on TV is so scary.

535
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:30,205
Without a "parental guidance" warning

536
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:31,102
and it's not Halloween.

537
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:32,567
You want people to complain?

538
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:35,532
It's Miss Yung's idea, not mine.

539
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,175
What?

540
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:38,532
Oh my God! How cute!

541
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:41,361
Cute? I don't see you wearing it.

542
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:44,973
Alan, sort it out between you
and tell me what to do.

543
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:50,820
What game are you playing?

544
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:53,330
How can I sell this idea to the M Club?

545
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:56,172
You're so charming you can do anything.

546
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,181
Or just offer to do more hotpots with them.

547
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,048
I'm serious! Either you change this

548
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,971
or let those women off the hook.

549
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:06,896
I must film this commercial.

550
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:09,205
Don't get huffy with me over those women!

551
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:10,250
Because your idea is sick!

552
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,375
Mr Wong is spending so much money
on the commercial.

553
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:14,690
You shouldn't mess it up because
of a personal vendetta.

554
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:17,213
If you're not happy with me,

555
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:20,811
I can quit and your troubles will be over.

556
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:22,250
Not that again!

557
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:23,688
I didn't want to either.

558
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:26,406
If I quit, Mr Wong will blame you.

559
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:29,533
He'll complain about you and...

560
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:31,686
And I'll lose my job.

561
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:34,008
Sol must do as you say.

562
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,095
Please! This commercial will be fun.

563
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:40,011
Sit back and enjoy a good laugh.

564
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,339
Good, there you are!

565
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:56,742
Lun's secretary sent over this disc.

566
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,378
They want us to do this dance
in the commercial.

567
00:34:58,402 --> 00:34:59,927
They want us to use this as reference.

568
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:03,607
My husband definitely won't let me do this.

569
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:05,456
I'm not doing the commercial.

570
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,380
No, you can't quit.

571
00:35:07,402 --> 00:35:08,972
There are 3 of you.

572
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:10,771
3 is not enough.

573
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:13,813
No, 3 is a lucky number.

574
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:16,647
Look at the Grasshoppers and Little Tigers.

575
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,257
It's only fun if we do it together.

576
00:35:19,277 --> 00:35:22,383
Don't force me. My husband won't let me.

577
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,489
Let her back out. The 3 of us will do it.

578
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:27,016
I want out too!

579
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,054
What?

580
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,763
Why? You don't have a husband.

581
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:33,174
I'm not in the mood.

582
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:37,920
Why? You've been like this lately.

583
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:40,377
I don't have time to practise.

584
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,732
I don't do facials and I look awful.

585
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:44,375
I don't want to go in front of the camera.

586
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,889
What should we do?

587
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:49,811
Lun made it clear he needed everyone
from M Club.

588
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:53,848
What else? I won't give up this chance.

589
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,560
The show must go on.

590
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,179
Patty's husband forbids her to do it.

591
00:36:03,198 --> 00:36:07,533
Chun-lei needs to look after her Mom.

592
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,285
Only 4 of you left in the M Club?

593
00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:13,329
There are 2 more, but one has gone mad,

594
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:15,125
the other is quite an introvert.

595
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:16,967
She can't go in front of the camera.

596
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,482
So that leaves you and Chu Lei?

597
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:22,690
Z or 4...What's the difference?

598
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:25,664
No difference? Can 2 people play mahjong?

599
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,687
You signed the contract.

600
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,537
It specifies there will be 4 of you.

601
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:29,926
Now there are only 2 left.

602
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,093
Sorry! I didn't want this to happen,

603
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,919
but I couldn't convince them otherwise.

604
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:38,661
I'll talk to the boss

605
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,131
and see if there's a way to sort it out.

606
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,046
Great!

607
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,767
No way! If they don't do it, I won't do it.

608
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:51,459
Change the storyboard, cut the dance.

609
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:53,690
Don't make fools out of them.

610
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,480
Then why do I need them?

611
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,096
You really want to do this?

612
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:01,099
I don't understand. You're a woman too.

613
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:03,409
Why must you give them a hard time?

614
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:07,099
You should know how sad it is
to be made fun of.

615
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,852
Have you forgotten what they did at school?

616
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:15,733
Alan, stop saying I'm vicious.

617
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:18,022
This is simply a slice of life.

618
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,816
I'm giving them a mirror.

619
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:22,891
Let them know the world is unfair.

620
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,453
Some women are born to be Miss Hong Kong;

621
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,014
some, country bumpkins.

622
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:30,763
I'm putting them in a commercial

623
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:32,845
where they can be themselves.

624
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:34,659
I'm not mocking them at all.

625
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,926
If you're not vicious, you're cruel.

626
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:41,096
You build your happiness on
others' pain.

627
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,849
You hurt others without
benefitting yourself.

628
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,899
If you think I'm so bad,

629
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:46,809
call Mr Wong and have me replaced.

630
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,686
Don't threaten me again.

631
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,020
I'm not doing that. I'm trying to help you.

632
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,739
If you finish this commercial,

633
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:56,810
you can keep Mr Wong as your client.

634
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:58,657
You'll get a chance to move ahead.

635
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:00,809
If you don't grab this chance,

636
00:38:00,837 --> 00:38:04,046
you'll fail again, like you did before.

637
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,560
No! I won't let that happen again.

638
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:09,201
I agree you have changed.

639
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:11,373
But you're beginning to fuss
like an old lady,

640
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:12,742
just like those housewives.

641
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:15,691
You're the only one who'll never change.

642
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,248
You're still as loathsome as ever.

643
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:24,483
Take that, Hero oral solution
is a must for menopause.

644
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:26,894
Down them all. They can clean you up.

645
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:32,534
You really want the M Club?

646
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:34,843
I'll get it done.

647
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:45,051
You're getting me in trouble.

648
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:46,125
Why?

649
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,487
They are delicious!

650
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:50,972
Have some more. Don't be shy!

651
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,176
No, my husband already says I'm a hippo.

652
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:57,815
He needs to get a truck to fit me in.

653
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:00,652
Is that why you turned down the commercial?

654
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:03,130
He said I'm fat and ugly.

655
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:05,920
The commercial would only embarrass him.

656
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:09,249
No! You're not fat!

657
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:14,209
You're cute and adorable.

658
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,374
You have very nice features.

659
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:20,653
You have a better camera face
than Cherrie Chung and Maggie Cheung.

660
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:21,614
Really?

661
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:23,848
Of course! Too bad you won't do
the commercial.

662
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:26,812
I've already hired a star
makeup artist for you.

663
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:27,530
Sing?

664
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:28,809
And a luxury brand as sponsor.

665
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:29,654
Pada?

666
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,737
Top director.

667
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:34,125
Anyone will do as long as
I look good on camera.

668
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:36,534
Don't worry, you'll be reborn.

669
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:37,739
Even your husband won't recognise you.

670
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:41,456
No. He'll drive you home in a Porsche
to have a baby!

671
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:42,659
Are you sure?

672
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:45,528
Of course! Even if you're fatter than this.

673
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:52,967
When I was an air stewardess,

674
00:39:53,001 --> 00:40:00,374
men of any size, race and profession
have courted me.

675
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:03,812
But I loved my freedom too much
to pay them any attention.

676
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,890
When I finally met someone I loved,

677
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:08,252
my Mom broke us up.

678
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:11,451
That's why I'm so lonely now.

679
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:14,410
You shouldn't be,

680
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:17,202
you have your friends from the M Club.

681
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:22,173
They either talk about their husbands
or the studio,

682
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:24,255
none of which is my concern.

683
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,965
You don't know how boring that is.

684
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:29,693
That's why you don't want to
do the commercial with them?

685
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,845
Or you have no confidence in yourself?

686
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,764
Why would I have no confidence?

687
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:40,299
Though I'm not much to look at now,

688
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:43,943
with proper makeup and if I set my hair,

689
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:46,732
I'm still the looker I have always been.

690
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:49,294
When I was still ﬂying,

691
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,846
a Hollywood director wanted to
cast me in a film.

692
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:55,526
I only turned it down because
they wanted me to strip.

693
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:58,485
Rest assured, you wont have to do that
in our commercial.

694
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:00,654
Will you do it?

695
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,094
I used to be so happy. What happened?

696
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,014
How did I end up like this?

697
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:13,327
When I get up in the morning,

698
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:15,573
I don't know what I'm doing.

699
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:18,247
There's nothing I want to do.

700
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:24,818
I haven't sat down for a 3-hour meal
in a long time.

701
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:27,760
I haven't seen a movie,

702
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,532
gone on a trip...

703
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:34,527
Nothing is worth getting excited anymore.

704
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:37,326
Nothing makes me happy.

705
00:41:37,515 --> 00:41:38,892
What happened?

706
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:44,815
I'm so bored and lonely! I want to cry.

707
00:41:57,717 --> 00:42:00,482
Don't cry, you still have me.

708
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:03,304
Prince!

709
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,688
Only you understand!

710
00:42:20,029 --> 00:42:23,761
Lun said "not one less".

711
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:26,252
Where can I find him Z more?

712
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,302
What about Mimi and Fifi?

713
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:30,816
How about Auntie Fong and Auntie Leung?

714
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:32,222
They're not the M Club.

715
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:34,250
Any woman will do.

716
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:39,408
Aren't we practising?

717
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:41,331
You'll do the commercial?

718
00:42:41,388 --> 00:42:42,253
You husband gave the green light?

719
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,895
I didn't tell him. I'll surprise him.

720
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,769
Hello, everybody!

721
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:52,294
Chun-lei! You're back!

722
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:55,657
I was in no mood
because I was having my period.

723
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,487
Now that it's gone,

724
00:42:56,562 --> 00:42:58,121
I'm in the mood to dance.

725
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:01,865
Great! M Club is back!

726
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:04,572
They'll start filming in 2 days.

727
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,886
We should start practising.

728
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,249
Hold it! Now that we're doing something
for the studio,

729
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:12,453
let's use our old motto...

730
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:17,576
M Club, absolutely not one less...Go for it!

731
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,930
Don't be stupid!
