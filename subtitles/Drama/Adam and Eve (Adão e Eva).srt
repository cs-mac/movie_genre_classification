1
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:29,792
Eva.

2
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,126
What are you doing here?

3
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:33,417
Where's your mother?

4
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:12,917
Alex.

5
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,084
- Long time no see.
- Been waiting long?

6
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:24,042
No. Only ten years.

7
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,334
Let's go, I'm freezing.

8
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,584
You've done well for yourself.

9
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,167
You've made some amazing robots.

10
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:41,042
I got bored of all that
years ago.

11
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,917
Bored of designing boring robots?

12
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,417
No. Bored of designing
fun robots for boring people.

13
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:54,251
I prefer lecturing.
Students make me laugh more.

14
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,834
Are you going to Dad's house?

15
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,417
It will be a mess.

16
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,376
- You could stay with us.
- No, no. Thanks.

17
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:06,001
- Do you know why they called you?
- Yes.

18
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,751
It must be important
to bring you all this way.

19
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:11,209
Very important.

20
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,792
Damn it, Alex,
always so mysterious.

21
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,376
Come over for dinner tomorrow, okay?

22
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:01,959
And welcome home.

23
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:28,917
Check out that cat.

24
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,834
Check out that guy!

25
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,459
Good morning, Alex Garel.

26
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,876
Hello, Dorotea.
I'm here to see Julia.

27
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,667
Julia is busy right now.

28
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:47,126
You don't look a day older.
You're beautiful.

29
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:50,376
You can't go in,
she's giving a class.

30
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:54,876
Alex Garel!

31
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:59,334
You must never manipulate
your robot's character.

32
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,167
You have 30 minutes
to do the test.

33
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,251
And remember,

34
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,084
try not to alter their profiles.

35
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:12,834
Good morning, Julia.

36
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,542
Some things never change.

37
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,042
Late as always.

38
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,209
Raise the frequency.

39
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:24,876
As you can see...

40
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,042
...although the software
is much more advanced.

41
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:37,751
- What?
- The nob on the right!

42
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,959
- What now?
- Turn it down.

43
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:45,167
He's coming.

44
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,042
- I know!
- He's coming over!

45
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,917
Stupid robot, stop making noise.

46
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:59,126
"Stupid student, stop hurting me."

47
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,751
I'm sorry.

48
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,251
What do we do now?

49
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,501
What do you see
when you close your eyes?

50
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,459
Now you've broken it.

51
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:19,542
We could restart it
and reinsert its bases.

52
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:21,626
You can restart it, yes,

53
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:25,209
but you have destroyed
its emotional memory.

54
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:26,834
Its soul.

55
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,792
See? It's dead.

56
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,376
If you restart it,
it'll look like the same horse,

57
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,584
but it'll never be the same again.

58
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,459
"What do you see
when you close your eyes?"

59
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,376
That command is sacred.

60
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:43,042
It must only be used
in extreme cases

61
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,042
when there is no other option.

62
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,292
Understood?

63
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,334
So, do you want to see it?

64
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:52,834
Draw me a tree.

65
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:54,917
Come on, focus.

66
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:58,042
<i>I'm bored,
I don't want to draw any more.</i>

67
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,042
The S.I.-9,

68
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,876
just as you designed it
ten years ago.

69
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,834
All finished and assembled:

70
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:11,959
endoskeletal structure,
muscle mechanisms,

71
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:13,959
even the outer shell.

72
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:16,959
But it's missing
the most important part of all.

73
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,042
The emotional intelligence software.

74
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,042
Reproducing the emotions
of a child is foolish.

75
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:23,751
That's what you said.

76
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,584
It's only human to make mistakes.

77
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,167
The first free robot.

78
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,834
Incredible, isn't it?

79
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:49,376
Is this how you imagined it?

80
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:58,251
Why me?

81
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,542
To be honest,
you aren't the first to try.

82
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,501
But you're the only one
capable of designing a robot

83
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,626
which is fun but safe.

84
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,376
Alex, this is your chance

85
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,542
to finish what you started.

86
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,792
Yeah. But I'm not working here.

87
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,251
Where will you go?

88
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,209
My parents' house.

89
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,501
All right.

90
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:32,376
That's how emotional intelligence
affects robot behaviour.

91
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:35,917
A certain event
will affect us differently,

92
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,334
depending on our mood

93
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,292
and the circumstances
in which we find ourselves.

94
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:02,792
Are you okay?

95
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,959
Yes.

96
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,584
Nobody has been in here
since your father died.

97
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,501
Are you sure you want to stay here?

98
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,501
It's only a bit of dust.

99
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,042
You're crazy.

100
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:28,959
We'll install
all the equipment tomorrow,

101
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,251
but you must also come
and see the models.

102
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,917
We need to choose a child
to base the android on.

103
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:22,376
Alex Garel?

104
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,917
S.I.-7.
Good morning, sir.

105
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,167
I'm Max, no surname.

106
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:33,792
The university sent me to do
housework and anything else you need.

107
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,584
- I don't understand.
- Company policy.

108
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,001
To avoid all that:

109
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:41,626
"There's no need, honestly.
I don't want to trouble you".

110
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,001
They just send me.

111
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,251
Call them,
if you don't believe me.

112
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,251
No, thanks.
You can go now.

113
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,126
Level 5:

114
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,001
food...

115
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,251
plus clothes...

116
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,584
Plus...

117
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,167
Cat!

118
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,751
Luckily, it doesn't have fur.

119
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:08,292
Plus general tidy up
of random objects.

120
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,001
- They're the worst, random objects.
- But...

121
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,501
It's okay, I'm a machine,
I'm used to it.

122
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,292
If you don't mind,
I'll start now.

123
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,417
I'm a "business before pleasure"
kind of guy.

124
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,667
Come along, sir. Here.

125
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,042
This is your leisure time.

126
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,042
What do you do in your free time?

127
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,042
I work.

128
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,542
In my dictionary, "work"
and "leisure" are antonyms.

129
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:38,417
We'll have to solve that, sir.
Coffee?

130
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:42,251
A coffee and a walk
will do you good.

131
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,126
It's a beautiful day for it, sir.

132
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,459
You have many skills.

133
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:04,042
More than you think, sir.

134
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,834
I was created by David Garel's team.

135
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,292
My brother?

136
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,084
I'm designed for a multitude of tasks.

137
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,042
I'm a gourmet chef,

138
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,042
a butler,
a carer for the elderly,

139
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,751
a monitor for children...

140
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,292
I speak 29 languages.

141
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,876
I even have advanced knowledge
of DIY, plumbing, electrics...

142
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:32,501
I saw some roof tiles outside, sir,
which need replacing.

143
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,626
And don't call me "sir", Max.

144
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:37,376
Thank you, Alex.

145
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,667
- What about that walk?
- Not sure I fancy it.

146
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,459
Please.

147
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,417
It will do you good.

148
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,917
Besides, I need space to work.

149
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:55,667
Come on, Gris, let's go.
We're in the way here.

150
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,584
<i>I'll be outside.</i>

151
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:23,542
<i>If you don't eat that sweet,
I'll give you 5 more when I'm back.</i>

152
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:28,292
<i>If you don't eat that sweet,
I'll give you 5 sweets later.</i>

153
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,126
<i>But don't eat it, okay?</i>

154
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:32,959
As you can see,
we did several tests.

155
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,542
Including the incitement test.

156
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,959
- The good old sweet test.
- That's right.

157
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,167
- What do you think?
- Of what?

158
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,501
Of the kids.
You have to choose one.

159
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,417
We need a model for the robot.

160
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:49,959
These kids aren't right.

161
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:51,876
None of them.

162
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,626
They're all... boring.

163
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,417
- Boring?
Yes, boring.

164
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,209
Who'd want to live with them?

165
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:03,459
Their parents perhaps?

166
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,584
They don't count.

167
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:14,042
With an ordinary child
you'll get an ordinary robot.

168
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:17,667
Alex!

169
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:50,376
That is how emotional intelligence
works when applied to robotics.

170
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,084
The fluid logic
and genetic algorithms

171
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:56,209
allow us to design
a variable artificial brain.

172
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:57,667
What does that mean?

173
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:01,667
That of all the options available,
it always chooses the one

174
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,834
best-suited to
the individual in front of it.

175
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,417
Okay, guys,
we'll pick it up here tomorrow.

176
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:27,001
How strange!
Alex Garel in a classroom.

177
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:29,334
It's only the second time
I've seen it.

178
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,292
You see that?

179
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,792
Now they study your absurd theories.

180
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,001
I don't know why,

181
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,042
they're no use to anyone.

182
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,251
But they don't come here
to hear my stupid theories.

183
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,459
No? Then why do they come?

184
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,292
They come to see you.

185
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,042
Right.

186
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:56,584
I have a meeting.
Turn the light off on your way out.

187
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:54,584
What are you looking at?

188
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,376
I wasn't looking.

189
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:57,959
Oh, really?

190
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,501
What do you call
fixing your gaze on something?

191
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:02,084
Watching.

192
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:04,417
Then you were watching me.

193
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,584
- Do you do this often?
- What?

194
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,167
Watching kids.

195
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:10,792
Yes, I do.

196
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:14,209
Cool. A pervert
who can admit what he is.

197
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,126
- At least you're original.
- It not what you think.

198
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:20,292
I do it for... work.

199
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,834
If you make excuses
it's less original.

200
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,084
So it's part of your work?

201
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,292
Really?

202
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:30,959
You don't interest me any more.

203
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:31,876
Bye!

204
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,001
Wait!

205
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,251
Like in the movies.

206
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,084
What?

207
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:44,626
In the movies, when she walks away,
he shouts "Wait!".

208
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:47,292
She turns around,
and then he kisses her.

209
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,667
What's your name?

210
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,042
Eva.

211
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,292
Would you like a sweet?
Just one.

212
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:02,292
Just one?
You're a professional pervert.

213
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,209
- What flavour are they?
- I don't know.

214
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,751
I don't like those.

215
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,001
But I'll take both!

216
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,667
You want a sweet?

217
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,167
It's "I don't know" flavour.

218
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,876
"I don't know"
which tastes of strawberry.

219
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,501
I work at the university
and I'm making a robot.

220
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,376
If you want, and if your parents
let you, I'd love to work with you.

221
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:28,584
You really are
a very unusual pervert.

222
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,417
But I have to go home.

223
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:32,001
See you around!

224
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,042
Just in time.

225
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:31,042
Lunch is ready,
despite all this mess.

226
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,959
- How was your walk?
- Fine.

227
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,584
The technicians
from the university came.

228
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,626
They brought a complete prototype

229
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,667
and various motor areas.

230
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,542
The hand-up is already installed.

231
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:50,751
This is delicious, Max.

232
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:55,501
I also made a basket for the cat.

233
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:02,876
Oh, no.

234
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,667
No you don't.

235
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,334
You can walk all around here,

236
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:10,459
but don't you dare make a mess.

237
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:12,917
Alex,

238
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:15,667
it doesn't micturate, does it?

239
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:22,292
Alex, this cat must be faulty,

240
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,042
maybe you should repair it.

241
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:26,376
Gris is a free robot,
he does what he wants.

242
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,126
He doesn't meet
some of the safety requirements,

243
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:30,459
but he's good company.

244
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:34,042
A free robot?
I've never heard of that.

245
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,042
It's an illegal application.

246
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:41,042
Just take care of him,
and try to get along.

247
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:43,834
Hear that, my feline companion?

248
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,542
Alex is going to eat now
and then we'll let him work.

249
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:51,042
Don't be a naughty kitty.

250
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:54,126
Max, what emo level are you on?

251
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,417
Standard level eight.

252
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:59,667
We're not used to
such emotional robots.

253
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:01,334
Take it down to six.

254
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,334
Done, Mr Garel.

255
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,209
Level six.

256
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,209
You can still call me Alex.

257
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:12,917
Thank you.

258
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:53,001
CURIOUS

259
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,542
CHEERFUL

260
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:47,792
Smoke.

261
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,542
<i>Smoke.</i>

262
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:53,042
RECEPTIVE

263
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,959
<i>Smoke.</i>

264
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:19,042
Hello?

265
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:20,667
<i>Hello, calamity.</i>

266
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:21,459
Hello.

267
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,167
<i>Can you come for dinner tomorrow?</i>

268
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,042
- I've got a lot of work.
- Right...

269
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:29,167
<i>Nine o'clock.
Don't be late.</i>

270
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,417
David...

271
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,667
FEARFUL

272
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,334
<i>Alex, come up.</i>

273
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,417
Good evening.

274
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,084
Hi.

275
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,334
- How are you?
- Good.

276
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,042
Nice flowers.

277
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:43,542
Wine?

278
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,292
Of course.

279
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,917
How was Dad's house looking?

280
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,334
In a real mess.

281
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,042
I've met Max.

282
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:52,792
Congratulations.

283
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:57,292
Hi.

284
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,126
Thanks.

285
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,501
How was Australia?
Any Australian girlfriends?

286
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,876
Nothing serious.

287
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:13,917
Alex has always preferred
robots to women.

288
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,626
- Women talk too much.
- That's true.

289
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:21,459
Hi.

290
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:23,584
What's with all the smoke?

291
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:26,959
- What's for dinner?
- Soup.

292
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:31,626
Eva, this is your Uncle Alex.

293
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:33,667
Nice to meet you.

294
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,376
Let's get the soup.

295
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,667
I'm very happy for you.

296
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:54,209
We ended up designing robotic cells
to implant into patients.

297
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:56,876
- Does it work?
- It's viable.

298
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,042
That's wonderful.

299
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:02,334
And why did you leave?

300
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,001
- To work at a better place.
- Better than Santa Irene?

301
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:09,042
- I don't believe that.
- Neither do I.

302
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:13,292
How did it go with Julia?
What did she give you?

303
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:17,667
- And don't tell me it's secret.
- You know I can't speak about it.

304
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,917
Who's Julia?

305
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:22,417
Julia is a very grumpy,
very clever woman.

306
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:28,209
How about a toast?

307
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,126
- To old times.
- And to secrets.

308
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,209
Hey, do you remember Eric's robot?

309
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,876
Who's Eric?

310
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:44,626
Eric was a friend
who made a robot

311
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:47,126
to do everything for him
because he was lazy.

312
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,917
No, not peas!

313
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,334
Peas! Peas!

314
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,209
No! Not peas!

315
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,459
<i>No! Not peas!</i>

316
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,042
Is that for the S.I.-9?

317
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:32,959
Isn't that girl a bit wacky
to be the model for a robot?

318
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:36,251
Yes, I'm looking for a fun model.

319
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,501
Don't move!
It's only anti rust spray.

320
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:26,792
Pervert!

321
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,459
Man, you can sleep!

322
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,209
I've been waiting half an hour.

323
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,001
You'll break your neck one day.

324
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:37,042
My mum says that
to learn something,

325
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,334
you have to fall many times.

326
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:44,042
So, are you coming inside?

327
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,417
Or are you afraid?

328
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,667
You weren't listening.

329
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:51,834
What my mum means is that
I shouldn't be afraid of anything.

330
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,959
What are you laughing at?

331
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:13,626
Welcome.

332
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:16,167
Please, take a seat.

333
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:20,167
You'll be more comfortable.

334
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,251
Something to read?

335
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,751
That's better, isn't it?
Much better.

336
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:33,626
Get down!

337
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,167
I don't mind.

338
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:36,584
What's your name?

339
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:40,376
He's called Gris. He's a prototype,
and he doesn't talk, he just meows.

340
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,251
He's the only robot
with free function.

341
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,126
Isn't that right, Gris?

342
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,667
All right,

343
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:50,042
I'm S.I.-7, Max,
no surname to my friends.

344
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,542
A pleasure to meet you.

345
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:56,084
The pleasure is mine.

346
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,376
I'm Eva,
no surname to my friends.

347
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,292
- You want to play a game, Eva?
- Okay.

348
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,251
Surprised.

349
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:24,292
Tired.

350
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:27,626
Happy. God knows why.

351
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,667
One word only.
Define it in just one word.

352
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,292
Happy.

353
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:37,834
Furious.

354
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:41,917
Angry.

355
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:43,501
Very good.

356
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,751
Perceptive.

357
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:51,917
I'm just making it more fun.

358
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:53,876
Are you bored?

359
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,167
I don't know what this is for,
but it seems a waste of time.

360
00:37:57,334 --> 00:38:00,292
Your reactions help me to configure
the robot's emotional memory.

361
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:02,501
It's going to be one boring robot.

362
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,042
I thought you wanted to make
something different.

363
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,584
That's what I'm trying to do.

364
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:10,251
If you help me,
it will be like you.

365
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,459
It will laugh and get cross
just like you.

366
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,667
One more and we're done, okay?

367
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:22,084
Sad.

368
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,917
Are you sure?
Look carefully.

369
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:30,334
He's crying.

370
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,792
People don't always cry
because they're sad.

371
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:35,292
- What would you say?
- Happy.

372
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:38,209
- What?
- This man just won a race.

373
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:41,042
So what?
He's sad because he won.

374
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,126
Why would winning make him sad?

375
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,376
Because he knows
he can't always win.

376
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,626
In that case, when someone loses,
they should laugh,

377
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:51,626
because they know
they won't lose all their life.

378
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:57,376
Wow. The girl with all the answers
has no answer.

379
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:58,626
Yes, I do.

380
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:01,376
You're funny when you're angry.

381
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:02,667
Don't laugh at me!

382
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,667
- Open the door.
- Where are you going?

383
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:09,042
Open the door!

384
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:12,042
Doon.

385
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:17,042
If you think I'm going to
follow you, you're wrong.

386
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,501
Doon.

387
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,209
Well, well. You're back.

388
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:46,959
If you won't
come and look for me,

389
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,876
I'll have to come back
on my own.

390
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,834
But on one condition.

391
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:55,626
If you want my help,
you have to show it to me.

392
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:06,876
This is the processor.
It's the robot's brain.

393
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:09,626
A brain? It's huge.

394
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,584
Actually, it's not that big.

395
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:19,042
It's as small... as a bee.

396
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:32,751
- What are these pieces?
- They're character components.

397
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:37,667
This piece, for example,
is aggression.

398
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:39,667
And that one?

399
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:41,084
This one?

400
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,209
This one...

401
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,251
is pride.

402
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,292
It's very small to be pride.

403
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:57,501
And now we switch it on.

404
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,417
It's pretty.

405
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,042
What's happening to him?

406
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,376
He's reacting to what he sees.

407
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:17,376
Forming a memory
based on his experiences,

408
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,126
just like a human.

409
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:29,084
And this, Eva,

410
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:32,376
is how the S.I.-9 sees you.

411
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,834
Now your head.

412
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:47,334
- It's scalding me.
- No it isn't. Stop whining.

413
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,209
I went to Alex's house today.

414
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:52,917
When?

415
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:55,501
After school.

416
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,334
You said you were going
to Maria's house.

417
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:00,001
I don't see Maria any more.

418
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:03,626
I've told you
not to ride your bike out of town.

419
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:05,459
But I was careful.

420
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:09,084
I don't care if you're careful,
I don't want you to do it.

421
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:11,126
I'm sorry.

422
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,459
Promise me you won't do it again.

423
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,126
You'll get no bedtime story.

424
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:23,084
I promise.

425
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,251
Why don't you ever talk about Alex?

426
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:34,501
Because Daddy was angry when he left.

427
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:35,834
Very angry?

428
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:37,042
Yes.

429
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:39,042
And you?

430
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,459
Me too.

431
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,167
Why?

432
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:48,501
Because we were studying together,

433
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,459
we were working
on a shared project,

434
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:54,042
we were fond of each other,
and then he just left.

435
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:57,167
And that made us sad and angry.

436
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,751
Did you love him
like you love Daddy?

437
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:02,751
Yes, more or less.

438
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,459
More? Or less?

439
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:08,084
Why are you such a little gossip?

440
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,001
You look happy.

441
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:31,292
I am.

442
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:41,376
Have you come to tell me something?

443
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:46,459
What would happen if we made
a girl instead of a boy?

444
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,292
Alex,

445
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,792
I've told you,
S.I.-9 is a boy.

446
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:55,001
We just need your
emotional reaction program.

447
00:43:55,126 --> 00:43:57,042
Emotional reaction?

448
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:58,792
Look,

449
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:01,542
boys are clumsy and boring.

450
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,542
Girls are sweeter, more mature,

451
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:05,917
more sensitive...

452
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,501
and much prettier.

453
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,917
But they are also more perverse,

454
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:14,042
more jealous and twisted.

455
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:15,667
And I know all this

456
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:19,251
because, many, many years ago,

457
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:20,542
I was one.

458
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:24,001
Now get your arse back to work,

459
00:44:24,126 --> 00:44:27,626
I don't pay you to sit here
eating my biscuits.

460
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:32,501
Not that many years ago.

461
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:50,751
So you don't do research now?

462
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:53,167
You prefer lecturing?

463
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,042
I love lecturing.

464
00:44:56,917 --> 00:45:00,917
It's very different,
but I have a quieter life.

465
00:45:04,126 --> 00:45:05,542
You seem happy.

466
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:08,542
Yes, we are.

467
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:11,376
And you?

468
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:16,459
Have you found someone
to break your heart?

469
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:20,751
Alex,

470
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:24,792
Eva told me about the tests, and...

471
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:29,292
I'd rather you didn't do them
with her.

472
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:31,917
I just want her to do
what little girls do,

473
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,917
so if you don't mind...

474
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:36,501
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

475
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:37,876
No...

476
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:40,042
- She's just so special.
- Yes.

477
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,042
She is.

478
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,084
But what did you expect?
She's my daughter.

479
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,417
Well...

480
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,001
I'll see you around.

481
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:57,501
Good luck.

482
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,042
Thanks.

483
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:57,917
You must be happy.

484
00:46:58,376 --> 00:47:01,251
You had them begging you
to come back.

485
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,334
You know I was never
the boastful one.

486
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:06,834
Or the nice one.

487
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,501
But you were the clever one.

488
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,292
We're both very clever.

489
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:13,792
I disagree.

490
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:18,417
I am extremely talented.

491
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,251
- And modest.
- But you...

492
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,126
are one in a million.

493
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:26,084
I suppose that's why
I'm the handsome one.

494
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:28,334
You were very handsome, yes.

495
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:32,376
Guess who I saw the other day.

496
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:36,667
Gloria.

497
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:40,917
Why didn't you ask her out?
There's a party next week.

498
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:44,001
- I think she never got over you.
- We were twelve.

499
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:47,209
You know what they say
about your first love.

500
00:47:47,376 --> 00:47:48,834
You never forget it.

501
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,126
Yeah.

502
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:04,667
Morning!

503
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,584
I thought you would dodge it.

504
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:10,626
Eva, we can't do this.

505
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:13,209
Your parents don't want you
to come here.

506
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:19,667
So what?

507
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:22,917
I want to, and you need me.

508
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:24,376
There are other kids.

509
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:25,917
But not like me.

510
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:28,876
With an ordinary kid,
you'll get an ordinary robot.

511
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:30,626
Come on, open the door.

512
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:48,042
Eva, come down.

513
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:53,501
Okay, fine. Just forget it.

514
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:54,876
What a shame.

515
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:58,667
I wanted to tell you
the story of David and Mum.

516
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:06,334
What story?

517
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:08,126
Open the door first.

518
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:13,209
All right.

519
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:16,417
We'll do unofficial tests.
You just have fun

520
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,542
and I'll observe you. Okay?

521
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:20,542
Okay, pervert.

522
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:27,584
Eva, Eva, slow down.

523
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:30,042
Come on, slowcoach.

524
00:49:34,584 --> 00:49:35,834
Go on, try it.

525
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:38,042
- What?
- This.

526
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:40,167
Turn around.

527
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:43,459
I'll get stuck.

528
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:44,751
No, no, no.

529
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:47,667
Okay.

530
00:49:57,126 --> 00:49:58,042
- Like this.
- What?

531
00:49:58,209 --> 00:49:59,292
Do this.

532
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:01,667
No, don't move your bum.
Like this,

533
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:02,876
like this.

534
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,584
Don't fall.

535
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:14,167
Pen.

536
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:16,334
Writing.

537
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:18,334
Story.

538
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:21,209
Mum.

539
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:22,667
Woman.

540
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:23,501
Pretty.

541
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,001
Garden.

542
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:28,876
Ground!

543
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:30,251
Ground.

544
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:32,917
Strong.

545
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:35,042
Stone.

546
00:50:35,376 --> 00:50:36,459
Grey.

547
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:38,042
Cat.

548
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:39,334
Robot.

549
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:40,751
Free.

550
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:41,959
Happy.

551
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:50,626
You haven't fallen enough.

552
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:52,501
What?

553
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:55,501
When Mum sees someone
who can't climb, she says:

554
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:57,167
"They haven't fallen enough."

555
00:50:57,417 --> 00:50:58,501
She says that?

556
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,917
You wouldn't like her
to say it about you.

557
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:03,209
Listen.
Between your mother and I...

558
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:04,459
There's nothing.

559
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:07,417
She's a wonderful person,
and very pretty,

560
00:51:07,626 --> 00:51:09,417
but we split up years ago.

561
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:12,834
And although my expression changes
whenever I hear her name,

562
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:16,667
it's only the memory
of good times we spent together.

563
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:18,917
What are you saying?

564
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:20,959
Nothing.

565
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:23,667
It's what you'd say
if we were in a movie.

566
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,001
Clumsy idiot!

567
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,876
It's the town. Now what?

568
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:46,584
See that house there?

569
00:51:47,334 --> 00:51:47,959
Which one?

570
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:50,542
- There are lots.
- It doesn't matter.

571
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,626
That's my house.

572
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:56,126
You brought me up here
to tell me that?

573
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:59,917
And also to tell you that
that house over there,

574
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,501
on the way to the university...

575
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:05,167
That's David's house.

576
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:08,001
You don't live together.

577
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:12,292
And?

578
00:52:12,459 --> 00:52:14,751
Don't tell me
you're not pleased to hear it.

579
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:17,834
Come on,
we have more tests to do.

580
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:20,917
- A deal is a deal.
- You're going to kill me.

581
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,209
<i>Who's that?</i>

582
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,751
It's Eva.

583
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:54,751
<i>How old is she?</i>

584
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:56,042
Ten.

585
00:52:58,667 --> 00:52:59,959
She seems nice.

586
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:02,501
<i>Is she your daughter?</i>

587
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:05,626
No.

588
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,667
<i>She looks a lot like you.</i>

589
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:38,084
You won't beat me!

590
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:40,126
That's what you think.

591
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,292
My turn.

592
00:53:56,626 --> 00:53:57,376
Hello.

593
00:53:58,667 --> 00:53:59,292
Hello.

594
00:54:00,084 --> 00:54:02,584
What are you doing here?
Did you come to see us?

595
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,751
Yes, I came to see
if you were home,

596
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:05,959
but it's late now.

597
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:07,376
Come inside for a drink.

598
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:09,334
No, no, thanks.
I have to go.

599
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:11,167
Right. Your secret projects.

600
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,626
Will you come
to the graduation party?

601
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,792
- I don't know...
- Yes, come.

602
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:18,459
Everyone wants to see you.

603
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:21,084
Okay, we'll see.

604
00:54:34,584 --> 00:54:35,584
Hello!

605
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:38,751
How's my little girl?

606
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:40,209
Hello, David.

607
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:44,042
Hello, love.

608
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:46,042
- How are you?
- What's going on?

609
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,334
We're playing sleds.

610
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:50,501
- Let's push Daddy off.
- You want to push Daddy?

611
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:58,667
<i>Worried.</i>

612
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:05,042
<i>Funny.</i>

613
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:09,542
QUICK

614
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:14,959
<i>Hungry.</i>

615
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:16,001
<i>No.</i>

616
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,084
<i>Sweet-toothed.</i>

617
00:55:18,126 --> 00:55:19,042
Perfect.

618
00:55:22,959 --> 00:55:25,042
PERFECTIONIST

619
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:28,251
<i>Bored.</i>

620
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:31,667
Are you sure?

621
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:34,001
<i>Yes.</i>

622
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,792
This woman is tired.

623
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,042
We also yawn when we're tired.

624
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:46,251
<i>She's bored
and that's making her tired.</i>

625
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:49,626
Sure, just like tiredness
makes you bored.

626
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,334
That works for everything.

627
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:53,751
CREATIVE

628
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:56,792
<i>Don't laugh.</i>

629
00:55:58,542 --> 00:55:59,667
Why not?

630
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:01,667
<i>Because.</i>

631
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,167
<i>Don't laugh.</i>

632
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:07,584
I'm laughing because you're funny.

633
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:09,167
<i>I'm not funny!</i>

634
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:11,042
Sit down.

635
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:11,917
<i>No.</i>

636
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:12,959
Sit down!

637
00:56:13,084 --> 00:56:14,959
<i>- Sit down!</i>
- I don't want to!

638
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:15,959
What are you doing?

639
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:18,959
- I told you to sit down.
<i>- No!</i>

640
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,292
What are you doing?

641
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:21,084
<i>I'm leaving!</i>

642
00:56:21,251 --> 00:56:23,001
- Where?
<i>- I'm leaving!</i>

643
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:24,042
You can't leave.

644
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:26,376
<i>- Why not?</i>
- The door is locked.

645
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:27,834
- Open it!
- No.

646
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,376
<i>I said open it!</i>

647
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:31,376
I'm ordering you to sit down.

648
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,667
<i>- I told you to open the door!</i>
- No.

649
00:56:34,876 --> 00:56:36,542
<i>- Open it now!</i>
- No!

650
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:38,001
Yes!

651
00:56:42,917 --> 00:56:45,334
What do you see
when you close your eyes?

652
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:06,001
What happened?

653
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:08,584
Not now, Max.

654
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,792
- Mr Garel.
- Hello.

655
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,292
Hello, Mr Garel.

656
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:51,959
- How are you?
- Fine.

657
00:57:52,084 --> 00:57:54,167
- You remember Manuel?
- Yes.

658
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:55,209
Hello, Alex.

659
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:57,834
Julia tells me
you're working at home.

660
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,001
You should work here,
at the university.

661
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,876
- Leave it.
- Really.

662
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:20,042
Who are you hiding from?

663
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:21,292
Nobody.

664
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,292
Here's to your bright future.

665
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:32,834
Look at this. Drinking already.

666
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,959
Hello, Alex.
Are you boring my wife?

667
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,126
I'm working on it.

668
00:58:39,084 --> 00:58:41,001
How's the prototype going?

669
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:42,292
Who wants to dance?

670
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:46,251
Alex doesn't dance. Right?

671
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:53,209
Thanks.

672
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:52,834
May I?

673
00:59:53,834 --> 00:59:54,917
Of course.

674
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:05,876
Have you been practising?

675
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:07,792
No.

676
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:11,501
You dance much better.

677
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:34,001
Where did David go?

678
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,751
Will you help me find him?

679
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,042
It's so cold.

680
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:21,376
And to think I missed this place.

681
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:24,542
But you also hated it here.

682
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:31,876
Are you going to stay?

683
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:35,126
When you finish the project.

684
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:37,417
Will you stay?

685
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,376
I might not finish it.

686
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:43,667
Well, you should.

687
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:45,501
For once.

688
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,042
Or haven't you changed?

689
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,792
I think I've changed.

690
01:02:56,334 --> 01:02:57,334
Right.

691
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:01,917
You haven't forgiven me?

692
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:05,542
No.

693
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:09,126
It was ten years ago.

694
01:03:09,501 --> 01:03:11,459
Ten years is nothing.

695
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:14,126
I'd need another ten.

696
01:03:27,126 --> 01:03:28,251
I can't. Alex, no.

697
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:29,584
I can't.

698
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:42,917
Lana!

699
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:14,959
What do you want?

700
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,626
What else do you want?

701
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:24,376
You left her once already.

702
01:04:28,084 --> 01:04:29,126
Go away.

703
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:54,917
Do you need something?

704
01:04:57,917 --> 01:04:59,001
Yes.

705
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:03,376
Turn your emo level
back up to 8.

706
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:12,042
Alex,

707
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:14,126
what's the matter?

708
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:19,834
It's nothing, Max.

709
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:21,584
But thanks.

710
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:31,917
Well, well...

711
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:35,001
Who hit you? The S.I.-9?

712
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:39,542
No.

713
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:45,001
I'm not going to finish the S.I.-9.

714
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:57,126
Leaving the job half done again?

715
01:06:58,126 --> 01:06:59,376
Alex,

716
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:02,084
you're a great creator,
maybe the best.

717
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,792
But if you don't finish
your projects,

718
01:07:05,001 --> 01:07:07,376
it doesn't matter
how good you are...

719
01:07:08,376 --> 01:07:10,792
Take a break for a few days

720
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:14,084
and then we'll talk.

721
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:17,876
It's because of her, right?

722
01:07:52,584 --> 01:07:53,959
What are you looking at?

723
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:55,959
Are your parents home?

724
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,667
Sad.

725
01:08:10,334 --> 01:08:11,167
What?

726
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:13,376
You have a sad face.

727
01:08:19,584 --> 01:08:21,834
Why did you lie to me, Eva?

728
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:25,917
Why did you say that David
didn't live with you?

729
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,959
That was what you wanted to hear.

730
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:34,042
Eva, I'm leaving.

731
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:38,292
You can't.

732
01:08:38,876 --> 01:08:40,876
You can't leave now,

733
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:44,084
now that I've finally found you.

734
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,501
It's not fair.

735
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,167
Alex...

736
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:40,917
I'm very sorry about what happened.

737
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:48,542
Eva tells me you're leaving.

738
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:57,792
Do you want me to go?

739
01:10:26,376 --> 01:10:28,876
Alex, I need to tell you something.

740
01:10:56,959 --> 01:10:59,667
"Eva is a very special little girl."

741
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:07,084
She is like us both
because we made her.

742
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:20,376
Eva!

743
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,042
Eva!

744
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,126
Eva!

745
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:32,917
Wait, I'll go with you.

746
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:35,876
No. I have to tell her myself.

747
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:37,959
Will you come back?

748
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:40,751
Of course.

749
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:48,251
Eva!

750
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:16,876
Eva!

751
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:29,376
My God.

752
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,292
No.

753
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:17,792
Eva.

754
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:46,334
Mummy, what happened to me?

755
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:49,042
Nothing, sweetie.
Everything is okay.

756
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:54,501
Mummy, it's not okay.
What's this?

757
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:57,626
Take it easy,
or you'll faint again.

758
01:14:58,501 --> 01:14:59,501
Please.

759
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:01,459
- Everything's fine now.
- Don't touch me.

760
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:03,376
I should have told you before.

761
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:05,584
- Let's go home.
- Don't touch me.

762
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,959
I don't want to.

763
01:15:07,126 --> 01:15:09,001
- What am I?
- You're my little girl.

764
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:50,501
Eva.

765
01:15:51,126 --> 01:15:52,292
What are you doing here?

766
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:53,834
Where's your mother?

767
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:11,834
Hello?

768
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:15,542
Yes, David.
Eva is here.

769
01:16:19,209 --> 01:16:20,251
What?

770
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:10,209
Eva...

771
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:12,917
Did something bad happen?

772
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:16,584
Alex is very upset.

773
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:19,209
How can I help you?

774
01:18:25,959 --> 01:18:27,667
I pushed her.

775
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:34,209
I pushed her.

776
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:38,626
It's all right.

777
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,251
I pushed her.

778
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:46,459
Everything will be okay.

779
01:18:46,626 --> 01:18:47,834
I pushed her.

780
01:18:48,751 --> 01:18:50,001
I pushed her.

781
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,792
I pushed her.

782
01:18:53,209 --> 01:18:55,459
I pushed her.

783
01:20:12,209 --> 01:20:14,959
You know that Lana
was as good as you.

784
01:20:15,084 --> 01:20:18,667
She finished the project
after you left.

785
01:20:18,876 --> 01:20:21,542
Lana was the first
to design the S.I.-9.

786
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:26,042
Eva, as you know her.
When we tested her,

787
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:28,501
she didn't pass the safety control.

788
01:20:29,459 --> 01:20:33,792
But Lana wanted to keep her,
she gave up everything for her.

789
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:36,542
And I let her.

790
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,209
That was a mistake.

791
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:44,167
Alex,

792
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:47,042
we have to destroy her.

793
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:48,917
She's a little girl.

794
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:50,126
No, she's not.

795
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:51,417
I know what she is.

796
01:20:51,584 --> 01:20:53,001
She killed Lana.

797
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:03,001
Julia, let me do it.

798
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:06,042
No. It's my responsibility.

799
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:07,334
Julia!

800
01:21:14,376 --> 01:21:15,792
I'll do it.

801
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:36,876
Hello, princess.

802
01:21:41,876 --> 01:21:43,542
It's very early.

803
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:48,917
Can we go skating?

804
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:51,334
I'm sure I won't fall today.

805
01:21:51,501 --> 01:21:52,501
All right.

806
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:02,501
Try it!

807
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:03,751
Look, Eva!

808
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,334
No, not like that!

809
01:22:27,501 --> 01:22:28,584
Like this!

810
01:23:23,251 --> 01:23:26,417
Alex, come and join us!

811
01:23:50,126 --> 01:23:53,626
Beautiful, isn't it?
Mum brought me here first.

812
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:56,667
When the sun went down
it got really cold,

813
01:23:57,084 --> 01:24:00,876
but I didn't want to leave
until all the lights came on.

814
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:04,501
It's beautiful, Eva.

815
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:07,834
I'd never seen it like this.

816
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:10,542
Alex,

817
01:24:10,834 --> 01:24:13,459
you have to promise to help me.

818
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,251
I don't want to be bad again.

819
01:24:18,917 --> 01:24:21,126
I want to be a good girl.

820
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:27,251
Dinner is ready.

821
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:44,084
Alex, after dinner,
I'd like you to read to me,

822
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:47,251
a book which Mummy
read to me every night.

823
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:55,959
It's called
"One Thousand and One Nights"

824
01:26:56,209 --> 01:26:58,542
and it's about a princess

825
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:02,667
and a prince who must kill her
before she falls asleep.

826
01:27:03,459 --> 01:27:06,042
But every night,

827
01:27:06,584 --> 01:27:08,501
she tells him a beautiful story

828
01:27:08,667 --> 01:27:10,667
which never ends.

829
01:27:11,334 --> 01:27:13,001
He can't kill her

830
01:27:14,584 --> 01:27:17,209
because he wants to hear more.

831
01:27:18,126 --> 01:27:20,626
And so it goes on like that,

832
01:27:20,876 --> 01:27:23,042
night after night...

833
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:27,334
Until the prince decides
to pardon the princess

834
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:31,584
so she can continue
telling him those stories

835
01:27:32,834 --> 01:27:34,417
forever.

836
01:27:39,376 --> 01:27:40,667
Alex,

837
01:27:42,417 --> 01:27:44,792
you're not going to fix me, are you?

838
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:04,251
Eva...

839
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:13,959
What do you see
when you close your eyes?

840
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:56,417
<i>She is like us both
because we made her.</i>

841
01:28:57,126 --> 01:29:00,084
<i>Just one?
You're a professional pervert.</i>

842
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:08,667
<i>Do this.</i>

843
01:29:09,334 --> 01:29:11,834
<i>No, don't move your bum.
Like this.</i>

844
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:14,459
<i>Why are you such a little gossip?</i>

845
01:29:15,876 --> 01:29:19,001
<i>We were studying together,
we were working on a shared project,</i>

846
01:29:19,126 --> 01:29:22,001
<i>we were fond of each other,
and then he just left.</i>

847
01:29:27,376 --> 01:29:29,834
<i>What do you see
when you close your eyes?</i>

848
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,292
<i>I see light.</i>

849
01:29:35,459 --> 01:29:36,876
<i>Lots of light.</i>

850
01:29:38,209 --> 01:29:40,334
<i>I see you, Daddy</i>

851
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,626
<i>and I see Mummy,</i>

852
01:29:46,167 --> 01:29:48,167
<i>and me, all of us together,</i>

853
01:29:49,876 --> 01:29:51,876
<i>playing forever.</i>
