Thanks.

What do you want with $5,000?

782
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:34,452
I want to go into business.

783
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:36,576
KATE: You're a little young for that,
aren't you?

784
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,729
I'm old enough.

785
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,654
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.

786
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:43,814
- What business do you wanna go into?
- Beans.

787
00:54:46,808 --> 00:54:49,459
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

788
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:52,054
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

789
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:54,813
- If we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

790
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:56,936
- Will Hamilton says that--
- Will?

791

You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

792

You see...

793
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:05,896
my father, he lost about all he had in--

794
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:08,858
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

795
00:55:10,448 --> 00:55:13,418
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

796
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:17,371
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

797
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:18,370
CAL: Yeah.

You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

804

Why? I didn't do anything to you.

805
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:59,415
It's a good business venture.

806
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:04,979
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

you think I ought to be run out of town.

810
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:22,093
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

811
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:28,056
This $5,000, now.

812
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:30,859
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

813
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:32,612
CAL: I never thought about that.

814

KATE: It's not.

00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:46,616
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

818
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,495
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

819
00:56:49,808 --> 00:56:51,890
Father thinks you're in the East...

820
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:54,977
and Aron thinks you're dead.

821
00:56:56,008 --> 00:56:59,808
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

822

We don't exactly move in the same circles.

KATE: Did what?

00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:18,854
Shot my father?

827
00:57:19,688 --> 00:57:22,055
Did he tell you that?

828
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:27,578
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

829
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:30,857
CAL: Ran away and did all that stuff?
KATE: None of your business.

830
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,455
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

831
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,894
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

832
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:40,130
I just wanted him to let me go.

833
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:44,136
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

834
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:47,014
He wanted to tie me down.

835
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,614
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

836
00:57:49,688 --> 00:57:51,850
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

837
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:54,056
Nobody holds me.

838
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,497
- But he loved you.
- Love.

839
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:00,017
He wanted to own me.

840
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:03,134
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

841
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:06,769
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do.

Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me.

any more than I do.

Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want.

852
00:58:42,488 --> 00:58:45,458
I got the toughest house on the coast...

853
00:58:45,528 --> 00:58:47,769
and the finest clientele.

and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

857
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:01,017
And I built it up from nothing.

858
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:04,336
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

859
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:07,139
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

860

You know, that's funny.

00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:12,379
I don't think he'll know where I got it.

862
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,735
No, but it's funny just the same.

863
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:16,933
Your father.

864
00:59:17,648 --> 00:59:19,935
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

865
00:59:21,048 --> 00:59:24,291
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

866
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:28,091
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

867
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:30,330
to save him his purity.

868
00:59:31,128 --> 00:59:34,450
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

You give this to him.
