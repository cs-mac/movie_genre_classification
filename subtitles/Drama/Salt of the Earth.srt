1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,740
The International Union
Miners ...

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,460
... and Workers
Metal presents:

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,140
SALT OF THE EARTH

4
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,340
The scene is
New Mexico, ...

5
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,980
... the land of the
Free US ...

6
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,180
... which inspired
this film ...

7
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,140
... and the home of the brave
they performed ...

8
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,300
... most of the papers.

9
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,940
How shall I begin my story 

10
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,060
that has no beginning

11
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,180
My grandfather raised cattle
in these streams ...

12
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,580
... before they got
Anglos.

13
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,260
our roots
go deep in this place

14
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,180
... deeper than
the pines ...

15
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,780
... or mine.

16
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,940
This is my town.

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,660
When I was small,
was called San Marcos.

18
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,540
Anglos put him
Zinctown.

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Zinctown, New Mexico, ...

20
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,940
... United States.

21
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,540
This is our home.

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,660
The house is not ours ...

23
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,380
... but flowers
yes they are.

24
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,380
My name
Esperanza Quintero.

25
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,460
I am the wife of a miner.

26
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,380
My husband has spent
18 years at this mine.

27
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,180
Half life in darkness,
with dynamite.

28
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,780
The land where
Mine is ...

29
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,260
... Grandpa belonged
my husband.

30
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,660
Now belongs
to the Company.

31
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,860
Who can say
when my story began?

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,100
Yo no lo sé.

33
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,780
But I remember that day
as the beginning of the end.

34
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,620
It was the day of my holy.

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,860
Moreover, met 35 years ...

36
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,140
... a day of celebration.

37
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,860
She was pregnant
7 months of my third child.

38
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,460
I remember that day
I made a wish.

39
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,180
It was a sin,
one evil.

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,860
I prayed to the Virgin to ask
forgiveness for my thoughts.

41
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,260
I wanted ...

42
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,380
... my son did not come ...

43
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,780
... to this world.

44
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,380
Are you ill, mother?

45
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,700
Are you sad?

46
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,540
Are we going to church
to confess?

47
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,780
Later, when
end boards.

48
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,780
Did you come back to fight
with Anglo children?

49
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,260
- They think very hard.
- Promised not to fight anymore.

50
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,180
Dad says do not let
make fun of me.

51
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,780
Ignore him.
¡Be still!

52
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,420
Does it hurt?

53
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,980
- And that cake?
- Forget the cake.

54
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,100
Go find your father
When your turn ends.

55
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,540
Tell him to come home
directly.

56
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,100
I have been told that you had
problems with a detonator.

57
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,460
You're alive, what
is the problem?

58
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,340
Ya know, this new standard
to work alone.

59
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,940
Let's see the supervisor.

60
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,380
It is negotiating
with your committee.

61
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,900
- All the better.
- Wait.

62
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,380
He dictated that standard,
It will not help.

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,260
Well, I'll stop boring.

64
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,380
With your contract?
Have someone read it to you.

65
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,020
He said nothing of helpers.

66
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,380
This mine is
bloodstained.

67
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,100
The blood of my friends
working alone

68
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,580
They were crushed because
anyone watched the detonator.

69
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,780
Nobody sounded
alarm.

70
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,820
That is the task
shift foreman.

71
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,540
He wants to extract mineral.

72
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,020
We want
everyone out alive.

73
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,940
You will work only.

74
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,500
If you work overflows,
I'll find another.

75
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,020
To a squirrel?

76
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,780
At an American.

77
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
Do not say anything on the cake.

78
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,780
Will strike?

79
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,180
I do not want to worry, but
in the shop told me ...

80
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,140
... that if we do not pay another
within the radio, ...

81
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,140
... will they take.

82
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,180
Only owe a month.

83
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,780
I tried to convince them.
That's not right.

84
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,380
Is not it good?

85
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,860
And is it OK to buy
this artifact?

86
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,780
But you wanted.

87
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,860
You had to listen
radio.

88
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,660
I hear at night ...

89
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,860
... when you are you
in the bar.

90
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,060
"No entry
in easy installments. "

91
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,460
Diré you something:

92
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,780
Deadlines are the curse
of workers.

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,980
- Where are you going?
- A talk with peers.

94
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,220
The water is cold again.

95
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,940
- Sorry, the fire was extinguished.
- Forget it.

96
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,460
They forget!

97
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,300
Short firewood five times
day, I can not forget.

98
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,340
Do not forget that miners
Anglos have running water ...

99
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,980
... and toilets at home.

100
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,100
Do you think I like
live like this?

101
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,060
What can I do?

102
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,180


103
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,700
... ask for better conditions ...

104
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,100
... would have to demand
decent plumbing.

105
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,100
We did, but we
to resign.

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,060
- What?
- All at once can not be.

107
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,100
Now we requirements
most important.

108
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,620
What's most important
that healing?

109
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,380
Safety at work
is more important.

110
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,020
This week has been
five accidents ...

111
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,780
... to increase
production.

112
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,940
You are a woman and do not know
anything in the world.

113
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,100
First we have to get
equality at work.

114
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,940
Then we will
the rest.

115
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,180
- That's a guy thing.
- I understand.

116
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,500
Men do strike
by your demands ...

117
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,100
... but you leave for later
what we women.

118
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,580
Do not start again
to criticize the union.

119
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,780
What have you done for me
your union?

120
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,380
Remember what it was like
before the union, ...

121
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,860
... when Estela sick and
we could pay the doctor?

122
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,180
We founded the union
for our families.

123
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,180
Okay, you will have
your strike.

124
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,260
I'll have my son.

125
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,780
The hospital will not admit me
being the wife of a striker.

126
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,980
Store fail to rely
and children will go hungry.

127
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,540
We can not pay
deadlines ...

128
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,700
... and the radio will be.

129
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,620
What all you care
is this radio?

130
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,980
Just think of yourself.

131
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,060
I do ...

132
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,620
... because you never
think of me.

133
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,380
Never.

134
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,820
Basta!

135
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,860
We are seeing
children.

136
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,540
Be resolved
the problem.

137
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,620
The company always
says the same.

138
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,140
For a miner, is
dangerous work alone.

139
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,500
Nobody works alone
in other mines.

140
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,740
Anglos work
in pairs.

141
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,020
And I have to risk
life because I'm Mexican?

142
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,380
- We have already asked.
- We are negotiating.

143
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,500
We have not achieved anything in
three months of negotiations.

144
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,980
Even with the help of
Barnes, International.

145
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,620
Ni increases,
nor old ...

146
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
... nor safety.

147
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,820
Have a drink.

148
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,460
We must act now.

149
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,100
Do others think
like you?

150
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,980
Speak for everyone.

151
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,140
What if employers
want to strike?

152
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,220
Do not want, and less
contract with the Army.

153
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,700
then
Why refuse?

154
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,540
They have agreed with other
sections of the union.

155
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,940
But here most
We are Mexicans.

156
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,220
We want equality with
Anglo miners.

157
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,300
The same pay,
the same conditions.

158
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,700
Exactly, but employers
do not want this equality.

159
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,540
His only argument against
the Anglo sections is:

160
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,580
"We give more than
the Mexicans ".

161
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,140
So what? discrimination
Anglo hurts ...

162
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,100
... but me.

163
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,100
And I'm sick.

164
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,060
If you declare strike
when they want, ...

165
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,780
... will crush the union.

166
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,780
Wait till you can win.

167
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
Employers do not expect.

168
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,940
No running water,
my children sick.

169
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,740
The doctor did not expect.

170
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,020
Cobra cash.

171
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,540
We must within
the radio.

172
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,020
The store does not hold:
"Pay or we get along."

173
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,580
Why such a hurry
Shop employers?

174
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,700
They want to scare us
so that we do not protest.

175
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,300
Want us to conform
with what we have.

176
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,100
But I am not satisfied,
I'm not afraid.

177
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,580
I'm sick.

178
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,620
What are you doing here?

179
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,900
- Is something wrong with your mother?
- Have you forgotten?

180
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,860
- Forget what?
- Today is the holy mother.

181
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,220
He's a great guy,
It is in everything.

182
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,460
Today is the holy
my wife.

183
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,500
I would like to ask you
viniérais to haunt.

184
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,380
- At this hour?
- The later the better.

185
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,460
Why sing?

186
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,700
Sing to me.

187
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,260
Can we turn
candles?

188
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,860
We can now turn them on.

189
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,380
Happy Birthday!

190
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,980
He never wanted to mourn.

191
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,180
Why do I cry,
if I'm happy?

192
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,980
I'm an idiot.

193
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,060
No, you're not.

194
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,020
Was very expensive beer?

195
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,060
I invited Antonio.

196
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Forgive me for saying
ever think of me.

197
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,260
I'd forgotten.

198
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,780
Luis reminded me.

199
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,780
I spent a week thinking that round

200
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,860
Never had such a nice holiday

201
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,260
It was a song that filled my being ...

202
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,700
and mitigated the harshness of everyday work

203
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,940
One, two three.

204
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,620
forget all our problems ...

205
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,340
... even Ramón

206
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,020
That night I could not dance ...

207
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,100
... because of my state ...

208
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,460
... but I was jealous when he danced with the other

209
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,260
It was wonderful to see you smile again

210
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,020
one morning, was hanging laundry

211
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,180
We were chatting
when they arrived ladies.

212
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,540
Formed a kind of delegation

213
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,580
They spoke of health facilities

214
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,340
Anglo miners had
sinks with hot water

215
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,220
Why not us?

216
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,700
I know, talk about it
Ramon

217
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,540
... just a week ago

218
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,700
He says the union it has
removed from their demands

219
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,940
We need to raise awareness
men about this.

220
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,980
Teach the banner

221
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,780
"We want health,
non-discrimination. "

222
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,340
We and many more
take you to the mine

223
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,020
While it is trading at the office ...

224
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,980
Arrive in groups to take the site

225
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,100
Both parties see that
we mean

226
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,700
- A squad of Women?
- Why not?

227
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,460
count me in

228
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,700
We should form a union
of woodcutters

229
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,620
We cut wood for breakfast,
to wash their clothes ...

230
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,380
... for washing for laundry,
to make dinner ...

231
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,700
... and when you come home
night, says:

232
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,620
Have you spent the day
reading comics?

233
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,620
Come on, Esperanza
we have to

234
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,860
I can not.

235
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,660
If Ramon found out of
I'm in a pinch ...

236
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,380
Do you fitting?

237
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,100
It is Mr. Kalinski

238
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,780
Hurry.

239
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,620
Carefully.

240
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,700
I want to see!

241
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,460
- I want to see him now!
- He'll be fine, Mrs. Kalinski.!

242
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,780
I want to see him now!

243
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,180
How did this happen?

244
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,540
He entered the gallery
they were dynamiting

245
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,620
I warned, this occurs
because we work alone.

246
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,340
- Why did not they tell you?
- I had to do the foreman

247
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,700
When I looked there was no

248
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,300
It would be sleeping.

249
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,540
Not come down to the well, Kalinski
I saw you at the office

250
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,700
Pancho lie.

251
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,740
You're a dirty ...

252
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,340
Enough!

253
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,100
Do not lose control.

254
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,700
There is a wounded man.

255
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,180
I'm sorry too, you know?

256
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,660
Accidents hurt us all

257
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
But the company

258
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,100
No reason to stand
like party

259
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,500
Back to work.

260
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,100
The party is over,
all to work.

261
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,020
What do they say?

262
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,460
Not "know".

263
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,780
Barnes, tell your men
back to work

264
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,260
No work for me,
I work for them.

265
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,180
Luis.

266
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,020
What you decide, comrades?

267
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,180
"We want health,
non-discrimination. "

268
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,460
That night, there was a
union meeting ...

269
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,020
... to give official appearance

270
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,860
Did not take long.

271
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,980
The strike was approved
by 93 votes to 5.

272
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,220
Teresa said it was
the time to introduce.

273
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,500
I did not want.

274
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,260
Never been in a
union meeting.

275
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,100
But others said:
"If you are one, we all."

276
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,460
When we arrived, the meeting
I was about to end

277
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,260
Charlie Vidal outlined the situation.

278
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,580
Said the strike
had one goal.

279
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,340
Equality.

280
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
But employers do anything ...

281
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,740
... to avoid them to get equality.

282
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,940
Try to divide workers ...

283
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,380
... between Anglos and Mexican-Americans.

284
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,580
Who sold it to his brother
would be rewarded.

285
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,580
Women ye
make a statement ...

286
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,260
It is not a statement

287
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,580
- Women want ...
- Higher!

288
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,340
Consuelo, speaking from the podium

289
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,380
Women have spoken
sanitary facilities.

290
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,580
If you want to achieve equality ...

291
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,540
... as you say, ...

292
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,260
... you should ask
the same equality ...

293
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,380
... sanitary facilities

294
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,940
Reivindicadlo also
the strike.

295
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,100
We have also thought ...

296
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,340
... we could create a
female auxiliary section.

297
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,420
We want to help in any way possible.

298
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,420
I think I speak on behalf
of my colleagues ...

299
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,300
... to thank the women
offering us their help, ...

300
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,740
but it's late and I suggest postponing the issue.

301
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,340
The board will accept a
motion to adjourn.

302
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,220
- I presented it.
- The seconded.

303
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,100
Who is in favor?

304
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,500
Who is against?

305
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,020
Approved.

306
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,100
You need to plan

307
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,420
Why did not you defended?
You are worse than others.

308
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,820
Teresa, can not be forced
Therefore the situation.

309
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,100
Ye you force us to accept
unfair conditions.

310
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,580
Why not consult me?
It was embarrassing!

311
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,020
At least you did not ridicule
as Consuelo.

312
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,780
It's not a bad idea;
should demand better health.

313
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,260
- But honey ...!
- Put a notice on the door ...

314
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,380
"No dogs allowed
or women. "

315
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,020
"We want equality
with other miners. "

316
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,780
"We are guided by the union."
"Less talk and more money."

317
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,980
So it all started,
and other strikes.

318
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,780
The company said
not negotiate ...

319
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,500
... until the workers
back to work.

320
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,380
But the ploy
will not work for them.

321
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,900
They hired strikebreakers
of other peoples.

322
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,060
But his mind was cooled ...

323
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,100
... when they saw the size of the picket.

324
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,260
The sheriff and his men
They were always there ...

325
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,660
... wearing their weapons.

326
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,820
But men just marched ...

327
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,660
... day after day ...

328
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,700
... week after week.

329
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,940
At first, women
we stayed at home.

330
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,940
The union brought food
We tried and we ...

331
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,540
... feed our families.

332
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,500
One morning mrs. Salazar
He went to the picket line.

333
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,500
Her husband had died in a
strike for many years.

334
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,740
She wanted to be there.

335
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,980
No one remembers how it happened.

336
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,420
One day Mrs. Salazar
he joined the march.

337
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,100
And it was not separated from them.

338
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,420
Several women began
bring coffee to their husbands ...

339
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,580
... and tacos, because
Men have just ...

340
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,580
... tired and hungry
acting on picket.

341
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,780
It was then that
the union decided ...

342
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,260
... that should be set
a female auxiliary section.

343
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,100
At first I did not go with them.

344
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,020
Soon give birth.

345
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,780
In addition to Ramón did not like.

346
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,020
But Ramon loves
good coffee ...

347
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,660
... and swore that of
other women appeared ...

348
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,620
... dregs of zinc.

349
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,860
So, one day I made the coffee.

350
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,020
"They did not move."

351
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,460
"Solidarity with the miners."

352
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,660
Three days ago I do not see him

353
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,100
Ramon, listen to this.

354
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,660
The foreman gave me last night
me shift manager ...

355
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,540
... if I am the first
returning to work.

356
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,740
"Jenkins, why are you doing
For these Reds?

357
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
I replied that the Reds
I like every day.

358
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,580
Two scabs managed to pass

359
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,780
- We stopped to rest.
- Les ye searched?

360
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,620
They were Anglos other peoples

361
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,780
But they were not miners,
they would not know the zinc.

362
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Good job.
Go to tomer coffee.

363
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,260
Ramon comes the supervisor.

364
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,220
- Good Morning
- How is here?

365
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,780
We picked up the types
to you. hired ...

366
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,940
... and we came in trucks
this morning.

367
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,220
When they saw the picket
they turned

368
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,380
Not seem so scary.

369
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,020
Mr. Hartwell, some
They are brave men.

370
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,380
Especially the leader
the picket line.

371
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,180
How is it called?

372
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,940
Raymon, or something.

373
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,180
Yes, I know him.

374
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,220
This is the main picket.

375
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,180
They have another on secondary road ...

376
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,420
... and patrol the area.

377
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,420
The land is in the company.

378
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,420
Why not throw them?

379
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,260
Everything is of the company,
Mr. Hartwell.

380
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,780
The shop houses ...

381
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,260
... everything.

382
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,460
Where would miss them?

383
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,540
And who would?

384
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,100
Do we let go?
Sooner or later.

385
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,380
Just want to impress
with his power.

386
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,940
Why do not you let go
these gentlemen?

387
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,900
Do you know who will
in that car?

388
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,380
The cashier brings us
Moscow gold.

389
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,460
No, it's the president
of the company.

390
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,220
Comes to appoint Jenkins
Managing Director

391
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,220
Come on, let him go.

392
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,700
How childish!
They are like children

393
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,580
Sometimes you have to pamper them,
... other must scold

394
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,340
... and others have to punish them without eating.

395
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Here comes my saying.

396
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,140
It is quite a character.

397
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,420
He claims that his grandfather
owned land mine.

398
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,620
Want to go to your office
Mr. Alexander?

399
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,580
Sure, I have not stopped
for coffee.

400
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,180
To that we can invite.
No thanks.

401
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,500
Men want to know who is
this gentleman.

402
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,540
- It is not his business
- Leave it, it's not a secret.

403
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,540
My name is Hartwell,
work in the offices of this.

404
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,580
- In Delaware?
- No, in New York.

405
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,940
By any chance are you
the president of the company?

406
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,260
- no
- What a shame.

407
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,820
The man always wanted
see President

408
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,980
He could resolve the strike.

409
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,580
Is that possible?

410
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,100
Yes, negotiating.

411
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,660
Is a union spokesperson?

412
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,540
Not exactly.

413
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,660
I wish it were.

414
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,220
Know more of mines
puppets with whom we associate.

415
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,260
Seriously, I've seen
your personal record.

416
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,100
I was going to promote you to foreman
when the strike began.

417
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,980
You had future in the company.

418
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,100
You've been swept by these red ...

419
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,100
... but you will betray.

420
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460
When awaken, Ray?

421
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,780
Your name is Ray, no?

422
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,500
Call me Quintero.

423
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,780
Mr. Quintero.

424
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,180
Are we allowed to pass or I
to call the sheriff?

425
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Nothing stops him.

426
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,140
I was wrong, do not want to
Jenkins CEO.

427
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,980
I want my!

428
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,380
You should have heard
to that liar.

429
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,900
Foreman said he would appoint me.

430
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,300
- What's the matter?
- It's nothing

431
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,180
just a cramp.

432
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,540
Dad, come here!

433
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,980
What makes Luis here?

434
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,980
Another time playing hooky?

435
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,660
Come back here!

436
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,260
We have seen two scabs

437
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,420
They have hidden there.

438
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,500
Wait, fellas.
You three, accompany me.

439
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,460
The others follow
in line.

440
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,780
Luis, come back!

441
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,780
They go by.

442
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,380
Ramon, listen,
for God's sake.

443
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,780
You!

444
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,100
I would have expected from an Anglo.

445
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,860
I needed the job.

446
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,260
You, Judas!

447
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,460
leech

448
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,780
It was for my kids!

449
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,980
Do not eat enough.

450
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,340
Do you think mine itself?
Dirty Rat.

451
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,780
I know I did wrong
but do not hurt me.

452
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,420
Do you think I'm going to hit you?

453
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,420
I would not mess with you hands.

454
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,260
There comes a child,
warns women, fast!

455
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,020
Why are we stopping?

456
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,980
Tell us why agrediste
that boy.

457
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,140
That's a lie.

458
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,260
Do not talk to
a white.

459
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,780
Go back and then produce a
blanket to move it.

460
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,460
Did not you say this torero
had much stamina?

461
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,180
No one would say now.

462
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,260
The chile gives
much energy.

463
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,500
Like as it prepares
your "tiny" Pancho?

464
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,940
We need a doctor soon,
that woman will give birth

465
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,020
Do you take me for the driver
an ambulance?

466
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Notify your physician of the company.

467
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,460
Nobody here has a car.

468
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,100
The company doctor will not attend
Picket anyone.

469
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,820
No time to take her home,
Put it in there

470
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,780
Raise your head Pancho,
that's no way to sit.

471
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,780
Do not you go out with
your pigs.

472
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,660
You like what you have searched.

473
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,420
OMG!

474
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,500
Forgive me for having desired
my son was not born

475
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,100
Have mercy on my son.

476
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,660
Do not let me die.

477
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,900
OMG!

478
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,660
Ramon was in the
hospital a week.

479
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,700
... and one month in prison ...

480
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,620
... charged with assault and resisting
authority.

481
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,300
I decided to postpone
christening ...

482
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,220
... until Ramón out
from jail.

483
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,460
We christened
the name John.

484
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,940
That night there was
double celebration.

485
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Christening Juanito
and the return of Ramon.

486
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,020
Children to bed
in the bedroom ...

487
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,460
... as always ...

488
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,780
... and men occupied
the living room, ...

489
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,340
... as usual.

490
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,420
- Five thousand dollars.
- Too much for me.

491
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,740
- Ascend to ten thousand.
- I'm going, what do you have?

492
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,580
Three aces.

493
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,740
Come to Daddy.

494
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,100
Do bailiffs
Vicente arrested?

495
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,700
Yes, there have been many
provocations.

496
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,300
Assume that locking up
leaders on false charges ...

497
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,760
... were able to end the strike.

498
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,730
Do they let play poker
all night?

499
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,690
- I want to dance?
- With the husband from whom?

500
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,330
With either,
even with mine.

501
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,940
If you dance with my husband,
will have to endure this.

502
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,190
Your attitude toward Anglos
It is unbecoming of a leader.

503
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,250
What attitude?

504
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,570
Do you distinguish between workers
and Anglo employers

505
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,690
To him I invited him to my house
Is not it?

506
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,730
Do you also suspect him?

507
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,490
perhaps

508
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,050
Has much to learn
on our people.

509
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,730
Still, say it all.

510
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,330
You are the organizer.

511
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,610
Strategy plan
and you hit almost always

512
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,330
You think of everything
we do the rest.

513
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,650
We do not have
to think about anything.

514
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,370
Do you think that laziness us
prevented from taking the initiative?

515
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,250
You know not.

516
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,330
Maybe not, but there is more.

517
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,050
Tonight on entering,
I hear you ask your wife ...

518
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,730
"That man is your grandfather?"

519
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,610
Is Juarez, Mexico's father.

520
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,130
If I did not recognize
George Washington ...

521
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,490
You'd take me for a stupid Mexican.

522
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,130
It never fails.

523
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,970
You try to advise Ramón
and you respond with an insult.

524
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,810
He's right. I still
much to learn.

525
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,410
Well, settled matter.
Who gives the cards?

526
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,090
Be comforted, even listening
women less.

527
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,130
What do they talk?

528
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,170
Their weaknesses.

529
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,130
Did you have?

530
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,770
Now it criticize Ramon.

531
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,170
If we exclude women
the union struggle ...

532
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,730
Come on, bet!

533
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,810
Let's change the game.

534
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,810
There are housewives,
They are our companions.

535
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,450
They deserve to be treated
as equals.

536
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,810
Look who's talking.

537
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,490
The defender of women.

538
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,410
Enough, Ruth.

539
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,330
I follow him everywhere.

540
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,650
The miners organized,
village after village ...

541
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,570
... in Montana, Colorado
or Idaho ...

542
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,410
... but never thought
in organizing women.

543
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,360
Women also have
Angles in sections.

544
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,610
Nor do I approve as
Ramón treat your woman.

545
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,210
Dr. Barnes has his remedy
for women ...

546
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,490
... but have not tried
at home.

547
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,890
It is breastfeeding her child.

548
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,550
Goodbye to the game.

549
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,850
I'm glad. Consuelo,
up the volume.

550
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,040
Top Dad.

551
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:19,920
Standing.

552
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,310
Look at him!

553
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,090
He is a fighter.

554
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,050
Born fighting ...

555
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,330
... and hungry.

556
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,450
Chupa Juanito.

557
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,730
You'll never be so happy
as now.

558
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,570
Yes, it will be happier ...

559
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,410
... someday.

560
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,490
What did they say to you?

561
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,330
I make you suffer.

562
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,510
Suffer if you're in jail.

563
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,400
In this cell
I could not sleep ...

564
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,520
For bugs, heat
and the stench.

565
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,780
And he told me:

566
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,540
"Think of something beautiful ..

567
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,570
... into something beautiful. "

568
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,390
And I thought of you.

569
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,900
And I felt my heart pounding ...

570
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,650
... of love for you.

571
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,870
Not only Juanito ...

572
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,230
... you too will be happy.

573
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,140
The strike will triumph.

574
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,240
Why are you so sure?

575
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,560
If we lose, we lose
more than a strike.

576
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,630
Lose the union
and men know.

577
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,370
If we win, we will win
more improvements.

578
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,480
We will win something ...

579
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,580
... much more:

580
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,970
hope for
our children.

581
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,250
Juanito need
more than milk.

582
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,410
- Do you live here Quintero?
- What do you want?

583
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,330
- We come to garnish.
- What about the warrant?

584
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,090
- Also have.
- We do not want problems.

585
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,930
Just took the radio.

586
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,610
sorry to interrupt
the party ...

587
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,620
... but the owner of the radio
has achieved a garnishment order ...

588
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,180
Do not touch.

589
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,810
We do not seek problems
Mr. Quintero.

590
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,700
We order
repossess the equipment.

591
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,660
I said do not touch it!

592
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,730
- Let them take her
- Passing over my dead body

593
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,080
I do not want your corpse,
or see you in jail.

594
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,810
It is yours and not
they carry.

595
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,180
If you resist will
an excuse to lock you up.

596
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,690
Gladden those faces.
We have real music!

597
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,250
But the strike continued.

598
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,630
It seemed interminable.

599
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,500
They spent four months,
five, six ...

600
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,920
The company was
without wanting to negotiate.

601
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,440
They tried to turn against
Anglo miners us.

602
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,560
They said I had to send the
Mexicans back to their country.

603
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,890
How I can back
the place where it went?

604
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,940
The barracks where I was born
is now Company

605
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,200
Why would anyone sends
patterns his people?

606
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,880
Patterns so there would
throughout New Mexico.

607
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,410
- Hopefully we will see that day.
- Jenkins is not an employer.

608
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,000
In his ilk
They let them stay.

609
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,260
You can not give the desert
Oklahoma, it would be inhuman

610
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,410
I was born in Texas

611
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,940
That would be even worse!

612
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,820
He reached the seventh month

613
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,770
The company store
he refused to serve us.

614
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,470
Box resistance
It was exhausting

615
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,850
Several families could not stand it.

616
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,340
Nobody knows where they went.

617
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,160
The union decided that
desperate cases ...

618
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,070
... should apply for a job
in other mines.

619
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:25,090
This was done.

620
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,130
About getting employment
helped with their pay ...

621
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,300
... for others
they could eat.

622
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,640
Ramon was not a hopeless case.

623
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,400
Only had three
children to feed.

624
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,920
Still, employers us
they would have starved ...

625
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,670
... but we received support
International, Denver ...

626
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,500
... and other sections.

627
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,530
We thought that
anyone outside the county ...

628
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,720
... he was interested in
our problems.

629
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,560
We were wrong ...

630
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,930
"Solidarity with the miners.
Construction union. "

631
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,960
Letters came from our
Southeast compatriots.

632
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,890
From far:

633
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,330
Butte, Chicago,
Birmingham, New York ...

634
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:14,750
Messages of solidarity ...

635
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,230
... and crumpled banknotes
men working.

636
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,920
The women were helping ...

637
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,580
... not only as cooks
or making coffee.

638
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,650
Some men mocked ...

639
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,210
... but you had to do the job ...

640
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,110
... and allow us to do so.

641
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,010
Nobody realized
the magnitude of change ...

642
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,120
... until the day of the crisis.

643
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,180
The sheriff smiled.

644
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,800
We learned that brought bad news.

645
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,470
The company had achieved a
writ ...

646
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,980
... prohibiting mining
manifest in the pickets.

647
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,240
It was based on the law
Taft-Hartley.

648
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,500
Punishable by heavy fines
and a prison ...

649
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,740
miners who disobeyed

650
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,710
You had to make a decision immediately

651
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,250
Ignoring the mandate
or do not comply.

652
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,740
If we obey ...

653
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,460
... the strike will fail

654
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,840
The scabs come
as the needle was going

655
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,370
If we disobey ...

656
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,650
... the strikers will be
arrested

657
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,750
... and the strike will fail
anyway.

658
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,040
So things are
peers.

659
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,410
Employers are we
at their mercy.

660
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,010
I want to add something.

661
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,770
Whatever your decision ...

662
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,110
... I support the International ...

663
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,020
... as it always has.

664
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,200
We are a union
democratic.

665
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,540
The decision ...

666
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,350
... is yours.

667
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,420
Comrade President.

668
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,000
If we surrender now ...

669
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,490
... and to the odedecemos
Taft-Hartley rotten ...

670
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,290
... we are fools and cowards.

671
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,990
We can only do
one thing to fight.

672
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,820
- To fight and win.
- There would win anything.

673
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,040
We would be detained

674
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,250
The men discussed.
There were great speeches.

675
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,560
Apparently Barnes
was right.

676
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,420
The company had them
at their mercy.

677
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,330
Apparently the strike
had failed.

678
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:08,550
Companion president.

679
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,490
If you read the injunction
carefully ...

680
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,750
... you will see that only prohibits
manifest miners.

681
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,530
women
We are not miners.

682
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,350
We will relieve you
on the picket lines.

683
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,650
Do not scoff.

684
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,310
We have a
solution and you do not.

685
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,030
Quintero is right
saying that lose ..

686
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,200
... the achievements of 50 years
fight if the strike fails.

687
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,640
also lose
women and children.

688
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,320
So we promise ...

689
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,740
... relieve you on the picket ...

690
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,280
... to strike
not fail ...

691
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,450
... and scabs
I do not take the job.

692
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,300
Only union members
may submit proposals.

693
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,420
- I present.
- The seconded.

694
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,030
You heard the proposal.

695
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,570
Start the discussion

696
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,350
Light asked whether they preferred
hide behind their wives ...

697
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,870
... or humble themselves before
employers.

698
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,730
Comrades, we ignore
our women.

699
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,390
Employers or
even think about them.

700
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,370
They will show employers what now ...

701
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,360
... why there is no unity among men ...

702
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,380
... their wives
and her companions?

703
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,820
Carlota Sanchez said
the pickets ...

704
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,960
... were unfit
the ladies.

705
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,930
It was not right.
Perhaps even it were sin.

706
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,790
Give an opportunity to the women.

707
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,550
What do
when police ...

708
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,450
... hit our women?

709
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,850
We will not stay
idly.

710
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,560
We will have to intervene
and back to the top

711
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:25,690
Or worse,
more humiliated.

712
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,430
Companions.

713
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,870
I beg you,
You do not permitáis.

714
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,350
Let's vote.

715
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,010
Discussed the issue.

716
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,150
we all know
we voted:

717
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,020
The female section
will be responsible for the pickets

718
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,970
Raise your hand if
they favor.

719
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,060
President, I appeal to
regulation.

720
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,480
I do not understand
these discussions ...

721
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,600
... but the men
you go to vote ...

722
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,220
... what to do
or not women.

723
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,190
I think it would be fair ...

724
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,690
... that we allowed to vote.

725
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,300
Especially if we
to do the job.

726
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,020
Comrades,
would go against all rules ...

727
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,170
... allow women
vote in a union meeting.

728
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,660
If no objections ...

729
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,800
... postpone the meeting.

730
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,040
Wait.

731
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,390
We can continue as
assembly of citizens.

732
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,430
So we all adults
entitled to vote.

733
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,620
- I propose
- OK.

734
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,750
Hands up who
want to postpone the meeting.

735
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,480
Who is against?

736
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:13,880
Approved.

737
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,460
Now all adults
entitled to vote.

738
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,090
Returning to the original topic

739
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,440
Those in favor of
women formed picket ...

740
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,140
... to raise their hands.

741
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,720
Who is opposed?

742
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,980
Approved the motion
by 103 votes to 85.

743
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,460
Then came the women.

744
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,820
From Zinctown,
Hills ...

745
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,410
... and other mining towns ...

746
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,420
... traveling up to 45 km.

747
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,030
The we had never seen before.

748
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,680
They had no connection with the strike.

749
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,880
They had heard of
women pickets ...

750
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:07,520
... and going.

751
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,530
The men came too.

752
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,770
I think feared ...

753
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,870
... women
not abide.

754
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,390
Or perhaps feared
that we did so.

755
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,810
But not all women
joined the pickets.

756
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,510
some husbands
they banned it.

757
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,830
I was a
them.

758
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,390
It's unfair, I would
to be with them.

759
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,870
It was I who asked
they could vote.

760
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,930
The union does not send
in my house.

761
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,860
Those Anglo motivate you
and you do get ridiculous.

762
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,600
- I do not see them in line.
- Yo si. I see Ruth Barnes

763
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,330
The woman organizer?
Is your duty to be there!

764
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,010
no

765
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,530
It's there because he wants

766
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,460
I also see Mrs. Kalinski

767
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,770
And Jenkins? his wife
is not on the picket

768
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,820
There are also late Anglo husbands

769
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,910
- What did you say?
- Late

770
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,640
Can I download to animate?

771
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,800
- How small?
- He likes to wander.

772
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,980
This will throw the air ...

773
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,360
Do you wish to see my gun, girls?

774
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,330
Shut up!

775
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,470
Would you disobey fun
an injunction?

776
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,130
I'm not so sure
that violate the law.

777
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:29,120
The injunctive only
mentions miners

778
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,310
Which side are you on?

779
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,200
calm down, will rush
as chickens

780
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,820
Here we go, before
100 women come more

781
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:37,770
Forward guys.

782
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,610
- Use gas?
- It will not be necessary.

783
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,960
Back, do not intervengáis

784
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:10,920
Han run over
my wife!

785
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,060
Do not give them excuses
to shoot.

786
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,370
You will go to jail
Back!

787
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,390
- Stand back
- Do not be involucréis

788
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,770
Do not stay still.
Do something!

789
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:22,510
Calm down.

790
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,260
If we do not intervene,
there will be victims.

791
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,880
Do not get it wrong

792
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,290
Besides, you already have
hands full.

793
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,490
Let's go!

794
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,920
Now they go, gather
the banners.

795
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,310
It protects the union
We will not move!

796
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,980
It protects the union
We will not move!

797
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,290
Continue as a tree,
firm riverside.

798
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,350
They do not move!

799
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,850
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

800
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,110
- And your mother?
- It was a meeting.

801
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,970
Did you see how he took
gun to the sheriff?

802
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,250
I never want to see you there.

803
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,280
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

804
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,690
Was it an unforgettable experience, right?

805
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,460
- I hope it does not recur.
- I Will go tomorrow.

806
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,360
- Could hurt you.
- It is possible.

807
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,460
If you think I'm going to deal
I child, you're crazy

808
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,520
Wear all day
caring for them.

809
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:14,570
I will care for
born.

810
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,280
Tomorrow I will not
stay with them.

811
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,270
So tomorrow ...

812
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,590
... come with me to picket.

813
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,140
I returned the next day ...

814
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:37,360
... and every day
for one month.

815
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,680
Juanito remained
in the gatehouse.

816
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,860
If you did good day
and no disturbances ...

817
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,570
... pulled the cradle
Outdoor.

818
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,910
Estela playing with small ...

819
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,360
... and Luis was ...

820
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,840
... at school.

821
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,070
Ramon came every
day to observe.

822
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,310
Women ...

823
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,670
... Ramón criticized by
not stay with the children.

824
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,040
The sheriff left us
in peace for a while ...

825
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,280
... but his men insulted us.

826
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,240
We said terrible things.

827
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:34,540
And he began again.

828
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,450
They returned to using gases
harnessing the wind.

829
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,410
we disperse
as planned.

830
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:54,030
I put the little one safe
as planned.

831
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,680
They failed to break
our ranks.

832
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,210
They could not break

833
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,520
We have tried everything
less fusilarlas.

834
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,510
Have you tried locking them?

835
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,870
Do you want the
stop all?

836
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,320
No, only the organizers ...

837
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,760
... which stand out and
those with many children.

838
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,640
Where is the boy?

839
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,220
Hey you! Come over.

840
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,340
Well, girls
You can choose ...

841
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,270
... among returning home
or go to jail.

842
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,140
No buts.

843
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,350
Dissolve the picket
or you will be arrested.

844
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,250
Okay ... What?

845
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,910
This is the ringleader,
Teresa Aguilar.

846
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:08,050
Under arrest.

847
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,040
Do you prefer your home
or dungeon?

848
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,010
Follow-up
displayed based discipline

849
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,630
There will resist
authority.

850
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,850
Follow-up

851
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,170
The Ms. Salazar, old.

852
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,170
Chana Diaz,
the blue dress.

853
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,060
Luz Morales, that.

854
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,940
Ms. Kalinski, Anglo.

855
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,850
Ruth Barnes, women
Organizer.

856
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,370
And Ana Alvarez, the beauty.

857
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,070
And former.

858
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,660
- Does the child?
- Is the wife of Quintero.

859
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,510
He does not want to come

860
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,330
- Leave Juanito.
- Do not worry about it.

861
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,340
- Also take care to Estella.
- No, the child comes to me

862
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,410
Solidarity Forever.

863
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:32,080
Solidarity Forever.

864
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,300
Solidarity Forever.

865
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,750
The union makes us stronger

866
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:44,720
Solidarity Forever.

867
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,580
Solidarity Forever.

868
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:52,110
Solidarity Forever .;

869
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,520
The union makes us stronger

870
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,320
Be quiet!

871
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,820
I told you ten times.

872
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,800
We have no food.

873
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,730
We have beds.

874
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,740
Baths have not.

875
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:48,260
So, please ...

876
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:51,010
... Shut

877
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,980
You can not take this milk,
you feel bad.

878
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:00,800
Not infant formula.

879
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,560
I should bring.

880
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,040
Do not worry.
Will succeed.

881
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,290
The child can not romar that milk,
we want the formula.

882
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,850
- What do you want?
- Formula.

883
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,430
We want the formula.

884
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,460
We want the formula.

885
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:35,870
"Office of the Prosecutor
the district. "

886
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,320
Get to commit
to leave the pickets.

887
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,960
Or set a high bail
for them to stay in jail.

888
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:55,660
I can not keep
of my own pocket.

889
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,510
Mr. Hartwell,
I wonder ...

890
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,880
... how long this will last.

891
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:02,870
You. Not want to negotiate ...

892
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:04,780
What do you want?

893
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,490
The company has
other mines.

894
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,140
You have to see the whole picture.

895
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,680
If they get their way ...

896
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,470
What are you doing here?
Are not you sick of me?

897
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,040
I come to my children.
They are in their cells.

898
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,770
And has taken all
their triumphs.

899
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,410
Not all.

900
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,000
For example?

901
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,720
Profit not silence them.

902
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,820
Say something of a formula.

903
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,230
A special compound
for the small.

904
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:03,770
It is his son.

905
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,340
Hush, hush!

906
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,440
I have given milk
for the child.

907
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,630
What comes
fuss?

908
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,410
This milk is useless.

909
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,670
The child needs formula.

910
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,380
If you sick. It will
responsible.

911
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:48,720
This is not a pharmacy.

912
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:50,950
Guilt is only yours.

913
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,800
In one hour you would be
with your families.

914
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,890
You just have to sign
express to the waiver.

915
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:00,890
We will not sign anything, stinky!

916
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:04,790
We want the formula!

917
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,760
We want the formula!

918
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,640
Where is that guy?

919
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,380
Come here, Pancho.

920
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,160
Where is the child?

921
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,480
And the girl?

922
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,150
Kids, get out of those baskets!

923
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,380
Three hours to heat water
just for laundry.

924
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,220
I assure you ...

925
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,600
... although the strike succeed,
which I doubt ...

926
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:47,360
... I will not return to work
if you do not put hot water.

927
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:50,250
The union had
I have demanded before.

928
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:52,240
Who do you tell?

929
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,620
Charlie according Vidal, there
Two types of slavery:

930
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,480
The wage,
and housewife.

931
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,080
It is the problem of
womanhood.

932
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:16,970
What problem?

933
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,830
The problem of what
do about it.

934
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,480
What does he do?

935
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,890
He says they deserve
equality at work ...

936
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,500
... equality at home
and also ...

937
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,340
... gender equality.

938
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,820
What does it mean
"gender equality"?

939
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,700
You know.

940
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:41,890
Charlie is a real organizer.

941
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,590
Oraganiza women
and disrupts their homes.

942
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,180
Can I go?
no meeting of the youth section.

943
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,180
We can help
in many ways.

944
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:03,980
You only get you
send to a reformatory.

945
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,970
- All help is easy.
- You'd have to help at home.

946
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,490
Mom did not make me
drying dishes.

947
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,100
You should help
without being asked.

948
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,300
- How are you?
- I'm fine

949
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,400
How did you sleep
these four nights?

950
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:34,650
We set the fuss
we brought bunks.

951
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:36,650
I almost ran hoarse.

952
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:38,910
And Estela? And the little one?

953
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,770
are sleeping

954
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,910
¿Firmásteis waiver
continue with picket?

955
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,900
never
we would have done.

956
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:53,880
If you continue,
They lock you again.

957
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,180
They are not, fed
of us.

958
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,870
The locos were returning.

959
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,710
The group of Consuelo
morning will rest.

960
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,440
- We the relieve you.
- Well, let's plan it.

961
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,160
We need to talk.

962
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,130
Later, now
we have a meeting.

963
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,720
We must organize
the picket tomorrow.

964
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,290
If you want, you can attend.

965
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,060
Let's see.
Who is available?

966
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:32,850
Chana's husband was
to the governor.

967
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,090
many men
they go hunting tomorrow.

968
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:39,740
They will be about forty,
their women can not come.

969
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,150
We will ask you
care of children.

970
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:47,870
What we do
with his attitude?

971
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,120
Still have not learned
The lesson?

972
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:53,250
our DELEGATION
I could talk to him.

973
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,420
This I have
I solve it alone.

974
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:27,030
I know someone who works
in the Ministry of Mines.

975
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,580
You know that saying?

976
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:31,330
That never again
to exploit this mine.

977
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:33,350
Is it possible?

978
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:35,760
He says the mineral
is exhausted.

979
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,330
All this is nonsense.

980
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,710
That mine is rich,
I know.

981
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,690
But that does not matter,
ever want to negotiate.

982
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,400
Look at this!

983
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,000
Him!

984
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:54,190
- President of the company.
- Let me see.

985
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:56,880
Hear this

986
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,110
"Mr. Hamilton Miller
distinguished gentleman ...

987
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:04,590
... it's banker, businessman,
director of Continental ...

988
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:09,020
... and president of
Delaware Zinc Inc. "

989
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,480
- Let me see.
- Wait, there's more.

990
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:16,150
"Amateur sport
and experienced hunter ...

991
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,110
... Mr. Miller finds time
for every year ...

992
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,250
... a safari in Africa.

993
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:22,660
Party this month
heading to Kenya ...

994
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,860
... where he hopes hunt
his thirteenth lion. "

995
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,260
I frame it,
Ramón look.

996
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:36,030
Must see
complete picture.

997
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,250
So that
will hunt lions.

998
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,090
Did you expect out
hunting rabbits?

999
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,590
Guys, would like to get
some deer.

1000
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,900
For weeks
I tasted the meat.

1001
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,090
What do you think of disappearing
for a couple of days?

1002
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,150
Do not ask me
I do not direct this strike.

1003
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,390
If you want permission
to take the field ...

1004
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:58,490
To ask Him
female section

1005
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,040
I waited lifted
until midnight.

1006
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,360
Do not expect me.

1007
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:21,750
The meeting lasted
just 10 minutes.

1008
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,740
My first night at home ...

1009
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,030
... and you go to the brewery.

1010
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,140
What's up?

1011
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,210
Do not endure this
aspect of me?

1012
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:32,820
Shut up!

1013
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:36,000
You wanted to talk.

1014
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,900
Speaks.

1015
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,400
Speaks.

1016
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,860
We can not continue.

1017
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,880
I can not go on living
thus you.

1018
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:07,980
True, we can not
go on ...

1019
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,610
... or we can return
our old life.

1020
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,910
And what is your new life?

1021
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:16,140
Do you think that entitles you
to neglect your children?

1022
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,820
- Where are you going?
- A hunting.

1023
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:34,050
- When?
- At dawn.

1024
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,270
- Only?
- Do Not.

1025
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,390
You can not leave.

1026
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,180
Why?
I am not required.

1027
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:43,950
You are.

1028
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:46,320
And especially now, with so many
men absent.

1029
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:48,450
You're the captain of the squad
booking.

1030
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,490
Yes, we reserve
for the funeral.

1031
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:54,820
What funeral?
We were not doing too badly.

1032
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,630
We have not seen scabs
three days.

1033
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,800
Because the company knows
which can starve us

1034
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,130
Even if it takes other
two or three months.

1035
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,190
For them it means nothing
The mine is still closed.

1036
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,510
It means a lot,
would do anything to reopen.

1037
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,680
They have other mines.

1038
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,360
Do not see the whole picture.

1039
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:19,200
They are millionaires.

1040
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:21,560
They can outlast us
and they know it.

1041
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,560
Are you willing to give up?

1042
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:26,760
Who speaks of surrender?

1043
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,460
I do not humiliate
to return to the company.

1044
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:33,320
You want to lose with honor,
Is that it?

1045
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,270
For I would not lose.

1046
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:38,550
I want to win.

1047
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:42,460
We are not weakening.

1048
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,030
We are stronger than ever.

1049
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,880
They are weakened.

1050
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,450
They wanted to destroy our
pickets and could not.

1051
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:53,120
To win, you have to
do something big surprise

1052
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:53,790
Like what?

1053
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,980
I do not know.

1054
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,300
But I feel it in the air.

1055
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,920
It is the calm prece
the storm.

1056
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,780
Charlie Vidal says ...

1057
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:09,030
Vidal Charlie Fuck!

1058
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,210
Do not give me now
Charlie Vidal.

1059
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:17,470
He is my friend.

1060
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:19,680
I need friends.

1061
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,330
Why are you afraid
to accept me as a friend?

1062
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,720
I do not know what you mean.

1063
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,280
True, you do not.

1064
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,900
Have you not learned
none of this strike?

1065
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:36,030
Why do you fear I
fight by your side?

1066
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:39,590
Do you still think you can have
dignity if I do not?

1067
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,240
You speak of dignity
after what you've done?

1068
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,770
Yes, I speak of dignity.

1069
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,380
Employers despise you
and that's why you hate.

1070
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,460
You say "stay on your site
Mexican dirty. "

1071
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,190
Why do I say to myself
I fall on my site?

1072
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,310
Do you feel better
if someone inferior to you?

1073
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,320
Calla, say nonsense.

1074
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,220
Who do I have to tread
to feel superior?

1075
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,170
And what good will that do?

1076
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:08,400
Do not want anyone
you feel so inferior as me.

1077
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,910
I want to get up and fight
for all along.

1078
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:14,740
Are not you shut up?

1079
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,570
If you do not understand,
you are stupid.

1080
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,860
You can not win
this strike without me.

1081
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,980
You will not gain anything without me.

1082
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,610
That would backtrack.

1083
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,930
Do not ever try.

1084
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,880
Never again.

1085
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:44,030
I'm going to bed.

1086
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:45,980
Sleep anywhere ...

1087
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,330
... but not me.

1088
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,940
They have only tested a while
the lives of women ...

1089
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,330
... And run away.

1090
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,580
Ramon is right.

1091
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:21,230
I downloaded all my bitterness ...

1092
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:23,210
... And he felt hurt.

1093
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:27,370
You learn so
that causes suffering.

1094
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,360
These changes come with pain.

1095
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,430
Also for other husbands ...

1096
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,660
... Not only for Ramon.

1097
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:56,540
Are you willing to give up?

1098
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:59,250
You want to lose with honor
Why is that?

1099
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,610
For I would not lose.

1100
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:03,130
I want to win.

1101
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,860
We are not weakening.

1102
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,700
They are weakened.

1103
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,730
Have not you learned anything
this strike?

1104
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,790
I can feel it in the air.

1105
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,440
It's the calm before
the storm.

1106
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,290
They wanted to destroy our pickets
and they could not.

1107
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:35,240
To win have to
surprise and quickly.

1108
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,940
Companions!
We should go back.

1109
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,720
Where is Ramon?
Was hunting with the others?

1110
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,450
Do you know where we can find?

1111
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,500
¿Hunters?
They're deserters.

1112
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,520
Something wrong?

1113
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,530
Speak, Charlie.

1114
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:01,240
The company has a
order of eviction.

1115
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,500
Eviction!

1116
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,060
Where?

1117
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:10,480
Eviction!

1118
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,550
Do not worry, Quintero
has gone hunting.

1119
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,830
Vacate your home
and the rest will be easy.

1120
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,700
Let the neighbors see it
to see if escarmientan.

1121
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,250
Can we do something?

1122
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,810
Back girls.

1123
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,200
What's up?
They are evicting Quintero.

1124
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,000
We are going there.

1125
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,480
Let alone children

1126
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,030
Come back here and finish the job.

1127
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,580
Ignore
Continue with the rest of the furniture.

1128
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:48,490
It's what we were expecting.

1129
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:50,350
What do you say?

1130
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:53,450
This means that waive
to end the picketing.

1131
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:55,590
Now we can fight together.

1132
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,530
Women back to enter it all.

1133
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,820
Quintero, these women
obstruct justice.

1134
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,820
Oblíguelas to behave.
I can not do anything.

1135
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:39,820
You. I know, no longer obey
men.

1136
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,850
Wants to return
to confine them?

1137
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,600
Do you really want enclose?

1138
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,440
Do not enter!

1139
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:07,560
Look, the boys from the quarry.
And the crusher.

1140
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,760
Any other ideas?

1141
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:58,870
I do not decide policy.

1142
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:01,140
I'll talk to New York.

1143
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,350
I think you better ...

1144
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:06,350
... Solve this.

1145
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,860
Yet.

1146
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:14,760
  We did not know then
we had won.

1147
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,860
But our hearts
were radiant.

1148
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,420
Ramon said:

1149
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,870
Thank you ...

1150
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,330
... Colleagues.

1151
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:34,630
Esperanza, thanks for your dignity.

1152
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:37,590
You were right.

1153
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,970
Together we can rise ...

1154
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,120
... And move forward.

1155
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:48,820
I knew then that we learned
something we could never take away.

1156
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,220
Something that could bequeath
Our kids.

1157
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:55,970
And they, the blood of the earth
they would inherit
