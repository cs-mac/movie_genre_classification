00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,695
From Harry Percy?

164
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,798
Where is Anne,
Lady Elizabeth?

165
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,266
I found this in her room.

166
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,349
And how is the Vicar of Hell
this chilly morning?

167
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,906
Warm enough,
Your Majesty.

168
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,646
To be active on the King's business
generates a certain heat.

169
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,086
Yes, I'm sure,
with your feet on the devil's fender

170
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,317
and your buttocks toasting at God's altar.

171
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,586
(CHUCKLING)

172
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,385
Has he spoken to you?

173
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,088
He has, Your Grace.

174
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,528
Good. Good.

175
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,672
And when may I smell
this pretty posy of yours?

176
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,678
If you mean Anne, sir,
she is still at her mirror.

177
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,771
A new dress, nervous fingers.

178
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,782
If you could give her half an hour, perhaps...

179
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,841
We have us this whole day, Thomas.

180
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,648
I've a new pack of hounds
you might care to view,

181
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,621
and there's a clump of red deer
in the lower meadow.

182
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,214
Well, we'll see the one and hunt the other.

183
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,383
Good hunting, Your Majesty.

184
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,017
You'll not be with us?
Alas, sir, no.

185
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,654
It appears there are two poor souls
who seek religious comfort.

186
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,924
I must go where I'm called.

187
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,991
Indeed, my Lord Cardinal, indeed.
God's work must come first.

188
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,061
And, who knows, there may be
a little worldly profit attached.

189
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,765
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Your Majesty.

190
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,344
Find them, bring them to me.

191
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,689
Thomas, a private word with you
before I meet Anne.

192
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,093
Yes, Your Grace?

193
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,859
There is always a temptation
for a man in my position

194
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,870
to regard the nation as his own trough
and to eat from one end to the other.

195
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,927
Not Your Grace.

196
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,997
Why not? Who can say no to me?

197
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,565
Except God, and he does, Thomas, he does.
That's the point.

198
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,305
I kneel. I pray. He answers.

199
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,610
But can that be seen to be so?

200
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,481
Why else would His Holiness the Pope

201
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,280
have named you Defender of the Faith,
Your Grace?

202
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,584
True. True. I am a religious man.

203
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:09,787
I want to do right by God and the Church,

204
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:15,232
and the people and myself,
and you, Thomas.

205
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,289
Do you follow?

206
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,392
(CLEARS THROAT)

207
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:21,872
That's a swathe of folk to satisfy,
if it includes God, Your Grace.

208
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,340
Include your two daughters, Thomas.

209
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,071
Are they friends?

210
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,237
Yes.

211
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,042
And do they exchange confidences,
do you think?

212
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:34,142
Do they whisper together at night
secrets about me, perhaps?

213
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,150
Who knows, Your Grace?
The one you have had, the other you desire.

214
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,321
Will Anne have me? For myself, mind.

215
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,028
I want an honest answer.

216
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,532
She's no fool, my Lord.

217
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,527
Good. Good.

218
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,141
What I do is God's will
and my prayer always is

219
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,804
that he will allow no thought
to enter my heart or mind

220
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,040
that is not his will.

221
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,551
He has... He has never failed me, Thomas.

222
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,916
But Your Majesty realizes
this might seem as...

223
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,249
As what?

224
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:16,592
As an excuse to do as you please,
to eat the trough dry.

225
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm the King of England.
When I pray, God answers.

226
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,903
Yes, Your Grace.

227
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,405
And let no man dare question that.

228
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,277
Or woman.

229

<i>GIGGLING</i>

00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:18,945
(GASPS)

231
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,558
Again.

232
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,837
I'm angry with myself.

233
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,963
Why?

234
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,471
Well, think of the years
I spent at the French court.

235
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:41,570
I was surrounded by gallant, captivating,
exquisite French courtiers,

236
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,638
and I loved none of them.

237
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,707
No sooner do I return
than I fall in love with a...

238
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,685
"Northern clodhopper," said His Majesty.

239
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,880
He was right.

240
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,446
Has no manners, can't dance,
can't sing, can't...

241
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,389
Can put his arms around you.

242
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,552
Not as well as I've known it done.

243
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,563
But they are the arms I want,
for some God-knows-what reason.

244
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,102
I love your awkwardness.

245
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,735
But if we love enough to marry,
we must love enough to keep nothing back.

246
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,002
So?

247
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,073
Are we to bed together? Before?

248
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,481
If you like.

249
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,911
Kiss me.

250
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,989
Are you a virgin?

251
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,058
I'm a man.

252
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,099
I know, but are you a virgin?

253
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,295
When we bed together, shall I be your first?

254
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,928
I...
Speak out.

255
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,332
Well, I'll say it frankly, as they do in France.

256
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,504
In England, we make muddy mysteries
of such things, as if they were crimes.

257
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,572
We don't come out of a rainbow at 17,
and there's no use pretending we do.

258
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,278
You may ask me whatever you like.

259
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,048
Are you a virgin?

260
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,812
No.

261
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,988
In France?

262
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,550
Yes. And long before.

263
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:09,265
When I was little, I was playing with a boy,
he threw me down and...

264
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,708
The King refuses you permission
to marry him.

265
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,804
But...

266
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,212
Why? Why, my Lord?

267
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,242
Marriages of the nobility are affairs of state.
I was wrong to encourage you, Percy.

268
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,412
The King and his greater wisdom

269
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,922
wishes you to marry one of the daughters
of the Earl of Shrewsbury.

270
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,959
Not I. I am pledged to Anne.
It is a good match.

271
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,326
I brought you to court.
You're a member of my household.

272
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,455
You will obey.

273
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,193
The whole world knew we meant to marry.
Nothing was said against it.

274
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,895
Well, now you've heard
the King's pleasure against it.

275
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,167
A half grown steer and a leggy girl

276
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,505
will not be allowed to overturn
the policies of state.

277
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,806
Why was nothing said?

278
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,371
Her father, my father,
and you, my Lord Cardinal,

279
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,713
who knows the King's business
better than he knows it himself...

280
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,412
Be silent!

281
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,920
You will obey or your estates will be forfeit.

282
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,957
If you show further disloyalty
by word or action,

283
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,584
it's doubtful how long you will live.

284
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,518
The Duke of Buckingham lost his head
for less.

285
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:12,790
Now go.

286
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,263
You must go.

287
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,559
Kiss me, then.

288
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,035
Don't touch her.

289
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,142
Be careful of yourself.

290
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,180
I will, for you.

291
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:43,626
My Lord, I love him truly,
and we are pledged to each other.

292
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,930
If you force him to marry elsewhere,

293
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,025
although I am only a girl,
you'll know you have an enemy.

294
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,297
Madam, you do me wrong.

295
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,340
I have no spleen against you.
lam only a messenger.

296
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,404
Messenger? Who has chosen for me?

297
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,679
When Henry of England
turns his eyes on a girl,

298
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,741
she can hardly look away.

299
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,986
The King has asked for me?

300
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,149
He has.

301
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,022
And sent you to me?

302
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,253
It is sometimes my duty
to anticipate his desires.

303
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,964
Even in carnal matters, my Lord Cardinal?

304
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,862
We have had the King in the bosom
of this family for some years.

305
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,674
My sister Mary is with child by him
and of no further use.

306
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,270
I shall not go the way of my sister.

307
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:41,748
You would be wise to anticipate my answer
and spare His Majesty any annoyance.

308
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:47,618
I will not be a mistress of the King even
with the blessing of a prince of the church.

309
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,406
Good sport in Boleyn's woods.

310
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,998
And in Boleyn's bowers,
he hopes.

311
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,838
I heard you, Norris.

312
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,939
Well, you buzz the girls, you two.
Tell me, man to man, all kingship aside,

313
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,209
what's the best way to win a maid?

314
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,443
A maid, Your Majesty?

315
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,452
Well, I couldn't swear to it medically,
but it's young and it's wild.

316
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,614
Oh, my King, my skills are not for
the grade of female you seek.

317
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,352
I'm more successful with waiting women
and ladies' maids.

318
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,020
Oh, don't be modest, lad.
I've followed your spoor so close

319
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,290
there was scarce time
to close the window you left by

320
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,231
or change perfumes to put me off the scent.

321
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,392
Speak on, your lure, your most seductive.

322
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,631
You'll not be offended?

323
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,605
I'll be offended if you hold back.

324
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:36,698
All right then.

325
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,006
If you truly want her, make her believe
that you are potent only with her.

326
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,067
Ah.

327
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,239
Pretend that you've tried
with numbers of others.

328
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:48,514
Gone to bed, kissed hotly,
but hung embarrassed and unable.

329
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,715
But with her you rouse up.
You're a man again.

330
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,849
They can't resist that. They open like...

331
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:58,328
Oh, well, never mind the simile. Yes.
What a game.

332
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,886
What a ploy.

333
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,799
Dare I ask, has Your Grace
ever been refused by a wench?

334
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,235
Who? I? Refused? Why, never.

335
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,762
When I've wanted them, I've had them.
And when I've had a wench, I'm cured.

336
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,832
That's general, isn't it?

337
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,402
Your Grace, can you all leave talking
of virgins long enough

338
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,004
to look at the venison?

339
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,913
Yes, yes. Come, come.

340
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,418
Next to the haunch of a virgin,
there's nothing like a haunch of venison.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

342
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:31,124
Do you also offer me up to this royal bull?
You, my father? And you, my mother?

343
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,493
For God's sake, lower your voice!

344
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,089
Do you know what it is to be in love,
either of you?

345
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,498
I love Harry Percy and will marry him.

346
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,730
Anne, you'll have us all dead or disgraced.

347
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,331
Lower your voice.
The royal bull can't force you.

348
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,399
Brother, I must fight. I must.

349
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,638
Do you know what it means
when a king asks for you?

350
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,306
If I don't, I can ask my pregnant
and foolish sister.

351
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,079
If you turn him away, we can say farewell
to all we've worked for and all we have.

352
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,712
Anne, if our parents had not taken
an advantage when it came their way,

353
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,846
what would've become of us?

354
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,914
If we lose the King's favor,
we lose everything.

355
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,755
Then say goodbye to it all, house, rank
and revenue,

356

for I will not take the King to my bed!

I was so anxious to see you, madam,
I ran ahead.

You see, madam, I brought your brother
to make sure that I was welcome.

us and not stayed at home with the ladies.

Nan.

367
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,661
Give me a kiss.

Yes, Your Majesty.

And now on the lips, sweet Nan.

I've been taking medicines for a cold.
My breath is foul, Your Grace.

Oh, your health is very dear to us.
You must needs keep well.

Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
I should continue the cure.

Anne, you see before you not the King,
but a poor fellow

00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:06,682
as uncertain, as eager, as hopeful, as afraid

Believe me, all kingship on one side.

I wish to be loved for myself.

Well, as you say, you're not the King,

but only a poor, uncertain, eager,
hopeful fellow.

393
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,172
Could you tell me, then, why the King sent
an old Church pander to give me my orders?

394
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,237
Pander?

395

Oh. Did he speak clumsily?

397
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,918
No, Your Grace. He spoke to the point.

You smell of horse sweat.

428
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,691
His Majesty has sent me to inform you,
my Lord,

429
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:42,206
that the entertainment at Hever
suits him well, and he intends to remain.

00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,572
Excellent. No, tell Lovell
his request is denied.

She'll go the way of all the rest. Granted.

The King should be here
attending to matters of state,

not pursuing a reluctant girl.

435
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,446
If he wants her, he should take her.
He is the King.

436
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,356
And what is Sir Thomas More's opinion
about that?

437
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,725
Master Cromwell,
when you counsel the King,

438
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,254
tell him what he ought to do,
but never what he is able to do.

439
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:12,326
If he knew his real strength,
it would be hard for any man to rule him.

440
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,633
He ought to leave Hever.

441
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,005
Let sleeping kings lie, Thomas,

442
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,203
and we'll see to the government
of the country.

to touch her when you wanted to,
to have her company when you asked it,

446

and to have no response,

447
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,997
to burn with love as I do for you

448
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,527
and be denied any pleasure
in your cool company.

It is a cruel thing, Nan, to be denied love.

But not as my sister is married.

you shall dispose of them

does my sister dispose of?

your loyalty, my good Vicar of Hell?

His Majesty may father out of wedlock.

I would rather mine than hers.

Brilliant, Your Grace. Brilliant.

745

You think so?

746
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:44,917
Yes. Keep promising her marriage
and the siege will soon be over.

747

In a month at most,
you'll have breached her.

You think I was lying?

00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:52,367
Well, if wooing, praise, gifts and power
have failed,

750
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,336
then of course you must try a new strategy.

there's only one thing I pray.

Show me how to save England
from chaos when I'm dead.

754

My marriage is cursed
and my sons born dead

It was incest and for 20 years
I have been punished.

00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,436
I was never married in the eyes of God.

761
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,673
Indeed you were, my Lord.
Thoroughly married.

762
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:39,613
All the world knows, the Pope granted you
a dispensation to marry Katherine

763
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:40,707
when Arthur died.

764
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,649
Because England and Spain
needed one another.

765
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,880
No! Because your brother was a boy of 15

766
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,287
and there was doubt that he'd consummated
the marriage before he died.

767
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,349
Fifteen! At 15, I was rogering maids
right, left and center.

768
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:52,657
But at the time of my marriage, I believed,
and the Pope believed,

769
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,324
and my father chose to believe,
that Katherine was virgin.

770
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:00,300
I was deceived.
The marriage was consummated.

771
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,470
Prepare the evidence.
Get me a case for annulment.

772
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,499
My Lord, I beg you...
As your faithful servant,

773
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,569
I beg you to consider.

774
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,841
Katherine is a princess of Spain.

775
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,908
Try to annul your marriage and you'll gather
enormous forces against you.

776
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,921
The combination of Spain, Naples, Germany,
the Netherlands.

777
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:23,119
All of them ruled by Katherine's nephew.
The Roman Catholic Church all over Europe.

778
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,184
Your own people even, who love the Queen.

779
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,230
I will marry Anne!
I will have her crowned Queen!

780
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:30,198
It could mean war.
It could mean the loss of your kingdom.

781
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,997
I will marry Anne if it breaks the Earth in two
like an apple

782
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,537
and flings the two halves into the void!

783
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,507
No. I don't believe it of him.

784
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,680
I fear it is true, madam.

785
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,713
As Spanish Ambassador, it is my duty
to have many sources of information.

786
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,859
Then it is Wolsey, not the King.

787
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:09,231
That butcher's cur, Wolsey,
who put it in his mind.

Wolsey is preparing the case
to take to Rome.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

790
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,206
Enter.

791
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,879
The King is here.
He wishes to see Your Majesty.

792
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,747
I will do all in my power to aid you.

793
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,413
I will send word today to your nephew,
the Emperor Charles.

794
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,819
Yes and to His Holiness.

795
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,017
This Pope bends to the wind, madam.

796
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,356
Your hope lies in your nephew.

797
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,687
Your Majesty.

798
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,253
My Lord Ambassador.

799
00:55:55,618 --> 00:56:00,021
It delights my heart to see you privately
after so many months, my Lord.

800
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,184
Sit, Kate. Sit.

801
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:12,795
Kate,

802
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:17,099
I'll come bluntly to the point.

803
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,005
God tells me that our marriage is a sin.

804
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,645
My conscience is deeply troubled.

805
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:31,119
Incest will be punished and we have been
punished, you and I, with dead sons.

806
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,452
Our daughter, Mary, is alive and well, Henry.

807
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,588
Our marriage must be annulled.

808
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:42,155
Then it is true.
Wolsey has brought you to this.

809
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:46,828
Kate.

810
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,038
Kate, it's God's will.

811
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:51,767
My conscience is clear.

812
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:58,303
Help me, for both our sakes.
Support me in my case to the Pope.

813
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,080
But I'm your wife.

814
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:07,112
Do you believe that I can ask Pope Clement
to tell the world that my father lied?

815
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,987
My mother lied?

816
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:13,017
Ferdinand and Isabella, the most
Christian princes, that each of them lied

817
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,497
when they swore my marriage
to your brother was never consummated?

818
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,864
Your own father signed the paper with them.

819

God knows he lied like a Trojan,
in season and out.

I've had little happiness in my life.

822
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:32,044
I was a lonely girl, brought from Spain at 15
to be used for English politics.

823
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:38,077
When Arthur died, I was pushed aside
and kept here for seven years,

824
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,918
until I could be used for you.

825
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,982
And you, I loved.

826
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,494
With you, I had my only happiness.

(SOBBING)

828
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,724
I love you still.

Then do as I ask!

830
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,338
No. I will not betray our daughter.

831
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,944
Our daughter is a threat, not a blessing.

832
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:12,616
I must...

833
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,985
I must have a son!

834
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,857
Get one, then, from one of your women!

835
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,452
I'm your wife and your Queen.

836
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,125
And neither you nor the Pope
can make my child a bastard!

837
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:29,594
If you defy me,
I'll have you sent from the court.

838
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,902
You shall be shut away in the country.

I will have it!

842
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:49,020
I too gave evidence that my marriage
to Arthur was never consummated.

843
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,559
Did I lie to the Pope all those years ago?

844
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,057
Did I lie to God?

845

Did I lie to you, Hal?

No.

The Pope had fled from the Vatican
to the hill town of Orvieto.

I couldn't reach him,
but we exchanged letters.

Yes, yes, and the annulment?

He refuses to annul your marriage.
He cannot refuse!

He cannot do anything else.

What's his reason?

877

The Spanish Emperor has got him
by the nose. That's his reason.

The Pope has finally answered
the King's appeal

890
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:39,413
and has sent Cardinal Campeggio
to try this case.

891

Campeggio speaks for His Holiness.
I will accept that.

My Lords, I have come to this court
not because I wish to discard a wife,

918

but because such grave doubts
are cast upon my marriage

and such grave fears invest my conscience.

for carnal pleasure,

of the Queen's person or age.

This court has been convened
to try the validity of that marriage.

The bishops assembled here
have all signed this document

and must be resolved by trial.

That is the truth, if it please Your Highness.

No, sir, that is not the truth.

No, I beseech you, do not.

950
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,954

01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,412
You have the power.
I say you should use it.

955
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,573
Power to hear the case,
Your Majesty.

956
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,138
But you've heard it,
hours of it.

957
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,378
From Your Majesty's witnesses.

958
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,888
The Queen says no court in England
can be impartial.

959
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,220
She appeals directly to Rome.

960
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,259
But you are Rome come to England,
my Lord.

961
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,851
My hands are tied.

962
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,658
The trial is adjourned for
the Queen's appeal.

963
01:08:55,731 --> 01:09:00,395
To the Pope, who fears the Queen's nephew
more than he loves the justice of God.

964
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,198
Your Grace could be excommunicated!

965
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,363
Get out!

966
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,430
Limp back to Rome.

967
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:09,808
And tell His Holiness I will have
the marriage annulled. Get out, get out.

968
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,109
Get out!

969
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:26,718
Well, my Lord Cardinal,
so much for your boastful promises.

970
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:45,135
Your Grace, forgive me.

971
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,215
Forgive me.

972
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,481
Go to the Queen.

973
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:59,592
Banish her from the court and house her
at your own expense in some remote place.

974
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,224
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:10,694
Remove yourself from my sight.
You are unfit for office.

01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,132
Render up the Great Seal.

978
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:19,170
And hide, Wolsey. Hide from my anger.

979
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:24,751
Go now. Go.

980
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,527
HENRY: Wolsey.

981
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:45,165
I do not forgive you.
I spare you for your past services.

982
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,923
The business of the day is over, lawyer.

983
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,591
I am a lawyer who has read the law.

984
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:11,928
So?

985
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,027
There is a law of this land
that says it is treason

986
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,267
to acknowledge any higher authority
than the will of the King.

987
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,900
It is, I take it, the will of the King

988
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,742
that he shall divorce the Queen
and marry the Lady Anne?

989
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:26,775
It is.

990
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:31,082
Then the Church in England
must grant your will

991
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:34,213
because it is treasonable to say
that the Pope is a higher authority

992
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,689
than the King

993
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,082
under the law.

994
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:45,364
I've always been a defender of the faith
and of the Church.

995
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:50,205
As matters stand, you are but half a king.

996
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,736
To say that Rome may dictate this matter

997
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:56,574
is to say that Rome may dictate
the succession to the Crown.

998
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:03,142
What the King of England wants, he should
have without hindrance from abroad.

999
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,310
True.

1000
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:06,886
It is true.

1001
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,689
It would mean excommunication.

1002
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,324
It would mean a break with Rome.

1003
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:20,198
It would need only the appointment
of a new Primate of the Church in England.

1004
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,601
He would then grant the divorce.

1005
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,234
And the penalty for all those good men

1006
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,832
who could not stomach your law,
Master Cromwell?

1007
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:32,506
The penalty for treason
has always been death, Your Grace.

1008
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,649
You may go.

1009
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:51,127
There is something else, Your Majesty.

1010
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,863
Cardinal Wolsey,
through skillful manipulation,

1011
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,462
has seen to it that the monasteries
of England are richer

1012
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,337
than the goldmines of the New World.

1013
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:04,311
If, as you should be,
you become Head of the Church,

1014
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,204
those riches are yours.

1015
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,682
You're a man without scruple, lawyer.

1016
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,611
Entirely without scruple.

1017
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:17,655
I learned my trade under Cardinal Wolsey,
Your Grace.

1018
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,328
(EXHALES)

1019
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,337
Are you also a pupil of the Cardinal's?

1020
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,773
No, no, no, I studied under a real master,
my father.

1021
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:37,175
Whatever villainy was lacking in the world
when Henry VII was born,

1022
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,305
he invented before he left it.

1023
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:43,317
But the one cardinal principle
he taught me was

1024
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,910
always keep the Church on your side.

1025
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:50,585
Well, you have the Church on one side
and you have me on the other.

1026
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,659
Yes. The choice is now clear.

1027
01:13:57,065 --> 01:14:01,229
If I make myself Head of the Church
in England, I make you my Queen,

1028
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:06,037
I make myself wealthier
than all the monarchs in Europe,

1029
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:11,842
and I shall be excommunicated.

1030
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,114
Everlasting damnation.

1031
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:22,789
In this life, no child of the Church shall
speak with me, feed me, shelter me.

1032
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,886
And when dead,
my body shall lie without burial

1033
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,454
and my soul

1034
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,400
shall be cast into hell forever.

1035
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,152
Heavenly Father,

1036
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:02,727
what I seek is not for myself, as you know,

1037
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:09,097
but for the future safety of my realm
and the greater glory of your name.

1038
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:17,005
If I weaken in my resolve,
remember I am but a man.

1039
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:27,585
Give me your heavenly strength
for my intended journey

1040
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,656
and resolve my doubts.

1041
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,521
My Lords,

1042
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:10,723
I intend to bring before Parliament certain
matters which have concerned us greatly.

1043
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:16,237
I am deeply alarmed by the increasing
influence and power in our state

1044
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,205
of the Church of Rome.

1045
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:22,406
Not content alone with the misappropriation
of property and money,

1046
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:26,140
Rome now seeks to interfere with the laws
and statutes of this realm.

1047
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:31,447
In particular, the King's prerogatives
relating to the succession to the throne.

1048
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,988
For all these reasons,
and many others known to you all,

1049
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:37,583
we must free ourselves
from the interference, influence,

1050
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:40,856
and direction of the See of Rome.

1051
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:43,090
Hear, hear!

1052
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:47,192
Item. The Oath of Allegiance
to the King of England, sworn by you all.

1053
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:51,399
Item. The Oath of Allegiance
to the Pope of Rome, sworn by the Clergy.

1054
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:55,807
Question. Whom do the Clergy serve?
Pope or King?

1055
01:16:56,678 --> 01:17:01,081
Cardinal Wolsey, the greatest churchman
of our land, is cast down.

1056
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:06,485
Any bishop or priest who does not
first serve the King will follow him.

1057
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:11,959
Parliament will be summoned
for the enactment of this bill

1058
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,995
named The Act of Supremacy.

1059
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,996
Where under the King is declared
to be supreme

1060
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:20,933
in all matters relating to the welfare of
his subjects, both spiritual and temporal.

1061
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,597
Sire...
My Lord Bishop, keep silent!

1062
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,733
There is only one question
I will put to this council.

1063
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,708
No other will be tolerated or discussed.

1064
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,802
And the question I put to you is this,
does any lord here,

1065
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,403
either spiritual or temporal,

1066
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:36,440
deny the right of Parliament to enact
this law and make it the law of the land

1067
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,214
if Parliament so chooses?
Sir Thomas More?

1068
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:42,552
I do not deny the right of Parliament
to enact laws.

1069
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,956
Good. Good.

that you did not heed my advice.

Concerning what?

1075
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:19,787
You have, I believe, told the King not
what he ought to do, but what he can do.

1076
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:22,455
Now no man in the world can hold him.

1077
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,298
The King's power must be complete.

01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:36,834
After today, I fear I must resign mine.

01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,086
No, no.

1106
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:37,425
Some friends of yours
are waiting to see you, Your Majesty.

1107
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,332
More, Fisher and Prior Houghton.
It seemed urgent.

1108
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,462
Urgent for them. Send them in.

1109
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,765
I'll tell them as I leave.

1110
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:57,376
Well, the country air
will do him good at Esher.

1111
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,587
The King will see you.

1112
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:09,653
Take heed, Sir Thomas.

1113
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:15,260
The King's passion for the lady
is blind to all reason and past service.

1114
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:20,507
My Lord, for your wisdom,
lam sorry to see you go.

1115
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:27,107
The King has gone beyond me.

1116
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,214
Through that one woman,

1117
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:33,614
I am lost forever.

1118
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:38,486
Do not neglect the King,
but see to your own safety.

1119
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:42,759
It happens, my good lord,
that I have been unwell lately.

1120
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:47,291
Therefore, I have given up my office
and shall leave the court and go home.

1121
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:51,897
There I will speak of nothing
but domestic affairs.

1122
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:54,965
Well, God be with you.

1123
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:36,907
It is Pope or King, there is no other choice.

1124
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:39,078
For me, it must be the Pope.

1125
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,482
I must follow my conscience.

1126
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,815
I cannot sign.

1127
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,923
Though I am sorry to lose old friends,

1128
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:52,095
you will die for it.

1129
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:57,697
There are hundreds of my order who
in good conscience cannot take this oath.

1130
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,136
Must they all die?

1131
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:03,405
If they insist, they will. My cause is just.

1132
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:07,280
The English Church cut off from Rome
is without an anchor.

1133
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,182
The only anchor I know is the King.

1134
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,278
The King had to choose, so must the Clergy.

1135
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:29,760
Well, Sir Thomas?

1136
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,136
I have come to say goodbye, Your Grace.

1137
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:35,870
I gave up my chain of office today,
as you kindly permitted.

1138
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:41,415
And when that day comes when you
have to choose, will you sign the oath?

1139
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:43,846
I shall read the document with care

1140
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:47,820
and hope that my conscience
will permit me to sign, Your Grace.

1141
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,962
Goodbye, Thomas.

1142
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,630
Goodbye, my Lord.

1143
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,703
Goodbye, Prior John.

1144
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:11,004
You leave this world of your own will,

1145
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,739
and I am sad for it.

1146
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:18,479
Your Majesty, it will go on without us.

1147
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,062
(sums)

1148
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:38,538
And that is the last of them
who dare question.

1149
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:43,035
The rest will die silent.

1150
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:06,289
I think there has never been a king
who gave so much to find his way

1151
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,892
to the heart of the woman he loved.

1152
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:14,299
I have stabbed, fought, and clawed my way
through the tissues of the Church and State.

1153
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,434
I've looted and plundered.

1154
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:20,037
I've ripped and torn the bodies
of my friends.

1155
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:23,409
And all to come to this day.

1156
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,115
And yet, not once...

1157
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:33,250
Not once have you said, "I love you."

1158
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:38,060
Now, my Nan...

1159
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,800
My Nan will say it now.

1160
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,169
Yes. I do love you.

1161
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:50,833
No.

1162
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:56,810
No, that's not it. That's not what I meant.

1163
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:58,442
What more do you want, my Lord?

1164
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,544
I don't know, Nan.

1165
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:02,454
I don't know, but I still don't have you.

1166
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:06,719
Tell me, Nan,
did someone some day say to you,

1167
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:11,663
"Never give in to him, never melt to him,
never forget to hate him for a time,

1168
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,963
"otherwise you'll lose him"?

1169
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,866
I've said it to myself.

1170
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,598
And do you say so still?

1171
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:19,999
Yes.

1172
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:21,836
I see.

1173
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:25,442
I see.

1174
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:33,010
Keep your heart, then!
Preserve your special chastity.

1175
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:38,518
I'm too old to suffer the longings
and passions and frenzy of a stupid boy!

1176
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,827
Writing poems in the middle of the night
to the cold-hearted bitch that I love

1177
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:44,330
and tearing them up.

1178
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,597
Pacing up and down, pacing up and down
in my room, unable to sleep.

1179
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:55,335
Sons you have promised me when
you are Queen, and sons I will have.

1180
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,571
Sons without love, if I must.

1181
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,877
Enjoy your palace.

1182
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:07,847
I will not come near you again
until the marriage day.

1183
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:11,685
Henry!

1184
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,529
I do love you.

1185
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:20,867
Henry, I love you.
I love you with all my heart. I love you.

1186
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:25,400
Can this be true?

1187
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:26,770
I love you.

1188
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:30,242
Take me, take me now.
I want to be yours only.

1189
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:33,477
I've been yours for a long time.

1190
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:38,312
Now you for the first time are mine, too.

1191
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:09,009
Henry.
Mmm-hmm?

1192
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,811
These men who are to die,

1193
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,146
let them live.

1194
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:19,024
It was done for you.

1195
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:21,288
I no longer care about the divorce.

1196
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:25,665
I'm so in love with you, my darling heart.

1197
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,396
Can it be true after this long time?

1198
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:37,472
God in heaven, I do love you
with my whole heart.

1199
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:38,637
(sum-nus)

1200
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:43,140
And our love will make a son
that will rule the world.

1201
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:46,914
Our son. A son. A son.

1202
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,513
With that and with your love,
I'll be the King I've always wanted to be,

1203
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:52,855
wise, generous, just, merciful.

1204
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:57,824
So I'll kill no man for you.

1205
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:00,996
It's like a new age.

1206
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:05,199
Wildfire in the air and in the blood.

1207
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:41,501
Harry!

1208
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:53,345
The King sent for me to meet him here.

1209
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:54,547
Here?

1210
01:29:56,257 --> 01:29:57,246
(CHUCKLES)

1211
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:02,222
Perhaps he is jealous and testing
my faithfulness by bringing us together.

1212
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:03,854
Perhaps.

1213
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:05,728
Has he reason to be jealous?

1214
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,563
No. Never.

1215
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:12,764
Well, well. You're his concubine.
I have a hag for a wife.

1216
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,900
Now I am to arrest Wolsey who began it all.

1217
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:17,035
Cold comfort.

1218
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:19,136
Arrest him? He's old and sick.

1219
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,204
I thought it was your doing.

1220
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:23,580
No. I'm past hating him.

1221
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,387
Give him the warrant.

1222

01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,701

No, you great royal fool.

1228
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,514
I'm a happy man.

Cromwell tells me
that when the dance was ended,

she was sent away under guard.

As far away as I could send her,
since we don't own Scotland.

Your Majesty, the people say
that you are the witch Queen.

Are we ruled by superstition?

1410

Katherine still lives in the heart
of the people.

1411
01:45:29,022 --> 01:45:33,186
The people say that her daughter is the heir
and yours the bastard.

I do not fear the people.

and tearing the King away
from the true Church.

1415
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:46,935
As they hate me
for despoiling the monasteries.

But the King, they truly love.

1417

You and I, madam,
live in the protection of the King.

So?

1419
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:02,550
So in Parliament, which speaks
for the people, there is a bill.

It makes your daughter the heir
and Katherine's daughter, Mary, illegitimate.

1422
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:16,360
If the King does not wish it,
the Act of Succession will not be passed.

1423
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:21,032
Would you sacrifice the child of our love

1424
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:24,373
to get a silly little harlot
brought back to court?

1425
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:27,140
One daughter is much like another.

1426
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,876
I care not who's named bastard
when I'm dead.

1427
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:31,645
And if I bring Jane Seymour back,

1428
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:35,017
you will have Parliament pass
the Act of Succession?

1429
01:46:39,326 --> 01:46:40,384
Yes.

1430
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:44,087
What a liar you are.

1431
01:46:47,367 --> 01:46:52,270
What good is that Act
unless every man in the kingdom

1432
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:56,742
who has power to accept my child
as legitimate heir

1433
01:46:56,810 --> 01:47:01,338
first swears an oath of fealty to you
as Head of the Church?

1434
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:04,748
And if they do not,
Act of Succession or no Act of Succession,

1435
01:47:04,818 --> 01:47:08,345
they will say my child is the bastard,
and there's an end!

1436
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:19,092
Go.

Nan, if you love me, don't defy me.
Bring her back.

1439
01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:44,053
I love you.

1440
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:48,822
I shall go to my grave loving you,
no doubt, and hating you.

1441
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:52,595
I will bring her back to my court

1442
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:57,103
if the oath is sworn by all men of power,
high and low.

1443
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:59,365
But those who refuse must die.

1444
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:02,340
You once said they must not die.

1445
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:04,138
And it was you who once said they must.

1446

And now so say I.

Anne.

1449

If you love me, forget the succession.

1450
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:19,656
If you remember how it all came about,

1451
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:23,958
how can you look me in my eyes
and say our daughter will not succeed?

1452
01:48:25,298 --> 01:48:28,893
Because it would need unlimited murder.
Nan, look at me.

1453
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:31,460
Is it fitting I should be Head of the Church,
Pope and King at once,

1454
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:34,939
a farce, a monumental tragic farce,
so that so many men must die?

1455
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:36,202
Could you sign the death warrants?

1456
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:40,679
I'd sign 10,000
rather than disinherit my blood!

1457
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:44,239
It's that,
or else it's my blood and Elizabeth's.

1458
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:47,753
Cromwell knows that.
Your butcher cleaver man knows that.

1459

Send him out to implement these details
and let it be done quickly.

High or low, they will sign.
I wish I were loved, but I'm not.

1461
01:48:56,429 --> 01:49:00,422
And yet I am Queen of this island
and Elizabeth also shall be Queen.

No.

For Elizabeth, no.

1464
01:49:06,306 --> 01:49:08,740
For her, I will not commit murder.

1465

Anne, if we had a male heir,
your son and mine...

1466
01:49:17,317 --> 01:49:22,084
I can be angrier than you've seen me yet.
I know where your heart is, it's not with me.

1467
01:49:22,155 --> 01:49:25,318
What has love got to do
with the getting of a king?

1468
01:49:25,692 --> 01:49:31,153
I'm not young. I'm not true. I'm bitter.
I'm envious. I'm dangerous. I'm malicious!

1469
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:38,866
It's your misfortune that you love me
now that I no longer love you.

1470
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:45,270
And yet, at this moment I want you,

1471
01:49:46,746 --> 01:49:50,045
because of the anger in your face
and the spark of blood in your cheek.

No.

and everything would be forgotten.

No! Not unless you kill them,
More and Houghton and Fisher

not unless Elizabeth is your heir!

I'll kill them, then.

Divorce is like killing.

it doesn't seem so difficult.

Indeed. Indeed.
I divorced Katherine in good faith.

But since that time, I have discovered
an impediment to my marriage to Anne.

Ah, the advantages of music.

1550

It doesn't.

And it is true that she likes to
have you close to her, is it not?

1559
01:56:31,484 --> 01:56:34,544
Without boasting,
I believe she prefers me to many.

1560
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:36,315
She prefers my style to the Italian.

1561

It is nearer to the manner
she learned to love in the French court.

than a pleasant singing voice.

01:57:20,166 --> 01:57:21,599
I'm sorry...

1575
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:24,162
Which?

1576
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:30,168
You're too simple to spy, I know that.

1577
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:33,174
So it is love. You love her?

1578
01:57:33,246 --> 01:57:34,645
No! No!

1579
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:36,648
You do not love your Queen?

1580
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:40,379
Well, yes, all right, I do love her.
As my Queen.

1581
01:57:40,453 --> 01:57:41,647
And she loves you.

1582
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:43,382
No, sir, of course not.

1583
01:57:44,157 --> 01:57:46,921
Barton, come out here. Bring your papers.

1584
01:57:48,528 --> 01:57:50,996
The last reply, but one.

1585
01:57:51,964 --> 01:57:54,762
"Well, yes, all right, I do love her."

1586
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:56,800
What are you trying to make me say?

1587
01:57:56,869 --> 01:57:58,302
The truth.

1588
01:57:58,371 --> 01:58:00,635
That you are the Queen's lover.

1589
01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:01,764
Oh, no.

1590
01:58:03,443 --> 01:58:05,434
No! No!

1591
01:58:05,511 --> 01:58:06,978
You first slept with her in February.

1592
01:58:07,046 --> 01:58:08,070
Never! I never!

1593
01:58:08,147 --> 01:58:09,136
On the 18th of February.

1594
01:58:09,215 --> 01:58:10,375
No!

1595
01:58:11,684 --> 01:58:13,174
No!

1596
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:16,187
Surely you remember
such an important date?

1597
01:58:16,255 --> 01:58:17,313
No!

1598
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:19,187
Come, try to remember.

1599

(SCREAMING)

01:58:21,694 --> 01:58:23,719
No! No! No!

1601
01:58:26,466 --> 01:58:27,490
Try!

1602
01:58:27,567 --> 01:58:32,197
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1603
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:40,006
Anyone can walk,
but can you walk with a train?

1604
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:41,307
Yes.

1605
01:58:41,581 --> 01:58:43,173
All right, head up.

1606
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:46,947
Go on. Good!

1607
01:58:47,787 --> 01:58:52,417
Don't look around. Go on.
It will follow you like a kitten's tail.

1608
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:56,558
Oh, what a queen it will make some day.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1610
01:58:57,730 --> 01:58:58,890
Enter.

1611

Madam, the Duke of Norfolk insists...

Uncle!

1613
01:59:02,401 --> 01:59:04,767
This is a rare honor nowadays.

1614
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:08,336
Leave us.

1615
01:59:13,146 --> 01:59:15,546
Nan, brace yourself, girl.

1616
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:18,040
I have a warrant for your arrest.

1617
01:59:20,119 --> 01:59:21,643
For my arrest?

1618
01:59:22,655 --> 01:59:23,917
A poor joke.

1619
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:26,083
It's not a joke, Anne.

1620
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:29,856
I could've let others do it,
but I felt I could do it more gently.

1621
01:59:29,929 --> 01:59:34,161
But I'm the Queen. How could I be arrested?
For what?

1622
01:59:34,233 --> 01:59:37,862
Adultery, it says here.
Nonsense, no doubt, but there it is.

1623
01:59:37,937 --> 01:59:40,303
Adultery? With whom?

1624
01:59:40,373 --> 01:59:42,773
(CHUCKLING)
Smeaton, Norris, and others.

1625
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:44,332
I thought you were serious.

1626
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:45,468
I am.

1627
01:59:46,312 --> 01:59:50,976
I am to take you to the Tower.
There's to be a trial. I am to preside.

1628
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:53,614
But I'm the Queen.

1629
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:55,252
My child, she's the King's heir.

1630
01:59:55,321 --> 01:59:56,754
You're to leave her with your women.

1631
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:58,221
My women...
Anne, you must come at once.

Master Kingston,
shall I be shut in a dungeon?

1637
02:00:48,341 --> 02:00:49,865
No, madam.

1638
02:00:49,942 --> 02:00:54,072
You will be lodged near the room where
you lay on the night before your coronation.

1639
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:57,780
Oh, Jesus, have mercy on me.

(CELL GATE OPENING)

1641
02:01:32,785 --> 02:01:34,446
lam Lady Kingston, madam,

1642
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:36,715
and will wait upon you,
whatever your wishes are.

1643
02:01:36,789 --> 02:01:41,021
Will you? Then go away. Leave me!

1644
02:01:41,093 --> 02:01:43,323
I fear, madam, that she must stay.

1645
02:01:43,396 --> 02:01:46,365
Every word spoken to you or by you
must be reported.

1646
02:01:46,432 --> 02:01:48,559
Send them away, Norfolk!

But...

Leave us!

Shall I ever be allowed to walk out

Shall I ever be free?

1651
02:02:25,771 --> 02:02:30,538
Norris, Weston, his friends?

1652
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:34,636
His friends since I first met him?

1653
02:02:34,714 --> 02:02:36,944
And they are accused with me?

1654
02:02:37,249 --> 02:02:38,307
Yes.

1655
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:42,182
He is willing to kill them to get rid of me?

1656
02:02:42,254 --> 02:02:44,313
To kill his closest friends?

Why have they arrested him?

1660
02:02:55,067 --> 02:02:57,797
He also is accused of being your lover.

1661
02:03:00,172 --> 02:03:01,833
Incest.

1662
02:03:06,178 --> 02:03:08,578
Oh, God help me. The King is mad.

I am doomed.

1664
02:03:12,284 --> 02:03:16,118
Your Highness,
you are accused of high treason

1665
02:03:16,188 --> 02:03:20,090
in that you, being the lawfully wedded wife
of our Sovereign Lord the King,

1666
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:21,956
did commit adultery.

1667
02:03:22,027 --> 02:03:24,291
I ask that you answer my questions.

1668
02:03:24,363 --> 02:03:27,298
By what lawful authority am I called here?

1669
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:30,498
I am your Queen.

1670
02:03:30,569 --> 02:03:34,562
And, as such, share the King's immunity
from arrest and trial.

1671
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:37,803
Norris, Weston, Smeaton, and Breareton
were tried, found guilty,

1672
02:03:37,877 --> 02:03:39,071
and condemned 10 days ago.

1673
02:03:39,145 --> 02:03:41,443
If they are guilty, then you are guilty.

1674
02:03:41,514 --> 02:03:42,913
Did they plead guilty?

1675
02:03:42,982 --> 02:03:44,574
They were found guilty.

1676
02:03:44,650 --> 02:03:47,175
They were innocent as I am innocent!

1677
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,619
Any man, no matter who he is,
who says the contrary is a liar!

1678
02:03:54,794 --> 02:03:58,127
CROMWELL: My Lord, the warrant of treason
was issued by direction of the King.

1679
02:03:58,197 --> 02:04:00,859
That is sufficient to give
this tribunal jurisdiction.

1680
02:04:00,933 --> 02:04:05,393
However, so that there may be no possibility
of doubt as to the guilt of the Queen,

1681
02:04:05,471 --> 02:04:07,371
will my Lord call the first witness?

1682
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,102
Call the Earl of Rochford.

1683
02:04:10,176 --> 02:04:13,168
George Boleyn, Earl of Rochford,
come into court.

1684
02:04:13,245 --> 02:04:15,076
The Earl of Rochford.

1685
02:04:22,688 --> 02:04:24,485
NORFOLK: Read the indictment.

1686
02:04:26,091 --> 02:04:28,787
George Boleyn,
you are accused of high treason,

1687
02:04:28,861 --> 02:04:32,228
in that on certain days and dates,
here and after specified,

1688
02:04:32,298 --> 02:04:35,392
you did commit adultery
with Anne, Queen of England.

1689
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:39,131
Being your own sister in the flesh,
an act of incest.

1690
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:41,639
No! Not true!

1691
02:04:41,707 --> 02:04:43,971
It is not your turn to speak.

1692
02:04:44,877 --> 02:04:47,937
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

1693
02:04:48,013 --> 02:04:52,074
You are a foul liar,
and my judges are your creatures.

1694
02:04:53,686 --> 02:04:57,884
Stand up, Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire.
Come to the bar.

1695
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:07,388
Do you recognize these two here accused,

1696
02:05:07,466 --> 02:05:11,459
known as Anne and George Boleyn,
as issue of your body?

1697
02:05:11,937 --> 02:05:12,926
I do.

1698
02:05:13,005 --> 02:05:14,700
Look at them, my Lord.

1699
02:05:17,209 --> 02:05:21,805
By the same mother, Elizabeth Howard,
daughter of the late Duke of Norfolk,

1700
02:05:22,548 --> 02:05:25,540
and therefore full brother and sister
in the flesh

1701
02:05:25,618 --> 02:05:28,917
so that their lying together would be incest?

1702
02:05:30,155 --> 02:05:32,487
Yes.
CROMWELL: For which the penalty is death.

1703
02:05:32,558 --> 02:05:34,549
Proper evidence in this matter
will be introduced later.

1704
02:05:34,627 --> 02:05:36,424
Remove the prisoner.

1705
02:05:46,071 --> 02:05:47,595
NORFOLK: That's all, my Lord.

1706
02:05:47,673 --> 02:05:48,901
As father of the accused,

1707
02:05:48,974 --> 02:05:51,841
you are now excused your duty as a judge
and may leave.

1708
02:06:00,452 --> 02:06:03,012
NORFOLK: Master Cromwell,
present your next witness.

1709
02:06:03,088 --> 02:06:05,249
Mark Smeaton, come into court.

1710
02:06:05,324 --> 02:06:06,484
BAILIFF: Mark Smeaton.

1711
02:06:24,076 --> 02:06:27,739
My Lords, this man was tried
as a commoner.

1712
02:06:27,813 --> 02:06:30,748
He confessed and was found guilty
of adultery with the Queen

1713
02:06:30,816 --> 02:06:33,080
by a jury of his own order.

1714
02:06:33,152 --> 02:06:35,746
He will give evidence against the Queen.

1715
02:06:35,821 --> 02:06:37,550
Put your questions.

1716
02:06:41,694 --> 02:06:47,098
Smeaton, did you have carnal relations
with the Queen?

1717
02:06:52,071 --> 02:06:54,596
Smeaton, did you lie with the Queen?

1718
02:06:57,643 --> 02:06:58,769
No.

1719
02:07:00,746 --> 02:07:03,738
There is mercy only for those
that tell the truth.

1720
02:07:03,816 --> 02:07:06,148
Three men have been found guilty
on your evidence.

1721
02:07:06,218 --> 02:07:07,845
Was that evidence perjury?

1722
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,718
You confessed to your own guilt
knowing the penalty for treason,

1723
02:07:10,789 --> 02:07:14,088
knowing, unless the King is merciful,
that you will be hanged,

1724
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:18,255
cut down while you still live, disemboweled
and your heart torn out while it still beats!

1725
02:07:18,330 --> 02:07:21,163
The King will not be merciful if you lie!

1726
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:23,458
Did you have carnal relations
with the Queen?

1727
02:07:23,535 --> 02:07:24,593
Yes!

1728
02:07:26,105 --> 02:07:27,868
My Lord of Norfolk,

1729
02:07:28,974 --> 02:07:30,236
may I question this man?

1730
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:32,300
I have not finished.

1731
02:07:32,378 --> 02:07:35,609
Justice must be seen to be done,
Master Cromwell.

1732
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:36,937
Proceed.

1733
02:07:37,016 --> 02:07:38,278
Thank you, my Lord.

1734
02:07:46,458 --> 02:07:49,154
Mark, look at me.

1735
02:07:51,797 --> 02:07:56,700
I know well you have been tortured,
but tell them the truth, Mark.

1736
02:07:57,202 --> 02:07:58,760
Have courage.

1737
02:07:58,837 --> 02:07:59,861
It is true.

1738
02:07:59,938 --> 02:08:02,338
Write that. He says the charge is true.

1739
02:08:02,408 --> 02:08:04,467
They have promised you your life,
haven't they?

1740
02:08:04,543 --> 02:08:06,170
If you lie for them?

1741
02:08:06,245 --> 02:08:09,408
Well, they will break the promise.
It would not be safe to leave you alive.

1742
02:08:09,481 --> 02:08:10,470
It is true.

1743
02:08:10,549 --> 02:08:12,244
He says the charge is true for a third time.

1744
02:08:12,317 --> 02:08:14,979
Write it down. We have our evidence.

1745
02:08:15,054 --> 02:08:16,817
Poor gentle singer.

1746
02:08:17,956 --> 02:08:22,017
Isn't it better, if you are to die,
that you die with the truth on your lips?

1747
02:08:22,094 --> 02:08:25,894
I am guilty! I was guilty with the Queen!

1748
02:08:25,964 --> 02:08:29,559
Let me go now. She came to my bed.

1749
02:08:29,635 --> 02:08:31,967
Let me go. She came to my bed, I swear it.

1750
02:08:32,037 --> 02:08:36,303
Even when she tells him he will die anyway,
he still admits his guilt.

1751
02:08:36,375 --> 02:08:38,366
Write that. Take him out.

1752
02:08:40,212 --> 02:08:41,839
No. Wait.

1753
02:08:44,516 --> 02:08:47,451
My husband, the King.

1754
02:08:57,029 --> 02:08:58,462
Smeaton,

1755
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:03,330
how many times did the Queen
come to your bed? How many times?

1756
02:09:03,402 --> 02:09:04,426
Many times.

1757
02:09:04,503 --> 02:09:05,800
When?

1758
02:09:05,871 --> 02:09:07,099
I don't remember.

1759
02:09:07,172 --> 02:09:08,434
You will remember, Smeaton.

1760
02:09:08,507 --> 02:09:12,409
Call it to mind or you'll speak with those
who can jog your memory.

1761
02:09:12,478 --> 02:09:16,005
Where did you couch with the Queen,
my wife?

1762
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:17,139
York Place.

1763
02:09:17,216 --> 02:09:18,547
That's a lie.

1764
02:09:18,617 --> 02:09:21,450
It could never have happened at York Place.
You shared a room with two others.

1765
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,612
No, no, it was at Windsor.

1766
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:24,815
Oh, fool, she never went to Windsor
except with me.

1767
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:26,482
Can you think of no better lie?
It was many places.

1768
02:09:26,558 --> 02:09:29,959
She came to my bed.
It was wherever you like, whenever you like.

1769
02:09:30,028 --> 02:09:33,862
Oh, God, help me. Let me go free.
I'll say whatever you like.

1770
02:09:34,233 --> 02:09:37,566
Did Cromwell promise you your life
if you said this?

1771
02:09:38,871 --> 02:09:40,896
Answer me! Did he?

1772
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,064
Yes.

1773
02:09:43,642 --> 02:09:45,007
He lied.

1774
02:09:46,245 --> 02:09:49,408
Say what you like, Smeaton,
and you will not live.

1775
02:09:49,815 --> 02:09:51,612
Say what you like.

1776
02:09:51,683 --> 02:09:55,175
Speak now without lying,
for it will avail you nothing.

1777
02:09:57,256 --> 02:09:58,314
I am to die?

1778
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:01,120
What happened between you
and the Queen?

1779
02:10:02,027 --> 02:10:03,392
Between us?

1780
02:10:06,165 --> 02:10:07,427
Nothing.

1781
02:10:09,067 --> 02:10:13,834
She was kind and pleasant and just.

1782
02:10:14,807 --> 02:10:16,604
I would not hurt her.

1783
02:10:17,409 --> 02:10:21,812
I lied because they have broken me
with ropes and irons,

1784
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:24,314
and then promised I would go free.

1785
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,141
Take him away.

1786
02:10:42,935 --> 02:10:44,163
And yet.

1787
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,501
It could be true.

1788
02:11:17,703 --> 02:11:19,637
For six years...

1789
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:28,707
This year and this,

1790
02:11:30,082 --> 02:11:31,606
and this,

1791
02:11:32,351 --> 02:11:33,875
and this,

1792
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:37,886
I did not love him.

1793
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:42,349
And then I did.

1794
02:11:44,496 --> 02:11:46,020
Then I was his.

1795
02:11:47,799 --> 02:11:51,462
I can count the days I was his in hundreds.

1796
02:12:00,212 --> 02:12:02,009
The days we bedded.

1797
02:12:05,517 --> 02:12:06,916
Married.

1798
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:13,417
Were happy.

1799
02:12:17,195 --> 02:12:18,787
Bore Elizabeth.

1800
02:12:23,268 --> 02:12:24,496
Hated.

1801
02:12:29,308 --> 02:12:30,605
Lusted.

1802
02:12:35,547 --> 02:12:37,310
Bore a dead child,

1803
02:12:41,353 --> 02:12:43,344
which condemned me

1804
02:12:49,428 --> 02:12:50,895
to death.

1805
02:12:58,837 --> 02:13:00,361
In all,

1806
02:13:02,674 --> 02:13:05,142
one thousand days.

1807
02:13:07,312 --> 02:13:09,109
Just a thousand.

1808
02:13:10,882 --> 02:13:12,349
Strange.

1809
02:13:14,152 --> 02:13:18,111
And of those thousand, one,

1810
02:13:19,091 --> 02:13:22,652
when we were both in love, only one,

1811
02:13:22,728 --> 02:13:27,131
when our loves met and overlapped
and were both mine and his.

1812
02:13:31,570 --> 02:13:34,095
And when I no longer hated him,

1813
02:13:37,209 --> 02:13:39,302
he began to hate me.

1814
02:13:41,446 --> 02:13:43,710
Except for that one day.

1815
02:13:47,552 --> 02:13:50,419
I'm not hungry. Take the food and leave me.

1816
02:13:52,090 --> 02:13:53,250
Nan,

1817
02:13:54,793 --> 02:13:56,192
is it true?

1818
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:01,765
Have you stepped into your own trap,
my Lord?

1819
02:14:02,768 --> 02:14:07,899
Any evidence you have against me,
you yourself bought and paid for.

1820
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:11,038
Do you now begin to believe it?

1821
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:12,201
Anne.

1822
02:14:13,245 --> 02:14:17,113
Anne, the court is still in session
to decide your verdict.

1823
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:19,574
I don't want to hear your guilt from them.

1824
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:21,380
I want to hear it from you,
from your own lips.

1825
02:14:21,453 --> 02:14:22,818
That I was unfaithful to you?

1826
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:24,719
Yes, just that.

1827
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:28,055
Were you unfaithful to me
whilst I still loved you?

1828
02:14:29,361 --> 02:14:31,488
Of course I'll never know.

1829
02:14:31,863 --> 02:14:34,957
Whether you say aye or no,
I shall never know.

1830
02:14:35,033 --> 02:14:38,298
You come here to make sure
whether there was truly adultery

1831
02:14:38,370 --> 02:14:42,363
because that would touch
your manhood or your pride,

1832
02:14:42,441 --> 02:14:46,275
and even so,
my heart and my eyes are glad of you.

1833
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:51,647
Fool of all women that I am,
I'm glad of you here.

1834
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:55,711
Go, then.

1835
02:14:55,787 --> 02:15:00,224
Keep your pride of manhood,
you know about me now.

1836
02:15:01,293 --> 02:15:05,787
Nan, is it true that you're glad to see me?

1837
02:15:05,864 --> 02:15:07,263
Yes, it's true.

1838
02:15:07,332 --> 02:15:12,429
Then, Anne,
let's do all gently for old time's sake.

1839
02:15:12,504 --> 02:15:16,964
I have no wish to harm you,
and your words have moved me deeply.

1840
02:15:18,076 --> 02:15:20,544
I must be free to have a son,

1841
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:23,945
and the son must be free to rule England
when I die.

1842
02:15:24,015 --> 02:15:26,279
Why must you leave a king
to follow you, Henry?

1843
02:15:26,351 --> 02:15:27,477
Why not a queen?

1844
02:15:27,552 --> 02:15:31,215
This country has never been ruled by
a queen. I know it never could be.

1845
02:15:33,525 --> 02:15:36,585
We can never have a son now,
and God has spoken.

1846
02:15:37,696 --> 02:15:40,494
I must have a son elsewhere.

1847
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:46,962
And it's getting late.
I'm not as young as I was.

1848
02:15:47,038 --> 02:15:48,699
And what do you want of me?

1849
02:15:48,773 --> 02:15:52,038
Agree to annul the marriage
and give up all rights.

1850
02:15:53,278 --> 02:15:55,803
You shall go abroad
and take Elizabeth with you.

1851
02:15:55,881 --> 02:15:58,111
You will be well cared for.

1852
02:15:58,183 --> 02:16:00,447
Please set me free.

1853
02:16:00,519 --> 02:16:04,250
To marry Seymour
and make our child a bastard?

1854
02:16:05,991 --> 02:16:08,926
No. No. No.

1855
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:13,456
Nan... Nan, you leave me no choice!

1856
02:16:13,532 --> 02:16:17,161
Once, I told you any children we had
would not be bastards.

1857
02:16:17,736 --> 02:16:20,296
You promised marriage and the Crown.

1858
02:16:20,839 --> 02:16:25,003
Now you try to dance out of your promise.
Well, I won't have it!

1859
02:16:25,076 --> 02:16:29,945
We are man and wife together.
King and Queen. I keep that.

1860
02:16:30,749 --> 02:16:33,240
Take it from me as best you can.

1861
02:16:33,318 --> 02:16:36,287
Then you have decided, and so have I!

1862
02:16:37,656 --> 02:16:40,853
Before you go,
perhaps you should hear one thing.

1863
02:16:41,393 --> 02:16:45,762
I lied to you. I said, "I love you," but I lied.

1864
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:49,425
I was untrue. Untrue with many.

1865
02:16:49,501 --> 02:16:51,332
That is a lie.
It is true.

1866
02:16:51,403 --> 02:16:55,635
I was unfaithful to you with all of them.
With half your court!

1867
02:16:55,707 --> 02:16:59,143
With soldiers of your guard, with grooms,
with stable hands.

1868
02:16:59,211 --> 02:17:02,647
Look, for the rest of your life,
at every man that ever knew me

1869
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:06,445
and wonder if I didn't find him
a better man than you!

1870
02:17:06,518 --> 02:17:08,110
You whore!

1871
02:17:09,688 --> 02:17:14,022
But Elizabeth was yours.
Watch her as she grows.

1872
02:17:14,092 --> 02:17:16,720
She's yours. She's a Tudor.

1873
02:17:17,295 --> 02:17:22,562
Get yourself a son on that sweet pale girl
if you can and hope that it will live,

1874
02:17:22,634 --> 02:17:24,659
but Elizabeth shall reign after you.

1875
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:28,399
Yes! Elizabeth, child of Anne the whore

1876
02:17:28,473 --> 02:17:32,239
and Henry the bloodstained lecher,
shall be Queen.

1877
02:17:34,212 --> 02:17:36,180
You've asked for death

1878
02:17:36,781 --> 02:17:38,408
and you shall have it.

1879
02:17:38,483 --> 02:17:40,314
So be it.

1880
02:17:40,385 --> 02:17:44,879
Only what I take to my grave,
you take to yours.

1881
02:17:44,956 --> 02:17:47,015
And think of this, Henry.

1882
02:17:47,859 --> 02:17:51,659
Elizabeth shall be a greater queen
than any king of yours.

1883
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:55,131
She shall rule a greater England
than you could ever have built.

1884
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:59,193
Yes! My Elizabeth shall be Queen,

1885
02:17:59,271 --> 02:18:02,001
and my blood will have been well spent.

1886
02:18:16,888 --> 02:18:18,219
(CRYING)

1887
02:18:30,502 --> 02:18:34,370
She's lying. She was never unfaithful to me.

1888
02:18:36,374 --> 02:18:39,309
She could. Any woman could.

1889
02:18:41,246 --> 02:18:44,181
No. She lies.

1890
02:18:45,650 --> 02:18:49,609
If she lies, let her die for lying.

1891
02:18:51,923 --> 02:18:53,413
Let her die!

1892
02:19:16,081 --> 02:19:17,446
Is everything ready?

1893
02:19:17,515 --> 02:19:20,575
Yes, my Lord. The Queen is at prayer.

1894
02:19:20,652 --> 02:19:23,450
Fetch her. The time for prayer is passed.

1895
02:19:32,731 --> 02:19:33,959
And where is the King?

1896
02:19:34,032 --> 02:19:36,296
At Richmond. Out hunting.

1897
02:19:37,736 --> 02:19:39,795
Will you join him later?

1898
02:19:39,871 --> 02:19:43,136
No, by God.
For me, there's killing enough this day.

02:20:22,046 --> 02:20:23,513
Will it hurt?

02:20:24,816 --> 02:20:27,250
They say not, my Lady.

1902
02:20:28,019 --> 02:20:32,012
The executioner from France
is an expert with the sword.

1903
02:20:33,458 --> 02:20:35,756
I hear that he is good.

1904
02:20:37,128 --> 02:20:38,186
And I have a little neck.

1905
02:20:38,263 --> 02:20:39,321
Oh, My Lady.

1906
02:20:39,397 --> 02:20:42,093
No, Kingston. No.

1907
02:20:42,167 --> 02:20:45,193
Come, I am glad to die.

My Lady?

1911
02:21:18,136 --> 02:21:19,433
Nothing.

Away, my Lords.

Where to, Your Grace?

1917
02:23:19,657 --> 02:23:21,522
To Mistress Seymour's.
