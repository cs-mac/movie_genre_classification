1
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,179
IRA a dollar-franc.

2
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,648
Four-ninety-eight, 40, 60.

3
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:42,040
The market's going against us.
We're exposed on the 100 million.

4
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:45,048
- We're gonna have to bail out.
- We'll take a whopping loss.

5
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,149
We can't buck the tide any longer.

6
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,872
Let me know the damage
when you've finished.

7
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,642
- Hold the phones!
- Hold on.

8
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,175
Okay, no arguments. Everybody cover
their short-currency positions.

9
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,506
Buy yen, sterling, francs, marks.

10
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,365
Sell dollars.

11
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,248
We've got 100 million to dump.

12
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,873
No haggling over prices.

13
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,386
- Dollar's off.
- How much?

14
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,756
Two percent against the mark
in 20 minutes.

15
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,707
It started in Frankfurt.

16
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,032
No. I think you'll find it started
about 10 blocks from here.

17
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:23,194
At Borough National, as a matter of fact.
They're in trouble.

18
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,656
Bailing out of their long-dollar position.
Dumping about 100 million.

19
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,466
Keep talking.
Let me know if it slides further...

20
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,256
...or hits the next big number.

21
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:35,860
Frankfurt? Borough National New York.
A dollar-deutsche mark.

22
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,336
Would you like...?
Can you make me a market of spot francs?

23
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:47,883
- Give me another market!
- Another Geneva for 30-60. Want it?

24
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:51,018
- Sell eight at 30!
- Two, two at 20.

25
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:54,414
Hello, Bern National.
Yeah, how do you trade in French?

26
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:57,871
- What's your spot on yen?
- Take two!

27
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,404
- Three.
- You'll only do three?

28
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,321
- Five million.
- We want sterling.

29
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:02,825
- Four.
- Good.

30
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,561
- What's the dollar-yen, please?
- Five at 75.

31
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,476
- Make it two. That's four.
- Okay.

32
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:16,991
- Take it.
- Four done.

33
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,225
- Do you want it? Forty-60!
- Sell five at 40.

34
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,589
- They'll only take two!
- Take the lousy two!

35
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:26,013
- All right, that's just one!
- I love you too. You're beautiful.

36
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,930
How about four? All right, two.

37
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,296
- Help me out.
- What do you mean there's no market?

38
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,052
It's coming? So is Christmas.

39
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,639
I can't get Bern!
They're closed for the day!

40
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,558
- We look like we're having trouble.
- Europe and the Street...

41
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,304
...know we're dumping.
The dollar's dropping like a rock.

42
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:43,633
All right, we'd better go in.
Long on dollars. Start with Paris.

43
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:47,984
And tell Borough National
they can have 40 mil on Interbank.

44
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:51,406
We're going to have to find someone
to ride shotgun over there.

45
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:54,882
I'm not taking this roller coaster again.

46
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:00,196
<i>Earlier this week,
the dollar slipped 50 points.</i>

47
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:03,427
<i>It recovered. But a lot of people
say things are going to get worse...</i>

48
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:04,770
<i>...before they get better.</i>

49
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:08,066
<i>Others in the banking community
say it was just a flutter.</i>

50
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,384
<i>But if there's one thing all of us
worry about, it's money. Our money.</i>

51
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:14,435
<i>In this case, of course, the dollar.</i>

52
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:17,375
<i>Here tonight to discuss the dollar
is Maxwell Emery...</i>

53
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,478
<i>...president of The First New York Bank.</i>

54
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:23,606
<i>Mr. Emery has sometimes been called
the lion of American banking.</i>

55
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,147
<i>The dollar's been under pressure
so frequently in our history.</i>

56
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:30,833
<i>I don't think these times are exceptional.</i>

57
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:37,708
<i>We go through regular cycles of anxiety.
In fact, we're an anxiety-prone people.</i>

58
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,298
<i>But we've never had anxiety
with so much reason behind it.</i>

59
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,753
<i>Since 1974, when the Arabs
started increasing the price of oil...</i>

60
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:46,887
<i>...they've amassed billions of dollars.</i>

61
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:50,948
<i>Until now, they've been very kind to leave
that money largely in American banks.</i>

62
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,247
<i>Mr. Emery, has there ever been
such a concentration of wealth...</i>

63
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,484
<i>...in the hands of one group before?</i>

64
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,886
<i>No, I think probably not.</i>

65
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:02,942
<i>But I assure you, their interests are ours.</i>

66
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,104
Have a good time.

67
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,762
Thank you.

68
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,386
- Wonderful party.
- Charlie will be by later.

69
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:31,724
- He's working late at the office.
- See you then.

70
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,743
Enjoy yourself.

71
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:53,503
Want an educated opinion?

72
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:57,569
You won't get a glamour boy like Hubbell
Smith to run a rescue operation over there.

73
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,452
He won't touch it with a fork.

74
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:03,444
He might. If the payoff is big enough.

75
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,729
Could I have a white wine
and a Scotch on the rocks, please?

76
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:12,599
Well, Max, I hear you rode in
on your white horse...

77
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,354
...and bailed out Borough National.

78
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,261
Well, that fellow down there is trying,
but he's overmatched.

79
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:21,969
I feel sorry for the poor son of a bitch
who tries to fix that mess.

80
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,578
I said I'd help them
but only if they'd take my boy.

81
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:29,102
Wanna hear the deal?

82
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,329
I don't know, Max.
I did my time in the trenches...

83
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:35,242
...when I was running
those problem loans for you.

84
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,996
I had enough crash-and-burn.

85
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:42,084
Hub...

86
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:47,999
...I'd consider it a personal favor.

87
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:51,010
With those turkeys at Borough National,
miracle is a better word.

88
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:54,966
Now, why do you piss cold water on it
when you know you're interested?

89
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,827
What makes you so sure?

90
00:10:56,992 --> 00:11:00,765
The guy who turns them round
is going to be hero of the week.

91
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:06,291
And we both know
that you're restless, ambitious...

92
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:10,036
...and a sucker for a chance
at a star play.

93
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,322
- That's the spirit that built the West.
- Has either one of you seen Lee Winters?

94
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,904
Last time I saw her
she was over by the band.

95
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,820
Something wrong?

96
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,512
Charlie Winters has been murdered.

97
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,753
A mugger broke into his office
and knifed him.

98
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,221
Oh, my God.

99
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,567
Isn't it?

100
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,533
I love the way he plays too. Don't you?

101
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:48,379
- Hello, Bill.
- Lee, could I talk to you alone?

102
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,040
- Would you excuse us?
- Certainly.

103
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,837
What is it, Hub?

104
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:02,197
Nothing.

105
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:08,145
I was just thinking about
the illusion of safety.

106
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:59,316
<i>- Yes. - You were inquiring
about Charlie Winters...</i>

107
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:04,629
<i>...the other day. I'm sorry to
have to tell you that he's dead.</i>

108
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:09,097
<i>I was struck by the coincidence.</i>

109
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:12,681
Charles Winters.
I'm sorry to hear about that.

110
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,598
<i>I'm sorry to hear about it too.</i>

111
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:20,203
I just wanted you to be aware.

112
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:22,881
Good night.

113
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:34,589
<i>Police have concluded Charles Winters
was murdered by a burglar...</i>

114
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:37,657
<i>...who panicked when Winters,
who was working late, surprised him.</i>

115
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:41,024
<i>No other motivations
for his murder have been found.</i>

116
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:45,013
<i>At his funeral yesterday in New York,
his widow, ex-film star Lee Winters...</i>

117
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:49,272
<i>...was accompanied by leading members
of the corporate and financial world.</i>

118
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,883
<i>So Lee Winters, the poor girl who
came out of the dirt hills of Arkansas...</i>

119
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,049
<i>...to achieve stardom
as the glamorous Ashley Norman...</i>

120
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:58,354
<i>...one of Hollywood's
most respected actresses...</i>

121
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,617
<i>...who, at the height of her career,
gave it up to become the wife...</i>

122
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,536
<i>...of a great American industrialist...</i>

123
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,560
<i>...played today her toughest role:
Where to go from here.</i>

124
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,030
<i>There are rumors that things
aren't what they were...</i>

125
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:13,006
<i>...in the troubled petrochemical empire
built by Winters...</i>

126
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,794
<i>...now facing the critical question
of who will become its next chairman.</i>

127
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:19,971
<i>And now in a...</i>

128
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:24,296
Don't take too long.
Hurry back down.

129
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:29,858
- Gaby, did you take my book?
- What book?

130
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:43,001
Well, Paris, we're seeing
some pressure out of Zurich.

131
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,905
Eleven's ringing. Who's on 11?

132
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:48,145
But we think it's topping out.

133
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,607
We're all atwitter.
Let me have your dollar-franc, please.

134
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,659
The question is, is he ready for us?

135
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,894
I've had a balance sheet worked up...

136
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,504
...and a summary of assets.
Is there anything else you might need?

137
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:06,283
Oh, nothing special.
Your interim financials maybe.

138
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,412
Something showing your cash position,
loan position, deposits.

139
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,880
Also a P & L statement, if you've got one.

140
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:16,928
The maturity schedules on your commercial
paper. Classifications on your loan portfolio.

141
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:19,909
Maybe the last examiner's report.

142
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,557
Oh, and your current profit breakdown.

143
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,442
You sure that'll be enough?

144
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:26,268
For a start.

145
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:01,900
Cheers.

146
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:09,959
Well, doctor, you've been on the case
for a while now. What's the prognosis?

147
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:11,975
Will the patient live?

148
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,720
The patient's been dead for six months
and doesn't know it.

149
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,699
Come on, now. It's not that bad.

150
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,452
No?

151
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,481
Roy, I salute you.

152
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:27,124
Borough National's your masterpiece.

153
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,428
Well, we may have to tighten our belt.

154
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,119
Try it around your neck.

155
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,888
Okay.

156
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:40,429
- I'll call Emery. You can bail out.
- No, I took this trip without a parachute.

157
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,827
- This is when the fun begins.
- Smith, this is not some sort of game.

158
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,606
Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.

159
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,640
You keep talking about a system, Roy.
That's your problem.

160
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:53,869
You can't beat the system,
but you can win a game.

161
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,283
- How?
- First, we have to find a way...

162
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,656
...to get some profit in here now.

163
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,445
Just 3 or 4 million...

164
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:05,057
...so we can meet that dividend
and give ourselves a little time to breathe.

165
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:08,005
A nice, hungry customer
so we can give him a big, fat loan.

166
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:10,054
Say, a couple 100 million.

167
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,864
- Collect the commission.
- Where are we gonna get the money?

168
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,897
I'll find the money.
What we need right now is a customer.

169
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:19,895
We really need a company even more
in the shithouse than we are.

170
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,202
If that's possible.

171
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:28,086
Sit down, Roy.

172
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,744
Talk to me about
the Winterchem Petrochemical Corporation.

173
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,854
We're loaned out to them to the legal limit.

174
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,750
No matter how hungry they are,
we can't give them a thing.

175
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,738
Not even lunch?

176
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:46,119
I'll start with what you're dying to hear.

177
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,288
We don't need to borrow another dime.

178
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:54,565
Well, I don't know what to say.

179
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,837
All we have to do is scale down a little.

180
00:18:57,004 --> 00:19:00,198
Think in more modest terms,
and we should weather the storm.

181
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,781
I don't think it makes any sense at all.

182
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:08,508
This is wrong. You can't cut back on this
company and expect it to ever grow again.

183
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:10,716
The replacement cost
would be astronomical.

184
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,119
We're grateful for your interest
in Winterchem.

185
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:15,736
All the public relations
you've put in for the company.

186
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:19,193
And I know how you must feel,
especially now that Charlie's gone.

187
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,983
Henry, don't patronize me.

188
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:25,590
You know where we went wrong. We let the
competition walk away with the technology.

189
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,664
Instead of cutting,
we must invest in R & D.

190
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,254
Keep the plants going
until new products are developed.

191
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:34,961
- Financed how?
- We'll just get ourselves a moneymaker.

192
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:38,222
There's a small petrochemical plant
in Spain at Valencia.

193
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,898
They're in place.
Their balance sheet looks real good.

194
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:45,708
And they're for sale. We'd have to invest
in some updating and a sure feedstock.

195
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:49,131
If we get it, we'll be buying ourselves
a real cash-flow machine.

196
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:52,193
I hear you, but that kind of capital
is simply not available.

197
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,438
Sorry, good people. I'm running late.

198
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,739
Roy, fill me in on the rest of this later.

199
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,465
Ms. Winters.

200
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:01,151
- Henry.
- Delighted to have met you.

201
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:04,380
- Warner.
- Good to see you.

202
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:12,476
That's a hell of a fella. I think
we're gonna enjoy working with him.

203
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,439
Let me speak with Lee Winters, please.
She's at the far corner table.

204
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,969
Lee, you're gonna be opening
the Palm Beach house soon?

205
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,852
Sorry, Mrs. Winters, a call for you.

206
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,852
Thank you. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

207
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,028
Yes, this is Mrs. Winters.

208
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,098
<i>How good are you
at keeping a straight face?</i>

209
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:36,267
<i>Because your Valencia deal
happens to be full of holes.</i>

210
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:40,620
Helen, I can't talk now.
I'm at a luncheon meeting.

211
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,117
<i>- Lf you have some messages...
- Try this on Helen.</i>

212
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:45,829
<i>Number one, what about
currency translation?</i>

213
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:48,843
<i>A Spanish plant has peseta obligations.
If the peseta goes up...</i>

214
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:51,620
<i>...your dollar earnings won't be worth
a plate of frijoles.</i>

215
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,726
<i>Two, how about labor stability?</i>

216
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:57,887
<i>Half the country's busy slipping bombs
in the pockets of the other half.</i>

217
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:01,183
<i>Three, Winterchem's tapped out
with us at Borough National.</i>

218
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:03,998
<i>How do you figure to fund
the acquisition?</i>

219
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:06,877
I see.

220
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,763
Is that all, Helen?

221
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:13,147
<i>Sorry, but I didn't wanna embarrass you
in front of Tweedledum and Tweedledee...</i>

222
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,235
<i>...since it's obvious that you wanna be
the new chairman of the board.</i>

223
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:23,573
No, absolutely not. Would you tell him
I'm out of town, please?

224
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,097
I'm sorry. Some people
just don't understand business.

225
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,414
Absolutely.
Of course we're gonna show a profit.

226
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:56,606
One, their currency may be unstable, but
they have to sell in international markets...

227
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:58,713
...so our dollar wouldn't be affected.

228
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:02,328
Two, the Spanish labor market
happens to be relatively strike-free...

229
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:05,430
...which you would have known
if you'd bothered to check, as I did.

230
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,008
Three, there are other banks that recognize
a sound investment when they see one.

231
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,888
As for that "chairman
of the board" remark...

232
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,176
...Mr. Smith, I don't know
what you're talking about.

233
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:25,545
How much stock did you say
her husband left her?

234
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,953
You were saying?

235
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,057
I thought we ought to have a drink on it.

236
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:51,392
On what exactly?

237
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:54,046
Your future at Winterchem.

238
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:00,533
Scotch, if you don't mind, with a twist.

239
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:03,669
Mr. Smith, you must have me confused
with an executive.

240
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:06,040
They tolerated me on the board
because of Charlie.

241
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:11,918
But now that he's gone, I'm just
an ex-movie star coasting into the sunset.

242
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,389
Not someone throwing them
a curve ball at lunch...

243
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:17,419
...about a Spanish petrochemical plant.

244
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,527
I'd say you coast pretty good.

245
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,545
Where'd you learn the moves?

246
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:25,382
Charlie involved me a lot in the business.

247
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:28,072
And when I was an actress,
I had my own company.

248
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,166
I made my own deals.
Charlie always says I have...

249
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:37,983
Charlie used to say I had good instincts.

250
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:46,268
Well, we're playing the classic scene,
aren't we?

251
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,996
The banker and the widow.

252
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:51,710
I'm sorry. I guess this is all too soon.

253
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:55,134
Of course it's too soon.
Everything's too soon, isn't it?

254
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:58,425
The company's in trouble too soon.
Charlie died too soon.

255
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,345
So what?

256
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:06,036
It'd be funny, wouldn't it?

257
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:10,288
If the banker helped the widow
walk off with the chairmanship.

258
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,408
Hilarious.

259
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,899
You mind telling me how?

260
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:21,643
- Your Valencia deal.
- I thought you said it was full of holes.

261
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,425
I thought you said
you didn't wanna be chairman.

262
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,176
Too bad because Ackerman's
just blowing smoke...

263
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:31,430
...about all this so-called support.
Nobody really wants to sell off.

264
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,114
Nobody wants to be on the board
of a shrinking company.

265
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:36,669
You nail that deal, you have a real shot.

266
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,529
Providing they took me seriously.

267
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:42,402
Come up with the 500 million to buy
that plant, and they'll take you seriously.

268
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:47,134
All you need is the okay
from Ackerman to go after it.

269
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:51,606
And I'm in a position to put you
together with the money.

270
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:53,877
There are risks involved.

271
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:59,603
I've never been afraid of risks.

272
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,405
That was Scotch with a twist.

273
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,775
For one thing, I'm not gonna get the okay.

274
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:12,590
Aren't you the man that told me
Winterchem...

275
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:14,412
...was borrowed out with the bank?

276
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,268
I'm the man.

277
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:20,260
- Where's the money supposed to come from?
- Private placement. Outside source.

278
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:23,299
- Direct?
- Through an agent I know.

279
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:25,923
We'd have to negotiate with his people.

280
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:30,824
Probably be a joint venture if they put up
the capital and share the profits.

281
00:25:32,904 --> 00:25:36,098
And the bank collects 1 percent
for setting it up.

282
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:40,866
On 500 million, that's 5 million profit.
No risk to you.

283
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:47,005
You have a very profitable
sense of humor, Mr. Smith.

284
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:50,301
You wouldn't deny me a little incentive,
would you?

285
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:52,856
No.

286
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,443
Was that on the rocks or straight up?

287
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:02,069
Of course, we do have to handle her
very carefully.

288
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,709
Yes. She is sitting on the largest block
of company stock.

289
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:10,217
If she sells her stock to some outfit,
we could all be out on our collective ass.

290
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,174
I say to hell with her damn stock.

291
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,044
What's she gonna do, unload
600,000 shares? That's her meal ticket.

292
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:18,987
<i>This isn't The Washington Post,
and she's not Katherine Graham.</i>

293
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:24,130
And I'll tell you, that woman is not going
to negotiate any deals for this management.

294
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:26,435
Ever.

295
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:30,588
Would you ask Mrs. Winters
to come in, please?

296
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:33,729
Next thing she'll want
to be chairman of the board.

297
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:43,032
Now, Lee, we want you to know
you'll always have a home at Winterchem.

298
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:46,459
Remember, we'll always be happy
to hear any suggestions you might have.

299
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,009
<i>- Mr. Ackerman, please.
- One moment, please.</i>

300
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:51,479
<i>- At least we didn't overestimate him.
- Hello.</i>

301
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:53,234
<i>- Warner, this is Hub.
- Hi, what's up?</i>

302
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,953
Nothing special. I just thought
it was time we sat down...

303
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,282
...and had a talk
about rescheduling your loans.

304
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,707
<i>- Maybe lunch next week?
- How about Thursday?</i>

305
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:03,468
Right, fine.

306
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:07,375
By the way, I had a talk
with that Japanese conglomerate...

307
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,925
<i>...that's buying up every company in sight.
- Did you?</i>

308
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,679
Yeah, Shigemitsu-Han.

309
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:15,234
They wanted to talk about
the Winterchem financials.

310
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,720
Of course, I wouldn't,
but I thought you ought to know.

311
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,344
<i>No problem.
They tried to take us over last year...</i>

312
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:23,334
<i>...but couldn't get enough stock.</i>

313
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,916
Well, in that case, we can all relax.

314
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,646
So where do you guys like to eat?

315
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,299
<i>How about the Bibliotheque
next Thursday at 1?</i>

316
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:33,401
<i>- Thursday at 1, right.
- See you then.</i>

317
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,548
I can't wait to see their faces
when they think I'm gonna sell my stock.

318
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,125
<i>- Hello.
- Helen.</i>

319
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:45,999
Would you contact Shigemitsu-Han and ask
if we can have lunch Thursday at 1.

320
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,444
Thursday at 1.

321
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,359
Hi, Lee.

322
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:38,522
So she won't sell her stock, huh?

323
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:40,658
Good move, Warner.

324
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:44,848
Well, I'm starved. How about you guys?

325
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,886
- I could use a drink.
- So could I.

326
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:51,626
How did I do?

327
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:54,479
Ackerman didn't eat a bite.

328
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:57,550
- How long do we have to wait?
- As long as it takes.

329
00:28:57,874 --> 00:29:00,239
- Lf it takes.
- Patience, patience.

330
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,854
They have to huddle first.

331
00:29:03,023 --> 00:29:07,777
Look unconcerned, get back to the office
and argue a little bit.

332
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,935
They're probably flipping a coin right now
to see who has to make the call.

333
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:17,502
Yeah.

334
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:19,621
Right, put him on.

335
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:25,689
Guess who lost.

336
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,119
Hey, Warner, long time no see.

337
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,205
<i>Hi. Listen, Hub,
I know you'll think I'm nuts...</i>

338
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:38,585
<i>...but we may let Lee Winters check out the
financing on that Spanish thing after all.</i>

339
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:42,322
<i>She's got an idea she can find
the 500 million somewhere privately.</i>

340
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:45,901
<i>She'll probably give away the family jewels
to get it.</i>

341
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:50,090
Would it make you happier
if I kept an eye on her for you?

342
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:53,515
<i>Jesus, could you?
That would be really terrific.</i>

343
00:29:53,682 --> 00:29:56,363
<i>- We don't want to look like total idiots.
- Consider it done.</i>

344
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:59,818
<i>Hub, I want you to know
we'll always be grateful.</i>

345
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:02,369
Just your friendly neighborhood banker.

346
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:04,874
They'll always be grateful.

347
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:07,140
We're not there yet.

348
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,198
You still have to meet the agent
for the 500 million tonight at Emery's.

349
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:14,493
Any ideas on how I should handle it?

350
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,416
Straightforward.

351
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,848
We've got nothing to hide.

352
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:21,244
Do we?

353
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:37,453
Please, Ms. Winters, excuse me.
I know this isn't the time or place...

354
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:40,721
...but did your husband ever mention
Jerry Fewster?

355
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:44,877
There's someone named Fewster. Did your
husband ever mention anything about him?

356
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:47,080
In what connection?

357
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,209
- You mean he didn't?
- I don't know. What was it about?

358
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:55,651
No, if he didn't mention it, that's fine.
It's fine.

359
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,592
- What did you say the name was?
- No, it doesn't matter.

360
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:01,543
I'm sorry I bothered you.

361
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:11,422
- Excuse me, does he work here?
- You mean Mr. Fewster?

362
00:31:11,844 --> 00:31:15,355
He's one of the federal bank examiners
who come in.

363
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:17,752
He's very nervous.

364
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:26,167
I don't believe Mr. Winters
told her anything.

365
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:30,356
She looked right at me.
She didn't know what I was talking about.

366
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:33,742
That's my train.

367
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:37,804
Well, if you hear from her again,
we expect to hear from you.

368
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:39,434
Okay?

369
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,851
Not gonna eat your hot dog, huh?

370
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,179
- Well, here they are.
- Oh, Hub.

371
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:41,728
- I was concerned.
- Courtney, I'm sorry we're late.

372
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:44,385
- You know Lee Winters?
- Good evening. Lovely to have you.

373
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,822
Would you take her down by Max?

374
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,557
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

375
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:57,537
- Sorry we're late.
- Don't worry about it. So glad you're here.

376
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:00,413
- Hello, Hub.
- Sorry, Max, got caught in traffic.

377
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,130
Lee, I'd like you to meet Sal Naftari.

378
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:04,723
How do you do, Mr. Naftari?

379
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:09,431
Mrs. Winters, at last. I was beginning
to be afraid I might not get to meet you.

380
00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:12,594
For a few seconds there,
I had doubts myself.

381
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:16,109
But I can't tell you how happy
I am that we made it.

382
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:18,863
Oh, Mrs. Winters, I was just telling Max
before you came...

383
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,574
...that I've just come back from Paris.
The state of the dollar is in crisis.

384
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:25,585
I don't know what you naughty bankers
are gonna do to us next.

385
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:28,232
Do you know that I couldn't buy
a single thing?

386
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,333
It's awful. I'm gonna have to wear
American clothes all summer.

387
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,570
- Two percent.
- Not this time.

388
00:35:34,956 --> 00:35:36,962
Okay, 2 and a half.

389
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:38,853
Eight.

390
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:41,505
Eight? Why 8?

391
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:45,510
It's a woman. Makes it tougher.

392
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:52,056
Hub, get it out of your head.
I've got a lock on this.

393
00:35:52,226 --> 00:35:55,007
These people are unpredictable.
They make up their own minds.

394
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:58,237
I'm only the agent.
I can only make the introductions.

395
00:35:58,399 --> 00:36:00,503
The rest is up to you.

396
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:06,010
If my deal is too rich, you're always
welcome to try it on your own.

397
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:10,001
- Okay, 8.
- Plus a fee of 300,000 for contingencies.

398
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,395
- Such as?
- Lf I knew, they wouldn't be contingencies.

399
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:20,935
I'll get right on it, providing,
of course, that's acceptable.

400
00:36:21,522 --> 00:36:23,309
Also, she'll have to travel.

401
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,221
They'll want a meeting.

402
00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:04,210
- We welcome you.
- Thank you, Khalid.

403
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:06,710
We're glad to be here.
My associate, Mrs. Winters.

404
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:10,165
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Winters, welcome. Please.

405
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:27,429
Come.

406
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:37,860
I believe you know my father, Ahmed.

407
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,908
Of course.

408
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:42,456
He thanks you for honoring us
with your visit.

409
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,244
Not at all.
You honor us with the invitation.

410
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:47,448
And Mrs. Winters.

411
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:48,986
How do you do?

412
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:39,322
I feel like a beggar asking them
for alms, and I hate it.

413
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,856
You and the rest of the world.

414
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:28,098
I thought we had an appointment.

415
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:30,301
This is an appointment.

416
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:55,282
Mrs. Winters, please.

417
00:39:55,703 --> 00:39:57,873
Hub, good to see you.

418
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:04,457
To begin with, I'm sure you will be pleased
to hear we have decided to make the loan.

419
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:08,490
But first, I think it
best to go over this...

420
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:11,435
...to make sure we are clear
on the main points.

421
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:13,062
Point one...

422
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:17,481
...the sum is to be 500 million,
of course, for the plant in Valencia...

423
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:20,095
...the money to be drawn
in units of 50 million.

424
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:21,982
At times to be negotiated.

425
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:23,776
Yes, of course.

426
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:25,916
Point two, Winterchem to hold title...

427
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:29,825
...but profits to be shared
on an equal basis.

428
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:33,280
Point three, Mrs. Winters' stock
will stand as security...

429
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:35,545
...for the entire transaction.

430
00:40:35,712 --> 00:40:38,492
- Point four...
- Excuse me.

431
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,954
That means if something happens,
I lose all my stock.

432
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,568
Mrs. Winters...

433
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:46,040
...I should tell you
there are those in the family...

434
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,753
...who do not think we should be
making this offer at all.

435
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:52,147
I assume if you could've found
venture capital of this sort...

436
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,316
...for a company like Winterchem
in America...

437
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,832
...you would not be coming
all the way to Arabia looking for it.

438
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:01,871
If you are able to arrange better terms
elsewhere, you are free to do so.

439
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,055
Shall I continue?

440
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,217
Point four...

441
00:41:17,383 --> 00:41:20,131
...after repayment of the principal
has been completed...

442
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:24,667
...all interest payments must be made
by the 15th day of each month.

443
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:28,826
If we're ever cash short when a payment
comes due, I could lose the whole company.

444
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:31,511
Don't worry. We'll cover you on that.

445
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:33,048
The bank will cover you.

446
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:34,675
I don't like the risk.

447
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:37,626
I guess it depends on how bad
you wanna be the chairman.

448
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:44,431
Well, I guess I should call the cockpit.

449
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:46,769
Have them radio the office
with the gory details.

450
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:49,169
Hey, that can wait.

451
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,991
This can't.

452
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:01,925
You're really ticked off
about the deal, aren't you?

453
00:42:02,637 --> 00:42:04,229
I'm sorry.

454
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,115
I just don't...

455
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:09,087
I don't like being dependent, that's all.

456
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,294
I was never dependent
on any one studio.

457
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,789
I didn't depend on Charlie.

458
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,139
And if anything goes wrong, I don't like
being dependent on Borough National.

459
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:23,452
You mean me.

460
00:42:28,638 --> 00:42:30,066
Here.

461
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:32,731
If you can't live with the deal, forget it.

462
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:36,888
Tell New York the terms
are unacceptable.

463
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,474
I warn you, I'm a problem.

464
00:42:44,214 --> 00:42:46,765
I'm a bad person
when I get in a corner.

465
00:42:47,508 --> 00:42:50,605
Fine. If you get in a corner,
tell me to go to hell.

466
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,386
In business, that's the ground rules.

467
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:58,828
But if you think the only thing we've
been doing together is business...

468
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:01,027
...one of us is a fool.

469
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:16,988
Would you radio Winterchem
in New York, please?

470
00:43:17,954 --> 00:43:20,887
Tell them we've come to terms
on the whole package.

471
00:43:24,446 --> 00:43:27,706
Well, you got your deal.
You got what you want.

472
00:43:29,308 --> 00:43:32,372
You don't know
the first goddamn thing I want.

473
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:36,654
It's not the deal.

474
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:40,842
The world's full of deals.

475
00:43:43,379 --> 00:43:46,225
A partner's somewhat more rare.

476
00:43:58,922 --> 00:44:00,896
I'm still not sure I trust you, you know.

477
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,477
That's a perfect basis for a partnership.

478
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:27,286
Thirty thousand.

479
00:45:36,371 --> 00:45:38,791
Just bumped him out of 20 million.

480
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:46,849
I thought you ought to see that.

481
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:52,420
They just want us to hold it?
Not roll it over?

482
00:45:53,928 --> 00:45:55,902
Doesn't make sense.

483
00:45:56,902 --> 00:46:01,123
They'll lose a ton of interest
if they don't re-deposit that money.

484
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,280
Must be a mistake.
Ask them to send it again.

485
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:05,919
You got it.

486
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:08,600
By the way,
how much is the deposit for?

487
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:10,523
Altogether, 95 million.

488
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:15,866
Rebecca, let's get a confirmation on that.

489
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:17,782
Let me have the maturity schedules...

490
00:46:17,946 --> 00:46:20,846
...on those Saudi Eurodollar deposits
we're holding.

491
00:46:21,016 --> 00:46:23,862
<i>The ones that are due now
or all of them?</i>

492
00:46:24,023 --> 00:46:25,844
- The works.
- What's going on?

493
00:46:26,006 --> 00:46:28,306
Nineteen deposits
worth 5 million each are due...

494
00:46:28,468 --> 00:46:31,281
...and the Saudis didn't
give us disposition instructions.

495
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:33,896
You got 23 more maturing
in the next three weeks...

496
00:46:34,065 --> 00:46:36,649
...which is 210 million we're gonna
have to come up with...

497
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:39,716
...if they decide not to roll over.
- Two hundred and ten million?

498
00:46:39,886 --> 00:46:42,470
That's practically every cent we carry.
It'll clean us out.

499
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:45,220
They can't let that money
sit without earning interest.

500
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:48,036
Even the Arabs aren't that rich.

501
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:52,419
Maybe they'll advise us through
their London affiliate, I hope.

502
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:55,133
Forty-60, anything there?

503
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:01,081
If you wait five minutes,
I'll have an answer.

504
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,248
That yen deal we lost, who was
the customer, and why did we lose it?

505
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:07,643
Hapsas Oil. First New York
must have wanted the trade badly.

506
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:10,673
They bid one point over market.

507
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,430
<i>Mr. Naftari returning your call.</i>

508
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:36,037
<i>- Put him on. I got five minutes to kill.
- Yes, sir.</i>

509
00:47:38,444 --> 00:47:41,922
I don't know. Some guys will go
anywhere to find a topless beach.

510
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,096
Hey, Sal, how's Monte Carlo, you turkey?

511
00:47:44,265 --> 00:47:46,751
<i>- Not bad. Something on your mind?
- No, nothing special...</i>

512
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:50,495
...except your friend Dawasir doesn't seem
to have both his oars in the water.

513
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:51,838
<i>What's going on?</i>

514
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:56,344
They got a couple of Eurodollar
deposits maturing. No big deal.

515
00:47:56,513 --> 00:47:58,334
But they're just letting them sit.

516
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:00,154
You happen to know anything about it?

517
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,423
<i>Nobody's talked to me.
I haven't heard a word.</i>

518
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,890
Well, Europe's gonna start
closing in a few minutes.

519
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:08,117
They work through London and Zurich,
and the interest they're losing...

520
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:09,874
<i>Well, what about it?</i>

521
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:11,317
<i>Hub, you got a problem?</i>

522
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:15,821
Hey, listen, if it's okay with them,
it's just fine with me. What do I care?

523
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:18,738
Then there's no problem?

524
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,265
Yeah, kid, talk to you.

525
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:23,696
Shit.

526
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:41,415
He said you don't seem to have
both of your oars in the water.

527
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:46,304
You cannot pull $95 million
in one chunk...

528
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:49,500
...from a bank the size
of Borough National.

529
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,897
When I undertook to manage this plan...

530
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:54,911
...you agreed to do it gradually
in small amounts.

531
00:48:55,072 --> 00:48:57,721
You're now starting to move billions
in a matter of weeks.

532
00:48:57,886 --> 00:49:00,470
The world economic situation
is deteriorating...

533
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,611
...more rapidly than we had thought.

534
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:04,720
We don't think we can afford
to wait, Max.

535
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,019
There will be no collapse in the
foreseeable future unless you panic...

536
00:49:08,184 --> 00:49:12,753
...and start it with some
damn fool move like this.

537
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:15,981
And if you are wrong, what then?

538
00:49:16,563 --> 00:49:20,074
We wake up one morning,
our oil is gone.

539
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:24,581
We find we have sold all we have in
exchange for paper money that is worthless.

540
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:30,314
You're risking immediate exposure.

541
00:49:30,476 --> 00:49:32,417
We risk it every day.

542
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:35,300
If Charles Winters
could stumble on that account...

543
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:38,529
...it's just a question of time
before someone else finds out.

544
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:41,211
- And when that happens...
- No one else will find out...

545
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:45,241
...if you revert to your original timetable.

546
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:48,381
All right, Max.

547
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:51,477
We'll think about it.

548
00:49:52,606 --> 00:49:54,994
But I'm not sure
what our answer will be.

549
00:49:58,427 --> 00:50:01,557
You're playing with the end
of the world, you know.

550
00:50:02,937 --> 00:50:06,677
The end of the world as you know it.

551
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:14,540
Europe's closing.

552
00:50:14,898 --> 00:50:17,384
You're on your own. No dispositions.

553
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:19,493
I don't want anyone playing hero.

554
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:21,866
- Give me the FYCB.
- Okay, let's hedge ourselves.

555
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,094
Cover at least half the amount
of the deposits for one day.

556
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:27,393
First New York and Morgan,
24 million each.

557
00:50:27,562 --> 00:50:29,536
Morgan, this is Borough National.

558
00:50:29,706 --> 00:50:32,454
First New York,
let me have your Fed Funds desk.

559
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:34,437
Listen, we got room for 24, 25.

560
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:48,634
- Right.
- No problem, get back to you.

561
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:50,867
- Morgan's tight today.
- First New York's dry.

562
00:50:51,037 --> 00:50:52,759
Come back tomorrow
if we have a problem.

563
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,635
This could be a real situation here,
Europe closing down.

564
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,826
If we can't find the cash to cover those
Eurodollar deposits we're shit out of luck.

565
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:04,877
Okay, try Boston and Chase, but that's it.

566
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:08,815
Let's not blow it all over the street.
As long as nobody else knows...

567
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:11,089
Now what the hell is that?

568
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:13,611
Dollar's dropping.

569
00:51:13,776 --> 00:51:17,287
Dropping? It's going through
the basement, for chrissake. Why?

570
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:21,281
Hey, Hub, it's Paris. They heard some
big Arab money is pulling out here.

571
00:51:21,451 --> 00:51:23,752
- They're gonna start shorting dollars.
- They're nuts.

572
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,182
Negative. Kill those calls
to Boston and Chase.

573
00:51:26,345 --> 00:51:28,896
- That's what they said.
- Tell them we're buying.

574
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:30,782
- We're buying?
- Tell them.

575
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,153
Dollar dropping fast against marks and yen.

576
00:51:33,317 --> 00:51:35,104
Add sterling and guilders to that.

577
00:51:35,267 --> 00:51:38,614
Okay, just button up. No more calls
go out of here until I tell you.

578
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:42,166
You better call your mama, both of you.
You're gonna be late for supper.

579
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,973
Vince, this is Gil. I'm bottom-fishing.
You got any ideas?

580
00:51:46,205 --> 00:51:48,855
No, no, nothing definite.

581
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,222
I wanted to flag it at the Fed
just in case.

582
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:53,141
- Hang up.
- No, not much.

583
00:51:53,305 --> 00:51:55,442
Maybe 100 mil or so.

584
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,253
Hang up that phone, Roy, or so help me
God, I'll tear it out of the wall.

585
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:07,499
Sorry, I'm getting a little static here.
I'll be back to you.

586
00:52:09,616 --> 00:52:12,549
Look, Smith, you can save the dramatics
for some other time.

587
00:52:12,718 --> 00:52:16,426
Are you crazy?
Are you right out of your fucking skull?

588
00:52:16,588 --> 00:52:17,831
Nobody knows we're broke.

589
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:20,132
I'm busting my ass
to act like business as usual...

590
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:22,817
...and you call the Federal Reserve Bank.

591
00:52:22,984 --> 00:52:25,121
<i>Why not take an ad
in The New York- fucking-Times?</i>

592
00:52:25,287 --> 00:52:27,936
Everything is drying up on you.
You can't get it anywhere.

593
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,955
I say we go to the Fed and make a clean
breast of it.

594
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:33,463
And blow everything.
Look, the Fed will never find out.

595
00:52:33,634 --> 00:52:36,382
We'll issue some domestic CDs
to cover the Eurodollar deposits.

596
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:39,194
By the time we add up our tabs,
it'll be two weeks from now.

597
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:41,180
By then, everything will be fine.

598
00:52:41,342 --> 00:52:43,512
So we ran a little behind
on bookkeeping. So what?

599
00:52:44,156 --> 00:52:47,470
You can't do that. That's illegal.
That is criminal, for chrissake.

600
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:49,909
Mildly. We can get by with it
for one night.

601
00:52:50,072 --> 00:52:52,656
- You don't know what's gonna happen.
- Walk to the Fed...

602
00:52:52,823 --> 00:52:55,124
...let them know,
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

603
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:56,594
You won't open tomorrow.

604
00:52:56,757 --> 00:53:00,268
With the performance record you've had,
they'll shut our ass down for good.

605
00:53:00,499 --> 00:53:03,563
We gotta sweat it out and pray
the Saudis roll over that 95 million...

606
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:07,043
...before Europe opens in the morning.
It's the only chance we got.

607
00:53:09,037 --> 00:53:10,759
Come on, Roy, where's your balls?

608
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:13,830
You're the one who's crazy.

609
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:17,956
I don't know anything about this.
I am not losing my deniability.

610
00:53:18,121 --> 00:53:20,159
You can hide in the closet
if you want to...

611
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:22,181
...but you're staying right here.

612
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:25,188
If I catch you on the phone,
I'll break your fucking arm.

613
00:53:26,883 --> 00:53:29,303
What are you gonna do
if the Saudis ask for that money?

614
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:32,788
I'll worry about it in the morning.
I gotta get through the night first.

615
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,300
Sorry, Eurodollar section says the market's
getting worse. Liquidity's drying up.

616
00:53:37,469 --> 00:53:39,704
- How much of this is around the floor?
- Not a lot.

617
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:44,022
Okay, here's the drill. For the rest of the
afternoon, no strong positions, no exposure.

618
00:53:44,185 --> 00:53:45,907
- Keep it humming. You got me?
- Yes, sir.

619
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:49,517
Hong Kong opens 8:00 our time.
Maybe they'll run it through them.

620
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:52,913
You and Betsy stay. I'll get back
from reception as soon as I can.

621
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:55,758
You're not going to that Winters
reception tonight, are you?

622
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:57,231
We're expected.

623
00:53:57,394 --> 00:54:01,254
And since the only conceivable reason for
our absence would be a crisis at the bank...

624
00:54:01,423 --> 00:54:05,316
...and since that's what we don't want
people to know we're up to our ass in...

625
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:07,175
...one of us better be there.

626
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,916
She's only the new chairman of the board
of one of our biggest customers.

627
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:14,658
Excuse me just a second, Howard, Nancy.

628
00:54:14,824 --> 00:54:16,710
- Hello, Mr. Smith.
- Good evening.

629
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,658
Are you over your jet lag?

630
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:21,754
- Bankers aren't allowed to have jet lag.
- Oh, no?

631
00:54:21,923 --> 00:54:24,573
I feel lucky. Warner's agreed
to be chief operating officer.

632
00:54:24,738 --> 00:54:26,231
Glad to hear it.

633
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,887
Roy Lefcourt sends his congratulations.

634
00:54:29,056 --> 00:54:30,462
He's a little under the weather.

635
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:32,083
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

636
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:34,161
I appreciate your being here.

637
00:54:34,332 --> 00:54:36,153
Thanks for your help.

638
00:54:37,755 --> 00:54:39,892
This is gonna work out all right.

639
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,375
Oh, thank you.

640
00:54:58,511 --> 00:55:00,452
N- A...

641
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:03,590
...blank, blank, L-E.

642
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:06,660
Cremona.

643
00:55:12,198 --> 00:55:13,953
<i>Me, any joy?</i>

644
00:55:14,117 --> 00:55:17,693
No. Nothing moving here
but the leaves on the trees.

645
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:20,279
Hong Kong opens in 10 minutes.
Want me to take a sniff?

646
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,903
<i>And have it in Paris through
the back door? Better not.</i>

647
00:55:23,072 --> 00:55:25,210
<i>How's our friend bearing up?</i>

648
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:28,917
I think he has visions
of numbers on his chest.

649
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:31,702
He's not the only one.

650
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:34,897
Let's keep the hatches
battened down. Not a word.

651
00:55:35,993 --> 00:55:37,486
Well...

652
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:39,564
...that sounds fine.

653
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:43,119
Just keep tracking.
We could get a move out of it.

654
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,508
I'll check in myself if I get a chance.

655
00:55:46,675 --> 00:55:48,561
Not the bank.

656
00:55:49,362 --> 00:55:51,848
I might have to drift over there
for a couple of minutes.

657
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,422
Tonight?

658
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,069
Nothing they couldn't handle themselves.

659
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:58,664
But I think I better look in on them.

660
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:01,985
- Don't wait up for me.
- You're so tense.

661
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:04,389
Are you all right?

662
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:08,515
At the peak of my form, lady.

663
00:56:12,298 --> 00:56:14,054
Good night, Nettie.

664
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,083
Would you order the car
to be out front?

665
00:56:22,249 --> 00:56:23,875
Yes, madame.

666
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:26,529
I think I'll go down
to the office for a while.

667
00:58:29,053 --> 00:58:31,638
<i>Fewster, let me tell you
the reason I'm here.</i>

668
00:58:31,805 --> 00:58:34,292
<i>You know all about Winterchem,
and you know Winterchem...</i>

669
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,802
<i>...depends a great deal on its connection
with Borough National Bank.</i>

670
00:58:38,972 --> 00:58:41,819
<i>I've been very concerned about
Borough National Bank's stability.</i>

671
00:58:41,979 --> 00:58:46,234
<i>Mr. Winters, the fact
that I am the bank examiner...</i>

672
00:58:46,395 --> 00:58:50,585
<i>...I'm not allowed to discuss any findings.</i>

673
00:58:50,747 --> 00:58:54,576
<i>I hired a private detective.
I hired him to check on you because...</i>

674
00:58:54,746 --> 00:58:59,797
<i>On me? You hired him
to check on me personally?</i>

675
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:04,019
<i>I happen to know...</i>

676
00:59:04,185 --> 00:59:07,480
<i>...that you took
a very low-interest loan. Am I right?</i>

677
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,120
<i>For the purchase of a house
from First New York.</i>

678
00:59:11,288 --> 00:59:13,328
<i>Is that correct, Mr. Fewster?</i>

679
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:16,111
<i>This low-interest loan, Mr. Fewster...</i>

680
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,589
<i>...some people might consider it
to be unethical.</i>

681
00:59:22,455 --> 00:59:26,067
<i>Others, even as a bribe.</i>

682
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,267
<i>And of course, that would be criminal.</i>

683
00:59:29,815 --> 00:59:34,801
<i>You're asking for information
that concerns something bigger...</i>

684
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:37,747
<i>...than Borough National Bank.</i>

685
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,521
<i>Fewster, I guarantee you...</i>

686
00:59:42,294 --> 00:59:44,301
<i>...you'll have my protection.</i>

687
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:47,050
<i>Now you just tell me what you know.</i>

688
00:59:50,613 --> 00:59:52,620
<i>I discovered...</i>

689
00:59:54,517 --> 00:59:59,699
<i>...an account, 21214.</i>

690
01:00:01,043 --> 01:00:03,945
<i>Mr. Winters, is the tape machine running?</i>

691
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:06,673
<i>Yes.</i>

692
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,385
<i>Please, sir, turn it off.</i>

693
01:01:31,594 --> 01:01:33,416
London branch.

694
01:01:39,754 --> 01:01:42,339
They're rolling over 90 million!

695
01:02:23,845 --> 01:02:26,911
I think we can all go home
and get some rest now.

696
01:02:28,805 --> 01:02:30,692
- Night, guys.
- Night.

697
01:02:30,852 --> 01:02:32,478
Good night.

698
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:38,240
Why only 90 million?
What about the other 5?

699
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:46,271
We're gonna pay the balance of 5
to First New York. Account 21214.

700
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:51,423
Do me a favor, will you?
Get me all our Saudi records.

701
01:03:10,144 --> 01:03:11,769
Look at this slippage.

702
01:03:11,936 --> 01:03:14,325
All over the last couple of years.

703
01:03:14,496 --> 01:03:17,724
Every month, 8 million,
7 million, 7 million...

704
01:03:17,887 --> 01:03:22,622
...all to that same account number,
21214, First New York.

705
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:26,998
Could be anything.

706
01:03:27,455 --> 01:03:30,237
An adjustment in the general portfolio
or loans.

707
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,341
Be nice to know more about that account.

708
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:42,745
I'll worry about it later.

709
01:03:45,277 --> 01:03:46,553
Jesus, what a night.

710
01:04:44,503 --> 01:04:47,667
I feel like the sack of Carthage.

711
01:04:54,582 --> 01:04:57,232
What happened at the bank last night?

712
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:09,006
You act like a man who just had
a reprieve from the electric chair.

713
01:05:32,754 --> 01:05:35,918
No, I don't think it can wait
until you come to New York.

714
01:05:37,298 --> 01:05:40,527
Mr. Fewster, I can come
to Washington today to see you.

715
01:05:41,073 --> 01:05:44,269
Well, I'd like to see you today
if that's possible.

716
01:05:46,353 --> 01:05:49,451
Well, where would you like to meet?
I can meet anywhere you want.

717
01:05:50,193 --> 01:05:52,047
In a parking lot?

718
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:55,215
No, that's fine.

719
01:05:56,944 --> 01:05:59,147
Brown station wagon.

720
01:06:00,175 --> 01:06:02,117
What's the license number?

721
01:06:04,783 --> 01:06:06,921
Would 2:00 be all right?

722
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:12,005
Thank you very much. I appreciate it,
Mr. Fewster. Thank you. Yes.

723
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,222
Kay, cancel my 1:00.
I'm gonna take the noon shuttle...

724
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:20,902
...to Washington. And would you have
a car reserved for me at the other end?

725
01:06:51,338 --> 01:06:54,982
- Mr. Fewster?
- Mrs. Winters, please get in.

726
01:07:00,425 --> 01:07:02,563
I'm sitting on something.

727
01:07:03,529 --> 01:07:05,351
I'm sorry.

728
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,353
Do you always meet people like this?

729
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,342
I don't meet people at all.

730
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:13,820
Not prime customers of the bank
I've just examined.

731
01:07:14,184 --> 01:07:17,828
I'm sorry you insisted
on coming down here, Mrs. Winters...

732
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,748
...because I can't tell you anything.

733
01:07:21,607 --> 01:07:24,770
I need to know what you told my husband
about Borough National.

734
01:07:24,934 --> 01:07:26,756
I told him nothing.

735
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:28,893
Mr. Fewster...

736
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:30,468
...I found the tape.

737
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,307
Now, there's enough on that
to get you in trouble.

738
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:36,891
But there's not enough to help me,
and I have to know.

739
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:38,752
I have to know if the bank is rocky...

740
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:41,666
...if it's losing money.
- It isn't money.

741
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:45,025
It's where the money is going. And...

742
01:07:45,188 --> 01:07:48,734
...I can't talk about it.
- Well, at least give me your worksheets...

743
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,104
...your notes, your...
- I can't.

744
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:54,235
They'd know where you got it
in five minutes.

745
01:07:57,027 --> 01:08:00,256
Look, if it's... If it's your job
you're worried about...

746
01:08:00,419 --> 01:08:04,063
...Winterchem will find you something.
- You don't understand.

747
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,488
All...

748
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:18,014
All I knew was that Borough National
was in trouble, that it had...

749
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:22,649
...something to do with this account
and some Arab Eurodollars.

750
01:08:23,105 --> 01:08:24,283
But...

751
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:28,703
...what I didn't know was
how big this must be.

752
01:08:28,864 --> 01:08:32,213
How desperate they are
to keep it all secret.

753
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,931
Because...

754
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:41,437
...when I started to follow up on it...

755
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:44,568
...I was told that...

756
01:08:44,735 --> 01:08:47,484
...it was a confidence factor...

757
01:08:47,646 --> 01:08:52,861
...that 21214 was a sensitive area. And...

758
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:56,636
- What?
- Well...

759
01:08:56,797 --> 01:08:59,481
...I got offered a loan...

760
01:09:01,373 --> 01:09:04,406
...at a very low interest.

761
01:09:06,973 --> 01:09:08,729
A bribe...

762
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:12,659
...which I took.

763
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:15,959
God help me.

764
01:09:20,635 --> 01:09:22,358
So...

765
01:09:22,523 --> 01:09:24,944
So, Mrs. Winters,
we're not just talking about my job.

766
01:09:25,114 --> 01:09:29,424
- We're talking about prison or worse.
- Worse?

767
01:09:30,202 --> 01:09:33,333
Mrs. Winters, please, just leave it.

768
01:09:33,497 --> 01:09:36,530
I can't leave it. I need your proof.

769
01:09:36,826 --> 01:09:40,338
Your husband couldn't leave it,
and look what happened to him.

770
01:09:40,601 --> 01:09:42,324
Charlie?

771
01:09:44,153 --> 01:09:47,797
Are you...? Are you saying this
had something to do...

772
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,960
...with Charlie's death?
- I don't know.

773
01:09:53,207 --> 01:09:57,168
I don't know. I don't know.
I can't be sure.

774
01:09:57,336 --> 01:09:59,954
But he found out,
and he died, didn't he?

775
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:04,429
Mrs. Winters, Mrs. Winters,
they're all over me, and I... I...

776
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:09,104
If I tell them you came to see me,
what happens to you?

777
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:13,328
And if I don't, what...?
What happens to...? To me?

778
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:15,531
L...

779
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,518
I thought...

780
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:25,613
I thought it was all over
when I took the bribe.

781
01:10:29,556 --> 01:10:31,945
But it's never gonna end...

782
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:35,914
...is it?

783
01:10:38,611 --> 01:10:40,400
Mrs. Winters.

784
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:47,369
There's a Dunkin' Donuts
in the Rockville Shopping Center.

785
01:10:48,562 --> 01:10:50,123
I'll meet you there at 4:00.

786
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:53,801
I'll need some time to get my notes.

787
01:10:55,697 --> 01:10:57,835
This is going to be over, Mr. Fewster.

788
01:10:58,001 --> 01:10:59,757
I promise you.

789
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:01,808
It's gonna end.

790
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:39,358
<i>All right. Stand by.</i>

791
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,927
- Hello, Mr. Smith.
- Sam...

792
01:13:17,091 --> 01:13:19,131
...I left some papers
up in Mr. Emery's office.

793
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:22,298
- No problem. I'll sign you in.
- Thanks.

794
01:15:21,111 --> 01:15:22,866
- Anything up?
- No.

795
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,819
Have a good night.

796
01:15:37,781 --> 01:15:40,498
That's one of the rewards
of working at night, no phone calls.

797
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,548
- Good evening, Henry.
- Evening, Mr. Emery.

798
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:46,766
You've got a hectic week ahead of you,
there's the IMF conference. Johnson's...

799
01:16:38,211 --> 01:16:40,632
That's one of his problems.
We take count.

800
01:16:40,803 --> 01:16:43,672
Europe development speech
is next Thursday.

801
01:17:03,712 --> 01:17:07,257
Not this year. Mrs. Emery's
taking care of the Girl Guides.

802
01:17:07,424 --> 01:17:09,147
That's enough scouting.

803
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,661
Tell George that when he writes...

804
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:19,384
...that community trust speech
he can forget Adam Smith.

805
01:17:19,582 --> 01:17:20,793
I know it was enough.

806
01:17:28,446 --> 01:17:31,642
I don't understand how we could've
been so wrong on interest rates.

807
01:17:31,805 --> 01:17:35,416
Warren went long on bonds again,
tried to cover himself.

808
01:17:37,885 --> 01:17:41,594
I'll accept his being wrong
but not his refusal to admit it.

809
01:17:42,012 --> 01:17:45,241
- You gonna talk to him about it over lunch?
- A drink should do it.

810
01:17:45,404 --> 01:17:47,705
Maybe Chase can afford him. We can't.

811
01:17:47,867 --> 01:17:51,860
- Just part of the image.
- What about that little list of yours?

812
01:18:09,753 --> 01:18:12,950
- I'm not gonna need you tonight, William.
- Yes, ma'am.

813
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:20,755
Hub?

814
01:18:21,944 --> 01:18:23,373
Hey.

815
01:18:23,544 --> 01:18:25,137
I'd just about given up on you.

816
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,007
- Oh, thank God you're home.
- Yeah, where you been?

817
01:18:43,734 --> 01:18:46,450
- Oh, just hold me.
- Oh, I was getting worried about you.

818
01:18:46,613 --> 01:18:50,410
- Just hold me.
- Tell me if you're okay.

819
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:54,731
Something awful happened in Washington.

820
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,617
What were you doing in Washington?

821
01:19:10,867 --> 01:19:13,769
It was an accident. You know,
one of those close calls.

822
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:18,025
I feel so silly.

823
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,894
I think I need a drink.

824
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,741
While you're at it, get one for me.

825
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,069
Scotch on the rocks with a twist.

826
01:22:13,537 --> 01:22:16,701
Mr. Emery there? Hub Smith calling.

827
01:22:19,488 --> 01:22:22,357
No. This won't keep. Can't you find him?

828
01:22:25,216 --> 01:22:27,420
Look, I have to talk to him.

829
01:22:27,584 --> 01:22:30,485
If he calls in, tell him...

830
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:36,955
Tell him we've got to
talk about 21214...

831
01:22:37,183 --> 01:22:39,703
...before anything else happens.

832
01:22:42,397 --> 01:22:44,121
That's right...

833
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:48,181
...21214.

834
01:22:51,453 --> 01:22:54,835
I can't speak for the president
of the United States.

835
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:57,874
He runs his shop. I run mine.

836
01:22:58,461 --> 01:23:00,435
But I'll tell you this.

837
01:23:00,988 --> 01:23:02,962
Bankers are more dependable
than governments.

838
01:23:03,132 --> 01:23:04,986
We don't lie to ourselves.

839
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,554
We can't afford to.

840
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,657
Isn't that right, Hub?

841
01:23:10,139 --> 01:23:11,732
I'd like to think so.

842
01:23:11,899 --> 01:23:14,288
We've just been joined by
a most distinguished banker.

843
01:23:14,459 --> 01:23:17,012
About 20 years ago,
he sat where you are...

844
01:23:17,178 --> 01:23:22,197
...drinking in my words with the same
skepticism that I see on some of your faces.

845
01:23:22,394 --> 01:23:26,387
How do you account for the fact
that for 30 years after the Depression...

846
01:23:26,553 --> 01:23:29,368
...there hasn't been
a single major bank failure?

847
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,090
Now there's one every 18 months.

848
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:33,907
Herstatt in Germany.
Franklin National here.

849
01:23:35,256 --> 01:23:41,006
The international character of banking today
makes everyone vulnerable to everything.

850
01:23:41,176 --> 01:23:45,104
<i>Somebody sneezes in Zurich,
we say gesundheit in New York.</i>

851
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,695
The important thing to realize is...

852
01:23:47,864 --> 01:23:50,230
...that everything is interconnected.

853
01:23:50,391 --> 01:23:52,660
We're all in this together.

854
01:23:55,127 --> 01:23:58,738
- This is Hub Smith with Borough National.
- Professor Aikens, it's a pleasure.

855
01:23:58,902 --> 01:24:03,058
Will you excuse us for a few minutes?
I'll catch up with you later.

856
01:24:03,222 --> 01:24:05,742
Well, you're a surprise.

857
01:24:13,877 --> 01:24:17,706
People will start talking about us, fella.
What are you doing?

858
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:23,184
As a matter of fact, right now
I'm trying to keep my temper.

859
01:24:24,403 --> 01:24:27,185
See, after that flutter we had
at Borough National yesterday...

860
01:24:27,347 --> 01:24:31,471
...there was one Saudi Eurodollar deposit
that didn't roll over.

861
01:24:32,211 --> 01:24:35,407
It was transferred instead
to First New York.

862
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:42,219
So I went over and had a little talk with
your computer about that stray 5 million.

863
01:24:44,338 --> 01:24:46,443
You set me up, Max.

864
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:50,511
You didn't want me
to save Borough National.

865
01:24:50,673 --> 01:24:54,087
You just wanted me to keep them afloat
for you to siphon off that Arab money.

866
01:24:54,481 --> 01:24:56,782
You've been doing it for months.

867
01:24:57,744 --> 01:24:58,921
Is that a fact?

868
01:24:59,088 --> 01:25:01,030
Don't dance with me, Max.

869
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:05,477
You have 21214 listed
as a foreign-exchange account.

870
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:08,713
But you don't buy other currency
with those dollars. You buy gold.

871
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:12,457
But you have to do it slowly because
if anybody finds out what's going on...

872
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:16,419
...the dollar will drop, and all the Saudi
investments over here won't be worth shit.

873
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:20,364
You're being a little wild and woolly here,
aren't you, fella?

874
01:25:20,526 --> 01:25:22,828
There have been some
perfectly normal transactions...

875
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:25,194
...that wouldn't raise an eyebrow
anywhere.

876
01:25:25,358 --> 01:25:28,619
Borough National is just the tip
of the iceberg, isn't it, Max?

877
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:32,042
I checked the inflows in 21214.

878
01:25:32,717 --> 01:25:34,888
There are billions coming in
on a regular basis...

879
01:25:35,053 --> 01:25:39,395
...from Arab and OPEC accounts you
control in at least 15 other banks.

880
01:25:40,972 --> 01:25:43,427
You're moving the Arabs into gold.

881
01:25:44,908 --> 01:25:47,941
- You're taking them out of the dollar.
- That isn't a crime.

882
01:25:48,108 --> 01:25:50,791
It isn't against the law.
It isn't even a conspiracy.

883
01:25:50,955 --> 01:25:52,743
Just a routine banking operation.

884
01:25:52,907 --> 01:25:56,933
And if we didn't handle it, they'd
find a lot of other people who would.

885
01:25:57,099 --> 01:25:59,717
Goddamn it, Max.
You don't just do this on your own.

886
01:25:59,882 --> 01:26:01,824
You go to the Comptroller
of the Currency...

887
01:26:01,994 --> 01:26:05,441
...the Federal Reserve Board,
the secretary of the Treasury.

888
01:26:05,609 --> 01:26:09,504
- You call the president, for chrissake.
- And start a real panic?

889
01:26:10,825 --> 01:26:13,542
Have you ever seen anyone
in government keep his mouth shut...

890
01:26:13,705 --> 01:26:16,257
...about anything for five minutes?

891
01:26:16,424 --> 01:26:17,701
Go ahead. Call the Treasury.

892
01:26:17,865 --> 01:26:20,864
Call the Comptroller. But I'll tell you
what's going to happen.

893
01:26:21,032 --> 01:26:25,222
When the Arabs learn that word of what
they're doing is out, they may panic...

894
01:26:25,384 --> 01:26:28,449
...move a big chunk of funds
too fast or the wrong way.

895
01:26:28,615 --> 01:26:31,931
Really destabilize the monetary markets.

896
01:26:32,135 --> 01:26:33,989
Then the dollar will collapse.

897
01:26:34,598 --> 01:26:38,275
Whereupon there'll be a lot of jawboning
by the president, and that won't work.

898
01:26:38,438 --> 01:26:41,503
Then they'll go to selling gold,
and that won't work either.

899
01:26:41,669 --> 01:26:45,117
Then they'll have to go to capital
controls. Freeze foreign assets...

900
01:26:45,286 --> 01:26:49,758
...stop any money from going in or out,
and that will be the end of all the markets.

901
01:26:49,925 --> 01:26:54,081
That will really be the finish. Then you'll
see a worldwide depression that'II...

902
01:26:54,244 --> 01:26:56,218
...make the 1930s
look like a kindergarten.

903
01:26:56,388 --> 01:26:59,584
In two months, you'll have breadlines
in Detroit, riots in Pittsburgh.

904
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:03,490
In six months, you'll see grass
right over Rodeo Drive.

905
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,407
And Michigan Boulevard
and Fifth Avenue.

906
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:07,742
And I won't have done it, Hub, you will.

907
01:27:09,602 --> 01:27:13,661
All because you tried to stop a movement
that couldn't be stopped anyway.

908
01:27:14,755 --> 01:27:16,511
Listen to me, Hub.

909
01:27:16,675 --> 01:27:21,824
Money, capital has a life of its own.

910
01:27:21,985 --> 01:27:25,181
It's a force of nature, like gravity.

911
01:27:25,345 --> 01:27:29,535
Like the oceans.
It flows where it wants to flow.

912
01:27:29,697 --> 01:27:33,821
This whole thing with the Arabs and gold is
inevitable. We're just going with the tide.

913
01:27:33,985 --> 01:27:35,391
The only question is...

914
01:27:35,552 --> 01:27:39,349
...whether you want to let it go
like an unguided missile and raise hell...

915
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,868
...or whether you want to keep it
in the hands of responsible people.

916
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,757
Keep it channeled, keep it quiet.

917
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,814
Believe me, Hub.
The dollar will hold. Believe me.

918
01:27:49,983 --> 01:27:53,877
The system will be fine,
providing nobody panics.

919
01:28:02,301 --> 01:28:04,123
I'm looking at you, Hub.

920
01:28:08,285 --> 01:28:09,714
Well...

921
01:28:10,045 --> 01:28:13,361
...I've listened patiently to
your somewhat fantastic story...

922
01:28:13,532 --> 01:28:16,402
...with one puzzling question in mind.

923
01:28:16,572 --> 01:28:19,539
If you wish to say something
to the Arabs, say it.

924
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:21,115
Why come to me?

925
01:28:21,468 --> 01:28:23,060
Because you know how to get to them.

926
01:28:23,227 --> 01:28:26,576
Sometimes. If they wish to be gotten to.

927
01:28:26,748 --> 01:28:31,504
And exactly what is it I'm to tell them?

928
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:34,096
That I...

929
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:38,159
...know that they're involved
in a secret financial manipulation...

930
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:40,664
...and that they want it kept secret.

931
01:28:41,753 --> 01:28:45,681
And so I'm prepared to trade,
Mr. Naftari, my silence...

932
01:28:45,849 --> 01:28:48,085
...in exchange for Winterchem.

933
01:28:48,249 --> 01:28:50,104
But you have Winterchem.

934
01:28:50,265 --> 01:28:52,720
Our contract has to be renegotiated...

935
01:28:52,888 --> 01:28:55,605
...so that if Borough National
goes under...

936
01:28:55,768 --> 01:28:58,997
...I don't lose my company to the Saudis.

937
01:28:59,512 --> 01:29:02,446
My silence is the only leverage I have.

938
01:29:02,968 --> 01:29:04,942
Forgive me...

939
01:29:05,111 --> 01:29:09,845
...but silence about what?
Some secret financial manipulation?

940
01:29:10,007 --> 01:29:12,854
You expect them to believe me
if I use those words?

941
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:15,665
Just tell them 21214.

942
01:29:22,102 --> 01:29:26,836
You realize, of course, that they may reject
your whole story as preposterous.

943
01:29:26,997 --> 01:29:28,720
They may not even wish to discuss it.

944
01:29:28,885 --> 01:29:31,056
I'll take my chances.

945
01:29:31,572 --> 01:29:34,223
If they don't get back to me,
they'll have to take theirs.

946
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:38,760
There's something else
they should know.

947
01:29:39,156 --> 01:29:42,189
While I've spoken to no one about this...

948
01:29:42,932 --> 01:29:46,990
...I've taken the precaution of putting
the evidence I have in a safe place.

949
01:29:47,923 --> 01:29:51,600
Very well, then. I will pass it on.

950
01:29:53,106 --> 01:29:56,488
I so enjoyed your work in films,
Mrs. Winters.

951
01:29:57,842 --> 01:30:00,110
What a pity you decided to give it up.

952
01:30:48,621 --> 01:30:49,798
Hello?

953
01:30:49,965 --> 01:30:53,063
<i>Sorry, partner, I missed
the damned 5:00 shuttle from Boston.</i>

954
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:55,235
<i>I just got into LaGuardia.</i>

955
01:30:55,404 --> 01:30:58,786
<i>Why don't you go ahead.
I'll catch up with you at the opera.</i>

956
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:01,227
Listen, you're tired.

957
01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:04,551
Why don't you just finesse it.
It's only a benefit.

958
01:31:05,099 --> 01:31:07,335
<i>Well, I am pretty whacked.</i>

959
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:11,300
Go on home. I'll call you tomorrow.

960
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,914
<i>- You swear?
- In blood.</i>

961
01:31:15,242 --> 01:31:18,089
<i>Hey, maybe we can get off somewhere
by ourselves this weekend.</i>

962
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:21,348
<i>Just the two of us. Alone.</i>

963
01:31:24,682 --> 01:31:28,259
<i>- Call me. Okay?
- Okay.</i>

964
01:31:50,983 --> 01:31:54,659
Nettie, first thing tomorrow I want
all the locks in the house changed.

965
01:32:43,777 --> 01:32:45,686
Changed my mind.

966
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:55,516
Mrs. Winters is not here.

967
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,494
That's okay, Nettie, I'll wait for her.

968
01:33:27,165 --> 01:33:29,553
<i>- Hello?
- Is Mrs. Winters there?</i>

969
01:33:30,621 --> 01:33:32,279
I'm afraid she's out for the evening.

970
01:33:32,445 --> 01:33:36,601
<i>Well, then could you give her a message,
please? I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Naftari.</i>

971
01:33:36,764 --> 01:33:39,447
<i>He asked me to say he's been in touch
with the other party...</i>

972
01:33:39,612 --> 01:33:44,281
<i>...in regards to the 21214 matter,
as Mrs. Winters requested.</i>

973
01:33:44,443 --> 01:33:47,377
<i>And they suggest a meeting
at 11 tomorrow.</i>

974
01:33:47,547 --> 01:33:50,100
Eleven tomorrow. I'll tell her.

975
01:34:02,905 --> 01:34:04,760
Hi, Mr. Smith.

976
01:35:45,007 --> 01:35:46,632
Excuse me.

977
01:35:51,598 --> 01:35:54,412
Okay, what the hell have you been
playing with Sal?

978
01:35:57,838 --> 01:35:59,725
I have nothing to say to you.

979
01:36:00,685 --> 01:36:03,434
What do you know about 21214?

980
01:36:04,141 --> 01:36:06,596
- Enough.
- Enough what?

981
01:36:07,276 --> 01:36:09,131
Enough to protect myself.

982
01:36:09,292 --> 01:36:12,041
- Against what?
- Against you.

983
01:36:13,836 --> 01:36:16,650
Borough National can go under.
You're not taking me with it.

984
01:36:22,154 --> 01:36:24,358
I'm through depending on you, Hub.

985
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:28,323
I went to the Saudis.
I'm cutting my own deal.

986
01:36:29,386 --> 01:36:31,939
Sorry, partner.
I guess I just lost confidence.

987
01:36:32,778 --> 01:36:35,428
- Do you know what you've done?
- What I've done?

988
01:36:36,842 --> 01:36:38,664
- Smile.
- What?

989
01:36:38,825 --> 01:36:40,035
Smile.

990
01:37:00,615 --> 01:37:02,884
I have to go. Have a nice evening.

991
01:37:47,266 --> 01:37:48,477
Leave me alone.

992
01:37:52,162 --> 01:37:54,169
Get out! It's not your driver! Get out!

993
01:37:54,817 --> 01:37:56,224
Get out! He's not your driver!

994
01:37:57,153 --> 01:37:58,462
Get out!

995
01:38:02,592 --> 01:38:04,599
Lee, are you all right?

996
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,556
I didn't know.

997
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:17,653
I swear to God, I didn't know.

998
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:40,220
Yes, Emery here.

999
01:38:44,892 --> 01:38:47,827
What? Not possible. They couldn't.

1000
01:38:48,508 --> 01:38:51,705
Everything that goes to them
clears through me, personally.

1001
01:38:51,868 --> 01:38:54,802
I'm afraid the matter
is out of my hands now, Mr. Emery.

1002
01:38:55,676 --> 01:38:59,570
Whatever they're planning
is out of yours too.

1003
01:39:02,491 --> 01:39:05,906
- It's not the children?
- No, no. Business.

1004
01:39:07,003 --> 01:39:08,661
Absolute nonsense.

1005
01:40:04,724 --> 01:40:06,284
Okay.

1006
01:40:07,476 --> 01:40:09,964
The Arabs yanked every penny
they had with us.

1007
01:40:10,804 --> 01:40:14,317
They hit all the other outfits too,
so it's across-the-board.

1008
01:40:14,483 --> 01:40:17,353
Every bank in the country is gonna be
struggling for liquidity...

1009
01:40:17,523 --> 01:40:20,206
...trying to cover those cash withdrawals.

1010
01:40:21,299 --> 01:40:22,542
We're dumping everything.

1011
01:40:24,466 --> 01:40:28,841
Treasury bills, bonds, Fannie Maes,
commercial papers, we want it all sold.

1012
01:40:30,577 --> 01:40:34,472
Fed Funds, Eurodollars, borrow
whatever you can find up to 200 million.

1013
01:40:34,929 --> 01:40:38,311
Foreign exchange, no positions.
Bullion, grab what you can get.

1014
01:40:38,897 --> 01:40:40,523
All right, let's hit it...

1015
01:40:42,129 --> 01:40:43,885
...and pray.

1016
01:40:58,895 --> 01:41:01,316
Maybe we could try to borrow
in Frankfurt...

1017
01:41:03,374 --> 01:41:04,836
...or Zurich.

1018
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:08,361
Swiss International owes us a favor.

1019
01:41:09,262 --> 01:41:11,050
It's over, Roy.

1020
01:41:12,685 --> 01:41:16,395
Twenty-nine percent for three-month
money with no nibbles.

1021
01:41:16,557 --> 01:41:20,834
- We may have to go to 30.
- The market's starting to react already.

1022
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:24,769
One large bank is bidding 27 percent
for six-month Eurodollars.

1023
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,241
Dollar down 4 percent
against the sterling.

1024
01:41:27,403 --> 01:41:30,054
I'm running low on contracts.
I need contracts!

1025
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:33,929
One thousand!
Gold jumped $ 100 in 30 seconds.

1026
01:41:34,091 --> 01:41:36,392
Dollar down by 5 percent
against the franc.

1027
01:41:38,059 --> 01:41:39,881
Borrowers stepping up the bids.

1028
01:41:40,042 --> 01:41:42,725
Fed doing another round
of repos at 30 percent.

1029
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:44,832
The customers wanna know
what's happening.

1030
01:41:45,002 --> 01:41:46,856
Do I tell them what we're doing?

1031
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:49,570
Tell them anything, Barney,
except what we're doing!

1032
01:41:53,545 --> 01:41:55,879
Stock market's off 75 points.

1033
01:41:56,041 --> 01:41:59,041
The dollar's depreciated 10 percent
and moving down.

1034
01:41:59,209 --> 01:42:02,470
They even yanked the Eurodollar
deposits that weren't due.

1035
01:42:02,632 --> 01:42:06,909
First New York is practically down
the tubes, and gold just went over 2000.

1036
01:42:08,808 --> 01:42:10,563
By tonight, that'll be cheap.

1037
01:42:26,213 --> 01:42:27,740
Hi, Virginia. It's me.

1038
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:31,868
I want you to listen
and listen very carefully.

1039
01:42:32,901 --> 01:42:37,091
As soon as you hang up,
I want you to go to the closet...

1040
01:42:37,732 --> 01:42:41,441
...take the suitcase
and get to the bank.

1041
01:42:45,124 --> 01:42:47,840
<i>It began eight days ago
when a group of Arab investors...</i>

1042
01:42:48,004 --> 01:42:50,491
<i>...withdrew billions of dollars
from U.S. Banks.</i>

1043
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:53,726
<i>That, in turn, started a chain reaction
on the world money markets.</i>

1044
01:42:54,211 --> 01:42:58,945
<i>Dollars, pounds, marks, francs, yen,
not one currency escaped.</i>

1045
01:42:59,139 --> 01:43:02,783
<i>This scene, outside a Manhattan bank
was duplicated all over the world...</i>

1046
01:43:02,946 --> 01:43:05,848
<i>...as people saw their life savings
become worthless...</i>

1047
01:43:06,018 --> 01:43:07,360
<i>...in a matter of hours.</i>

1048
01:43:07,522 --> 01:43:09,344
<i>Good evening. I'm George Page
in New York.</i>

1049
01:43:09,505 --> 01:43:13,531
<i>And this is another in our series of reports
on the world economic crisis.</i>

1050
01:43:13,697 --> 01:43:15,802
<i>The growing paralysis
of the industrial world...</i>

1051
01:43:15,969 --> 01:43:18,871
<i>...has left millions without jobs,
without money...</i>

1052
01:43:19,041 --> 01:43:20,502
<i>...and without hope.</i>

1053
01:43:20,672 --> 01:43:23,355
<i>Crowds of unemployed
poured into Washington yesterday.</i>

1054
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,553
<i>They stood in silent protest
before the nation's leaders.</i>

1055
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:30,331
<i>At the same time, more than a million
people packed St. Peter's Square...</i>

1056
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:33,146
<i>...where the pope urged
calm and nonviolence.</i>

1057
01:43:33,311 --> 01:43:35,831
<i>The pontiff asked for prayers
for world leaders...</i>

1058
01:43:35,999 --> 01:43:38,519
<i>...prayers and peace and reason.</i>

1059
01:43:38,782 --> 01:43:42,262
<i>But the last 24 hours
have been marked by growing protests...</i>

1060
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:43,990
<i>...and ever-increasing violence.</i>

1061
01:43:44,158 --> 01:43:46,940
<i>Last night, demonstrators burned
American currency...</i>

1062
01:43:47,101 --> 01:43:48,508
<i>...in front of the White House.</i>

1063
01:43:48,669 --> 01:43:52,411
<i>And attempts to put out the fires
led to a confrontation with police.</i>

1064
01:43:52,573 --> 01:43:55,191
<i>Every hour,
from every corner of the globe...</i>

1065
01:43:55,357 --> 01:43:59,480
<i>...there are new reports of outraged crowds
demanding action.</i>

1066
01:43:59,644 --> 01:44:01,651
<i>A bankrupt world
seems to be teetering...</i>

1067
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:04,756
<i>...on the very edge of anarchy.</i>

1068
01:44:47,831 --> 01:44:50,733
<i>And now for continued coverage
from around the world.</i>

1069
01:44:51,159 --> 01:44:53,777
<i>A statement was issued
from the OPEC meeting today...</i>

1070
01:44:53,943 --> 01:44:57,008
<i>...that the leading oil-producing nations
would resume oil exports...</i>

1071
01:44:57,174 --> 01:45:00,403
<i>...as soon as the international
monetary markets have stabilized.</i>

1072
01:45:00,854 --> 01:45:04,465
<i>The panic has spread across political
and philosophical boundaries.</i>

1073
01:45:04,886 --> 01:45:08,530
<i>The U.S.S.R. And the developed
Eastern European Communist countries...</i>

1074
01:45:08,693 --> 01:45:10,929
<i>...dependent on Western trade
and capital...</i>

1075
01:45:11,093 --> 01:45:14,355
<i>...have witnessed the same riots
that have taken place in the West.</i>

1076
01:45:14,965 --> 01:45:17,648
<i>The economic summit conference
will be attended by leaders...</i>

1077
01:45:17,813 --> 01:45:20,049
<i>...of the West, the East
and the Third World.</i>

1078
01:45:20,212 --> 01:45:23,856
<i>Said one, "There is a need
for unity of purpose and resolve...</i>

1079
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,769
<i>...unequaled since the end
of World War II. "</i>

1080
01:45:27,731 --> 01:45:32,073
<i>At this time of crisis, there has been
a turning to the past as well as the future.</i>

1081
01:45:32,755 --> 01:45:36,813
<i>Words spoken by Franklin D. Roosevelt
in the depths of the Depression...</i>

1082
01:45:36,978 --> 01:45:38,734
<i>...were quoted in the Senate today.</i>

1083
01:45:39,634 --> 01:45:42,384
<i>"This is preeminently the time
to speak the truth...</i>

1084
01:45:42,546 --> 01:45:44,334
<i>...frankly and boldly.</i>

1085
01:45:44,498 --> 01:45:48,426
<i>Nor need we shrink from honestly
facing conditions in our country today.</i>

1086
01:45:48,977 --> 01:45:51,694
<i>This great nation will endure
as it has endured...</i>

1087
01:45:51,857 --> 01:45:53,897
<i>...will revive and will prosper.</i>

1088
01:45:54,256 --> 01:45:59,438
<i>We face our common difficulties. They
concern, thank God, only material things.</i>

1089
01:46:00,304 --> 01:46:02,987
<i>Each age is a dream that is dying...</i>

1090
01:46:03,151 --> 01:46:05,388
<i>...for one that is coming to birth. "</i>

1091
01:47:21,959 --> 01:47:23,715
I've been worried about you.

1092
01:47:26,215 --> 01:47:27,709
How are you?

1093
01:47:28,103 --> 01:47:29,859
Like everybody else.

1094
01:47:30,983 --> 01:47:33,284
Looking for a way to begin again.

1095
01:47:38,598 --> 01:47:41,118
You're gonna need a partner.
