so it's nice. It's for a year. A year.

154
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:41,950
Chief! Ah, this is crazy!

155
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:45,271
The coffee tastes good here, too...
Seriously...

156
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,970
Stop looking at my chest, it isn't yours.

157
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,641
Is that so?

158
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:07,970
So. Is it doing alright?

159
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,170
It's not that side.

160
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:12,520
Is that so?

161
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:14,731
Ahhh... Gosh..

162
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:19,050
You seem just fine. The
way you're acting up.

163
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,140
I heard you asked for a warning from Chief.
You told him you want to get a warning

164
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:26,590
- and step down from the anchor chair?
- Yes.

165
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:30,480
You have no idea that while you've been away, the viewers
have been flooding the comment boards and have been

166
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:34,590
calling the broadcasting station looking
for you and waiting for you, right?

167
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:40,120
They weren't looking for you out of curiosity and
they weren't waiting for you out of pity either.

168
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:45,860
They say they want to see you every day in that chair.
Where you've gone to, whether you've been fired,

169
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:51,750
complaint calls are still flooding in. Not only
that, the pure love between you and Pyo Na Ri,

170
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,810
and Reporter Lee Hwa Shin is
doing well without relapsing.

171
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:59,860
They want to see that you're healthy every single day. Do
you want to run away like a pubescent student that much?

172
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:02,750
- No way.
- Everyone is only talking about you two.

173
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:06,280
Didn't you see the placard hanging
per the president's orders?

174
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:12,201
I'm sure that very soon, the president will
properly get his money's worth out of you two.

175
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:27,561
I'm giving you up, Sunbae. It's over.
I'm not going to like you anymore.

176
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:31,210
Did a better guy appear?

177
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:34,581
I still think your chest is sexy.

178
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:40,061
And I want to work alongside you while
sitting here for a long time to come.

179
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,121
So be healthy.

180
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:52,640
<i>Many companies have been found to be using Sophora instead
of the most costly lingzhi mushrooms, to make supplementary</i>

181
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:57,940
<i>health food containing red ginseng and Tian Ma, which can
affect the digestive system and hinder consciousness.</i>

182
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:00,031
<i>Let's not break up.</i>

183
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,651
<i>Let's break... not break up. Let's
not break up. Let's not break up.</i>

184
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,671
<i>Let's break up.</i>

185
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:16,231
For a whole week, where the hell did
you go and what did you do? Here.

186
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:22,730
Mom.

187
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,120
What?

188
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:27,261
Let's break up.

189
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:31,060
Let us break up.

190
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:36,720
This punk, I will just...! Hey, how
can a mother and son break up, huh?!

191
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,081
We can't break up!

192
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:46,721
I can say it so easily to Mom.
Why can't I say it..?

193
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:54,671
Are you done with work?

194
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,830
<i>No.</i>
- Yeah.

195
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,651
Do you want to have dinner?

196
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:05,800
<i>I don't want to.</i>
- Let's.

197
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,721
What should we eat?

198
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:17,681
Thank you.

199
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,141
I said we should have some rice. Why Udon?

200
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:27,130
Oh, it's tasty. I've been craving Udon.

201
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:29,160
Can I have a glass of soju?

202
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:33,700
Since when did you ask me before you drank?
Aunty, could I have a bottle of soju, please?

203
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:35,681
Yes.

204
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,050
Mr. Reporter.

205
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,620
When Chi Yeol is done with his college
entrance exam, let's have dinner together.

206
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,410
But Chi Yeol doesn't like me.

207
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:04,050
That's right, he doesn't... But then
again, no matter whom I bring home,

208
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:07,530
he'll act like a father-in-law. No,
no, he'll act like a mother-in-law.

209
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:10,270
He thinks his sister is the
best in the world, so...

210
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:12,150
- Next time...
- Next time?

211
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:18,701
What next time are you talking about? You live next
door, so just treat him like your brother-in-law, okay?

212
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:22,911
Should we get together on the day he's
done with the college entrance exam?

213
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:27,590
Why? Is it because you're afraid
of Chi Yeol? But you know what?

214
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,420
In the scope of things, he's
still a brother-in-law.

215
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,671
Na Ri.

216
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:41,711
<i>Let's break up...</i>
- Let's break up.

217
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:50,840
Is it because you're scared
of a brother-in-law?

218
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,681
Why?

219
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:55,651
Is it because of you are sterile?

220
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,011
Is that it?

221
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:09,031
You knew about it?

222
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:15,850
Since when did you know it?

223
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:20,440
You've known but as though you didn't, you've been
watching me while having me in your palm, is that it?

224
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:23,871
Not long after you disappeared...

225
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:35,100
Slow down!

226
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,801
Move.

227
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,881
How ridiculous I must have looked...

228
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:51,130
That's good then. Let's break up.

229
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:54,051
- I don't want to.
- Let's end this.

230
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:59,441
Mr. Reporter, I'm okay even
if we don't have kids.

231
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,811
I'm really okay.

232
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:16,120
I only need you. And... I don't even have
the confidence to raise kids well and...

233
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,810
You're really good at lying.

234
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,410
No, I'm telling you I'm fine.

235
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,721
You're making a person
pitiful in an instant.

236
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,370
- Did you feel sorry for me?
- Don't be sorry, Reporter.

237
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:32,530
Did you pity me? Is that why you
didn't say anything and just watched?

238
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:39,670
I wanted to give you time. I figured you
would tell me in time, comfortably,

239
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,971
so I just waited.

240
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:52,770
I can cope with not having kids, but I can't
be without you. I can't break up with you.

241
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,531
I said I'm not okay with it!

242
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:59,771
This is not a problem that can be resolved
just because you say you're okay.

243
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:04,981
As long as you're understanding, is that
supposed to put me at ease? Is that it?

244
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:11,320
I... am confident I will
love you a whole lifetime,

245
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:18,400
but... whether I can make you
happy for a whole lifetime...

246
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:21,091
I keep questioning it thousands of times.

247
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:27,800
- So...
- I can't break up with you.

248
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,401
Let's break up.

<i>Huh? Right. Ah, that's what happened.
Right. That's right.</i>

I have some family problems in England.
I have to go to there for a week.

275
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,700
Hey, what about the 9 o'clock news?
Have you lost your mind?

276
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:04,460
Hey. Do all broadcasters have to keep doing
the news even when their mother is ill?

277
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,120
If I'm not there when my mother passes, I don't think I'll be
able to swallow even a spoonful of food for the rest of my life.

278
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,360
How could I possibly eat when I'm
not even a human being?! How?!

279
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:14,330
Oh, is your mom that ill?

280
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:16,070
Ahh... Seriously...

281
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:20,830
Hey, hey. For just a week, just for a week,
couldn't we put Lee Hwa Shin in the anchor seat?

282
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:22,571
Hwa Shin?

283
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:27,880
Hey, you could get your seat permanently taken away by
Hwa Shin that way. You never know about these things.

284
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:30,980
Hey, if Hwa Shin gets a good response, do you
think the president will give you the seat back?

285
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:32,410
Please help me, Jong Hwan.

286
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:34,460
Oh, Jeez. I'm going crazy...

287
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,200
Tell the president about it yourself, then.

288
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:41,531
Yes. Yes. Pardon?

289
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,941
What do you mean, Pyo Na Ri? President...

290
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:52,120
Yes, Yes. Yes, I hear what you are saying.

291
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:56,770
But it's too soon for Pyo Na Ri, and there
are too many risks we have to watch out for.

292
00:25:56,771 --> 00:26:01,181
Well, anyway, I'm against the idea of having the
two of them doing the 9 o'clock news together.

293
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:18,850
Think about it the other way around... If I couldn't
have children, you'd still ask to break up with me?

294
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:21,301
- Would you?
- Get lost.

295
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:30,220
To be honest, a marriage without
children... Yeah, I can imagine.

296
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,320
We could get sick of each other
with just the two of us.

297
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:37,000
Looking at a child who looks like us will
keep us going even when things get hard.

298
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:40,350
And we'll make up quickly when we
argue for the sake of the child.

299
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:45,700
We'll smile while looking at the child and
overcome our worries. It would be nice.

300
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:46,641
That's it, then.

301
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:51,050
But Reporter... I can't
even imagine a marriage

302
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:55,300
where you're not there.
When you disappeared,

303
00:26:55,301 --> 00:27:00,200
everything the doctor said about us not being
able to have a child seemed pointless.

304
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:07,380
When I couldn't find you, I realized that there's
nothing more I want than just to have you by my side.

305
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:11,490
So please, Mr. Reporter... if it
isn't because you dislike me...

306
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:16,710
If it's not because you're tired of me already,
please don't ask me to break up with you.

307
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:20,101
- If you say let's break up once more...
- Let's break up.

308
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,371
Let's break up.

309
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:29,210
- Are you even human?
- Let's break up.

310
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:31,150
- Won't you close your mouth?
- I said, let's break up.

311
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,991
- That bad mouth of yours, I'll sew it up!
- I said, let's break up.

312
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:38,940
How can you say that so easily?

313
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:41,211
It's an easy thing for me to say.
Let's break up.

314
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:45,050
Geez... You're really a bad guy...

315
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:47,171
Let's break up.

316
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:58,300
Reporter, it's not over. People say nothing is 100%
impossible because of advances made in medical science.

317
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,900
Let's just do it every day. Let's sleep
together whenever we get a chance,

318
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:05,540
and eat whatever is good for us and sleep together,
take care our bodies and sleep together,

319
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:10,610
without any burden to you, let's just
think of it as taking a really great nap.

320
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:14,170
If we don't give up,
they say it's possible.

321
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:16,200
You want just keep sleeping
together every day?

322
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:17,700
Let's make an effort together.

323
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,780
Ah, so pitiful... Hurry up and go home.

324
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,640
I will be good to you.

325
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:22,800
What if it doesn't happen even then?

326
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,990
- Those kinds of things, say that after we sleep together a hundred times.
- And what if it still doesn't happen?

327
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:30,990
Then... let's take a nap every time we eat one
of the noodles at my place you bought me.

328
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:35,030
- And if it still doesn't happen?
- We'll buy some more noodles.

329
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:38,470
Don't look at me like that...

330
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:42,570
I'm not marrying you. Do you
know how many noodles there are?

331
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,710
It's not quite a thousand.

332
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:47,780
- I'm not marrying you.
- Marry me.

333
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:49,411
Let's break up.

334
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,551
Let's break up!

335
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:57,711
Go.

336
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:05,280
- You're dumping me?
- Yes.

337
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:08,511
- I've been dumped?
- Yes.

338
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:12,571
- You're not going to regret it, right?
- Yeah.

339
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:20,710
Fine. Let's end it all.

340
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:25,200
Yeah, fine, fine. Just end it.
Let's break up. Break up.

341
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:27,001
(Let's break up.)

342
00:29:45,691 --> 00:29:48,480
Hurry up and go back to your home!

343
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,310
Ah, I don't know.

344
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:54,651
Ah, Reporter, you're really something.

345
00:29:55,911 --> 00:30:02,040
Your pride is really amazing. Geez...
You're tops in stubbornness.

346
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,201
You're so great.

347
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,511
With this, I've really
done as much as I can.

348
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,581
Don't feel hurt by me.

349
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:15,380
Trying to hold onto you this much,
I've really done all I can.

350
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:19,960
Don't say that you've been hurt by me
behind my back. Don't even criticize me!

351
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:23,070
- Oh, fine, let's just forget it. Forget it.
- I told you to leave.

352
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,430
- Just forget it.
- You'll freeze to death.

353
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:27,541
Just forget everything!

354
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:33,920
Mr. Reporter, since it's the last
time, do you want to have some ramen?

355
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:36,321
- Last time?
- Yeah.

356
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:40,951
- No thanks.
- Do you not like that it's the last time or that it's ramen or do you not like the nap?

357
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:44,800
Okay, let's forget this.

358
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,530
Forget it. Just forget it. Forget
everything. Forget it all!

359
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:49,311
Aren't you going already?!

360
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:53,961
We broke up, so don't worry about me.
Just go in and sleep.

361
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,801
Noona.

362
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,771
What are you doing there?

363
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:05,851
You saw, didn't you? Your sister was drinking
and creating a scene and clinging onto me.

364
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:08,510
Get rid of your sister from here.

365
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:09,790
What did you say?

366
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:14,130
How dare you say "get
rid of" about a woman?

367
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:15,551
Hey!

368
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:18,451
Get over here already!

369
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,541
Are you off to work?

370
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,340
Are you... going somewhere?

371
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,280
Yes, I have some matters to attend to so...

372
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:47,551
Ah, then see you at the
hotel in the evening.

373
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:02,270
What are you doing at a
hotel in the evening?

374
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,401
We'll have to see...

375
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:07,561
Going to hotels already...

376
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:09,440
Be careful that people don't start talking.

377
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:11,941
You just need to keep your mouth shut.

378
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:17,410
Seems like you'll have to eat dinner alone.

379
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:21,640
I figured, so I made you your
favorite dish, codfish soup.

380
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:25,790
Don't eat just whatever just because
you are alone. Eat properly, hmm?

381
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:29,557
Heat it up before you eat. You
know how to heat it up, right?

382
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,211
I don't know!

383
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:37,511
I hate that you're dating. I'm bored.

384
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:40,430
I feel like you're being
taken away from me, by Chef.

385
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,940
Hey... how can you say such a thing?

386
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:47,121
I'm not going to reheat it and eat it. I
don't know how to reheat it. I'm not eating!

387
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,991
How can someone change!?

388
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:58,081
Hey, I'm finally starting to date after
500 years. Help me out, would you?

389
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:03,000
Hey, Hwa Sin and Pyo Na Ri, you
two do the 9 o'clock news.

390
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,830
Why? I don't want to work with her.

391
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:06,970
It's the president's orders.
Just do well for a week.

392
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:08,470
Reporter Gye probably won't let it happen.

393
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:12,230
The president said to try putting the two
of you together as temporary replacements.

394
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:16,710
Recently you two made news, so he thought we might
get good ratings. Happy now? You want me to go on?

395
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,400
We can't.

396
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:22,360
I'm not asking you, this is an order.
How come you only think about yourself?

397
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:23,850
It's a good opportunity for Pyo Na Ri.

398
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:27,270
This is a good chance for her to recover
after ruining the election broadcast.

399
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,090
Also, Reporter Gye said she doesn't want to do it
with you. She said she's taking a break for a week.

400
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,700
I will try my best. Thank you
for giving me the opportunity.

401
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:35,550
I said we can't do this, Chief.

402
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:36,941
Leave.

403
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,620
You won't be able to get
married at this rate.

404
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:41,680
Why?

405
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:43,850
If you do the 9 o'clock news with me,

406
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:46,910
people who didn't know will find
out about our relationship.

407
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:50,020
Nothing good can come out of this. The
broadcasting company is just using us.

408
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,280
To get more viewers.

409
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:55,140
It's not because you think I'm still not good
enough even for a week as temporary replacements?

410
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,900
I'm going to do my very best
even if it's for a week.

411
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,140
I'm sure you will.

412
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:02,020
It's too soon for you.

413
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:05,380
If you're in a too visible of a place,
you'll get even more arrows flying at you.

414
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:06,690
What I'm saying is, it could
be dangerous for you.

415
00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:10,450
Maybe because I've never been in a safe position before,
I don't feel that afraid when you say it's dangerous.

416
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:12,110
- It's not a joke.
- The same goes for me.

417
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,031
We broke up.

418
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:15,660
You act like it's for my sake that
you don't want to get married.

419
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:18,300
And you're telling me not to be
the 9 o'clock anchor either?

420
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:20,550
Why did you become such a scaredy-cat?
Why are you such a coward?

421
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:24,910
Me having breast cancer, being sterile...
Don't forget it.

422
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:27,130
Are you stupid? Think about it again.

423
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:31,811
Why have you turned into a scaredy-cat?
Why have you become a coward?

424
00:34:41,191 --> 00:34:42,900
I won't ever be your replacement.

425
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:48,160
You know I'm doing the morning news, right? You can't
come back since I won't give you the seat back.

426
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:50,200
Good luck.

427
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,481
Okay. Thank you all. Geez.

428
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:57,301
It's unlike you to act so pitiful.

429
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:02,570
Do you know why I'm not doing
the 9 o'clock news with you?

430
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:06,290
You met me first when I was a high schooler, so you'll
always see me as a high schooler, Sister-in-law.

431
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,941
Correct.

432
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:13,641
How can I do the 9 o'clock
news with a high schooler?

433
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,160
Oh, don't be so down.

434
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:19,200
Do you think I don't
know what you're up to?

435
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,740
Not just for a week, but
forever, here, in this spot,

436
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:25,081
you're trying to take over the seat, right?

437
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:26,780
You think it's a good opportunity, right?

438
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:28,480
Isn't that obvious?

439
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:33,211
Not just me but for anyone else, through
this kind of opportunity a star is born.

440
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:43,290
Ah, don't worry. My sister
can't win against me.

441
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,270
Oh... Can I... go to the
bathroom for a bit...?

442
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,691
Yeah. Yes, go ahead.

443
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:01,931
Hey, it's the first broadcast
so keep the tension.

Though the world can't change the news,

449
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:37,880
the news can change the world.

450
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:41,300
This is SBC News Hotline. I am Lee Hwa Sin.

451
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,351
I am Pyo Na Ri.

452
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,170
- It's to the point.
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.

453
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:51,130
What kind of woman could
have cured your asexuality?

454
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm so excited and curious
that I ran all the way here.

455
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:56,290
She's younger, right?

456
00:36:56,291 --> 00:37:00,611
Yes, she is. She's younger than you.

457
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:06,750
Sunbae.

458
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:10,330
Hey, Bang Ja Yeong! What
are you doing here?

459
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:15,151
Sister, say hello to her. To me, she's
the sexiest woman in this world.

460
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:23,100
It's been estimated that the daily wage of
former CEO of the "D" Group, Kang Yong Jae,

461
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:26,190
who went to jail over tax evasion
and refusing to pay fines

462
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:28,620
is 4,000,000.

463
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,140
Every time he works 7 hours,
from 38,000,000 of fine,

464
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:34,320
4,000,000 won is written off each time.

465
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,750
- A normal wage...
- Could he be digging up diamonds at his labor house?

466
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:42,650
<i>Hey, hey, Hwa Shin!</i> What is he
trying to add on now? Don't do it!

467
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:46,950
Even if he doesn't work on weekends and
on national holidays, he still gets paid.

468
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:50,370
At this rate, it looks to be a
very lucrative part-time job.

469
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,030
Hey, Pyo Na Ri! Step in! Step in!

470
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:55,310
A normal wage for labor
for a criminal is 30,000.

471
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:58,660
So if you're to pay off 38,000,000 in fines,
it'll take more than a hundred years.

472
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:03,160
At the very least in consideration for our citizens
who work hard every day while paying their taxes,

473
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,670
former CEO, Kang Yong Jae,

474
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:08,550
- please keep folding those shopping bags diligently.
<i>- Hey, Hwa Shin! Are you crazy! Why are you doing this?!</i>

475
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:11,170
Your department stores' bags
should be an exception, no?

476
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:14,000
This concludes the SBC News Hotline.

477
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,300
Why do you always do this when I'm PD?

478
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:18,850
Do this to other PDs on another
live show, you bastard!

479
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,341
Have a restful night.

Thank you for your efforts.

481
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:31,370
You still think I'm a scaredy-cat?
Should I be punished?

482
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:35,620
Hey. Although it's refreshing,
go easy, would you?

483
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:39,140
While scratching that itch,
you could bleed instead.

484
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:42,500
Hey, Hwa Shin, at this rate, D Group's
department store will pull out all their ads.

485
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:45,280
Aish, you're asking to get fired
on your first day, you bastard.

486
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,160
If I get fired, I'll just
go fold some shopping bags.

487
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,670
Well done. Good job.

488
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,010
This is new bedding.

489
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:53,920
Yes, it's new, but you have to wash
them still, right? I'll be going now.

490
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:56,101
- Yes, goodbye.
- Yes.

491
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:10,671
Why are you following me?

492
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:18,411
Oh, it arrived.

493
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:24,790
What's all this?

494
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,820
This is the rice cooker we picked together.

495
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:30,320
This is the iron I bought that
time to iron your shirts.

496
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:32,040
And this is our bedding.

497
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:36,531
It's brand new but it's been laundered,
so we can use it right away. Right away.

498
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:42,610
You said forget it. You said you
were going to forget it all.

499
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:43,870
I'm leaving.

500
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:46,170
You didn't buy the rice
cooker for yourself?

501
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:50,980
No. Our rice cooker's lid is a little loose, but I
can't throw it away because it was my mother's.

502
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:53,681
I think I can use it for
another ten years or so.

503
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:56,311
Let's break up.

504
00:39:56,312 --> 00:40:00,611
These are all things you don't have at
home. You came without a winter blanket.

505
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:02,770
Let's use it as we live together.

506
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:06,750
This is all of my dowry.
Don't expect anything more.

507
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:09,630
I won't marry you.

508
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:10,991
You won't?

509
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:16,670
Really? Then forget it. I'm going.

510
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:18,490
Ah, then what am I
supposed to do with this!?

511
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:21,690
So, I told you I'd make rice for you
with this, and iron your shirts,

512
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:24,260
and use this to nap with you!

513
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:26,181
Are you a tick?

514
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:30,010
Mr. Reporter, I'm a woman who had
a crush on you for three years.

515
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:34,000
On top of that, while liking each other
I've even accepted your marriage proposal

516
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:38,020
and I just got notified to break up.

517
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:42,591
To break up... I think it'll take
me at least... thirty years.

518
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:46,660
I'll break up with you
after thirty years, okay?

519
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,951
Why are you being so foolish? Seriously.

520
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:03,100
<i>Boo Yoo Group's President Choi Jeong Goo has been
charged with 1,700,000,000 won worth of charges.</i>

521
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:07,100
<i>Under the Additional Punishment

<i>Booyoo Group fired most of its permanent workers
in this past year citing an operating deficit.</i>

524
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:18,450
Right now, they're only hiring
temporary workers. This situa...

525
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:23,240
"Boo Yoo Group will be with you until
the day you are rich in mind and body."

526
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:26,410
Hey, hey. There he goes again. Stop. Stop!

527

<i>Stop! Lee Hwa Sin, stop!</i>

528
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:32,650
I guess it was only up to the day in which President
Choi became wealthier rather than the citizens.

529
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:35,800
This concludes the News Hotline.

530

Thank you for tuning in.

531
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:45,931
The news itself is fun to watch, but Hwa
Shin's position is becoming unstable...

532
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,861

I'm going to die from a heart attack because of you.

535
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:08,420
Hey, is it anything new that a Korean
Chaebol is found guilty of tax evasion?

536
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:10,430
I told you clearly before
we started, didn't I?

537

When you talk about Boo Yoo
Group's President Choi's arrest,

538
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:17,430
I told you to do it dryly without any emotion and
just deliver the facts. Did I or didn't I, you punk?!

539
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:19,710
What? Dryly? Let go.

Am I a dryer?

541
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:26,670
Without emotion... Am I a robot? Do I
have to just read it like some parrot?

542
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:30,650
- You said you'd let me say what I wanted in closing!
- Right.

543
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:34,570
Seeing President Choi's conduct, I just can't only deliver
the facts dryly like a robot! What do you want me to do?!

544
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:36,880
You didn't have me sit here just to
behave like a tongue inside a mouth!

545
00:42:36,881 --> 00:42:40,010
You know I'm not telling you to
behave like a tongue inside a mouth!

546
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:43,410
I'm saying not to act like a thorn
stuck inside a mouth, you punk!

547
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:47,390
You'll get your tongue pulled out at that
rate. Are you dying to have it pulled out?

548
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:52,470
Are you happy that you got to spew out whatever you
want? You think the viewership will go up? Who cares?

549

did you go during that week?

You think I came knowing you'd be here?
I looked everywhere,

Are you confessing your love to me?

I...

568
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:28,630
used to think that I was a pretty lonely guy. But after
seeing you from behind leaving the broadcasting station,

00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:32,590
I realized that you're lonelier than me.

I thought you were anymore.

How big your love is... How
sincere it is, I saw it.

00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:04,500
What are you doing?

591
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:06,460
What are you doing!?

592
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:10,630
<i>How much advertising did Reporter
Lee Hwa Shin lose up to now?</i>

593
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:15,471
<i>Stop him from doing any more broadcasting and send him to the
employees' children's kindergarten as a maintenance staff!</i>

594
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,151
Let's eat, Mr. Reporter.

595
00:48:44,181 --> 00:48:45,720
It's delicious.

596
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:48,551
A compliment? Let's see.

597
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:58,941
Whenever it's bland to me, you say it tastes good. Okay,
I got it, I'll make it like this for you in the future.

598
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:04,540
Reporter, you know what? We don't
need a child. There's already one.

599
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,390
Hwa Shin will be raised by Pyo Na Ri.

600
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:08,770
Shut your mouth.

601
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:11,700
- If I shut my mouth how am I supposed to eat?
- Then open it only when you're eating.

602
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:15,040
Are we really breaking up over this?

603
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,580
Yeah.

604
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,561
You really don't change your mind...

605
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:27,630
Also, when you do the news, watch your expressions
and stop being so cautious because of me.

606
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,870
But you make me that way! Please
watch how you say things!

607
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:37,860
Did you hear that that department store pulled
their ads? At this rate, you'll get fired soon!

608
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:42,370
Got it. Got it. Got it. Alright. Just eat.

609
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:45,300
Let's talk about work after we're
done eating. That's enough.

610
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:48,910
Don't you ever forget it. Anchors
should only care about the viewers.

611
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:53,850
If you care about anyone else, then viewers won't trust
you. It's the end for an anchor if you have no trust.

612
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:58,140
Ah, so unlucky, seriously. Always
around the dinner table...

613
00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:00,910
- Before, you used to say that I was cool whenever I said things like this.
- I did?

614
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:03,210
You didn't mean what you said? Huh?

615
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:06,970
It was written all over your eyes, nose, mouth,
and forehead that you thought I was cool.

616
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,531
But now what? Unlucky?

617
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:13,310
I did? Was I that blind?

618
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:14,860
Ah, this... Seriously...

619
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:18,141
I guess you don't like being called
unlucky even though we're breaking up.

620
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:26,970
Have some anju. (snacks eaten with alcohol)

621
00:50:26,971 --> 00:50:30,061
The things I hate the most
in this world are anchovies.

622
00:50:33,011 --> 00:50:36,031
Even if you hate it, have some.
It's good for your breast.

623
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,890
I don't want to.

624
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:42,000
You really don't listen, do you?

625
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:43,970
Why should I listen to you when
I don't even listen to my mom?

626
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:46,780
Listen to your mom and
me too from now on then!

627
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:49,190
- What?
- When you're doing news, too,

628
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:53,750
how you can you butt in without a
signal whenever I read my lines?

629
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,490
Do you know how much it shocks
me everytime it happens?

630
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:59,770
- That is...
- Are you a reckless driver? A newbie driver?

631
00:50:59,771 --> 00:51:01,240
You would be the newbie and
I'd be the reckless one.

632
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:04,210
Whether a newbie or reckless,
they're equally dangerous.

633
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:08,570
A reckless driver will probably get into a huge accident
over his ego while trusting his own driving skills.

634
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:13,580
A newbie would be better. They'd be more
careful and wouldn't cause a big accident.

635
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:17,700
If you look at it this way, you're
way worse than Reporter Park!

636
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:22,230
What's? How dare you compare
me to that bastard?!

637
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:26,310
What? I am worse? Where am I worse? How am
I worse? Does that make sense right now?

638
00:51:26,311 --> 00:51:29,140
Even if Reporter Park
disrespects his partner...

639
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:34,100
at least he didn't butt in every time I do
my lines and say whatever was on his mind.

640
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:40,167
Every time I'm on with you I'm so nervous that
I feel like I'm going to get a heart attack.

641
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:42,550
I told you not to do it in the first place!

642
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:45,970
Because I didn't think you could handle it, I
told you not to do it. Did I or didn't I?!

643
00:51:45,971 --> 00:51:49,910
Why should I not do it?! You (informally) should be
thinking about how to work well with your partner instead!

644
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:52,940
- You?
- Are you a dictator?!

645
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:54,730
- Shut your mouth.
- Are you a tyrant?!

646
00:51:54,731 --> 00:51:58,241
- Hey, shut it!
- Do you think being a reckless driver makes you cool?!
