1
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,002
Although what you are about to see is a work of fiction,

2
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,503
Although what you are about to see is a work of fiction,
it should nevertheless be played

3
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:42,904
Although what you are about to see is a work of fiction,
it should nevertheless be played at maximum volume.

4
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:32,200
Histories, like ancient ruins, are the fictions of empires.

5
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,898
While everything forgotten hangs in dark dreams of the past,

6
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:44,895
ever threatening to return.

7
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:13,743
Dublin 1854, birthplace of Oscar Wilde,

8
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,529
Lord'n heaven!

9
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:21,422
Madame Wilde! Richard!
Come quickly!

10
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,860
I want to be a farmer.

11
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:47,321
I want to be a barrister.

12
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:49,494
I want to be a truck-driver.

13
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:52,681
I want to be...a pop-idol.

14
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,866
One hundred years later...

15
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,853
Get him, get him!

16
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,131
Leave him!

17
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:34,236
Childhood, adults always say,
is the happiest time in life.

18
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:40,836
But as long as he could remember,
Jack Fairy knew better.

19
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:52,356
Until one mysterious day, when Jack would
discover that somewhere there were others...

20
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,662
...quite like him.

21
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,049
Singled out for a great gift.

22
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,728
And one day...

23
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,829
...the whole stinking world...

24
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,530
...would be theirs.

25
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:56,847
Hey!

26
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:14,953
Look! It's Jack Fairy.

27
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:17,673
Who's Jack Fairy?

28
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:02,239
"The streets of London are ablaze in sparkle
make-up and glittering frocks..."

29
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:07,401
"...as the boys and girls of the current
glam-rock craze pay tribute to their patron saint..."

30
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:08,851
"pop-star Brian Slade"

31
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:12,452
"...and his space-age rock persona -
Maxwell Demon."

32
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:16,833
"Yeah, Brian Slade, he's just so different.
I mean, I've never seen anyone quite like him."

33
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:20,114
"And 'Lipstick Traces', his last album was just...
it was just something special."

34
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:23,515
"It's an album that's like, appealing to
so many people like that."

35
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:28,470
"A palpable whirl of anticipation
can be felt outside London's Lyceum Theatre..."

36
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:31,928
"...as fans await the final show
on Slade's smash world tour."

37
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:36,686
"Security around the performer is tightened
following a recent BBC interview..."

38
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:40,847
"...in which he admitted to premonitions
of being assassinated on stage."

39
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,469
Turn it off!

40
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,860
"...any of his enthusiastic
and colorful followers..."

41
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:49,261
"...some of whom have been
queueing here since late last night."

42
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,605
Brian, the time!

43
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,654
Ladies and Gentlemen!

44
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:02,255
The Lyceum Theatre.

45
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,594
In cooperation with "Bijou Music"...

46
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,160
...is proud to present

47
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:12,061

successful European tour...

<i>Singer Brian Slade shot on stage.</i>

50
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:40,485
Put out the torches!
Hide the moon! Hide the stars!

51
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:46,006
For once, there was an unknown land...

52
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:50,807
full of strange flowers and subtle perfums.

53
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:57,109
A land of which it is joy of all
the joys to dream.

54
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:01,273
A land where all things are perfect.

55
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,374
And poisonous.

56
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:31,494
"It appears today's youngsters
have fashioned a whole new bent..."

57
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:34,485
"...on the so-called sexual liberation
of the flower-power set."

58
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,737
"The long hair and the love-beads
have given way to glitter make-up..."

59
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,538
"...platform shoes..."

60
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:42,997
"...and a whole new taste for glamour,
nostalgia and just plain outrageousness."

61
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,813
"Is London not shocked?"

62
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,559
"London is improving."

63
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,260
"Well, I think it's a disgrace."

64
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:51,662
"Parading around all ponced-up like
a pack of bleeding woofters."

65
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:53,863
"Bloody hell!
What will they think of next?"

66
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:03,866
"And heading up this flash stampede
is none other that pop-giant Brian Slade..."

67
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,936
"whose stylish escapades have paved the way
for a whole new breed of performing artists..."

68
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:14,287
"...from Curt Wild and The Flaming Creatures
to Jack Fairy and Polly Small."

69
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,648
"Thanks to Slade, today's youngsters
are singing a whole new tune."

70
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,781
"So, you're saying you're bisexual?"

71
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,411
"Yeah. I like boys, I like girls."

72
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:25,268
"They are all great.
No difference, is there?"

73
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:27,969
"Mr. BBC"

74
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:32,439
"Rock music has always been a reaction
to accepted standards."

75
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,291
"And homosexuality has been going on
for centuries, yeah."

76
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:39,337
"At the moment,
having a gay image is 'in'."

77
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:42,279
"You know, just like a few years ago
it was trendy to wear a..."

78
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:45,822
"...a long grey coat with a
Led Zeppelin record under your arm."

79
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:50,372
"Everyone is into this scene,
because it is supposedly the thing to do right now."

80
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:54,732
"But you just can't fake being gay, you know.
If you're gonna claim that you're gay..."

81
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,875
"...you're gonna have to
make love in gay-style and..."

82
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,321
"...most of these kids just
aren't gonna make it."

83
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:04,664
"That line - 'Everyone's bisexual' -
it's a very popular thing to say right now."

84
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,508
"But personally I think it's
meaningless."

but in between them - Norman Brown.</i>

"I knew i should create a sensation",
gasped the Rocket.

88
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,179
And he went out.

89
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,368
Ok, Lionel. That's it.
Thanks.

90
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,219
I don't get it.

91
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,220
What don't you get? It was
a stunt. The guy faked his own murder.

92
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:41,585
-Yeah, but why?
-Publicity.

93
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:43,986
Arthur, any recollection?

94
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,375
Of what?

95
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,076
Of this Slade fellow.

96
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:57,456
Well, he's an early 70s
glam-rock singer.

97
00:13:57,564 --> 00:14:00,420
Told you we could count
on "Mr. Old Time Rock'n'Roll".

98
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,153
Yeah.

99
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:03,554
Count on me for what?

100
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,815
I thought I was on the
Reynolds trip.

101
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:08,816
Well you are.

102
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,176
But the president isn't due
until the 8th.

103
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,577
And I need a piece
for the Weekender now.

104
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,247
Great.

105
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:23,916
Next week is the 10th year anniversary
of the whole shooting stunt incident.

106
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,569
I'd like you to find out what
happened, where he is today.

107
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,510
"What ever happened to
Brian Slade?" Ok?

108
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:37,791
Yeah, and naturally you want me
for this, because I'm the resident Brit. Right?

109
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:42,589
Nah. No, no, no.
I want you, because you remember.

110
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:49,936

"to sign up in their local government
offices and join the committee..."

113
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:02,577
Because I remember.

114
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:10,055
Suddenly I was being paid to remember all the
things that money, the future and the serious life...

115
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,119
had made so certain I'd forget.

116
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,320
And for what?

117
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:17,280
Some meaningless prank,
a decade old.

118
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,981
Why was is suddenly up
to me to figure it out?

119
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,239
Clearly there was something.

120
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,840
Something from the past,
spooking me back.

121

Ten years.

Ten years and the world
had changed so completely that...

131

seemed like someone else's life.

the shooting on the 5th of February of singer Brian Slade..."

154
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:50,087
"...at London's Lyceum Theatre
was a publicity stunt..."

155
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:52,975
"mounted by the singer's company
Bijou Music Limited."

156
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:57,650
"Manager Jerry Divine announced today that
his company meant no harm in their escapades."

157
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,432
"That it was intended solely
as entertainment."

158
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,804
"Very unfortunate, very sad and unfortunate
that in this day and age...

159
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:12,069
"...an artist's quest for artistic freedom
should cost him his career."

160
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:15,848
-Warum, denken Sie?
-Why do you think?

161
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:17,830
"I dunno."

162
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:26,091
"I dunno. It got too big, I guess. Too...
got too schizoid, you know."

163
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:31,857
"I mean...he thought he fucking was
Maxwell Demon in the end, you know?"

164
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:37,027
"And Maxwell Demon...
he thought he was God."

165
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:43,293
<i>"Brian Slade sales plummet"</i>

166
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,474
<i>"Brian Slades U.K. tour cancelled"</i>

167
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,955
<i>"Singer Brian Slade scheduled

168
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:52,441
<i>"Singer Brian Slade charged
with cocaine possession"</i>

169
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:11,037
Brian Slade? Oh yes.

170
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:18,095
Quite well.
Once upon a time.

171
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,038
So...?

172
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:33,606
So, what was he...
what was he...like?

173
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,750
Who's that? Brian?

174
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,151
Yeah.

175
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:51,049
Like nothing I'd ever
seen before.

176
00:23:56,646 --> 00:24:02,445
And in the end...
like nothing he appeared.

177
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:14,842
He was...elegance,
walking arm in arm with lie.

178
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:23,142
His real name, in fact,
was Thomas.

179
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:27,539
And his father owned a small
tiling business in suburban Birmingham.

180
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,239
But Brian never cared much
for the suburbs.

181
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:36,536
As a young boy, he had the rare fortune
of spending a summer in London with his aunt.

182
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:40,636
A figure of some ill repute
in the Slade family, after she married a cockney...

183
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:47,035
in the entertainment field and
followed him off to Deptford.

184
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,522
Brian's tender introduction to the
theatrical underworld...

185
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:49,023
would leave a dramatic impression.

186
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:21,514
So what are you?
A mod or a rocker?

187
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,615
Six of one, half a dozen of the other,
really.

188
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:31,912
Taking their cue from Little Richard,
the swank London mods – short for modernists –

189
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,711
were the first to wear mascara
and lacquer their hair.

190
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,509
The first true Dandies of pop...

191
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:45,609
and known to just about any indiscretion,
where a good suit was involved.

192
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:00,504
All right, lads?

193
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,898
Style...
always wins out in the end.

194
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:41,597
Cheers!

195
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:45,298
For Brian, the mods were a glamorous call to arms.

196
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:48,995
Or at least to London,
where three years later...

197
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:54,093
at the Sombrero Club in Kensington,
I would hear him sing for the very first time.

198
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:03,691
Everything, it seemed, started at the Sombrero.
No club in London had more notorious sway.

199
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:09,889
And there, at the centre of it
was Brian's American wife, Mandy...

200
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:15,788
who's dramatic transformation to London party girl
was a constant source of amusement to us all.

201
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,888
You all know me.
Subtlety is my middle name.

202
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:23,887
It’s as subtle as the piece of skin between
my vagina and my anus – ooh la! la!

203
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:28,686
Now what’s is that called,
does anyone remember what that's called?

204
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:32,985
No man’s land! Oh gosh,
my geesh, darling!

205
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:35,784
Now, ladies of and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

206
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:38,285
And whomever else who may be in
the house this evening.

207
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,383
It is my supreme pleasure...

208
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:45,081
to introduce all you lovely
little minxes here tonight...

209
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:49,682
to the Sombrero Club’s prettiest star...

210
00:28:49,683 --> 00:28:53,279
and my most shimmering hubby!

211
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,680
I give you Brian Slade!

212
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,661
Say, have a look at “Miss Beautiful"!

213
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,859
-Have a look at the homosexual!
-A slut, mates, a slut in fancy clothes!

214
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:27,958
-Who is he?
-Some scrubber my dear, I do assure you.

215
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:34,558
-But not that scruffy, as I last recall.
-Ooh, you’re wicked.

216
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:45,355
He won’t be home tonight.

217
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:48,952
So, I introduced myself.

218
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:54,551
Told him I was developing my own management company
and on the look-out for new talent.

219
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:58,451
He introduced me to his wife,
asked me what sign I was...

220
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,449
and before the week was out,
we were signing contracts.

221
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:11,147
You see, Brian believed in the future.

222
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,847
He despised the hypocrisy of the
"peace and love" generation...

223
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:21,046
and felt his music spoke far more to
its orphans and its outcasts.

224
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:25,845
His revolution, he used to say,
will be a sexual one.

225
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,941
But in 1970, rock audiences bred on...

226
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:32,243
Credence Clearwater and the Beatles...

227
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:38,140
were not entirely sure what to make of this
particular brand of revolt.

228
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,135
Somehow he got it into his head
that he had to perform in a frock.

229
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:04,036
Don’t ask me why. I mean, I thought it was
a bit naughty, a bit of a giggle, but...

230
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:22,032
-Who’s this geezer, then?
-Some shirt-lifter from Birmingham.

231
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:39,729
Get the fuck off!
Cut the shite!

232
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:44,128
-Bugger off, you woofter!
-Fuck off!

233
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:54,524
Darling? Darling, you were fabulous!

234
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:57,723
Every bit! I was beaming, truly,
like someone’s mum.

235
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:02,323
And they adored you!
The whole lot - transported!

236
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:05,322
Transported!?
We went down like a fucking knackered lift!

237
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:08,422
Brian, I tell you,
I think it's simply a matter of presentation.

238
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:10,820
-And with the proper back-up...
-Back-up?

239
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:14,318
What happened to Judy Garland!?
What happened to all your bloody torch song rubbish!?

240
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,919
I know, I know, in a cabaret, but in the context of a
rock show, I can see now, it's just a little bit more dodgy.

241
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,718
The act was there, wasn’t it?
The act was there. Just a...

242
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:24,719
Brian!

243
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:29,816
Lead singer and founder of the greatest
garage band know to mankind...

244
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,189
CURT WILD!

245
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:31,503
Curt Wild, founder of the influential
garage band The Rats...

246
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,301
came from the aluminium
trailer parks of Michigan...

247
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:40,101
where rock folklore
claims far more primitive origins.

248
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:26,491
According to legend, when Curt was 13, he
was discovered by his mother in the family loo...

249
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,891
"servicing" his older brother...

250
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,388
and promptly shipped off for
18 months of schock treatment.

251
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,179
The doctors guaranteed the treatment
would fry the fairy clean out of him.

252
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:27,477
But all it did was make him bonkers...
every time he heard electric guitar.

253
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,765
They despised him.

254
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,166
Yeah.

255
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:31,062
But when you're abused like that...
you know you've touched the stars.

256
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:36,761
I know. I just...
I just wish it'd been me.

257
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,960
Wish I'd thought of it.

258
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:55,359
You will, luv.
You will.

259
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:40,022
-Nice stuff.
-Thanks.

260
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:44,319
Devine. Jerry Devine. Personal management.
I’m interested.

261
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,617
Oh, well, thank you, but I
already have management. He's...

262
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,518
Not in my opinion.

263
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:56,217
The truth is you have talent.
That's obvious.

264
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:59,616
But it doesn't really matter much
what a man does in his life.

265
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:03,715
What matters...
is the legend that grows up around him.

266
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:08,213
Today, you're a talented singer.
That's all right.

267
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:16,813
-I can make you a star.
-And just how do you propose to do that?

268
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:20,210
I will tell you, sir...

269
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,511
When you pin me.

270
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:37,209
I've never in all my life...

271
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,410
May the best man win.

272
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:13,400
Earlier tonight, on the popular chart show
'Top of the Pops', newcomer Brian Slade...

273
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,297
performed his hit single
'The Whole Shebang'...

274
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:19,399
dressed in platform boots
and wearing glitter eye make-up.

275
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,997
A spokesman for the show,
known for showcasing pop's brightest stars...

276
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,996
says they’ve been deluged
with calls all evening.

277
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:30,497
The next day every schoolgirl in London
was wearing glitter eye make-up.

278
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,695
And I was out of a bleeding job.

279
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:38,894
And that, as they say,
was that.

280
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:42,592
I would not hear another word
from Brian -

281
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:46,990
or any of them for that matter -
ever again.

282
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:54,889
Have you got any idea what ultimately happened to him?
I mean, where is he today?

283
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,390
Last I heard he’d returned to Birmingham,
but...

284
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,088
this was three years ago?
Four?

285
00:43:02,787 --> 00:43:06,887
No, I'm sorry, I'm afraid
I can't help you there.

286
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:11,986
-Looks as though it may be unavoidable.
-What's that.

287
00:43:12,485 --> 00:43:15,286
The ex, I'm afraid.

288
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:18,485
But then ever story needs a contrary opinion...

289
00:43:18,984 --> 00:43:24,882
and with Mandy
you're guaranteed excesses of both.

290
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:37,886
-Miss Slade?
-Yeah?

291
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,980
I’m Arthur Stuart, from the Herald.
We spoke on the phone.

292
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:52,677
Anyway, I've just got a few questions
I wanted to ask. It shouldn't take too long.

293
00:43:54,876 --> 00:43:56,175
Do you mind if I sit down?

294
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:58,676
It's a free country. Sort of.

295
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,372
-So, what are you having?

296
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:08,873
Scotch. Rocks.

297
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:12,473
Yeah, make that two.

298
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:16,970
Gee. You must be after some
damn exclusive copy.

299
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:20,169
Well, it's a piece on Brian Slade.

300
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,168
-What, sort of a memory jog kind of thing?
-Yeah.

301
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:32,068
Well it's been, ten years since the whole...
fake shooting incident.

302
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:37,666
Oh, and what a fake it was. Tricking us all in the end
with such an authentic demise.

303
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:41,664
His career, you mean?

304
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:48,063
I mean, have you got any idea what happened to him
or where he is today?

305
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:52,862
Can't you just, run him through the files?
Punch in the name?

306
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:53,860
No, not exactly.

307
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:57,461
Because, honestly darling...

308
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,960
I haven't spoken with Mr Slade in...

309
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:08,059
seven years. At least.
-Seven years? Wow.

310
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:14,557
-Wow. Yeah. At least. Smoke?
-No thanks.

311
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:20,358
No, right after everything crashed,
we..we split.

312
00:45:21,156 --> 00:45:25,356
And Brian, he just...

313
00:45:29,155 --> 00:45:32,252
became someone else.

314
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:37,053
But again, he always was.

315
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,347
That's 10 bob to you, mate.

316
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:18,044
It was New Year's Eve 1969,
the start of a new decade...

317
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,642
and everywhere you went
there was this sense of the future,

318
00:46:22,142 --> 00:46:24,840
the feeling in the air
that anything was possible.

319
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:30,125
See, Jack Fairy had also come to London
in the swinging sixties.

320
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:41,924
And in crowded clubs or hotel bars,
this shipwreck of the streets...

321
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:45,622
rehearsed his future glory.

322
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:52,118
A cigarette tracing a ladder
to the stars.

323
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:23,014
"Maricon, épicène, sexe douteux"
(Faggot, androgyne, sexless)

324
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:26,718
"Le Vice Anglais"
(The English Vice)

325
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:35,210
I needn't mention how essential dreaming is...

326
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:38,110
to the character of the rock star.

327
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,109
Jack, darling!

328
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:51,706
Jack was truly the first of his kind. A true original.
Everybody stole from Jack.

329
00:48:56,607 --> 00:49:06,104
But from the moment Brian Slade stepped into our lives,
nothing would ever be the same.

330
00:49:10,203 --> 00:49:12,301
It was his nature.

331
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,290
Do you jive?

332
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,079
So...I married him.

333
00:52:25,557 --> 00:52:31,657
Times, places, people...

334
00:52:36,057 --> 00:52:38,355
They're all speeding up.

335
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:47,153
So to cope with this evolutionary paranoia...

336
00:52:50,854 --> 00:52:54,151
strange people are chosen...

337
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:03,150
who, through their art,
can move progress more quickly.

338
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:12,447
It was the most stimulating
and reflective period of our marriage.

339
00:53:26,944 --> 00:53:30,743
"Thank you and welcome, pop pickers,
to 'Pick of the Pops'."

340
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,640
"I'm Davy Rocket and
we have a very special show for you today..."

341
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:37,639
"dedicated to one of pop's
blazing new talents..."

342
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:44,740
"and one who's been holding a virtual reign over the British charts
for a startling record breaking 18-month span."

343
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:48,239
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the incomparable Brian Slade."

344
00:53:48,538 --> 00:53:52,737
"Or should I say...Maxwell Demon."

345
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:56,936
The bloke at the front.

346
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,334
Brian, why the make-up?

347
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:04,834
Why? Because rock and roll's a prostitute!
It should be tarted up! Performed!

348
00:54:05,635 --> 00:54:11,734
The music is the mask, while I, in my chiffon and taff,
well, varda the message.

349
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:11,735
Brian, Brian!

350
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:17,732
Bloke in the suit there.

351
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:20,931
What about your fans?
Aren't they likely to get the...wrong impression?

352
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:25,430
-And which wrong impression is that?
-Well, that you're a blinking fruit!

353
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,229
Well thank you, sir, and no,
it doesn't concern me in the least.

354
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,528
I should think that if people
were to get that impression of me...

355
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:36,727
the one to which you so eloquently refer...

356
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:43,026
it would not be a wrong impression in the slightest.
-That is me, that's me dad, that's me!

357
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:46,326
I mean, everybody knows
most people are bisexual.

358
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:47,327
Any more questions?

359
00:54:49,124 --> 00:54:50,423
Yeah, woman with the beret.

360
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:53,124
I was under the impression that you were married
and living North London...

361
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,824
I am married.
Quite happily, in fact.

362
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,923
I just happen to like boys
as much as I like girls.

363
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:02,022
And seeing as my wife feels pretty much the same
about such things...

364
00:55:02,823 --> 00:55:06,223
I should think we've been able to make
a fairly decent go of it so far.

365
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:13,620
Alright, any more questions?
Okay, thank you very much.

366
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:17,618
For the first time in Brian's life,
he was simply telling it like it was.

367
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,417
Did he realize what he'd actually done?

368
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:26,018
How could he have? I mean today,
there'd be fighting in the streets.

369
00:55:26,317 --> 00:55:30,716
But in 1972...
it was more like dancing.

370
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:34,616
A Star is Born -
and He Twinkles

371
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:37,014
Gay stunt at Slade show

372
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:39,413
All that glitters - is gay!

373
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,111
That man, sitting over there in the white suit...

374
00:55:57,311 --> 00:56:02,210
is the biggest thing to come out of this country
since sliced Beatles.

375
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:06,408
Outside this country,
no one knows who the hell he is.

376
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:11,607
You people, you're gonna change all that.

377
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:15,106
You guys, you're the actors.
It's up to you...

378
00:56:15,307 --> 00:56:20,803
to change Brian Slade, pop singer, into Maxwell Demon,
space-age fucking superstar!

379
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:26,204
Nothing fantastic about it.
Why?

380
00:56:26,402 --> 00:56:29,403
Because the secret of becoming a star...

381
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:31,801
is knowing how to behave like one.

382
00:56:32,002 --> 00:56:35,901
-Hey kids, let's put on a show!
-Precisely.

383
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:38,176
Action!

384
00:57:00,095 --> 00:57:06,393
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!
Sort him out!

385
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:13,592
I know it's unprecedented, I know it's unorthodox,
but sir...

386
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:17,092
if you want Brian Slade,
those are the terms.

387
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,191
You may take them or leave them.

388
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:24,785
-Yes? -I'm Shannon Hazelbourne.
-Who? -I rang up about the position. -The what?

389
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:28,786
-Assistant Clerical Aid?
-Oh, the position. Fine. Brilliant. Follow me!

390
00:57:29,185 --> 00:57:32,886
-Hurray! Zounds!
-Now, Shannon, I realize of course...

391
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:36,284
your talents lie
within the clerical art...

392
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:41,883
but I was wondering, by chance if you
had any experience with wardrobe?

393
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,883
No, never.

394
00:57:44,082 --> 00:57:48,581
-Fantastic. I think that's everything.
-No, I said I didn't.

395
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:51,282
Everybody! I'd like to introduce...

396
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,079
you to our lovely new Wardrobe Mistress.

397
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:02,478
-Shannon.
-Shannon. Welcome Shannon!

398
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:07,177
Excellent! Yes, Mr Weinberg!

399
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:12,775
Thank you very much indeed, sir.
Cheers!

400
00:58:14,777 --> 00:58:19,075
-Extraordinary!
-What Jerry? What?

401
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:25,373
So tell me, Master Demon...
Who would you most fancy meeting...

402
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,072
in America?

403
00:58:27,573 --> 00:58:34,171
-Ah, bravo! Jerry! Garbo, Brian, please!
-Brando for me. -Einstein.

404
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:37,671
-Very sorry chickee. He's dead.
-Jerry said anyone.

405
00:58:38,077 --> 00:58:41,477
Brian? Who?

406
00:58:42,169 --> 00:58:46,867
Curt Wild.
I want to meet Curt Wild.

407
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,767
And meet Curt Wild we did.

408
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:56,052
-Mr Wild? -Yeah?
-I'm Rodney from Electra. I have Brian Slade here...

409
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:59,250
from England who just wanted to pop over, say hello.
-I just wanted to say...

410
00:59:59,949 --> 01:00:05,348
I think your music is tops. Really, smashing.
Best of the lot.

411
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:14,145
Smashing...top of...jolly...
shit.

412
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:23,544
Sorry, darling.

413
01:00:26,644 --> 01:00:30,643
Now at that time, Curt Wild was between management
and Brian knew this..

414
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:34,042
of course, and urged Devine to pursue the situation.

415
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:37,841
And so if, in that probability,
an interest arose...

416
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:43,739
in which Brian would serve on some projects,
possibly, though not exclusively...

417
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,738
as...we're taking our lead from you here, Curt...

418
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:50,238
possibly as producer on that project.

419
01:00:50,638 --> 01:00:54,137
How might that scenario,
purely hypothetically...

420
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:59,636
how might that scenario appeal to you
at this juncture?

421
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:05,034
What Jerry's trying to say is
do you want to come to London to cut a record?

422
01:01:06,035 --> 01:01:07,235
Oh, yeah. Cool.

423
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:12,334
-Very good!
-But how can we help you?

424
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:16,532
You must tell us. What do you need?

425
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:20,033
Everything.

426
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:27,930
See, heroin was my mainman. But now I'm on the methadone
and I'm getting my act together.

427
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:33,928
You come here and say you wanna help
and I say, hey, far out.

428
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,728
You could be my mainman.

429
01:01:42,026 --> 01:01:45,827
It was pretty clear what was happening.
It happens every day.

430
01:01:46,026 --> 01:01:48,825
But for the world to think
it was happening, well...

431
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:51,925
That was Jerry's particular genius.

432
01:01:55,925 --> 01:02:01,623
Right away he started promoting the two of them
like a pair of 40s starlets on the swoon.

433
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:06,722
A Tracy and Hepburn for the 70s.

434
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,400
My career was on the skids, mate.

435
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:51,398
And you fished me out of the muck.
You got me back on my feet, you did.

436
01:03:51,598 --> 01:03:54,097
It was nothing, chum.
I wanted to help you...

437
01:03:54,296 --> 01:04:00,496
make more of that far out sound.
I love your music, my son, and I love...

438
01:04:06,296 --> 01:04:09,392
You don't have to say it, mate.

439
01:04:55,584 --> 01:05:00,882
Every great century that produces art is,
so far, an artificial century...

440
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:04,582
and the work that seems the most
natural and simple of its time...

441
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:09,280
is always the result of
the most self-conscious effort.

442
01:05:09,881 --> 01:05:15,678
I am not really myself except
in the midst of elegant crowds...

443
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,978
at the heart of rich districts...

444
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:22,477
or amid the sumptuous ornamentation
of palace hotels...

445
01:05:22,678 --> 01:05:26,876
an army of servants and
a plush carpet underfoot...

446
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:33,475
What is true about music is true about life:
that beauty reveals everything...

447
01:05:33,675 --> 01:05:36,276
because it expresses nothing.

448
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:39,674
The first duty in life is to assume a post.

449
01:05:40,172 --> 01:05:45,473
What the second duty is
no one has yet found out.

450
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,070
The Aesthete Gives Characteristically
Cynical Evidence...

451
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:04,468
Replete with Pointed Epigram
and Startling Paradox...

452
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:08,667
while Explaining His Views on Morality in Art.

453
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:11,042
Brian, Brian!

454
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:15,966
Maxwell Demon is the story of a space creature,
who becomes a rock and roll messiah...

455
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:19,165
only to be destroyed by his own success.

456
01:06:19,465 --> 01:06:23,464
Are you saying this is your destiny?
Are you Maxwell Demon?

457
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:27,164
Man is least himself,
when he talks in his own person!

458
01:06:28,063 --> 01:06:33,061
-Give him a mask and he'll tell you the truth!
-Brian! Brian!

459
01:06:33,562 --> 01:06:36,862
Is it your belief that all dandies
are homosexual?

460
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:41,460
Ha! Nothing makes one so vain
as being told one is a sinner!

461
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:55,056
Hey! Coming through! Coming through!
Hey guys. Watch out! Excuse me!

462
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,457
-Coming through. Careful now! There you go.
-Tell us Brian!

463
01:06:58,856 --> 01:07:03,554
Are the rumours true that say you and Curt Wild
have some sort of plans up your sleeve?

464
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:07,954
Oh, yes! Quite soon we actually
plan to take over the world.

465
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:25,150
Excuse me, fellas, while I raise a glass
to the loveliest man in Europe!

466
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:31,150
And they tell you it's not natural!

467
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:49,345
The world is changed because
you are made of ivory and gold.

468
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:54,543
The curves of your lips rewrite history.

469
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:13,899
This is too much!

470
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:18,198
Jim! What are you gonna do? Jim!

471
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:08,184
Could you conceivably turn down that blasted...
Arthur! Arthur, open this door!

472
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:18,381
You bring shame to this house.
You bring shame to your mother and me.

473
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:23,980
It’s a shameful, filthy thing you’re doing...

474
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,680
Do you hear me?
Stand up!

475
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:12,769
It's funny how beautiful people look
when they're walking out the door.

476
01:13:35,063 --> 01:13:37,963
Really Shannon, it’s no problem, honestly.

477
01:13:38,563 --> 01:13:43,262
I’m not fussed about it, I’m quite open about it.
I was having a fabulous time last night myself.

478
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:50,059
Really luv.

479
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:55,759
You shouldn’t let it upset you so.
Brian is a grown man and...

480
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,359
fully capable of shagging whatever
he fancies and...

481
01:13:59,558 --> 01:14:03,358
exceedingly partial to the practice.

482
01:14:04,557 --> 01:14:06,757
Now, just because someone seea,
you know...

483
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:09,757
...two naked people asleep
in bed together...

484
01:14:09,956 --> 01:14:13,855
...it doesn’t necessarily prove
sex was involved.

485
01:14:24,653 --> 01:14:28,553
It does, however,
make for a very strong case.

486
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:34,550
But you’re a sweet, sensitive darling
to be so broken up about it.

487
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,549
Brian would be absolutely chuffed
to know that you...

488
01:14:37,351 --> 01:14:40,850
Don’t you ever dare tell Brian!

489
01:14:41,049 --> 01:14:45,948
Swear to me you’ll never say a word. Ever.

490
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:51,144
I swear.

491
01:14:57,045 --> 01:14:58,045
Jesus!

492
01:15:32,437 --> 01:15:38,134
Sudden change in plans.
Brief holiday, much needed.

493
01:15:38,335 --> 01:15:39,736
Back by Hammersmith.

494
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:43,437
B.

495
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:49,232
That was it.

496
01:15:52,134 --> 01:15:57,030
Look I’m sorry. I wish I could help you more.
You seem like a nice guy. I just...

497
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:04,430
...don’t think I have what you’re looking for.

498
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,527
See...I think you do actually.

499
01:16:11,825 --> 01:16:16,723
Oh yeah?
And what makes you think so?

500
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:21,824
Well that smile, for one thing.

501
01:16:23,624 --> 01:16:26,922
Well, smiles lie.

502
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:30,123
Exactly.

503
01:16:36,421 --> 01:16:43,217
Listen. Once, of course,
it was a gorgeous gorgeous time.

504
01:16:43,318 --> 01:16:47,818
We were all...
living our dreams.

505
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:53,515
But you see all that went away.

506
01:16:56,115 --> 01:16:57,213
All of it.

507
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:01,714
With Curt.

508
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:07,814
And not even the real Curt. I mean, it was this...
idea of Curt more than anything, this...

509
01:17:10,812 --> 01:17:15,210
...image. Which, of course,
nobody could ever possibly live up to.

510
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:19,511
I mean Maxwell Demon, Curt Wild.
They were fictions!

511
01:17:23,308 --> 01:17:29,508
Somewhere along the way,
Brian seemed to get lost in the lie.

512
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,100
-Shit!
-Cut it.

513
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:00,601
Should I stop it?

514
01:18:14,096 --> 01:18:17,294
-He’s gonna hit the bridge a half-verse early.
-Now you’re simply wasting tape.

515
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:18,969
Alright. Cut it.

516
01:18:23,693 --> 01:18:27,991
What?
What? Is there a problem?

517
01:18:29,892 --> 01:18:32,090
-Again.
-What? What?

518
01:18:32,591 --> 01:18:34,491
-Sorry, Curt, but it appears...
-What?

519
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:38,289
Curt, we only ask that
when you decide to make a change...

520
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:42,288
...you simply inform us in advance,
so Eton here is properly prepared, otherwise...

521
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:43,389
What the fuck are you
talking about man?

522
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:47,587
I didn’t make any fucking changes!

523
01:18:55,862 --> 01:18:58,362
Brian?

524
01:19:01,384 --> 01:19:08,783
Fucking mother fucker! Mother fucker, you’re a mother fucker!
Fuck you! Fuck you, mother fucker! Fuck you!!

525
01:19:10,183 --> 01:19:13,883
Eton!
Eton, please!

526
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:19,182
Brian, I’m sorry to be the one to have to tell you this,
but what started off as an interesting experiment...

527
01:19:19,481 --> 01:19:23,180
has quite frankly descended into a demeaning
waste of your time and mine.

528
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,579
-I mean, you’ve already spent forty hours studio time...
-Thirty-six.

529
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:30,878
Whatever! Thirty-six hours studio time
on two, three bloody cuts!

530
01:19:32,077 --> 01:19:36,477
Brian, you seem to forget, you’re a very big star now
and I think your time is worth a great deal more than this -

531
01:19:37,077 --> 01:19:44,075
Fucking space-queen on your fucking high horse!
And all your fucking henchmen! Fuck you, fuck you!

532
01:19:47,774 --> 01:19:50,073
Perhaps it’s time for another little break.
Hey fellas?

533
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:54,373
Give us a stretch.

534
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:05,866
Jerry?

535
01:20:10,467 --> 01:20:12,467
I can’t risk extending his contract, Brian.

536
01:20:14,367 --> 01:20:18,766
I think it’s quite clear why.
I’ll talk to you tomorrow.

537
01:20:32,062 --> 01:20:36,460
Piss off! Go on then! Back to your wolves!
Your junkie twerps!

538
01:20:36,761 --> 01:20:40,959
Your bloody shock treatment!
And fuck you too!

539
01:21:52,444 --> 01:21:54,043
Out! O-U-T.

540
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:57,444
Well, Brian. I’m afraid that is
completely out of the question.

541
01:21:58,141 --> 01:22:03,341
You are contractually bound to finish
the Maxwell Demon tour as Maxwell Demon.

542
01:22:03,441 --> 01:22:05,641
Jerry, I'm telling you,
it's just getting far too out of hand...

543
01:22:05,942 --> 01:22:12,138
Brian! I realize you’re under tremendous strain, but
you’ve just gotta hang on in there and finish the bloody tour.

544
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:15,539
You hang on in there. I’ll hang on here.
Right?

545
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:18,738
And then you can do what you want.
OK?

546
01:23:33,121 --> 01:23:36,621
<i>Brian Slade shooting declared a hoax</i>

547
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:42,918
Down with Slade!

548
01:25:00,602 --> 01:25:03,702
I don’t believe that there is much
of a future to speak of.

549
01:25:03,902 --> 01:25:09,501
-We’re in a bit of a decadent spiral, aren’t we?
-Sinking fast.

550
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:14,299
-Big Brother, baby. All the way.
-Which is why we prefer impressions to ideas.

551
01:25:14,498 --> 01:25:18,998
-Situations to subjects.
-Brief flights to sustained ones.

552
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:23,796
-Exceptions to types.
-And yourself?

553
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:31,593
Well I’m...
I’m just looking for a room at the moment.

554
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:20,284
So for one entire day,
I actually think Brian’s been shot.

555
01:26:22,183 --> 01:26:25,183
That the whole thing is real.

556
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:29,881
All his paranoias proven horribly true.

557
01:26:30,682 --> 01:26:34,382
-You mean, no one told you?
-Nope.

558
01:26:37,479 --> 01:26:38,778
Why?

559
01:26:39,879 --> 01:26:40,879
Forgot.

560
01:26:45,378 --> 01:26:46,175
Jesus!

561
01:26:46,776 --> 01:26:50,776
I mean...I knew it was over.
I just...

562
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:57,475
...didn't know it was up to me
to make it stop.

563
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:22,765
-Mandy.
-Hello, Brian.

564
01:27:28,066 --> 01:27:29,465
No, thanks.

565
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:41,264
These are the papers.

566
01:27:42,361 --> 01:27:47,160
I believe they’re in order.
All you need to do is sign.

567
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:01,257
So you won't forget.

568
01:28:03,156 --> 01:28:06,356
-I already have.
-Evidently!

569
01:28:11,155 --> 01:28:19,554
Fuck you, Brian! Did you ever, for one bloody second in your life,
want anything more...than this?

570
01:28:20,654 --> 01:28:22,252
No.

571
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:30,349
Your problem is...

572
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:34,450
...you get what you want
and do what you will.

573
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:37,651
Worlds, Mandy, are built out of suffering.

574
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:42,048
There is suffering at the birth of a child
as at the birth of a star.

575
01:28:42,349 --> 01:28:45,847
You live in terror of not being misunderstood.

576
01:28:45,848 --> 01:28:51,745
Women defend themselves by attacking,
just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.

577
01:28:53,546 --> 01:29:02,244
I lost my girlhood, true.
But it was for you.

578
01:29:05,443 --> 01:29:09,142
What in God's name is going on up here?
How the fuck did you get up here?

579
01:29:09,942 --> 01:29:12,343
-Brian, I’m really sorry about...
-It’s alright, Shannon.

580
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:14,641
Mandy was just leaving.

581
01:29:18,342 --> 01:29:20,442
Mandy, if you’d be so kind
as to follow me...

582
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:24,338
Let go of me.
I’m perfectly capable of making my own...

583
01:29:28,338 --> 01:29:30,237
I really don’t want to have to call someone.

584
01:29:34,438 --> 01:29:36,438
Call someone?

585
01:29:40,036 --> 01:29:43,033
I am his wife, for fuck’s sake!

586
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:51,133
Fuck the lot of you!

587
01:29:54,733 --> 01:29:57,132
Was that the last time you saw him?

588
01:29:57,331 --> 01:29:58,230
No.

589
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:08,126
I saw him again. Briefly, a few weeks later,
at a concert.

590
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:09,327
He was performing?

591
01:30:12,427 --> 01:30:16,326
No.
Curt was actually performing.

592
01:30:17,126 --> 01:30:19,424
He and Jack Fairy had just
finished their Berlin record...

593
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,326
...and Curt was in London playing some gigs.

594
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:26,724
And Brian was there, for a second.
I don’t think anyone even saw him.

595
01:30:30,123 --> 01:30:32,223
Which concert?

596
01:30:38,921 --> 01:30:44,019
It was like a tribute.
Sort of a farewell concert to glam rock.

597
01:30:44,519 --> 01:30:49,618
To save your wild, wild lives.
To ne´er your fans embitter.

598
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:55,717
To cease your sad demise.
Tonight, we toast!

599
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:01,203
Is this working? Cos I want it blue-er.

600
01:32:04,802 --> 01:32:08,401
I don’t think you should bother.
I think I should go on stage tonight, instead of you.

601
01:32:09,402 --> 01:32:10,702
Arthur, come on,
give us a hand with this.

602
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,899
Stop moving about,
I’m doing me eyeliner.

603
01:34:06,954 --> 01:34:12,351
"...and due to the overwhelming demand, there will be
additional shows added whenever and wherever possible."

604
01:34:12,952 --> 01:34:18,252
"Regrettably, Mr Stone only has time for a few brief questions
this morning as he has a plane catch to Zurich."

605
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:49,153
Lou! Lou!

606
01:34:53,152 --> 01:34:55,450
-I’m sorry, Arthur. I’m late.
-Lou! I think I’m on to something. -What?

607
01:34:55,751 --> 01:34:58,450
-Something quite big. I think I know who Brian Slade is.
-Ah, that story’s been dropped.

608
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:02,450
-What? Why?
-I need you on the Stone show.

609
01:35:03,251 --> 01:35:04,251
But that's it!

610
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:10,049
What did they say to you?
Lou!

611
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:17,350
Hi, yeah. My name is Arthur Stuart,
from the Herald.

612
01:35:18,851 --> 01:35:23,651
I was given this number and
told I could reach Curt Wild here.

613
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:30,852
-Listen...(whispers)
-Yeah. Hello? Hello!?

614
01:35:31,053 --> 01:35:33,253
Listen, I don’t know
who the hell gave you this number...

615
01:35:33,654 --> 01:35:36,154
...but Curt Wild is not available and
not interested in granting you...

616
01:35:36,255 --> 01:35:38,855
...or anyone else an interview on this subject.
You got it?

617
01:35:40,556 --> 01:35:42,556
I'm sorry. I was told...

618
01:40:13,584 --> 01:40:20,182
-That was really beautiful.
-Yeah? Thanks.

619
01:40:22,982 --> 01:40:26,281
-Did you see him?
-No, I didn't see him.

620
01:40:48,477 --> 01:40:49,574
It’s only now, looking back...

621
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:56,374
...that I see how you patched through my walls
and entered my life...

622
01:40:58,175 --> 01:40:59,175
...in waves.

623
01:41:03,074 --> 01:41:03,971
Come closer.

624
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:10,772
Don’t be frightened.

625
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:18,170
What’s your name?
Your favourite colour? Song? Movie?

626
01:41:20,568 --> 01:41:25,369
-Don’t be nervous. Are you high?
-I’m on a button.

627
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:36,465
He was waiting for me.
I’d followed his signals...

628
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:42,066
...and slipped away and now,
suddenly...

629
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:50,961
Hey!

630
01:41:55,727 --> 01:41:56,927
Make a wish!

631
01:42:35,728 --> 01:42:36,728
Hey!

632
01:42:52,448 --> 01:43:00,746
Make a wish!
And see yourself, on-stage, inside-out.

633
01:43:01,847 --> 01:43:07,744
A tangle of garlands in your hair.
Of course you were pleasantly surprised.

634
01:43:09,045 --> 01:43:12,543
Softly, he said:

635
01:43:12,644 --> 01:43:15,044
I will mangle your mind.

636
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,299
Tommy! Tommy! Where did you get the idea
for such a spectacular stadium show?

637
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,698
To tell you the truth –
it’s a bloody pain in the ass!

638
01:46:16,699 --> 01:46:20,599
The whole thing takes six full size rigs or
three chartered planes to transport.

639
01:46:20,899 --> 01:46:22,798
What can I say? I think big!

640
01:46:23,698 --> 01:46:28,197
Tommy! What’s your opinion on the work
that President Reynolds has been doing?

641
01:46:28,397 --> 01:46:30,497
Excellent. Excellent.
I think he’s doing brilliant work.

642
01:46:30,697 --> 01:46:34,694
He’s a tremendous leader, a tremendous spokesperson
for the needs of the nation today.

643
01:46:34,695 --> 01:46:41,194
Tommy! What's your response to the recent allegations
connecting you with bisexual pop-singer Brian Slade...

644
01:46:41,293 --> 01:46:44,490
...who staged his own assassination
ten years ago this week in London?

645
01:46:44,491 --> 01:46:47,091
...that Mr Stone has time for
this evening. Thank you very much!

646
01:46:50,292 --> 01:46:54,092
Out! Get out!

647
01:46:55,089 --> 01:47:00,487
"...Stone is promoting his Grammy-winning release,
"People Rockin’ People", to sold-out arenas worldwide..."

648
01:47:22,589 --> 01:47:24,188
Beer, please.

649
01:47:33,579 --> 01:47:38,678
Excuse me? Sir?
Are you with the Tommy Stone Tour?

650
01:47:43,376 --> 01:47:47,376
No.
I’m just a journalist.

651
01:47:48,877 --> 01:47:55,273
Perhaps you’d like my...
press pass? As a souvenir?

652
01:47:56,574 --> 01:47:57,674
Thanks sir.

653
01:48:30,868 --> 01:48:31,964
You're Curt Wild.

654
01:48:34,565 --> 01:48:36,965
Yeah.
Who the hell are you?

655
01:48:39,965 --> 01:48:43,363
I’m a journalist.
From the Herald.

656
01:48:46,563 --> 01:48:48,363
You were at the concert?

657
01:48:51,563 --> 01:48:55,960
It’s just funny, cause...
I was trying to contact you, actually.

658
01:48:57,461 --> 01:49:00,761
About a story I was doing,
about an old friend of yours.

659
01:49:03,258 --> 01:49:05,058
Brian Slade?

660
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:09,456
I was trying to find out
what actually happened to him.

661
01:49:09,657 --> 01:49:11,957
-Look...
-I mean, before he became...

662
01:49:14,256 --> 01:49:15,856
...such a mystery.

663
01:49:18,456 --> 01:49:21,753
Look, man, I don’t know who you’ve been
talking to or what you’re after here.

664
01:49:21,854 --> 01:49:22,854
What?

665
01:49:26,354 --> 01:49:27,354
What?!

666
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:34,653
Listen! A real artist creates beautiful things
and puts nothing of his won life into them. Okay?

667
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:38,151
-Is that what you did?
-No.

668
01:49:40,352 --> 01:49:42,052
We set out to change the world.

669
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:46,349
Ended up just changing ourselves.

670
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,350
What's wrong with that?

671
01:49:52,349 --> 01:49:53,647
Nothing.

672
01:49:55,548 --> 01:49:57,348
If you don’t look at the world.

673
01:50:08,945 --> 01:50:10,945
Well, I guess in the end
he got what he wanted.

674
01:50:20,743 --> 01:50:24,741
-That’s quite a pin you got there.
-Oh yeah.

675
01:50:25,442 --> 01:50:26,442
Is it old?

676
01:50:27,139 --> 01:50:31,239
Possibly.
It belonged to Oscar Wilde.

677
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:34,139
Or so I was told by the person
who gave it to me.

678
01:50:36,139 --> 01:50:41,339
A friend of mine.
Kinda disappeared some years back.

679
01:50:44,937 --> 01:50:47,936
I forget where we were.
We were on a trip.

680
01:50:48,135 --> 01:50:49,635
But he said to me, "Curt...

681
01:50:51,836 --> 01:50:53,636
"...a man’s life is his image."

682
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:09,431
-Here. Why don’t you hang on to it?
-Me?

683
01:51:10,332 --> 01:51:11,432
Sure. Why not?

684
01:51:12,631 --> 01:51:16,428
I’ve had it too long anyway.
Go ahead.

685
01:51:19,329 --> 01:51:20,629
For your image.

686
01:51:26,327 --> 01:51:35,024
Really. I couldn’t.
But thanks.

687
01:51:42,225 --> 01:51:44,424
God, I love this song.

688
01:51:47,422 --> 01:51:50,423
-Anyway.
-Yeah.

689
01:51:53,022 --> 01:51:55,920
-See ya around.
-Cheers!

690
01:52:25,914 --> 01:52:29,379
He called it a freedom.

691
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:34,580
A freedom you can allow yourself.

692
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:39,081
Or not.
