1
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,560
I was hurt because I liked you as a kid,

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,700
I made money for you,

3
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,370
And I came back here for you,

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,140
You can trust me,

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,140
As you date me,

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,840
you can learn that there is a man,,,

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,980
you can trust,

8
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,940
Goodnight,

9
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,010
I love you,

10
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,420
I love you,

11
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,460
Hae Ra,

12
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,490
I'm happy,

13
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,210
Where is time flowing to?

14
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,750
I do not know yet

15
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,620
Please stay with me

16
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,620
- Do not leave me - Do not leave me

17
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,300
I still love you

18
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm surprised there's still,,,

19
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,020
a place like this left in Seoul,

20
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
You must be drunk,

21
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,220
How many times are you going to repeat that?

22
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,590
How can you make,,,

23
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,530
both men's and women's wear?

24
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,060
You already said that too,

25
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,830
Because I'm a genius,

26
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,170
Plus I had a lot of time,

27
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,370
Then make a suit for me too,

28
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,870
We'll see,

29
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,340
Wake up,

30
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,250
Five more minutes,

31
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,950
I didn't think he was a poor drinker,

32
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,190
How do you know,,,

33
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,060
Choi Ji Hoon?

34
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,690
Through Jung Hae Ra,

35
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,990
Jung Hae Ra?

36
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,160
He was a boyfriend of,,,

37
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,200
someone I know,

38
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,570
I have a friend named Jung Hae Ra,

39
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,970
She works at a travel agency,

40
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,440
Do you know Hae Ra?

41
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,650
Ji Hoon was,,,

42
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,190
Hae Ra's boyfriend?

43
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,240
When did you come home last night?

44
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,980
- Around 1:30am? - 1:45am,

45
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,090
Did something good happen?

46
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,590
- No, - No,

47
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,390
Hae Ra, Let's go,

48
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,790
I'll give you a ride,

49
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,900
Wait one second,

50
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,350
Hae Ra,

51
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,350
Coming,

52
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,550
Don't get mad at the chief director,

53
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,890
Don't be impatient,

54
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,890
Okay,

55
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,190
They applauded you at the meeting,

56
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,730
which means they think highly you,

57
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,730
Right, I'll take the calls cheerfully,

58
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,800
You can swear at rude customers,

59
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,370
Okay, I'm good at that,

60
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,480
Thank you,

61
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,580
Anything you want to say to me?

62
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,790
Have a good day,

63
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,490
Other than that,

64
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,090
I love you, Have a good day,

65
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,370
Bye,

66
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,240
Cheer up,

67
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,020
Good morning, Mr, Moon,

68
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,290
Hi,

69
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,690
I'll make my own coffee that suits my taste,

70
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,890
Don't do this from now on,

71
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Why not?

72
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,300
I don't want to be that kind of boss,

73
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,800
I got you this coffee as a thank you,,,

74
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,400
for saving me the other day,

75
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,540
Don't worry about it,

76
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,700
Okay, Thanks,

77
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,010
By the way, did you hear?

78
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,910
Remember Yoon Dal Hong who betrayed us,,,

79
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,750
with the surface rights?

80
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,220
His son had a terrible car accident,

81
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,720
So he's out of his mind,

82
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,920
How badly did his son get hurt?

83
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,060
He's in a coma,

84
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,230
That wouldn't have happened,,,

85
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,760
if he had worked with us,

86
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,600
Don't say that,

87
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,030
I'm just upset,

88
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,200
You should go and do your work,

89
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,440
Okay,

90
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,450
This is nice,

91
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,050
It must've been fine liquor,

92
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,720
I don't have a headache,

93
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,090
I loved coming to a bathhouse in winter,

94
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,100
I used to play like this,

95
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,370
You were a prosecutor, right?

96
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,370
I guess Hae Ra didn't tell Mr, Moon yet,

97
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,510
Seeing that you're still his trainer,

98
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

99
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,110
Hae Ra, me, and my girlfriend are,,,

100
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,680
friends since childhood,

101
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,150
I know very well,,,

102
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,290
about what happened,

103
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
That's why you know about law so well,

104
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,330
It was all settled, and the problem was solved,

105
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,830
I wasn't charged or sent to jail,

106
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,160
Nothing like that happened,

107
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll keep it a secret, Don't worry,

108
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,140
You'd have no merit as an informant,,,

109
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,270
if Mr, Moon looks down on you,

110
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,940
Let's go have a hangover soup later,

111
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,980
I won't get intimidated,

112
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,820
I had no choice,,,

113
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,190
because I tripped over in my life,

114
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,860
How did you choose to fake being a prosecutor?

115
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,560
My parents ran a residence in Sillim-dong,,,

116
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,830
where people gather and study for the bar exam,

117
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,100
I saw and heard a lot of stuff since I was young,

118
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,270
What about Hae Ra?

119
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,270
How did you fool her?

120
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,570
Goodness,

121
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,570
I didn't mean to fool her from the start,

122
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,210
Of course, you didn't,

123
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,680
I went for some paperwork at the district office,

124
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,280
I saw a middle-aged woman crying,

125
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,380
I helped her with my knowledge,

126
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,790
Then she suddenly went,

127
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,520
"Thank you so much, Mr, Prosecutor,"

128
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,820
I went to a travel agency,,,

129
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,520
to make a reservation for my grandma's trip,

130
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,160
I ran into that woman again,

131
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,760
She must've said,

132
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,870
"What brings you here, Mr, Prosecutor?"

133
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Yes,

134
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,440
Hae Ra helped me with the reservation,

135
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,070
She was kind and pretty,

136
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,210
I asked her out first,

137
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,210
I found out that she was a lonely person,

138
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,610
so I kept acting like I was a prosecutor,

139
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,050
It's heartbreaking,

140
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,050
You can go tell Mr, Moon everything about this,

141
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,390
Everyone makes mistakes at least once in their lives,

142
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,560
Liking her isn't a sin, is it?

143
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,260
Fooling her is a sin,

144
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,400
Just tell me what you want from me,

145
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,170
Mr, Moon is in trouble,,,

146
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,910
due to the landlord's change in mind,

147
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,310
He must be looking for another way,

148
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
Sir,

149
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,380
Chairman Park sent people to the bathhouse again,

150
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,720
I'll be back,

151
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,890
Mr, Han,

152
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,220
You heard the news about Mr, Yoon's son, right?

153
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,660
Yes,

154
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,990
Send him a basket of flowers,

155
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,830
Include a message saying, "Hope he gets well soon,"

156
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,670
It's a business manner,

157
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,570
Are your curious about that alternative?

158
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,780
(Bookstore, Bathhouse)

159
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,340
It'll be better if it's more specific,

160
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,480
(Yoon Dal Hong)

161
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,150
Moon Soo Ho, out!

162
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,120
- Moon Soo Ho, out! - Moon Soo Ho, out!

163
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Redevelopment is the way to live,

164
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,690
Moon Soo Ho is stopping the redevelopment,

165
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,620
Moon Soo Ho, out!

166
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,560
- Moon Soo Ho, out! - Moon Soo Ho, out!

167
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,000
You made a good choice,

168
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,940
You should live more at ease now,

169
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Right,

170
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm leaving you a message,,,

171
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,740
since you won't take my call,

172
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,810
It's a piece of cake,,,

173
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,750
to find your place if I order my kids,

174
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,290
Don't make things difficult,

175
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,620
Just have brunch with a newspaper delivery boy,,,

176
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,290
who has become rich,

177
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,930
Let's have elegant brunch,

178
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,580
It's new to have palbochae as brunch,

179
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,680
Seo Rin always took me,,,

180
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,980
to a Chinese restaurant,

181
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,690
Thank to her,

182
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,650
I got to eat palbochae for the first time in my life,

183
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,130
It has become my life's dish,

184
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,730
I found the last item amusing,

185
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,330
Can I see other items as well?

186
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,770
Seo Rin isn't dead, is she?

187
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,210
I'm sure,,,

188
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,740
you're still in touch with her,

189
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,650
It's better you don't meet your first love again,

190
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,780
She's alive,

191
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,700
She's grown very old,

192
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,670
She wants to be remembered as a pretty girl,

193
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,470
What does her husband do for living?

194
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,380
No one will marry that crazy brat,

195
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
She's still single,

196
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,050
Is that right?

197
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,160
(Jung Hae Ra)

198
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,430
Why aren't you answering your phone?

199
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,230
What are you doing?

200
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,070
Hello?

201
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,680
Can I visit you with my colleagues today?

202
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
It's about work,

203
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,450
No,

204
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,080
What about we have delicious lunch,,,

205
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,120
at my friend, Young Mi's shop?

206
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,390
- I'll take out,,, - No, thanks,

207
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,990
What's wrong with her?

208
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,730
She's making me want to curse now,

209
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,330
What a manner,

210
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,500
That wasn't nice,

211
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,040
What do you think about this shirt?

212
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,170
Whatever,

213
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,040
Take a look,

214
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,750
I spent all night making this,

215
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,450
It looks like it's for men, It's lousy,

216
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,220
It's not mine, It's for a man,

217
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,490
Who?

218
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
Is that for,,,

219
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,890
that model yesterday?

220
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
No,

221
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,430
Someone I want to deliver my body heat,

222
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,370
Excuse me,

223
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,610
I don't want another toy you gave me last time,

224
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,240
Do you have something fancier?

225
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,210
What do you mean by toy?

226
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,480
That's upsetting to hear,

227
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,050
What was that?

228
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,960
Do you have things like,,,

229
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,230
portraits, prayers,

230
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,830
or letters?

231
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,300
You must be looking for treasures,

232
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,900
These are too common,

233
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,240
Be careful,

234
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,710
That's worth 100,000 dollars,

235
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
You don't have what I'm looking for,

236
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,180
I'll just take a few toys then,

237
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,950
I'll pay you in cash right now,

238
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,850
Are you sure you're not interested in these?

239
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,890
If you're acting to buy them cheap,

240
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,660
please stop it,

241
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,890
I'll give them for free,

242
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,430
I've done this a lot,

243
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
You're giving me those because they're cheap,

244
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,840
This ring was found,,,

245
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,440
in the stomach of a yellow tail caught in winter,

246
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,910
I told you,

247
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,450
I lost it when I jumped down the cliff,

248
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,780
It came out,,,

249
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,150
from the stomach of a yellow tail in winter,

250
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,850
It's a lucky ring,

251
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,720
so I paid quite a lot for this,

252
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,800
Thank you for the lucky gift,

253
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
I gave you the lucky gift,

254
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,410
so let me meet Seo Rin just once,

255
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,540
I'll talk to her,

256
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,190
The building owners aren't in for the redevelopment,

257
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,890
Once the redevelopment starts,

258
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,260
they will have much less profit,

259
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,360
They call it redevelopment,

260
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,760
but it's rather like uniformity of the town,

261
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,770
Did you check the register copies of these places?

262
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,340
Yes, in case of the 28th street,

263
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,140
the landlord owns the building,

264
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,110
It's different in the 32nd street,

265
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,710
Its surface rights will soon expire,

266
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,680
Meet with the building owner and tenant,

267
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,910
Okay,

268
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,050
(Bookstore, Bathhouse)

269
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,080
We have to surround this area,

270
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,120
so that the contracts will be canceled,

271
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,730
Oh, the landlord of the 32nd street,,,

272
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,000
owns the bank building at the intersection as well,

273
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,540
These places too,

274
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,600
Who's the landlord?

275
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,180
It's an old woman named Choi Seo Rin,

276
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,410
Go see her right away,

277
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,650
Check this out,

278
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,060
What's this?

279
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,070
(Handsome guys who are 100 years older than us,)

280
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,980
I told you she'd come,,,

281
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,350
if we sent her the picture,

282
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,550
What are those pictures?

283
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,960
You came here because you think you look like him?

284
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,820
Why did you place them here?

285
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,890
Why are you mad?

286
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,200
You're at fault, Young Mi,

287
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,960
She's such a beauty, so she'd be upset,,,

288
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,430
to hear that she looks like men,

289
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,070
You must be upset, I'm sorry,

290
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,300
I'm sorry,

291
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,500
My friend is a bit slow-witted,

292
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,870
She's been like that since young,

293
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,570
Don't be upset,,,

294
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,840
and have a seat here,

295
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,850
Should I dust it off one more time?

296
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,280
- Ju Hee, come on, - Okay,

297
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,180
Right, I'll dust it off too,

298
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,650
My goodness, This is,,,

299
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,690
Goodness,

300
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,760
Goodness, this is really clean now,

301
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,890
- This way, please, - My goodness,

302
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,640
First of all, we need outfits,,,

303
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,900
to dress sharply in Paris and London,

304
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,510
So we will go there empty-handed,

305
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,940
dress sharply in your awesome clothes,

306
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,350
take pictures in them,

307
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,280
tour around, take them off,

308
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,350
and return home without any baggage,

309
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,650
My business instinct says,,,

310
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,460
this will thrive,

311
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,290
What do you think about launching your brand?

312
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,730
I don't want to,

313
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,900
And take down that picture,

314
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,670
Don't you think your talent is wasted?

315
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
You're such a genius,

316
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,240
That's what I'm saying,

317
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,140
You have a completely different style,,,

318
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,810
compared to those mundane designers,

319
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,810
The clothes you designed for Hae Ra are so unique,

320
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,040
They're the best,

321
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,310
I am,,,

322
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,480
all for this idea,

323
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,250
Sharon is a genius,

324
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,260
But she never works hard, I think it's because,,,

325
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,820
she has a lot of real estate properties,

326
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,430
Hey,

327
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,030
Anyway,

328
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,100
I hope she does not waste her talent anymore,

329
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,200
When this business thrives,

330
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,470
you will become a world-renowned designer,

331
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,210
Imagine that,

332
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,620
How long have you been designing clothes?

333
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,050
Well,,,

334
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,690
I'll just have to say that it's been a while,

335
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,760
Just say that I'm a new designer,

336
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,700
Congratulations,

337
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,410
Do you acknowledge my talent too?

338
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,040
I came out to the world,,,

339
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,510
to be acknowledged by you,

340
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,610
despite the danger,

341
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,280
Sharon,

342
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,450
- Sharon, - Sharon,

343
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,360
I was her assistant,,,

344
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,130
when I was 16,

345
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,760
But she still looks the same,,,

346
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,890
even after 60 years,

347
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,860
There was a reason why she opened and closed,,,

348
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,070
her shop from time to time, never making,,,

349
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,070
any regular customers, living under the radar,

350
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,910
Sharon never grows old, and she won't die either,

351
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,910
She's a monster,

352
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,650
(New Designer Sharon)

353
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,920
(Real name, Choi Seo Rin, 250 years old)

354
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,360
Let's do this together,

355
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,030
I can bring you some design references today,

356
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,960
Sell that picture to me,

357
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,330
Oh, if you decide to do business with us,

358
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,830
I'll give it to you as a present,

359
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,120
Goodness, miss, Are you insane?

360
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,890
Hey, call the police and report her,,,

361
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,320
for interrupting business and property damage,

362
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,890
My gosh,

363
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,560
Wrap it up and send it over,

364
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,930
And bill me for the picture,

365
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,170
My goodness,

366
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,010
She's crazy,

367
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,040
I need to go get some salt,

368
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,180
I need to sprinkle salt all over this place,

369
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,680
What's with her?

370
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,050
Is she an attention seeker?

371
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,150
It looks like she needs love and attention,

372
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,950
And some treatment,

373
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,990
Let's leave her out,

374
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,690
- What was that? - My goodness,

375
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,440
Did I ask to see you when you're busy?

376
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
You did,

377
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,610
Goodness, what will you do?

378
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,210
You should go, then,

379
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,540
Okay,

380
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,180
I'm glad you called,

381
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,950
I needed to get some healing,

382
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,550
I came because I needed courage,

383
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,290
What can I do for you?

384
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,930
When you work,

385
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,900
if things don't seem to work out,

386
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,200
should I quit right away, or should I keep going?

387
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,600
In that case, d, o, i, t,

388
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,840
D, o, i, t?

389
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,600
Your name is the answer,

390
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,010
Hae Ra, meaning "do it",

391
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,510
That was lame,

392
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,240
Be more specific,

393
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,650
In a businessman's eyes, how does the owner of,,,

394
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,380
Sharon Tailor look?

395
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,020
Is this for the outfit rental business?

396
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,250
Yes, I want to,

397
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,460
She's way too unique,

398
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,960
But her style is too cool to give up,

399
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,800
She doesn't look very ordinary to me either,

400
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Right?

401
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,500
What you need is Sharon Tailor's talent,

402
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,700
Yes,

403
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,900
If you feel confident enough,,,

404
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,770
to humor her and train her,

405
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,870
you can give it a try,

406
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,990
I had enough taffies, but I still feel depressed,

407
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,630
I need something sweeter,

408
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,930
Let's go get some cake,

409
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,100
Let go of me,

410
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm going to quit,

411
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,240
I don't want to work for a rude employer,

412
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,210
You can quit after we get some cake,

413
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,950
Stop pronouncing it like a grandma,

414
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,050
It's cake,

415
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,750
Are you leaving to get some cake?

416
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,350
If you want to use someone's talent,,,

417
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,620
for your business,

418
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,020
you need to be ready,,,

419
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,860
to do something big,,,

420
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,260
for their sake,

421
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,960
One of the reasons why,,,

422
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
I got lucky was that I worked hard,

423
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,700
But not everyone makes it even if they try hard,

424
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,270
And some don't get the chance to work hard,

425
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,610
Even so, you must try,

426
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,140
Even if it doesn't work, you must work hard,

427
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,680
Is that how you lived your life?

428
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,380
Yes,

429
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
Soo Ho, you're a big boy now,

430
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,360
I don't mind you talking to me like that,

431
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,560
but don't do it in the public,

432
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,660
But why?

433
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,730
Why are you concerned about others?

434
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,260
We had fun that day,

435
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Why are you concerned about others?

436
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,670
We had fun that day,

437
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,780
All right, then,

438
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,090
Becky,

439
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,960
Perhaps one day,

440
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,660
we might become the clowns of this world,

441
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,560
Is it impossible for us,,,

442
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,340
to grow old with the ones we love?

443
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,120
It's a shirt made with the finest cotton,

444
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,890
Why are you giving this to me?

445
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,850
You let your employees get trained with me,

446
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,560
I was thankful,

447
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,330
No, I should thank you,

448
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,530
I will work hard in the future,

449
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,230
What will happen,,,

450
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,070
when Mr, Moon puts this on?

451
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,970
I wished that he and I,,,

452
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,940
will get to live under the same roof,

453
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,060
I haven't seen Hae Ra for a while,

454
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,930
She's working outside,

455
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,570
Is she doing interviews with other companies?

456
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,970
Chief director,

457
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,040
Hae Ra loves this company,

458
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,770
Why does she?

459
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,250
Yes, I'm on my way,

460
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,550
You can do it,

461
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,650
I have to go back to work,,,

462
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,220
after I stop by the tailor's,

463
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,420
Don't wait around and go to sleep early,

464
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,650
Okay,

465
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,050
Bye,

466
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,710
Hae Ra,

467
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,210
Have some tea,

468
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,020
It took Sharon half a day to make that,

469
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,920
and then she was knocked out,

470
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,790
Thank you,

471
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,640
You must be tired, I'm sorry to bother you,

472
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,240
What is it?

473
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,210
These are,,,

474
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,580
the draft proposals I made,

475
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,680
Please take a look,

476
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,450
I said I didn't want to do it,

477
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,680
Then please review it later,,,

478
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,450
after you get some rest,

479
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,120
I can't be bothered to do anything,

480
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,700
Those dresses are so pretty,

481
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,330
May I take a look?

482
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,350
E10 Black Knight "Don't You Mess With Me"

483
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,450
Do you make wedding dresses as well?

484
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,280
I've never made one for someone,

485
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,750
I make one when I'm sad,

486
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,020
then I rip it apart,

487
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,960
That's a waste,

488
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,590
It's up to me,

489
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,100
I wish you'd make wedding dresses too,

490
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,030
Why?

491
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,300
What do you mean why?

492
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,700
It'd be a huge blessing if you could,,,

493
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,370
wear a beautiful dress like this,,,

494
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,310
on the most important day of your life,

495
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,780
Someday,,,

496
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,450
when I get married,

497
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,860
I'd love to wear a dress made from Sharon Tailor,

498
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,340
There's a veil hat,

499
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,640
Who do you think you'll marry?

500
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,980
I'm not sure,

501
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,210
Baek Hee,

502
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,080
Should I just kill her,,,

503
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,580
and run away?

504
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,390
I'm an expert at living in hiding,

505
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,470
I wish you'd remember,,,

506
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,140
your past life at least once,

507
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,980
He'd feel sorry for me,

508
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,690
It's not the man you live with, is it?

509
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,990
It'd be nice to be married,,,

510
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,760
to him,

511
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,620
I don't know why I attached a veil that way,

512
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,160
It looked horrendous,

513
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,960
so I couldn't stand it,

514
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,560
Are you crazy?

515
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,900
Are you insane?

516
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,500
How can you thrust scissors like that?

517
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,470
Why are you wearing that stupid veil?

518
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,340
I should cut it here too,

519
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,550
Get away,

520
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,650
How dare you,,,

521
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,090
Get out right now,

522
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,460
I won't do that work,

523
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,700
Apologize to me first, you ignorant woman,

524
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,270
Apologize, now!

525
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,670
Take your hands off me!

526
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
You!

527
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,160
How dare you!

528
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,800
You,,, Come here,

529
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,930
Come here!

530
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,910
Boon Yi, that wretched girl,

531
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,610
She used to be my slave who made my clothes,

532
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,150
How dare she bite me and scratch me?

533
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,850
What are you saying?

534
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,190
Didn't you see what she did to me?

535
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,490
Wait,

536
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,290
Did you get a tattoo here too?

537
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,280
If you want to use someone's talent,,,

538
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,580
for your business,

539
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,610
you need to be ready to do something big,,,

540
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,320
for their sake,

541
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,950
D, o, i, t,

542
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,120
Hae Ra, Do it,

543
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
What?

544
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,900
Hae Ra,

545
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm sorry,

546
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,120
I apologize,

547
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,820
I should've been more understanding,

548
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,360
But I failed to do that,

549
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,260
Please forgive me,

550
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,830
I thought about it,

551
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,930
Master potters break perfectly fine ceramics,,,

552
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,070
if they don't suit their taste,

553
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,470
I'm sorry, I didn't grasp that earlier,

554
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,740
Hae Ra,

555
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,640
You have an amazing personality,

556
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,350
I've never seen anyone so cool,

557
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,850
Please bring us some plates,

558
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,420
I brought a lot of,,,

559
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,850
tteokbokki, sundae, and fritters,

560
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,800
Please forgive me,

561
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,760
and consider,,,

562
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,300
working with my company at least once,

563
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm sure you'll change your mind,,,

564
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,970
if you look at the proposal,

565
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,670
I sincerely beg you,

566
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,960
Hae Ra,

567
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,660
Circle Tour will,,,

568
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,500
start the clothing rental business,

569
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,800
I think our idea leaked,

570
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,130
Theirs is exactly the same as ours,

571
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,570
What?

572
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,040
It's for the better,

573
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,170
It takes too much work and leaves no profit,

574
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,710
I'm sure they'll cancel it after one term,

575
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,210
Hae Ra, don't be disappointed,

576
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,810
Didn't I tell you not to brag about your idea?

577
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,150
Gosh, you make me tired, I'm so tired,

578
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,850
You tire me out,

579
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,160
How can he say that?

580
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,630
Hae Ra, Are you in there?

581
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,800
Stop crying,

582
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,740
I'm not crying,

583
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,440
What are you doing in there then?

584
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,840
I have constipation,

585
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,910
Don't lie,

586
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,710
Come out,

587
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,280
We have a problem,

588
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,550
Eagle Airline pilots,,,

589
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,390
are having a strike,

590
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,590
We need to book new flights for group tours,

591
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,500
After we take care of this,

592
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,930
let's cry together,

593
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,870
Mr, Song,

594
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,670
Our situation is really urgent,,,

595
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,510
because of the strike, Please take 30 people,

596
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,840
You haven't been giving us good deals,

597
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,810
Please help us just this once,

598
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,450
30 people connecting to Frankfurt will do,,,

599
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,250
Hello? Mr, Song?

600
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,090
Hello?

601
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,150
- Yes, - Please hold,

602
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,920
- Yes, - Okay,

603
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,390
- Yes, - Please help us,

604
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,660
- We need your help, - Please,

605
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,150
Hi, there,

606
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,360
I thought you'd need roasted chestnuts today,

607
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,260
What happened to your face?

608
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,920
What's wrong? Did something happen?

609
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,430
Did things not work out right?

610
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,870
There's no need to cry for such a thing,

611
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,800
I'm upset,

612
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,140
Don't cry,

613
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Hae Ra,

614
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,960
Yes?

615
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,390
Hae Ra,

616
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,130
My heart,,,

617
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,070
is burning,

618
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,540
It's so hot,

619
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,470
I'm in a bad mood,

620
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,510
I'm not in a mood to hear your joke,

621
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,450
I'm not joking, It's really hot,

622
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,450
Hold on,

623
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,820
Gosh, it's hot,

624
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,190
Just in case you don't like chestnuts,

625
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,520
I bought roasted sweet potatoes too,

626
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,930
Didn't you smell it?

627
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,690
It's not fun?

628
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,760
You just smiled, right?

629
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,940
You know what happens when you smile after crying?

630
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,940
Hey,

631
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,170
Stop it,

632
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,670
Stop what? I'm serious,

633
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,410
When I went to med school,

634
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,840
someone came to the hospital because of that,

635
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,280
He came to the emergency room,

636
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,020
What's that?

637
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,720
Joke around according to situations,

638
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,560
It's all right,

639
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,600
I don't know what happened,

640
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,730
but it's all right,

641
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,400
You have me by your side,

642
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,140
You'll have a lot of struggles in your life,

643
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,580
Still, it's fine,

644
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,080
I'm here by your side,

645
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,090
Let me see your face,

646
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,330
Don't,

647
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,170
That's my girl,

648
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,910
Goodness, seriously,

649
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,640
You'll reunite,,,

650
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,440
with your owner tomorrow,

651
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,630
Hae Ra, look,

652
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,660
Should I put it here?

653
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,960
That's perfect,

654
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,970
Who's your guest today,,,

655
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,970
that you called in a chef?

656
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,900
Someone whom I'm very grateful to,

657
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,870
Join us for dinner later,

658
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,810
No, thank you,

659
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,340
It's uncomfortable,

660
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,640
There's no need to,

661
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,250
You and my guest,,,

662
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,610
are all family to me,

663
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,160
This should be enough,

664
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,660
I'm the only one who's lonely in this world,

665
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,900
What do you think?

666
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,900
If the two get married,

667
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,770
what will happen to me?

668
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,180
Are you the guest for today?

669
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,660
I told you 15 years ago,

670
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,460
I told you to take care of a poor child,,,

671
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,490
in exchange for paying all your debt,,,

672
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,330
and that I wouldn't show up until she gets married,

673
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,800
Then why are you here?

674
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,770
I can't predict how the world goes,

675
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,510
I did what I could do,

676
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,740
I did enough,

677
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,480
I could've abandoned her,,,

678
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,540
after receiving money from you,

679
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,750
I would've,,,

680
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,520
killed you then,

681
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,020
What?

682
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,090
Who saved me from drowning,,,

683
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,020
in the first place?

684
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,160
I was betrayed by my own husband,,,

685
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,720
and had a huge amount of debt,

686
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,590
But you saved me,

687
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,890
You paid for all my hospital fees,,,

688
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,230
and took care of me like a family,

689
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,630
I know you wouldn't have killed me,

690
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,570
Right, I wanted you to take care of Hae Ra,,,

691
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,240
with those guts of yours,

692
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,210
Except for the failure in the hanok investment,

693
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,810
I did the best I could do,

694
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,380
I never siphoned off the money,,,

695
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,420
that you sent me every holiday,

696
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,050
All right,

697
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,050
Let's say we never met before,

698
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,300
Excuse me,

699
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,900
What is it?

700
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,240
Hello,

701
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,870
I'm here to see Ms, Choi Seo Rin,

702
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,380
She doesn't live here,

703
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,580
But her address is here,

704
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,250
Why are you looking for her?

705
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,050
If you get in touch with her,

706
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,890
please call me,

707
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,090
(Ahn Chan Ki)

708
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,390
Thank you in advance,

709
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,930
"Blacksmith's"?

710
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,630
Wait a second,

711
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,570
Isn't the CEO of this company, Moon Soo Ho?

712
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,310
That's right,

713
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,510
What is the matter?

714
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,720
I'm very happy and lucky,,,

715
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,450
to have a precious time with you,

716
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,000
It's like I'm in a dream,

717
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,670
I've never imagined,,,

718
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,770
having a wonderful meal at Soo Ho's house like this,

719
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,970
I'm tearing up,

720
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,780
Don't cry,

721
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,210
I'm going to cry too if you do,

722
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,320
How do you know each other?

723
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,920
I have two people who saved my life,

724
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,590
They're Ms, Jang and Hae Ra,

725
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,990
You're the second person who saved my life,

726
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,730
Did she save you from drowning or something?

727
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,500
When I couldn't do anything,,,

728
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,170
and wanted to die,

729
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,170
she gave me huge courage to stand back up,

730
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,410
When I was younger,

731
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,550
I delivered green juice in the town,

732
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,980
I knew who lived where and their circumstances,

733
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,190
I saw a math genius boy with a scar on his face,,,

734
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,760
crying in the reed field one day,

735
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:21,140
I lied that I could predict the future,

736
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,380
"Nothing is in your way,"

737
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,910
"You'll achieve everything you want,"

738
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,110
I had nowhere to lean on,

739
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,250
so I decided to trust her lies,

740
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,950
I prayed for Soo Ho even when I donated a coin,,,

741
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,490
in the Salvation Army charity pot,

742
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,030
How nosy of you,

743
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,830
I know it's there even though I can't see it,

744
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,270
What is?

745
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,240
A desperate prayer,,,

746
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,200
or poignant longing,

747
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,910
Can you see where such a thing reaches?

748
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,610
You can't,

749
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,850
But can you say it doesn't exist?

750
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,520
My prayers piled up and came true before my eyes,

751
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,190
I believe in the power of heart,

752
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,730
I believe in karma as well,

753
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,760
It's all a coincidence and a superstition,

754
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,230
There's no such thing,

755
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,180
Here,

756
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,600
Today is a day I'd love to leave as a diary entry,

757
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,400
I'm so happy,

758
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,600
I think,,,

759
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,570
I'll die very early,,,

760
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,710
for all the luck I had,

761
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,810
I hope this is just a pointless concern,

762
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,580
Show me your hand,

763
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,090
Don't worry about it,

764
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,860
You will live a happy life,,,

765
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,330
until you turn 300,

766
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,090
I'll believe you again,

767
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,030
Right,

768
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,940
Isn't Geumseong 1-dong and Geumseong 2-dong,,,

769
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,900
where you've been working on?

770
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,470
You're right,

771
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,410
I heard Chairman Park Chul Min,,,

772
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,280
has been convincing people to do a redevelopment,

773
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,240
Do you know him well?

774
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,150
We have a bad history,

775
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,610
How so?

776
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,880
I'll tell you later,

777
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,750
I want to talk about only good things tonight,

778
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,750
Okay,

779
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,360
I think she's weird,

780
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,030
She might act like,,,

781
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,070
your mother-in-law if you marry Soo Ho,

782
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,470
Come on, Aunt Sook Hee,

783
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,510
It'll be a while until we get married,

784
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,840
I need to achieve something in my life too,

785
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,410
Don't you think?

786
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,620
Oh, right,

787
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Take this,

788
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,560
Melt this in when you make,,,

789
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,060
matching rings with Hae Ra,

790
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,740
This looks very old,

791
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,670
I hope you trust what I say again,,,

792
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,780
and do that,

793
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,380
Okay, I will,

794
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,220
Come have some desserts,

795
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,450
I made some delicious coffee,

796
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,590
Really?

797
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,320
I look forward to having some,

798
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,720
I'm better at it, Why didn't you call me?

799
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,560
No, this time, it turned out very well,

800
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,960
Really? Let's take a look,

801
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,610
I brought coffee,

802
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,740
- Okay, - Coffee,

803
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,280
- Have some coffee, - Coffee,

804
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
- This is yours, - Why on earth,,,

805
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,510
do we say working hours begin at 9am?

806
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,950
He calls us out for meetings,,,

807
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,490
at 6:50am every other day,

808
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,490
Hey,

809
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,490
It's the peak season for traveling,

810
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,060
We can't have meetings during working hours,

811
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,090
Have some coffee,

812
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,160
"Merci beaucoup,"

813
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,300
Now, show me what you brought,

814
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,830
(A Trip with a Theme)

815
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:22,340
Simple package tours are decreasing in demand,

816
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,540
So we thought of a trip with a theme,

817
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,450
A trip of taste,,,

818
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,750
with a famous chef,

819
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,320
Or a South American trip after Che Guevara,

820
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,930
For the trip of taste,

821
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,830
you can enjoy your trip as well as food,,,

822
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:48,100
with explanations of the chef on the trip,

823
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,930
So we thought of trips with such themes,

824
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,730
Sounds good,

825
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,240
I told you to think of something like that,

826
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,840
You did?

827
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,870
I don't remember you saying that,

828
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,640
I told you to do this last time,

829
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,550
You practically took my idea,

830
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,280
Chief director,

831
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,820
We came up with this among ourselves,

832
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,480
We thought of this after we lost,,,

833
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,950
the outfit rental business,

834
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,960
The chairman will love this idea,

835
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,590
See? You came up with a great idea thanks to me,

836
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,730
Right, Hae Ra?

837
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,460
What's with that face?

838
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,260
What's wrong?

839
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,900
I wonder why,

840
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,800
What do I have to do at times like these?

841
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,540
Do I have to stay calm? Or should I be angry?

842
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,280
I'm really frustrated right now,

843
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,720
Hello, Mr, Moon,

844
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,920
Come in, please,

845
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,790
I'm a bit late, I'm sorry,

846
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,160
Everyone, say hello,

847
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,690
This is Mr, Moon Soo Ho, who will work with us,,,

848
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,330
on the Seoul Neighborhood Project,

849
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,260
- Hello, - Hello,

850
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,860
Hello,

00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,600
I'm really glad to see you,

852
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,870
Hello,

853
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,170
Hello, Nice to meet you all,

854
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,170
Of course,

855
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,480
What's going on?

856
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,200
What are you doing? You should go,

857
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,800
It must be cold here, I'll get a small heater,

858
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,800
Forget it,

859
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,570
Goodness, this means we'll see you,,,

860
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:34,870
twice a week in our meetings,

861
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,240
I know you're all busy,

862
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,310
so we'll prepare a lot to not waste your time,

863
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,180
Thank you,

864
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,720
Go, I'll see you outside,

865
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,790
Sure, Ms, Jung,

866
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,430
What happened?

867
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,200
Your chief director is really interesting,

868
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,500
He called me at 6am,,,

869
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,640
and wanted to meet me,

870
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,470
Goodness, this is so embarrassing,

871
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,240
I chose this agency as the one,,,

872
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,410
I wanted to work with,

873
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,710
It might be inconvenient for us to work together,

874
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,220
Does this place have a security camera?

875
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,220
It doesn't,

876
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,000
I'm so glad that I get to work with you,

877
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,510
I'm busy today,

878
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,580
I'll see you at home,

879
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,580
Bye,

880
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,660
Go!

881
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,170
This looks good,

882
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,700

884
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,040
That's hot,

00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:21,540
- Mr, Moon, are you okay? - Yes,

886
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,410
Oh, goodness,

887
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,150
You have a meeting with a property owner,

888
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,490
- I'm sorry, - It's fine,

889
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,460
Get back to work,

890
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,060

Hello,

893
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,190
Will you sit on that sofa and wait for a little bit?

894
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,430
I wished that he and I,,,

895
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,140
will get to live under the same roof,

896
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,870
This is Ms, Choi Seo Rin,

897
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,440
I inherited the land from my ancestors,

898
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,750
but there was an error on the papers,

899
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,820
Hello, I am Moon Soo Ho the CEO,

900
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,560
Hello, I'm Choi Seo Rin,
