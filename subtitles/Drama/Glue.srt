1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,795
<i>How do I know if a girl fancies me?</i>

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,878
<i>Or how can I make her notice me?</i>

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,713
<i>Do girls really like sucking dick?</i>

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,309
<i>I need to get laid this summer.</i>

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,988
<i>My body can't take it anymore.</i>

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,476
<i>I don't wanna keep waking up all sticky.</i>

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,030
<i>If my parents made love a month...</i>

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,312
<i>...before I was conceived...</i>

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,036
<i>...would it be me being born?
Or another boy?</i>

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,994
<i>If they made love two minutes later?</i>

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,515
<i>You can be an orphan
even when you have parents.</i>

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,839
<i>If you have nothing in common with them
somehow you're all alone.</i>

13
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,954
Nacho!

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,395
What? Hold on for five minutes

15
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,077
Yesterday Nacho
and I rode bikes all day long.

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,836
And I noticed that Nacho
has more hair under his armpits

17
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,873
I have thin blond hair

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,070
What does he think about
when he's playing football?

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,435
And when he's wanking

20
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,232
what does he think about?

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,835
Let's go.

22
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,032
Hello
- Hi

23
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,435
What's up?
- Nothing, just passing by.

24
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,192
I picked him up at the football pitch
and we came over.

25
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,994
Are you training these days?
- No, I'm rehearsing with the band.

26
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,391
We have a band.
- We have a band.

27
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,192
With my brother.

28
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,876
I'm learning guitar these days.
And I sing.

29
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,239
Where are the toilets?
- That necklace?

30
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,556
What?
- That necklace

31
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,228
It's a present.
- Is it from here?

32
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,114
No.

33
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,439
The bathroom is that way.
Over there, to the left.

34
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,111
Shall I wait here?
- Yes.

35
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,633
Did you do the medical examination?
- Yeah, that's why we're inside.

36
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,955
Otherwise you can't get in.

37
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,831
Next.

38
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,951
Who's next?

39
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,514
Take off your T-shirt and shoes.

40
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,912
My trousers as well?
- No, not yet.

41
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,073
Say Ahh

42
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Good.

43
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,553
Good.

44
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,669
Let me see your hands.

45
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,679
Turn them around.

46
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,313
The other side,
lift it a bit.

47
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,716
Show me the sole.

48
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,911
The other one.

49
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,076
You have athlete's foot, I'm afraid.
I'll give you a prescription.

50
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,920
You should wash your feet.
Dry them well.

51
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,353
Apply this cream between your toes.

52
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,393
And in ten days you can come back.
- I can't get in now?

53
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,394
Can I get dressed?
- Yes.

54
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,350
So you're sunbathing, fucking cow.
- Mecha!

55
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,839
Messing around with my husband
you bitch.

56
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,635
You're mad, let go.
- I'll smash your face in.

57
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,596
Come on
Go call the police bitch. Cunt.

58
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,679
You're insane.
- Fucking cunt.

59
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,189
I'm gonna teach you,
for fucking my husband.

60
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,595
You'd better have fucked him well then.

61
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,080
How dare you.
- Get off me.

62
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,590
Come here you bitch.
I'm gonna stick this up your ass.

63
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,513
Get off me.

64
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,636
Oily fucking cunt.

65
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,953
Let's see if you can sunbathe now.

66
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,118
Come on, sunbathe.

67
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,436
Come on. Fucking cow.

68
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,396
Fat cow.

69
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,593
What a greasy fucking pig.

70
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,717
Fucking pig.

71
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,633
What a shitty life.

72
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,032
Have you seen my headphones?
- What?

73
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,639
My headphones.

74
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,559
No, I didn't see them.

75
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,879
He can't find his headphones.

76
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,833
The small ones I'm looking for.
- No, I didn't see them.

77
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,508
I didn't see them.

78
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,432
Now, go on.

79
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,674
What's up?
- Nothing.

80
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Can I have a ciggie?
- No.

81
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,989
Why not?
- Give him one.

82
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,716
Come on, just one.
- No, you're too young.

83
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,037
We just had lunch, I want to share
a ciggie with you guys.

84
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,478
Can I have a cigarette?

85
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,189
Stop it.

86
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,153
Flor.

87
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,792
Stop it.

88
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,228
Leave your shoes outside,
it smells like a zoo in here.

89
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,549
What's this shitty program?
- Meeting Point.

90
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,157
Can I change the channel?
- Don't.

91
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,194
Can you get out of the way?

92
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,795
Get out of the way mum.

93
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,356
Why do you have to sit
right in front of me?

94
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,398
Where are you planning to sit?
- Here.

95
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,557
You're blocking my view.
- Have you eaten sweetie?

96
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,517
Have you?

97
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,356
Do we have anything to give this kid?

98
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,398
What have you got in your hair?
- Nothing.

99
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,875
You have something.
- No, I don't.

100
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,594
Did you wash it?
- I took a shower last night.

101
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,153
You must have some kind of product
in it then. - It's been cut like that.

102
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,992
It's a spiky haircut.
- But it's dirty, it's all sticky.

103
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,955
Did you have a good day?

104
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,069
The day after tomorrow dad's
coming for dinner. - Really?

105
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,510
I'm telling you to make sure you're here.

106
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,913
I won't be here.

107
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,750
Well, try and change your plans
to be here.

108
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,269
So we can all be together.
- I can't.

109
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,152
The day after tomorrow?

110
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,710
Have you suddenly forgiven him?
- Well, yes.

111
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,152
What's your problem.
- You're crazy mum.

112
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,920
What?
- We have to put up with you afterwards.

113
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,437
He's an asshole, how can you invite him?
- Don't say that about your father.

114
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,033
He's a human being, who makes mistakes
and regrets them. - Yeah, right.

115
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,589
Listen, you're just a kid.
- I'm not a kid, I'm 16.

116
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,392
Exactly.
- I'm a grown up.

117
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,912
You're not old enough
to understand certain things.

118
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,955
I do understand, he cheated on you a
hundred times. That's easy to understand.

119
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,595
But I'm the one who should forgive him,
not you. - Do whatever you want.

120
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,030
Come over here, please.
- No.

121
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,597
Hey, take it easy.

122
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,109
Hey, you got a ciggie?
- No, I don't smoke.

123
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,029
Does your mummy
not allow you to smoke?

124
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,274
What is that for?

125
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,835
Give me back the bike.

126
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,388
Give it back.
- Don't get pissed off.

127
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,398
Hey, come over here.

128
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,556
Follow him on the bike.
- What's up?

129
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,429
What's up?

130
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,199
You want more?

131
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,073
Guys.

132
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,310
I've brought some new lyrics.

133
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,718
I'll try them out while we rehearse, ok?

134
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,397
<i>Cultivating panties, culture of love</i>

135
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,592
<i>To die in plenitude
Is to die wlth attitude.</i>

136
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,596
<i>Russian men and women
taking their clothes off.</i>

137
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,673
<i>My arms are hanging.</i>

138
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,077
<i>My arms are hanging</i>

139
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,835
Can I have a look?
- Let's see how long it is.

140
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,873
What?
- Are they too long to fit into the song?

141
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,399
The thing about the Russians, it's
because my grandparents were Russian.

142
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,990
I thought, if I'm here
it's because they had sex...

143
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,033
And took their clothes off, that's why...

144
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,194
You know what Maty told me
the other day? - What?

145
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,072
That he'd been to a sex motel
with his girlfriend.

146
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,998
Where?
- To a sex motel.

147
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,838
Where?
- In Neuquen.

148
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,279
There were loads of rooms to choose
with different themes.

149
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
What do you mean?

150
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,553
For instance,
one room was like a jungle.

151
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,435
So you'd be fucking in bed
with lianas hanging above your head.

152
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,317
Another one was like the Batcave,
from Batman.

153
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,833
There was the Bat...
- Batmobile.

154
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,234
Was that the bed?
- Yes.

155
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,510
You'd enter the room and find.
- Any Batcondoms?

156
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,759
There was a closet with costumes.

157
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,439
Like Batman clothes?
- Yes.

158
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,234
Wicked.

159
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,915
And who was Batman? Maty?
- Yes.

160
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,076
What about her?
- Catwoman.

161
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,999
So cool.

162
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,310
Maty Superhero.

163
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,955
Batmaty.

164
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,668
Imagine Maty in a Batman suit.

165
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,997
I'm reaching further.
- It'd be nice to go to a sex motel.

166
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,668
What?
- To go to one of those motels.

167
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,080
With a girl.
- Obviously.

168
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,589
Why?
- Do you wanna go alone?

169
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,478
Go and wank on the bed of a sex motel?

170
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,797
Is there more?

171
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,509
Let's save some for later.

172
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,997
Shall I put them back in?
- Yes.

173
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,113
Yummy...

174
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,913
Open your mouth.

175
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,871
My dad's coming tomorrow.

176
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,472
What for?

177
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,716
To have dinner I guess.

178
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,718
Weren't they on bad terms?
- Sometimes.

179
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,235
His flat is gonna be free.

180
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,835
We could do something there.

181
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,113
Yeah, a party.
- Aweekend party.

182
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,074
I'd have to escape.
- Why?

183
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,596
Cause my dad's coming.

184
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,711
I can't tell them I'm going.

185
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,918
Let's go.
- Ok.

186
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,993
Ring again.

187
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,474
I rung once, why should I ring again?

188
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,473
Hello.
- Hello.

189
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,149
What's up?
- Nothing, just passing.

190
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,629
Where you walking past?
- Yeah, we were passing by

191
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,196
And we remembered
that your house has a balcony

192
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,710
We almost called
on your neighbours' house.

193
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,359
What a nice house.

194
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,272
It isn't nice.
- I like it.

195
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,950
What a silence.

196
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,189
Were you sleeping?
- No.

197
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,871
Have you eaten anything?
- No.

198
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,955
And yourselves?
- No.

199
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,158
You wanna come in?

200
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,476
Keep going. And...

201
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,595
...turn right. Upstairs.

202
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,470
Does it bother you?
- No, I like it.

203
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,630
It's right in your face.

204
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,594
Look what I found.

205
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,237
I found it at the video store.
On the counter.

206
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,398
Read the other side.

207
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,273
'Pick me up. I will bring you good luck.'

208
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,031
You're lucky.
- I picked it up by chance.

209
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,268
I put my hand on the counter and
there it was. As if it came to me.

210
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,271
What is it?
- It's from Saint Gaucho Gil.

211
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,552
You've gotta write copies and throw them
in the street for other people.

212
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,955
Have you done that?
- Not yet.

213
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,118
You can put them anywhere.

214
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,595
Throw me on the streets or sidewalks.

215
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,197
St Gaucho Gil is very miraculous.

216
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,428
If you find this letter make
two copies everyday for 20 days.

217
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,949
During that time you will have a surprise.

218
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,869
What does it say?
Asurprise...

219
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,992
For...
- You and your family.

220
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,715
No, for you and your family.

221
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,836
Aman found this letter
and won the lottery.

222
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,352
What if I win the lottery?

223
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,680
But he stopped making copies
and lost everything, even his job.

224
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,031
Tell me where you're gonna put them
so I can pick them up.

225
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,798
That's not fair.

226
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,158
Do you want something to drink?
- Ok.

227
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,233
What?

228
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,635
Milk.
- Milk... with chocolate.

229
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,595
How many spoonfuls of chocolate?

230
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,760
Three spoonfuls.
- I want plain milk.

231
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,349
Cold?
- Yes.

232
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,914
I'm gonna have chocolate milk too.
- Ok.

233
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,954
How do I look?
- Silly.

234
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,675
Shall we tell her about going to Neuquen?
- Yeah, later.

235
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,717
Stop it.

236
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,232
Get off me.

237
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,073
I'm a kitten.

238
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,710
The kitten wants cuddles.

239
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,272
Wanking monkey.

240
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,269
Eat it, eat it...

241
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,919
Eat this cock.

242
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,472
I'm itchy.

243
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,469
Get that look off your face.

244
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,157
I've an itchy ass.

245
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,551
Open or closed?

246
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,036
Do I have to guess?
- Yes.

247
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,715
Closed.
- No, open.

248
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,118
Very good.

249
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,233
Did you get it?
- No. I mean yes but, let's try again.

250
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,559
Good.

251
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,875
Very good.

252
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,349
I don't understand.

253
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,754
What is it? Is it a pisstake?

254
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,430
No, you're supposed to notice
if it's open or closed.

255
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,639
But what is it that's supposed
to be open or closed?

256
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,308
That's what you have to guess.

257
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,670
I don't like that game.

258
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,155
Wait until you get it.

259
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,595
This weekend we're going to Neuquen.

260
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,677
Neuquen is wicked.

261
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,438
Have you been there?
- Yes.

262
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,232
My dad lives there.

263
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,514
His flat's gonna be free. Just for us.
My dad's coming here.

264
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,392
Do you wanna come with us?

265
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,993
Ok.

266
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,990
When?
- This weekend.

267
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,595
Friday.
- Ok.

268
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,031
I reckon we'll to stay till Sunday.
- We'll bring some food.

269
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,912
Great.

270
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,993
Who else?
- You can bring a friend if you want.

271
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,315
Leticia is off to the lake. You know her?
- Yeah.

272
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,833
Jimena.

273
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,114
Who's that?
- The girl from the swimming pool.

274
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,074
From the other day.
- We'll have to see if they'll let her go.

275
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,396
Why?
- They might not let her go.

276
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,831
Ask her and we'll call you later.
- Ok.

277
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,918
And I'll ask them here.

278
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,079
Will they let you go?
- Yeah. It won't be a problem.

279
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,396
I'll ask my mum.

280
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,474
It's gonna be great.

281
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,035
Yeah, sure.

282
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,999
I think mum's just got back.

283
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,078
You'd better go now.
Just in case.

284
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,238
Ok.
- Come.

285
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,558
Go now. Go that way,
through the window.

286
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,351
Here.

287
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,279
Come on, Lucas.

288
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,359
Come on.

289
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,358
What's up?
- I don't dare.

290
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,951
It's not so high.
- Andrea, where are my pills?

291
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,915
What's all this mess in the kitchen?

292
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,079
I'll clean it up later. - You lock
yourself up in your bedroom all day.

293
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,632
I'll clean it in a minute.
- I can't do it all on my own you know.

294
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,308
Could you lower your voice a bit?

295
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,036
No. Give me a hand here.
- I can't now, I'm studying.

296
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,710
When I say now I mean now,
come here Andrea.

297
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,673
For fuck's sake, come here.
D'you hear me?

298
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,957
They were dirty.

299
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,632
Open or closed?

300
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,955
Closed?

301
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,673
Tell me the secret.

302
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,438
Look at my mouth.

303
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,159
Good.

304
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,873
Very good.

305
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,030
What is it?
- It's the mouth.

306
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,912
Now do it for me.

307
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,559
<i>Yesterday I went for a walk
to the lake.</i>

308
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,397
<i>And I was thinking that the world is huge.</i>

309
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,795
<i>And that human nature...</i>

310
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,755
<i>The big bang when it all exploded...</i>

311
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,632
<i>It brought...</i>

312
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:16,275
<i>...tons of things, the lakes,
the mountains, all the animals...</i>

313
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,671
<i>And it also brought human beings.</i>

314
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,711
<i>I sound like a school book.</i>

315
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,878
<i>And...</i>

316
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,239
<i>But human beings are much more
complex. While a tree is just a tree...</i>

317
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,477
<i>...a person is something more locked off.</i>

318
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,269
<i>It's like we're stuck
inside the soap opera of life.</i>

319
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,918
<i>And we have to live, we don't have
a choice. But we're not capable...</i>

320
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,270
<i>...of seeing the world for what it is.</i>

321
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
<i>And...</i>

322
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,477
<i>...see that we're all here
only for organic reasons.</i>

323
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,760
<i>And it all goes beyond.</i>

324
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,636
<i>The simple fact that my parents
conceived me. It all goes further beyond.</i>

325
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,354
<i>Where do tears come from?</i>

326
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,513
<i>I don't know.</i>

327
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,314
<i>What's the difference between
kissing a boy or a girl?</i>

328
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,396
<i>Boys have beards.</i>

329
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,112
<i>Otherwise it'd be the same thing.</i>

330
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,992
<i>I want to travel.</i>

331
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,753
<i>Why is it that boys don't cry?</i>

332
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,437
I thought you were sleeping.
You alright?

333
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,549
Why can't you play a whole track?

334
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,998
Please.

335
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,069
I'll play your favourite song.

336
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,279
This bus follows the rhythm
of the music.

337
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,554
Andrea, it's Lucas

338
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,748
Yeah, we're in Neuquen. What's up?

339
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,110
Yeah.

340
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,598
But, why not?

341
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,792
We wanted to pick you up
at the coach station, but...

342
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,397
Ok. It's alright

343
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,598
Big kiss
See you when we're back.

344
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,514
Bye.

345
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,390
Shit. She said she would come

346
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,589
It's here. I won.
Come down.

347
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,794
Here.

348
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,749
Where?

349
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,192
Water?

350
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,753
What are these?
- Models.

351
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,871
Models?

352
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,348
Come on, let's have a look around
- I'm coming.

353
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,875
I've got a glue lollypop.

354
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,589
<i>Another fifteen year old girl
has committed suicide</i>

355
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,670
The tap.

356
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,233
The tap.

357
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,838
It's dripping.

358
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,635
You hear it?
- No.

359
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,231
Right there.

360
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,671
Right there. No.

361
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,598
That's it. Yes.

362
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,591
Right there.

363
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,509
Like that's alright. Yes.

364
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,436
Right there.

365
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,672
Don't change the channel.

366
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,231
Don't change it.

367
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,909
Where are you going?
- Home.

368
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,434
Why?

369
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,989
My mum's gonna freak out.

370
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,079
Stay over.
- No, I gotta take the bus.

371
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,195
Don't be such a cunt, stay.

372
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,197
My mum's gonna kill me.

373
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,834
Bye.

374
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,554
Hi.

375
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,273
What happened?

376
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,832
What do you think?

377
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,069
Looks like you sniffed all my glue.

378
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,632
Very clever.

379
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,599
What time is it?

380
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,399
Half past nine.

381
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,629
Don't tell mum about this.
- Do you think I'm stupid?

382
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,231
Look at this.

383
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,192
Your T-shirt.

384
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,395
What's this?

385
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,474
Can't believe this.

386
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,035
I've seen things, but this...

387
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,278
Will this one suit you?

388
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,075
Is it a bit too serious?

389
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,750
No, I like it.

390
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,873
Did you come here alone?
- No, with Nacho.

391
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,438
Where is he?
He left.

392
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,757
What's your shoe size?
- Forty two.

393
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,518
Forty two.

394
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,393
They're too big for me, I'm forty one.

395
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,240
You have to help me clean this mess.

396
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,156
How do we clean up the glue?
- Don't know. We'll find out.

397
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,155
I'll help you.
- Ok.

398
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,193
Here you go.

399
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,635
Let me do that.

400
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,038
You don't do this once a week, do you?

401
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,831
Leave it like that.

402
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,398
Let me have some.

403
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,748
Bye.

404
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,593
<i>Promise.</i>

405
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,078
<i>For...</i>

406
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,035
<i>...the next three weeks I won't look
at my tits to see if they have grown.</i>

407
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,758
<i>I wonder what Lucas
and Nacho are doing now.</i>

408
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,198
<i>Maybe they're rehearsing.</i>

409
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,872
<i>Why do girls never have rock bands?</i>

410
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:07,310
<i>Why are there girl's things
and boy's things?</i>

411
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,679
<i>Can I be friends with boys?</i>

412
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,314
<i>Boys are more fun.</i>

413
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,829
<i>I want to be brave.</i>

414
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,193
<i>Like a man. I want to be a man.</i>

415
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,995
<i>Not be scared of cockroaches.
Not be scared of thieves...</i>

416
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,470
<i>I want to French kiss.</i>

417
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,672
<i>Right now. Can't wait.</i>

418
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,713
<i>I want a juicy kiss.</i>

419
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,593
<i>A deep French kiss.</i>

420
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,958
<i>With fleshy red lips.</i>

421
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,152
<i>With the taste of cherry lollypop.</i>

422
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,593
Want some?

423
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,479
Is it too strong?

424
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,910
I gotta go.
- Ok.

425
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,593
Fucking asshole.
- We used to make fun of that fat cow.

426
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,078
I knew that fat fuck
wanted to fuck everyone.

427
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,273
And you just go and fuck her.

428
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,712
Slow down cause you're losing it.
- Ok, you know what I want?

429
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,549
What?
- What you doing?

430
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,356
Are you insane?
- Get the fuck out and never come back.

431
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,959
Get out.

432
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,870
You don't deserve this family,
you are a sick fuck.

433
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,595
Hi.

434
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,837
I gotta go.

435
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:54,151
I'll call you guys in a couple of days.
We'll do something.

436
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,193
You guys alright?

437
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,678
Don't know what's wrong.

438
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,309
Sorry.

439
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,758
Can I have one?

440
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,429
You don't inhale.

441
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,639
Yes I do.

442
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,990
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

443
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,871
<i>It's already light.</i>

444
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,389
<i>Maybe I should have a wank.</i>

445
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,952
<i>I imagine the town's completely empty.</i>

446
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,310
<i>With no one around.</i>

447
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,113
<i>And Nacho?</i>

448
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,355
<i>I wonder what he's doing.</i>

449
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,835
<i>Is he sleeping?</i>

450
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,871
<i>Am I in his dreams?</i>

451
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,715
<i>I wanna touch Andrea's tits.</i>

452
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,996
One, two, three.

453
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,628
Are we done yet?

454
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,913
We're going to play a song.

455
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,796
<i>Russian men and woman
taking their clothes off</i>

456
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,678
<i>Without curtains the light burns you out</i>

457
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,195
<i>Stains on my skin,
pleasure disease</i>

458
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:44,030
<i>To die with plenitude
and live with attltude</i>

459
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,558
<i>Desert. Desert. Between my legs</i>

460
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,957
<i>Desert between my legs</i>

461
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,196
<i>Make me wet</i>

462
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,231
<i>My pen explodes
My ink explodes</i>

463
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,517
<i>I ink you with red wine</i>

464
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,037
<i>Pumping bodies getting intertwined</i>

465
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,357
<i>Shaking bodies mixing up</i>

466
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,715
We want more.
- We want more.

467
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,795
We don't really play that well...

468
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,232
...but there's a band coming now,
they are really good:

469
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,635
Los Wanos Band.

470
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,031
You both smoke?
- Yes.

471
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,230
What's that?
- Acocktail.

472
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,871
Wanna smoke?

473
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,914
The gig was great.

474
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,830
Has anyone ever tickled
the roof of your mouth?

475
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,592
Here, with the tongue.

476
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,953
Open your mouth.

477
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,440
Open it.

478
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,349
Now you do it to Nacho.

479
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,473
Do it to Nacho.

480
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,992
Pass the drink.

481
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,238
What are you doing?

482
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,998
I've never been
in the men's toilets before.

483
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,712
You're leaning against the walls.

484
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,113
Men's toilets are smellier.
- No.

485
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,433
What time is it?
- Late.

486
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,837
Close your eyes.

487
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,550
Look up to the sky.

488
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,953
Higher.

489
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,955
How old were you?

490
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,559
When?

491
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,789
When you first kissed a boy.

492
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,309
The first time?
- Yes.

493
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,031
Fourteen

494
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,797
And you?

495
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,431
Kissing a boy or a girl?

496
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,439
Agirl.

497
01:26:58,640 --> 01:26:59,868
I was twelve.

498
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,911
Wow, so young.

499
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,998
Good morning.

500
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,030
Well, good afternoon.

501
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,437
What a night last night.

502
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,957
I've got a headache.
- No wonder.

503
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,311
Take an aspirin.

504
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,959
Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

505
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,558
It's dad.

506
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,990
Where did he get that?

507
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,753
What's he doing?
- He has a van.

508
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,434
Dou you think he bought it?

509
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,919
You alright?
- Yes.

510
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,076
Nice top.

511
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:11,400
Where did you get that van from?
- I borrowed it. You like it?

512
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,194
It's very comfy, we can all fit in.

513
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,992
I got a plan. Let's go somewhere
for the weekend, the four of us.

514
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:26,513
Get a bikini, a sweater...

515
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,314
Do you have that game with the words?

516
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,193
I think so.
- Bring it over.

517
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,075
Get a sweater.
I have sleeping bags for everyone.

518
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,349
What's wrong?
- You guys go.

519
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,758
Let's go the four of us.
Come on, the four of us together.

520
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,349
Bring some warm clothes
for the night.

521
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,790
And keep that top on
cause it really suits you.

522
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,552
Come on, hurry up guys.

523
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,230
Three days?

524
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,557
I forgot my shorts,
ask Lucas to get some for me.

525
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,069
They won't fit you.
- Yes, we're the same size.

526
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,397
Come on.

527
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,390
Is there anything to eat?

528
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,236
Ok, let's go.

529
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,557
That one. Put it on.

530
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,311
Let's go.

531
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:03,034
Are we on time?
- Perfect.

532
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,760
I'm not going.
- Come on, Mecha

533
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,837
Come on.
- No, I get scared.

534
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:11,837
Really?
- Yes, you guys go.

535
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:15,157
Ok, let's go, Lucas.

536
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,994
It is safe?
- Yes

537
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,634
It's not gonna fall out of the sky, is it?

538
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,035
Be careful.

539
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:29,950
How long are we gonna fly for?
- Whatever you want.

540
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:33,311
We'll be fifteen minutes.
- Ok, no longer than that.

541
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,600
Let's not waste anymore time.

542
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,278
This is expensive.

543
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,588
Is this plane safe?

544
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,198
Look, dad

545
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,031
They're are like models.

546
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,638
Look dad, the train.

547
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:03,676
CAMPING

548
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,989
Didn't you ask for any instructions?

549
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,475
You have to stick this in.

550
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,072
I'm going inside.

551
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:22,193
Someone has to put this peg in for me.
I'll do it.

552
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,156
Shit.
- Can you help me?

553
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,076
Stick it in there.

554
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,589
That's the hole.
- Must be like this.

555
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,879
Lucas, be careful with that.

556
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,071
I need something to use as a mallet.

557
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,033
Here,

558
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,551
Your father's just useless.
He brings a tent and he can't put it up.

559
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,034
I don't get it.

560
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,797
What are these?
- Oh, don't worry about them.

561
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,269
I didn't bring any warm clothes.
- I told you to bring some.

562
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:48,032
You said bring your swim suit and I did.
Bring your red bikini, you said.

563
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,718
Fucking hell.
And he's laughing, what an ass.

564
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,475
Fucking hell.
- Where are you going?

565
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:23,355
Come back.
Come here. I'll fix it in a sec.

566
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,193
There are bags floating on the water.

567
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,278
It's true.

568
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,634
What do you think they are?
- Plastic bags.

569
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,833
No, they're flamingos.
- I can't believe we have to do this again.

570
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,348
We should get started.

571
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,277
Hi
- Good morning.

572
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,555
What are you listening?

573
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:24,913
Look.

574
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,909
Does it happen to you sometimes
that you're walking...

575
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,239
...and...

576
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,231
...you see a leaf on the floor...

577
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:02,718
...and you say to yourself
I must step on it...

578
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:07,875
...otherwise something really bad
will happen to me if I don't step on it.

579
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,393
Do you shave?

580
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,717
Sometimes.
- Never.

581
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,638
Don't lie.
- And you?

582
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,239
I do sometimes.

583
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,475
Sometimes.

584
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:42,309
Once a week.
- Do you wax?

585
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,911
Your legs and everything?

586
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,997
There's a demonstration.

587
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,712
I think it's the factory workers.
I saw them today.

588
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,076
Have you ever noticed
that we act differently...

589
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,236
...around friends than with family?

590
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,273
My mum used to get mad at me.

591
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,510
Because of that.

592
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,512
Let's go
