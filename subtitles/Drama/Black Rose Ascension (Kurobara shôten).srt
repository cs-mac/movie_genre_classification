1
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:17,586
Look like you're enjoying it!

2
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:21,415
What's the matter with you?

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,865
Look more excited,

4
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,651
That's good,

5
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,145
Zoom in on her face,

6
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,324
I ll try from under the table,

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,327
Good,

8
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,282
Face the camera,

9
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:01,491
Looking good,

10
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:15,811
Good,

11
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,235
What's the matter?

12
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:30,988
This position is wearing me out,

13
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:34,084
- Wait a second,
- Hurry it up!

14
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:37,597
My legs are numb.

15
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:42,722
Change to another position,

16
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:46,244
- Try it from behind.
- You come closer,

17
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:06,671
I can t do This anymore,

18
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:13,631
What the hell?
What are you doing?

19
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:15,762
What s the matter with you today?

20
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:21,163
I feel like I m going to...
get morning sickness again.

21
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:22,102
Let Meiko take a break,

22
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:24,719
If you don't feel good, we
can replace you.

23
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,277
Just hang on for a bit longer,

24
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:31,207
I can t do it anymore,

25
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,362
Get off of me!

26
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:39,302
I really can t do it any more today,

27
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,964
You give up too easily,

28
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:49,498
Let s take a break,

29
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:50,339
Right,

30
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,048
Everyone take 5.

31
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:11,850
I want to go, I just want to leave,

32
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:12,957
Where to?

33
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:17,511
Anywhere, anywhere but here,

34
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,517
I am sick of This,

35
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,538
Don't say that.
You can't say that,

36
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:26,523
We re almost done shooting,

37
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:30,534
We still have hours till we re finished.

38
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,722
We re almost done,

39
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:38,256
My family doesn't want
me to do This any more.

40
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,537
Why do they care?

41
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:47,079
I m like a whore. They're upset
about What I ve done with my life,

42
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,769
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:54,085
It's your life, not theirs.
Don t listen to them,

44
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,553
I m not, This is my choice,

45
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,315
Quit your nagging,

46
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,428
Then quit?
Who s stopping you?

47
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:05,574
You always think things are so simple,

48
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:06,540
It s annoying,

49
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:09,146
So What do you want?

50
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:14,998
I've given you anything you've wanted.
And now you give me This?

51
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:18,555
There's many girls who d kill
to be in your shoes,

52
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,592
You have to
treasure What you have,

53
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:28,097
You just have to push yourself,

54
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:31,133
You are already famous in Japan,

55
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:35,782
You ll be even more famous
if you give it some time.

56
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:39,596
And You ll earn so much money,
you won t know What to do with it,

57
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:43,601
But I've been doing
these movies for so long,

58
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:48,606
Women get tired too,

59
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,611
I'm afraid I ll Hurt the
baby if I keep working.

60
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:58,593
You think fucking will Hurt the little guy
in there?

61
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:02,051
Thanks for getting Her knocked her up.
THANKS FOR WATCHING OUT!

62
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:06,624
How can a woman live
if she has a miscarriage?

63
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:07,602
You don't get it,

64
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:09,758
<i>Meiko,,,</i>

If you don't want to do it, How
much money would change your mind,

69
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:36,563
No more movies,

When are you going to marry
your co-star?

81
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:30,779
Don't give Her any ideas,

00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:48,949
This here is What l recorded of that girl,

171
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,204
I ve never met anyone like her,

172
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,793
I left my recorder in there,
and This is What I got,

173
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:59,396
This recording is pure gold,

174
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,116
I ll sell it at 6,000 yen a piece.

175
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,903
We ll be rich,

176
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:09,372
Filthy rich,

177
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,410
<i>What?</i>

178
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,482
<i>It hurts, It hurts.</i>

179
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:24,717
What does that sound like to you?

180
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:28,618
You think she d complain about Having
a kid?

181
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:33,430
She sounds perfect,

182
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:38,435
Maybe I ll ask Her to work
for us,

183
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:45,790
Listen to This,

184
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:49,422
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

185
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,813
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

186
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:55,883
<i>That's as wide as it gets.</i>

187
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:07,531
You are despicable.
I can't believe you're doing This,

188
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:09,623
This is good,

189
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,535
Too good,

190
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,211
I got to go find her.

191
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:19,065
There's no time,

192
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:21,599

You're leaving so soon?

195
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,559
<i>Please, do It slower.
You're hurting me, </i>

196
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,859
<i>Please be more gentle,</i>

197

You have tooth ache?

207
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:41,693
Well, have you?

208
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,066
Of course - why else would I be here?

209
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,169
Everyone here does,

210

<i>You know,,, I m a movie director,</i>

223
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:48,617

<i>Finally l found another girl,</i>

230
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,851
<i>I have nothing to worry about anymore.</i>

231
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:23,660
I Haven't played around
for such a long time.

232
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:30,166
It s been almost 30 years by now,

233
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:33,636
I ve been very healthy despite it,

234
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:41,416
You have to exercise everyday,

235
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:48,025
You can't play by yourself,

236
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:51,767
Madam.

237
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:56,545
I almost thought you wouldn't
show up,

238
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:59,589
I won't take up too much of your time,

239
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:06,828
You look upset, Are you okay?

240
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:12,709
I m just a bit worried, that's all,

241
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:16,679
I've never done anything
like This,

242
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:21,729
I m sorry, but This is all new to me,

243
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:24,698
<i>Being filmed while having sex,,.</i>

244
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:26,699
<i>I can t even imagine What it s like,,,</i>

245
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:30,727
It seems almost like being
a prostitute, I'm not into things like that,

246
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:18,668
Honey, you ve got nothing to worry about,

247
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,149
No way,

248
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:23,532
It s not like being a prostitute,

249
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:25,087
No way,

250
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:28,796
You re going to love this job,

251
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:30,763
No way,

252
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,800
Come on, come with me,

253
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,813
Go find somebody else,

254
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,781
I changed my mind,

255
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:09,825
It s really not that big of a deal,

256
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:19,325
You'll enjoy it, Madam.
I promise you, it ll be great,

257
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,610
I am serious,

I wouldn't lie to you, I promise,

259
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:30,660
Just listen to This, okay?

00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:39,330
<i>Nothing that big has ever
been in my mouth.</i>

261
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:42,744
That s my voice,

262
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,868
I recorded This at the dentist's office,

263
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:46,873
You ve gone too far!

264

<i>Oh yes!</i>

<i>Yes!</i>

266

273
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:12,900
Don't be so emotional,

274
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:16,893
Hey, stop that!

Your head will splat all over the place,

276
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,471

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:32,920
Why did you have to play that here?

278

So here we are, I m sorry

289
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,843
<i>Shooting a film.,,</i>

Does he look like an honest man?

299
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:31,491
He's the cameraman I talked about,

300
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:35,460
Does he look like a weirdo?

301

He's one of the best in the business.
And the nicest man You ll ever meet,

We shot one of our movies here,

306
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:02,058
You shouldn't worry
about What other people think of you.

307
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:05,561
This is funny,

308
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:12,545
What are you thinking about?

309
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:16,769
Could you do me a favor?

310

I'm so confused,

315

I can give you a lot of money,

316
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:52,040
Yes, but it's still not worth it to me.
Do you think that's all I'm worth?

317
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:54,826
<i>I understand.,,</i>

318

It'd be a shame to say no,
but I can't force you,

You lose another one?

335
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,148
What do you know?

336
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:21,913
She's new.
She s timid, so What?

337
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,814
You have to be careful,

338
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,684
You want to get that girl
for your movie?

339
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,469
Don t you think I know that?

340
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:40,215
She was my only hope,

341
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,365
I see,

342
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:46,217
What happened?

343
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:52,228
She looked very shy anyway,

344
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:58,234
It gets me excited just talking about her.

345
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,237
She s like no other,

346
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,372
She makes me crazy,

347
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:13,522
She s just so wonderful,

348
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,272
<i>Wait a minute, What the hell am I doing?,,,</i>

349
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:29,242
I got to go get her, I need her,

350
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:33,337
I couldn't go on not knowing
What Could ve been.

351
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:34,901
Careful,

352
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,834
Faster man, go get her!

353
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:39,877
I can't Let her get away!

354
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:44,388
I Will see you later
and I LL have her,

355
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,400
No, Please,

356
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,409
<i>What's going on In there?</i>

357
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:45,407
I m trying not to hurt the baby,

358
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,422
I'm almost done,

359
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,456
Bastard!

360
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:55,770
The both of you will fuck alone,
but not on camera, huh?!

361
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,650
- Don't hit him.
- Get off of me!

362
00:34:58,443 --> 00:34:59,353
No!

363
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:22,497
<i>What is This?</i>

364
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:26,501
<i>Why would you want to kill yourself?</i>

365
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,911
Here you are,

366
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:07,548
Madam, you've been riding in Here
for more then an hour,

367
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,566
I know.

368
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,941
Is everything alright?

369
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:12,507
I just really like it,

370
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,458
- I see,
- Madam,

371
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,417
Come on in,

372
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,971
Why are you here?

373
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:26,050
<i>Are you the one who,,,</i>

374
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,551
saved me?

375
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:35,571
The money you offered me was so
awfully low,

376
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,042
It made me feel worthless, I wanted to die,

377
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:41,758
How much do you want?

378
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:46,125
Tell me What you want?
Whatever you want, you got it,

379
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:53,721
I m not going to lose you,

380
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:01,688
Okay, no more messing around,

381
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,085
Let me tell you a story,

382
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:12,738
My wife passed away a few years ago.

383
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:18,623
I ve been living alone all by myself,

384
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:21,688
Really?

385
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,978
Do you know How Hard it's been,
losing someone that you love?

386
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:32,627
I couldn t imagine,

387
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,233
Killing yourself hurts other people,

388
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:41,637
It was one of the most terrible things
that s happened to me,

389
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:46,641
It s so awful,

390
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:56,006
I m sorry,

391
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,654
Take This,

392
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:08,254
It must be awful to lose someone
you loved so much,

393
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:12,905
Did you consider remarrying?

394
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:18,674
I didn't want to hurt my daughter,

395
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:25,192
So I never tried to find another woman,

396
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:27,884
<i>But seeing you,,,</i>

397
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:32,572
makes me want to remarry,

398
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,897
I've never met someone else
so beautiful to me,

399
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,701
I Hope you understand where
I'm going with This,

400
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:55,711
I understand What you mean,

401
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:59,714
Thank you,

402
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,721
I'm sorry but we just met.
How Could we get married?

403
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:08,423
How?

404
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:11,662
<i>I ll give you a good life,,,</i>

405
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,729
Don't you worry,

406
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:21,737
Please believe What I say,

407
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,718
Will you be with me?

408
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:27,799
What about your daughter?

409
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,463
I think she'll like you,

410
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:32,045
You really think so?

411
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:43,404
I ll think it over; you did save
my life after all,

412
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,434
Go straight ahead,

413
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,507
Madam, Madam!

414
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:12,014
I don't Have any money
for the taxi,

415
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:15,210
Don't worry, I got it,

416
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,816
<i>Still going straight?</i>

417
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,806
Yes, Please,

418
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:06,848
We are the same kind of people,

419
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:08,843
We're both stubborn,

420
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,847
Is that What you think?

421
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:19,108
Do they know What you do?

422
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:24,947
Of course they do, they've seen
my films before,

423
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:31,826
Are you ready to watch one?
You can see if you still want to do it,

424
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:47,326
You're already a grown woman.
Why are you so shy?

425
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:52,369
I want to watch it so you
think differently of me,

426
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:55,922
Alright,
just give me a sec, okay?

427
00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:01,924
Everything in the film is staged.

428
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,899
It s not real,

429
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:07,879
It's all fake,

430
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:11,907
Don't take it seriously.
They're acting, remember,

431
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,172
I hope you enjoy it.

432
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:20,949
Okay, let s begin,

433
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,358
Were those girls kissing?

434
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:32,563
That sure looks real to me,

435
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,942
This kind of thing shouldn't be shown,

436
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:37,932
I am not watching it,

437
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:41,948
I can t watch This,

438
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:43,745
Turn it off,

439
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:45,952
I m leaving,

440
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:51,378
It s okay, don t worry,

441
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:53,106
Take a look,

442
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:53,911
No,

443
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:55,950
Please, for me.

444
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:07,293
It's very natural.
2 people giving in to desire,

445
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,990
Is it?

446
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,999
Yes, it is,

447
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:15,254
It s no big deal,

448
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:17,983
Don t be like that,

449
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:22,011
Other women don't think it's a big deal.
Why should you?

450
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:24,056
Really?

451
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:28,016
You don t have to be shy.

452
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,579
You gotta knock that off, and
grow up a little,

453
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:39,164
It s like having a delicious meal,

454
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:43,514
That can't be described in words,

455
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:46,012
It s like a great meal,

456
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,217
Really?

457
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:52,007
It s nothing, no big deal,

458
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:03,018
Just express What you feel inside.

459
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,003
That s all I ask of you.

460
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:06,998
You want me to?

461
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:13,392
You have to keep your
interest for such great things,

462
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:22,992
This is a part of life,

463
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:28,054
Something that has to be experienced,

464
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:30,044
Really?

465
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:40,055
It's so good. Why do you
want to avoid it?

466
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:42,033
Really?

467
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,107
Please don't be so shy,

468
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:51,521
This is interesting.
And educational,

469
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:58,231
What?

470
00:47:00,097 --> 00:47:02,474
Please, help me,

471
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:09,508
I saved your life, Please
do This for me,

472
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:16,392
No,

473
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:22,097
<i>You can t run away from,,.</i>

474
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:28,114
What you have to experience,

475
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,104
No,

476
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:32,766
Come on,

477
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:38,113
Keep rubbing it, keep it up,

478
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:42,116
Please,

479
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,687
Come on,

480
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:47,076
You'll love This,

481
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:49,011
Don't be shy,

482
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,658
Just give in already,

483
00:47:53,184 --> 00:47:55,288
I really like you,

484
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:00,248
No,

485
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,134
I really like you,

486
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:04,138
Please,

487
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:08,142
Come on,

488
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:10,110
Wait,

489
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:15,450
Give me a minute,

490
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:53,859
You re so beautiful.

491
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,536
So beautiful,

492
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:14,060
You ll get used to making
love every night, right?

493
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:21,215
<i>A beautiful body,,,</i>

494
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,117
A soft and tender body,

495
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:36,481
You are so charming,

496
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:52,383
I've never seen a body like yours,

497
00:50:00,277 --> 00:50:02,484
This is wonderful,

498
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:12,243
Attractive breasts,

499
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:20,888
Nice stomach,

500
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,452
Let me see that pussy of yours,

00:50:35,312 --> 00:50:37,212
Just beautiful,

Finally I have my chance,

503
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:52,523
I ve been dreaming about
What This would feel like,

504
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,311
Do you like it?

505
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,319
Wonderful,

506
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:25,805
Marvelous.

507
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:43,358
Everything is just perfect.

508
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:53,368
All of it is mine,

509
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:16,011
Get off of me!

510
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:18,404
Stop it!

511
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:20,389
No!

512
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:23,397

No, Let me go!

517
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:56,863
Quit trying to resist,

518
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:02,937
<i>Listen to me,,,</i>

519
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:06,284
I love you!

520
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:11,119
Please, Help me!

521
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:21,537
What now?

522
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:25,675
Don't you feel better?

523
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:30,141
I ll make you feel better,

524
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:40,720
Only I can do that,

525
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:45,952
<i>Only I can give you,,.</i>

526
00:55:48,425 --> 00:55:51,633

I ll take you higher today,

528
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,696
Get a close-up,

529
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:58,706
Zoom out.

530
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:07,716
This woman is overcome with ecstasy,

531
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:35,106
You can stop shooting,

532
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:12,806
It feels so good,

533
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:20,814
You bastard!
I hate you!

534
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,796
Calm down,

535
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:28,151
What position do you want to try next?

536
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:29,486
What are you talking about?

537
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:30,820
Are you going to sell This?

538
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:31,802
Yes,

539
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:33,327
For retail,

540
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,794
No, no!

541
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:37,126
Stop it!

542
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,699
<i>How can you earn money,,.</i>

543
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,853
without making a little sacrifice?

544
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:51,846
Women always think like This,

545
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,829
Let me go!

546
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:04,279
It's too late for you to go now.
We already filmed it,

547
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:07,463
Is that so?

548
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:09,875
You are so naive,

549
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,558
You can't be serious?

550
01:00:11,588 --> 01:00:13,192
What do you want?

551
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:16,870
Get the fuck up,

552
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:25,482
lf you want to get married, you
have to do This,

553
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:30,884
Do you understand, bitch?

554
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,889
Understand?

555
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:46,229
I see,

556
01:01:16,953 --> 01:01:18,932
It feels so good,

557
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:23,354
<i>You see,,,</i>

558
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:27,941
It s good isn't it,

559
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:46,974
Are we getting married now?

560
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:48,109
Of course.

561
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:55,683
Will you marry me?

562
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,978
I do.

563
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:46,246
ALL This walking is making me tired,

564
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,038
What?

565
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:50,126
We're almost there,

566
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:56,057
So if I shoot This scene with
This other man, we can get married?

567
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:57,651
<i>I m kinda worried abo,,,</i>

568
01:02:58,188 --> 01:02:59,371
Oh my god!

569
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,092
Are you alright?

570
01:03:04,494 --> 01:03:07,304
I got you, I got you,

571
01:03:09,132 --> 01:03:10,360
Are you okay?

572
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:12,867
He's a nice guy; he won t hurt you,

573
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:17,469
After you sleep with him we'll be rich,
and we'll live happy ever after,

574
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:18,513
Okay?

575
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:19,380
Alright,

576
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:28,817
I still feel so nervous about
sleeping with him,

577
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:34,188
I don't know if I can do it,

578
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:39,721
Don't worry,
This is the only time You ll have to do it,

579
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:03,035
No,

580
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,235
Do it again,

581
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:09,102
Action,

582
01:04:22,672 --> 01:04:24,253
Take it off slower,

583
01:04:29,145 --> 01:04:30,885
Let s take a break,

584
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:39,473
Alright, are you ready?

585

Let's get started,

586
01:04:44,194 --> 01:04:46,230
Do I really have to do This?

587
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:52,807
Don't worry, it'll be over soon.
And We ll  be rich,

588
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:55,205
But, I don t want to do it,

01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:57,640
Come on, Let's go,

590

Let s start with you eating her out.

591
01:05:11,588 --> 01:05:13,260
Get the lights ready,

592

Honey, don't look over at me,

595
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:45,801
Close your eyes, and tilt your head,

01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:55,447
Act like you re enjoying This,

597
