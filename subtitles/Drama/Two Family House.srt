narrator:
In the spring of 1956

20
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,609
on the borough
of staten island in New York,

21
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,882
buddy visalo
decided to buy a house.

22
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,451
Never try to walk
on the nails,

23
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,419
because that's where
the beams are.

24
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,388
It looks kinda
old, huh?

25
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,917
The place was built
in 1912.

26
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,722
The plumbing
is practically new.

27
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,894
I done it myself
a few years ago,

28
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,263
and upstairs,
you got

29
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,561
a completely
separate apartment.

30
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,303
$80 a month rent
it gets...

31
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,428
Enough to cover
a mortgage payment,

32
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,203
assuming
you qualify.

33
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:51,372
2 family. You could
quit the factory.

34
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,242
Yeah.

35
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,569
Now, here's the showpiece.

36
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,275
That's a 40-foot
double parlor, gentlemen.

37
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,708
Boy, to beat
the heatin' bill.

38
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,682
I guess you
could always

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,850
lower these
ceilings, huh?

40
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,278
She's the best buy
on staten island.

41
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:06,424
What do you think,
Mr. visalo?

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,760
I mean, you know,
there's a down payment.

43
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,787
You could quit
the factory, you know?

44
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,732
Rent to
the tenants upstairs?

45
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,457
Wouldn't have to work,
life of Riley.

46
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,662
No, no, no.
No tenants upstairs.

47
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,965
Estelle and i
live upstairs.

48
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,297
Downstairs...

49
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,872
What? What are you
gonna do?

50
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,701
"Buddy's tavern."

51
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,866
I have my own business.

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,335
Your own bar.

53
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,383
Yeah, I wouldn't
want that--

54
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,777
that big fuckin'
living room.

55
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,849
With a bar
and some tables,

10, 12 tables?
40, 50 customers?

57
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,448
I put
a guy in back.

58
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,352
You know, break down
a wall, and put in

59
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,824
some live
entertainment.

60
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,560

narrator: It might be worth
noting at this point

66
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,722
that in 1945, when buddy
was in the air force,

67
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,019
he performed at
a special services show

68
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,361
which was attended
by Arthur Godfrey,

69
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,387

when he got back
to New York.

74
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,369
Buddy,
Arthur Godfrey

75
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,405

Arthur Godfrey,

76
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,909
the girl waited
for you for 2 years.

77
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,280
You wanna
get married,

78
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,409
you gotta have
a serious job.

79
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:45,324
And her family found
the whole idea embarrassing,

80
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,989
not to mention
impractical.

81
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,287
This is Arthur Godfrey,
for god sakes.

82
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,420
How many breaks am I gonna
get like this again?

83
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,386
Do you wanna
marry me, buddy?

84
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,425
Oh, estelle, honey,

85
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,699
you know I wanna
marry you.

86
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,857
Then don't do this.

87
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,366
Narrator: Instead,
it was a twin bed

88
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,467
in a room in estelle's
parents' house

89
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,899
until the newlyweds
were ready

90
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:04,904
to move out on their own

91
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,565
and a job
in the machine shop

92
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,573
in the enzolocco
baked goods factory,

93
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,805
where buddy's talents
went largely unnoticed.

94
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,014
Meanwhile,
Godfrey took a chance

95
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,416
on an ex-naval cadet
named Julius larosa,

96
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,550
an overnight
singing sensation.

97
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,356
I don't wanna
hear it.

98
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,459
It could've been me.

99
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,890
Narrator: Even the much
publicized

100
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,725
firing of larosa
a year later

101
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,100
failed to dampen the fires
of buddy's resentment.

102
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,099
Buddy: Oh, that was
Julius larosa. We saw it.

103
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,843
Yeah, it was
right on the air.

104
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,069
You should have
seen his face.

105
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:46,375
That means that that could
have been you, see?

106
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,850
What did I tell you?

107
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,518
So what? Better to be
larosa without a job

108
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,518
than be visalo
at that fuckin' factory.

109
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,056
Narrator: It was a watershed
moment in this marriage.

110
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,390
Never again would
estelle stop buddy

111
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,696
from pursuing his dreams...

112
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,527
Dreams which were now
understandably

113
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:09,702
lower in scale than
they had previously been.

114
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,712

are any calls.

116
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,612
Narrator: A series
of calamitous

117
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,080
beginning with the first
privately owned limo service

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,910

00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:29,686
Had the slightest use for

123
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,461
Narrator: Buddy's
house painting service

124
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,159
fell victim to the design
sensation of 1953.

125
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,103
We're gonna have
the whole house done.

126
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,528
They say we'll never
have to paint again.

127
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,034
Buddy: What,
even the bathrooms?

128
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,936
Woman: Oh, they're lovely.
Velvet. Wanna see?

129
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,440
Well, that's all right.

130
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,742
Hey, you know, I could

00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,304
But it will.
It's buddy.

177
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,173
Buddy here's thinkin'
of openin' up a bar

178
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,971
over on west street.

179
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,643
West street?
The Mick neighborhood?

180
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,682
What do you want with
servin' them micks?

181
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,779
They got no money.

182
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,980
They always
ask for credit,

183
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:41,881
and they never pay.

184
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,252
Estelle:
Don't you see?

185
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,850
Look, some guys,
they're destined

186
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,892
for success,
you know?

187
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,887
It's like they
could do no wrong,

188
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,959
like they were
pregnant with it.

189
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,761
Buddy, he's pregnant
with failure.

190
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,791
Oh, come on.

191
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,856
It was gonna interfere
with your business--

192
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,265
buddy, you could
have my business.

193
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,599
I got me a lot up
in orange, New Jersey,

194
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,295
and the first chance
i get, I'm goin'.

195
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,106
What the hell you
gonna do up there?

196
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,308
Chicken farm.

197
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,339
Chicken farm.

198
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,884
I got it all
figured out.

199
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,138
Chicken farm?

200
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,746
Yeah, you make money
on both ends.

201
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,018
And you make money
from the eggs.

202
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,747
How the fuck did you
come up with this?

203
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,752
Narrator: And ultimately,
as things always do,

204
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,686
it came down to legalities.

205
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,931
Could the house
be converted into a bar?

206
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,187
Yep, yep.
According to this, yep,

207
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,655
'cause you're
on the northwest border of town,

208
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,674
covered under the business
statute of 1877, see?

209
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,028
So, you don't
need the approval

210
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,196
of the bar and restaurant
commission,

211
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,674
'cause, oh,
those sons of bitches,

212
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:40,973
they can tie you up
forever.

213
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,344
Huh. Hey, that's
a great law.

214
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,943
Narrator: After the usual
visit from a relative

215
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,306
first, write it at
the contract of sale.

216
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,646

tenants

217
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,851
upstairs
in our bedroom,

218
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,652
if they don't
wanna leave?

219
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,824
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

220
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,361
Of serving them with
an eviction notice.

221
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,157
They got one week
to get out.

222
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,729
I know you want
to move in right away.

223
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,188
We'll move in
downstairs,

224
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,056
oh, so,
in other words,

225
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:09,225
narrator: And, after
the usual last argument...

226
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,166
I hate that house!
It's a slum!

227
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,766
It's our chance,
estelle.

228
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,905
Oh, please, to what?
Turn me into a barmaid?

229
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,752
Narrator:
Moving day arrives.

230
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,907
Hey, it's a nice street.
I'm gonna...

231

if it don't work out

for some reason, god forbid,
the bar don't work out,

233
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,194
we'll just rent
the downstairs out--

234
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,059
hey, hey, hey, come on!
Pick that up, will ya?

235
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,189
What do you think?
There's the bay window.

236
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,025
That's where
the sign's gonna go--

237
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,930
the neon sign,
"buddy's tavern,"

238
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,395
featuring buddy...

239
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,303
Oh, estelle.
I'm so sorry.

240
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,836
Don't worry about it.

241
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,282
We'll be in and out
in a month.

245

246
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:04,164
I'm in the luggage compartment
of a train.

247
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,257
What sense would it make
to unpack everything

248
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,129
just so we have to pack
it up again

249
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,228

we ain't lookin'
to be landlords.

291
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,251
No, no. The idea here
is for, uh, me and the wife

292
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,292
to keep the whole house
to ourselves.

293

we're gonna live up here.

00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,357
A bar? Lovely idea.

298
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,395
Yeah, well, it's been
on my mind for a while now,

299
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,370
seeing as how the street's got
all these businesses on it--

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,270
will you be
servin' food?

301
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,272
Food? Yeah, I don't know,

302
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,384
maybe some sandwiches
or somethin'.

303
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,253
I didn't get
to the point yet.

304
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,952
The point is, I'm lookin'

I don't wanna make anything
too uncomfortable for you,

to be right this minute.

307
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,155

Maybe even a week.

soul, Mr. visalo?

00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,602

bought this firetrap

00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,965
from that prick
mahoney

313
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,073
tells me, above all,
you're stupid,

314
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,435
and if you think you're
gonna come up here

315
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,914
you're even dumber
than you look.

Now, I got a wife in
there expectin' a kid,

317
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,616
so, in spite
of your stupidity,

318
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,677
I'm sure
you'll be able to see

319
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,345
that I'm
not exactly in the mood

320
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,923

two-bit Italian

Oh, hey, viloola.

324
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,366
I forgot--the rent.

00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,335

Ain't had it for months,

346
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,270
Well, how is that
possible?

347
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,540
Everyone lived
rent free?

348
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,268
"Only applies
to 2-family dwellings,

349
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,373
"converted from what
was originally intended

350
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:55,206
between the years
1919 and 1921," uh-huh.

351
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:59,746
Estelle: My uncle Louie
would have known better

352
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:01,253
to buy a house
and not ask

353
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,254
whether the tenants
had to stay or go.

354
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:07,456
My uncle Louie, buddy,
and he couldn't read or write.

355
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Why don't we go
to uncle Louie's grave

356
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,702
and ask him
what to do, huh?

357
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,327
No, we gotta sell
this house fast, buddy.

358
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,704
Maybe uncle Louie
will buy it.

359
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,543
What the hell?

360
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,239
I'll take care
of this, baby.

361
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,684
Oh, my god.
This isn't happening.

362
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,409
Hey, what's
goin' on in there?

363
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,216
Hey, open up, will ya?

364
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,317
Op--what are you
doin' to her?

365
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,689
What are you doin' to her?
Open up the door!

366
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,258
What's the matter with you?

367
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,217
Hey! Hey! Hey!

368
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,329
Who are you?

369
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,574
I'm visalo,
the, uh, landlord.

370
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,171
I--i heard a noise.

371
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,443
Woman: What of it?

372
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,311
You broke my door down.

373
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,409
I could've
just called the cops.

374
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,681
What right
have you?

375
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,379
You broke
my door down.

376
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,821
He's here.
Our lovin' protector, Mary.

377
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:09,388
Well, you come to inspect
the fuckin' damage, visooli?

378
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,519
Hey, settle down, pal.

379
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,593
Oh, visooli, you know,

380
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:18,331
it's about your figure,
your girlish figure.

381
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,831
You reminded me
of somethin'.

382
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,833
I couldn't think what.

383
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,774
No, but now I know.
I know.

384
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,700
You're a sausage,
visooli.

385
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,365
Don't you know?

386
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,613
Don't you see
what I mean?

387
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,678
Short on the top,
short on the bottom,

388
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,337
and packed
in the middle

389
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,375
hey, hey, look,
i got news for you, pal.

390
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,411
You're movin'.

391
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,616
And I got news for you.

392
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,717
You smell like
a fuckin' garlic bread.

393
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,149
Jim, stop it.

394
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,824
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

395
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,857
Oh, oh,

396
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,330
she's your type,
huh, visooli?

397
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,729
Oh, you want
a piece of her, do you?

398
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,732
Well, may it please
you to know

399
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,704
that this lady

400
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,802
belongs to me...

401
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,844
From here, down to here.

402
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,480
And all that's
in-between.

403
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,175
Unh! Oh!

404
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,529
I suppose you expect me
to thank you.

405
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,888
You know what?

406
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,656
You're as sick as he is.
You're even sicker.

407
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,196
You're both sick,

408
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:32,771
and you're both
movin' tomorrow!

409
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,909
Buddy: He would've killed her.
He would've, you know--

410
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,679
narrator: Naturally,
news of buddy's

411
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,637
drunken Irish tenant

412
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,575
and his ungrateful
pregnant wife

413
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,450
he can't evict them.
That's what he's sayin'.

414
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,379
It's about this law.

415
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,284
Buddy, you know
what they say?

416
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,286
The only thing worse
than a drunken Mick

417
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,518
is a drunken Mick with
a broken fuckin' nose.

418
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,493
Angelo is right.
We should just throw them out.

419
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,432
Well, it's what I told you.
The guy's got rights.

420
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,527
The guy in the housing office
with the bow tie, he said--

421
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,299
what about your rights
as a homeowner?

422
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,898
Throw the guy out.
It's your house.

423
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,930
Tomorrow mornin',
throw the guy out.

424
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,436
Throw the fucking
guy out!

425
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,437
What do you mean?
You mean physically?

426
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,609
What do you think,
magically?

427
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:09,668
You go down there
and you grab

428
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,676
his stupid
Irish Mick ass,

429
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:14,377
out of the block,
and that's it. Done.

430
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,750
<i>Finito.</i>

431
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,220
What? Are you gonna
be there?

432
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,420
No, I'll send you
by yourself.

433
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,821
We're all
gonna come there.

434
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,522
We're all coming.
I'm in. I'm in.

435
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:27,694
Narrator: The o'nearys
were to receive 3 warnings

436
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,564
in the space of 5 minutes.

437
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,562
If they didn't actively

438
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,433
begin moving
their possessions

439
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,632
then appropriate actions
would be taken,

440
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,295
said actions
remaining vague,

441
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:41,013
but without a doubt,
involving violence.

442
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,284
What are you doin'?
Whoa?

443
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,607
You gonna warn
'em or what?

444
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:50,512
Yeah, of course.
Um, I'm just thinkin'...

445
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:54,351
Or should I do it
from down here?

446
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,454
What's the difference?

447
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,415
What if the shoutin'
wakes up the neighbors?

448
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,694
Well, who the fuck cares?

449
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,962
Hey, it's my house,
all right, Danny?

450
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,561
Well, go fuckin'
talk to him.

451
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,663
What are we doin' here early
in the morning? Come on.

452
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,265
All right, all right.
I'm gonna--I'm gonna go--

453
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,668
I'm gonna go up there.

454
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,799
Wake the Mick up, huh?

455
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,038
Wake the guy up, huh?
Buddy!

456
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:22,754
All right, all right.
Stop shoutin', will ya?

457
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:43,002
Wake up in there.
It's visalo.

458
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:47,674
Hey, wake up.
It's moving day.

459
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:51,314
I ain't goin' away.
You're goin' away.

460
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,511
No, I ain't leavin'
youse alone, ok?

461
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,913
You're leavin' us alone.

462
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,554
Oh, shut up!

463
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,394
Let's give 'em
a couple minutes.

464
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,964
All right, ok, so, uh,
let's set our watches.

465
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,963
I got, uh,
10 minutes to 7:00.

466
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,996
I got 5 of.

467
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,396
Set it to mine.
My watch works.

468
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,006
So--so maybe you should
set it to ours.

469
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,979
Whose idea was this
to set our watches?

470
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:28,447
All right, enough
with the watches.

471
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,552
Jim! Jim, wake up!

472
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:39,524
Oh, god. Jim!
Wake up! Come on!

473
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,425
Ok. What? What the?

474
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,058
Wake up, come on.

475
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,363
Aah!

476
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,525
Wake up!

477
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,132
Jim, for god sakes,
wake up!

478
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,108
This is your second
warning, o'neary!

479
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,010
Let it be known
that you have received

480
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,981
2 of a possible 3 warnings!

481
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,811
Go the the window.

482
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,746
Why?

483
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,493
There's men outside.

484
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,889
Who?

485
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,520
Go to the window!

486
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,655
They're gonna
throw us out!

487
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,762
Visoolo.

488
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,444
If you and your band
of fat-ass dagos

489
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,682
wanna be responsible
for breakin' the law

490
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,547
and dispossessing me,
well, that's fine.

491
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:35,977
I'll see you in court.

492
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,882
How do you like
this guy?

493
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,484
He ain't takin'
no one to court.

494
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,945
You know how
expensive that is?

495
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,893
But if you wanna
be responsible

496
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,959
for harmin'
a pregnant woman

497
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,057
and an unborn child,

498
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,558
then you'll have
to harm me, too...

499
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:52,661
And that encounter
will surely prove fatal

500
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,865
to all of ya.

501
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,537
Aw, come on.
Gimme a break.

502
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,897
What about that,
huh?

503
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,765
He's bluffin'. I can
take him myself.

504
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:06,084
It's ok, Mary.
They was just bluffin' us.

505
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,645
It's happenin'.

506
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:17,222
Oh, Jesus, it's happenin'.
Oh, Jesus.

507
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,156
No, listen to me, please.

508
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
This is your second
warning, o'neary,

509
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,701
unless you already
come to your senses.

510
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:25,727
I need your help.

511
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,971
We have to have
a doctor now.

512
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,727
Yeah, fuck you.
What?

513
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,095
A doctor,
for Christ's sake.

514
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,573
She's havin'
the baby.

515
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:39,244
Yeah, bullshit.
Why don't you call the doctor?

516
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,805
Because you turned
my phone off.

517
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,684
Angelo: Did you turn
the phone off?

518
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,983
I don't know,
the other day, come on.

519
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,246
I swear to you,
we'll both be outta here,

520
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,815
but we need a doctor now!

521
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,664
I think,
uh, you know,

522
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,959
this is a little
different now

523
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:55,891
here, you know.

524
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:59,155
Maybe she is
havin' a baby.

525
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,001
Ok, look,
since technically

526
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,842
you have one warning
left, o'neary,

527
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,097
I'm gonna take
your word for it,

528
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,505
but don't try nothin'
funny, you hear?

529
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,639
Chip, go call the doctor.

530
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,043
Yeah. I think we'd better.

531
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:16,514
Could you imagine
if she had a baby?

532
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,084
Where's your phone?
Is the phone in here?

533
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,746
In the wall, chip.
Over here.

534
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:24,724
The wall. Thank you.
Here we go.

535
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:25,624
So, what's goin' on?

536
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,615
No, no, nothing, nothing.

537
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:27,626
Nothing's goin' on, it's--

538
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,887
uh, yeah. Hello, operator.

539
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,685
Uh, we need a doctor
over here right away.

540
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,926
A doctor? Oh, my god, chip.
Somebody got hurt.

541
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,632
Uh, yeah, we're at--
no. It's--it--

542
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:35,804
the woman upstairs.
She's--

543
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:36,831
she's havin' a baby
or somethin'.

544
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,996
She's havin' a baby?!
Oh, my god!

545
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,906
Uh, what? The address?
Uh, I think we're at--

546
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,809
hey, buddy.
She's havin' a baby?

547
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,241
Yeah, that's
what he says.

548
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,546
So, what the hell
are you guys

549
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,748
just standin'
here for?

550
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,019
Just--we're just
here makin' sure

551
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,047
he don't try
nothin' funny.

552
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,951
You're a bunch
of knuckleheads,

553
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:56,123
you know that?

554
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:03,957
Hello?

555
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,326
Hello?

556
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,902
Yeah, yeah, here!

557
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,770
Oh, my god,
she's having--

558
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,599
oh, my god. Hey,
you're gonna be ok,

559
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,995
all right?
I'm gonna help you.

560
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:14,866
It hurts!

561
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,714
Oh, my god!

562
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,939
Oh, my god.
I need you to get me

563
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,606
sheets, towels,
anything.

564
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,614
Listen, I've never
done this before,

565
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,946
but you're
gonna be ok. Hey!

566
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,853
Maybe I should
go up there, huh?

567
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,916
Yeah, maybe you should.

568
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:33,955
We'll stay down here,
you know,

569
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,260
in case he tries
somethin' funny.

570
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,732
Estelle: You gotta
sweat, baby.

571
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,360
What's your name?

572
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,004
What's your name,
honey?

573
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,129
Mary! Mary!

574
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,173
My god!
Oh, my god!

575
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,900
I have it, baby.
He's right here.

576
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,265
Just push.

577
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,844
Estelle: Bring him
to you, come on.

578
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,344
Just push.

579
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,906
I can't!

580
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:57,054
Just push one more time,
please!

581
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,919
You gotta push.
I know it hurts.

582
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,618
I know it hurts, Mary.

583
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,860
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

584
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:16,971
Narrator: That's me.

585
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,039
Buddy: He's somethin',
isn't he?

586
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,337
Narrator: In the kitchen
of the home

587
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,268
in which I was born.

588
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,112
Estelle: He's beautiful.

589
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,938
Huh? You ready
to meet daddy? Huh?

590
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:26,975
He's, uh...
Aw, Jesus.

591
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,309
He's a little dirty,
i guess, huh?

592
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:35,816
He's not dirty, just--
just cuddle him some.

593
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,861
Narrator: You may detect
vaguely quizzical looks

594
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:40,657
on the faces of those
who were present...

595
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,926
That's because it was
immediately apparent

596
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,332
that, in spite
of having been born

597
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,035
of 2 white parents,

598
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:55,137
I seem to have been
made of darker material.

599
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,041
Hey.

600
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,987
Bring him to me.

601
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:17,188
Bring him to me!

602
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,806
What happened?

603
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,076
Hey, uh, look.

604
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,824
Go back to the bar, ok?

605
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,989
I'll meet ya there later.

606
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,288
Narrator: That
was the last time

607
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,761
anyone in
staten island

608
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,129
ever saw
Jim o'neary,

609
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,887
my mother's
husband.

610
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,856
He was arrested
for vagrancy

611
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:56,995
and vanished for good
shortly thereafter.

612
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,905
My mother recovered
from my birth

613
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,081
and later told me that
the only shocking thing

614
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,521
was that the inevitable
hadn't occurred to her

615
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:14,988
during the 8 1/2 months
of her pregnancy.

616
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,487
At least not
consciously.

617
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,120
The brief and, apparently,
satisfactory union

618
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:25,296
had never entered her mind
as a possible complication.

619
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,997
Or perhaps
it constituted

620
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,899
a sort of backup plan.

621
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,231
Her life with
her first husband

622
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,366
was one way
or another,

623
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,100
in need of some
drastic change.

624
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,908
He's got the nose,
the skin,

625
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,041
and everything.

626
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,876
The kid's
fuckin' colored?

627
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,482
Half, yeah.

628
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,453
You gotta be
kiddin' me.

629
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,292
You mean she really
fucked some coon?

630
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,518
Evidently. How else
does it happen, right?

631
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,393
Well, buddy,
i mean,

632
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,525
look at it
this way.

633
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,330
You're gonna
have your own

634
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,401
janitor
on the premise.

635
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,431
Kinda puts
a black spot

636
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,896
on the neighborhood,
don't it?

637
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,339
Kinda gives a new
meaning to the term

638
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,981
black Irish, you
know what I mean?

639
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,907
Let's have a couple
of drinks here

640
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,053
on the spook.

641
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,054
In your own
house, huh?

642
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,250
Gonna stay
in the house now?

643
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,921
Yeah, why not?
All right, sure.

644
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,567
Buddy. Buddy.

645
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,640
Estelle told me
what happened.

646
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,969
What are you
gonna do about it?

647
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,205
About what?

648
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,940
He doesn't even realize
what's goin' on.

649
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,546
What, I'm fine.
I ain't drunk.

650
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,079
All right,
what, what?

651
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,084
You know,
you think

652
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,575
you're
so smart, huh?

653
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,986
Big shot
homeowner.

654
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,918
You can run your
own business.

655
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,423
But yet you're
too stupid

656
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,164
to realize
when something

657
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,959
very, very
important

658
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,231
has happened
here.

659
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,429
What?

660
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,060
Buddy.

661
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,532
The baby
is colored.

662
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,104
So?

663
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:47,643
But it happened
under our roof.

664
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,570
Buddy, this thing
and her baby,

665
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:51,476
are still here.

666
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:52,477
Well, we gotta
get her out,

667
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,078
and we gotta
get her out now!

668
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,980
Honey, look,
she just had the kid.

669
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:00,383
All right, give her
a couple of days, ok?

670
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,416
I'll talk to her.

671
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,390
No. No, buddy.
Tomorrow,

672
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:07,089
or you know
where I'll be.

673
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,262
That's it, ok?

674
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,339
It's visalo.

675
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,239
Come in.

676
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,687
Ever seen
one before?

677
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,987
I'm sorry, ahem.

678
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,959
I, uh, I came
to tell ya--

679
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:39,988
you came to
tell me that

680
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:43,192
my husband's back,
quit the drink,

681
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,385
paid you
the back rent,

682
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:50,226
I think you know what
i came up here to tell ya.

683
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:55,006
All I ask you
for is a week,

684
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,107
just a week to rest

685
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,108
and make some kind
of arrangements.

686
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,410
A week?

687
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,651
I got a sister
in sheepshead bay.

688
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,977
She'll help.

689
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,283
We haven't spoken
for a while,

690
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:08,094
look, I think
you ought to know

691
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:09,147
that i--i--i--

692
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,294
if it's the money,

693
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:14,189
I'll pay you for it
as soon as I can.

694
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,133
Just a week.

695
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,557
That's all
i ask you.

696
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,133
It's gotta
be tomorrow.

697
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,700
Well, I couldn't
expect you to let me

698
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,104
stay here rent-free

699
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,766
to look after a child
that nobody in the world

700
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,244
could possibly want,
now, could I?

701
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,443
Come on, you gotta
admit, I mean,

702
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,375
it's a little odd, right?

703
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,481
What's so odd?!

704
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,175
I'm not askin'
for your pity.

705
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,216
I don't care what you
or anyone else thinks.

706
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:47,623
I got nothin'
to be ashamed of.

707
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,726
I'll do you
the courtesy

708
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,697
of gettin' out
of your house tomorrow.

709
00:33:55,767 --> 00:34:00,097
Yeah, uh,
no hard feelin's, right?

710
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,066
God help you.

711
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,477
What's with
the green paint?

712
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,379
It's left over from
the, uh, you know,

713
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,381
the house
painting service.

714
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,323
I figured
i could use it

715
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,777
on the trim
inside the bar.

716
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,816
I don't see a bar
being done in green.

717
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,721
Unless maybe it's
got an Irish theme.

718
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,393
Bite your
fuckin' tongue.

719
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:25,803
Mornin'.

720
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,068
Mornin'.

721
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,765
Girl like that
fuckin' a mulignon.

722
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,501
What a shame.

723
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,306
I've left all
the furniture.

724
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,382
Sell it
if you wish.

725
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,651
Unless you
want it.

726
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,120
What would
i need with it?

727
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,849
Here, take this stuff
inside, will ya?

728
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,786
I'll be back
in a second.

729
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,521
All right.

730
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,486
No, forget the keys.
Just kick it.

731
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,295
Just kick it.

732
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,372
Hey.

733
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,441
You know where
you're goin'?

734
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,870
What does it
matter to you?

735
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,606
I'm just askin'.

736
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,812
Well, if you
must know,

737
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,813
I'm checking into
the dorralton hotel

738
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,545
until my sister can
arrange something.

739
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,881
The dorralton.

740
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,846
Jesus, you gotta
be careful.

741
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:26,815
I mean,
that's mostly...

742
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:29,725
Ladies of
the evening.

743
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,261
I beg your pardon.

744
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:35,833
Prostitutes.
That kind of thing.

745
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,870
I wasn't expecting
the Waldorf.

746
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:42,914
May I go now?

747
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,508
Look, I'm just
tryin' to be--

748
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,510
as always,
Mr. visalo.

749
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,916
Eh, crazy bitch.

750
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,549
Jeez.

751
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,189
Narrator:
On weekends,

752
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,492
everybody did
what they could

753
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,533
to help buddy
and estelle

754
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,288
make something
of their home.

755
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:05,826
Honey, get out
of the way.

756
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:06,931
What are
you doing?

757
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,632
Get out
of the way!

758
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:12,935
We're gonna
take this down.

759
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,548
Beautiful.

760
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:29,954
Leaded glass.
Look at that.

761
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:32,855
Hey, honey,
take a look at this.

762
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,518
Nice, estelle.

763
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,598
Gorgeous.
Beautiful.

764
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,673
Narrator:
During the weeks,

765
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:44,899
the grinding
daily routine

766
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,773
went on for
both the men...

767
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,772
Hey, thanks.

768
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:49,774
You know?

769
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:50,605
For what?

770
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:53,879
You're the only one
i know who does.

771
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,779
That's 'cause
you got balls.

772
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,981
Narrator: As well
as for the women.

773
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,582
Should I go
down the list?

774
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,454
The painting
business.

775
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,623
They were
pretty good ideas.

776
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,462
Narrator: And, gradually,
the odd set of events

777
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,358
disappeared into
the haze of folklore.

778
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:12,931
She said you should
have told the police.

779
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,801
'Cause what she did

780
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
was against the law.

781
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:17,932
What is?

782
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,866
Miscegenanton...
Or something.

783
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,772
It's that imbalance
that the Irish got.

784
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,735
And the Mick says,
"she's havin' a baby,

785
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,714
"havin' a baby."
A baby.

786
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:31,683
How much longer I gotta hear
this story, huh, ang?

787
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,323
Buddy, you
don't know it,

788
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,418
but you
made history.

789
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,619
It ain't never
gonna be forgotten.

790
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,692
Well, what the hell.
It wasn't my fault.

791
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,490
Nobody said it was.

792
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,892
Come on,
have another drink.

793
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:44,463
So, buddy comes back
downstairs, right?

794
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:45,933
And I go, "so, uh,
what was it,

795
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,671
and he says,
"neither. Pickaninny."

796
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,598
Pickaninny.

797
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,743
I never said that.

799

00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,943
I'm lookin'

00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,345
her name's
o'neary. Mary.

807
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:37,948
Fourth floor.

808
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:38,979
Fourth floor.

809
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,354
Um, uh,
which room?

810
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,954
How the fuck
should I know?

811
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,936
Who is it?

812
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,546
It's visalo.

813
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:10,678
I was just passin' by,

814
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,522
and I was wonderin'
how you were doin'.

815
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,986
Not too good, huh?

816
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,990
My sister won't
take me in.

817
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:26,034
She couldn't explain
the whole thing

818
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,931
to her husband.

819
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,933
Ohh.

820
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,495
Maybe you ought
to consider, uh,

821
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,104
givin' it away.

822
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:37,066
Why are you here?

823
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,975
I don't know.

824
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:40,978
I don't know.
You know, they were

825
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,149
talkin' about you
down at the bar,

826
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,007
and, uh, I mean,
i wasn't sayin' anything,

827
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:47,515
but I started wonderin',
you know, how you doin'.

828
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,989
I give you something
to talk about, do I?

829
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,619
You and your
friends at the bar.

830
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,955
The people
at the market, too.

831
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,391
And then you
feel guilty,

832
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,456
and the next thing,
you're around here,

833
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,104
payin' a visit
and givin' me advice.

834
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,000
Why don't i
give him away?

835
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,943
Because maybe
i don't want to.

836
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,869
Look, I'm just
tryin' to help.

837
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,565
You don't care.

838
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,176
You think
I'm some slut,

839
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:16,148
some stupid girl with
her brain down here.

840
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:17,708
Hey, what the hell, Mary?!

841
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:20,916
And my name
is not Mary.

842
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,449
It's Mrs. o'neary
to you.

843
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:24,885
I'd never dream
of calling you

844
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,960
by your first name,
Mr. visalo.

845
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,928
If it's Mrs. o'neary,
where's Mr. o'neary, huh?

846
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,843
Where's your fuckin'
bum husband?

847
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:41,807
Get the fuck
outta here.

848
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,007
Narrator: But it remains
an undisputed fact

849
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:46,539
that every man has
at least one moment

850
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:49,775
of total selflessness
in this life.

851
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,981
Don't throw it away.

852
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:57,894
Me and Laura
goin' Saturday.

853
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,559
Don't worry, I won't.

854
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,925
Used to be
my grandmother's room.

855
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,832
She died
last year. 104.

856
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,035
$25 a month,
includin' the water.

857
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:16,767
Last guy I had used it,
uh, for emergencies.

858
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,205
You know what I mean?

859
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,880
Uh, yeah,
i think so, uh,

860
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:24,209
in fact, I'm kinda lookin'
to just do this quietly.

861
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:27,146
Hey, yeah, I was married
myself for years.

862
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,552
Uh, no, no,
it's not that.

863
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,123
It's uh--
it's somethin' else.

864
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,792
I--it's hard
to explain.

865
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,062
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

866
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,131
Deaf and dumb.
D and d.

867
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,099
That's me.

868
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,997
Yeah, all right, good.

869
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,770
Let's keep it
that way, then.

870
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,240
Otherwise,
I'll have to kill ya.

871
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,009
I won't have this.

872
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,152
Give me 38 bucks.

873
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,647
Jesus, for this dump?

874
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,649
Stop it.
Do you hear me?

875
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,782
Why are you
doin' this?

876
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:02,816
You'll pay me back.

877
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,551
Damn right I will.

878
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,916
I won't
take charity.

879
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,733
Does your conscience
bother you, is that it?

880
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,160
Because it needn't.

881
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,134
He pays for the water.

882
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,073
Are you doin' this to
try to make yourself

883
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,568
into a Saint,
is that it?

884
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:20,841
Christ.

885
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,109
I'm doin' it
because--

886
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,107
I don't know.

887
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:25,539
I'm just doin' it,
all right?

888
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,114
Can't you even
say thanks?

889
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:31,012
No, you can't.
That's nice.

890
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,676
In that case,
I'm not doin' it

891
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,884
for your thanks.

892
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:34,715
I'm just sorry--

893
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,889
I don't need
your pity.

894
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,058
You need a goddamn roof
over your head

895
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,557
till you figure
out what to do

896
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,289
with your goddamn self.

897
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,590
Look, don't get
it in your head

898
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:46,926
that I think what
you did is all right.

899
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:51,572
I think what
you did is sick.

900
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:56,340
You shouldn't be stayin'
in that hotel, that's all.

901
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,811
I take it
your wife doesn't know.

902
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,140
No, she don't know.

903
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,691
Thank you,
Mr. visalo.

904
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,027
Narrator: A letter from
the staten island bank

905
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,830
was addressed
to Mr. visalo

906
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,002
and urged his
immediate attention.

907
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,671
Though it was
his wife who decided

908
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:27,199
to take matters
into her own hands.

909
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,708
According to
my calculations,

910
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,815
you, uh,
your expenditures

911
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:42,047
are running about
2 1/2 times your income.

912
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:45,893
Against how much of our own
money we spend, is there?

913
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,820
Certainly not,

914
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,015
as long as
the collateral

915
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:51,156
this was merely
a courtesy on our part

916
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:54,662
however, if the rate
of spending continues,

917
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,926
you have only, perhaps,
a month and a half

918
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,866
before your savings
run out.

919
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,841
And then
we will have to talk.

920
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,341
That won't be necessary,
and could you do us a favor

921
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,013
and not send any more
of these letters?

922
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:10,053
My husband,
he works very hard.

923
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:12,018
He's under a lot
of pressure.

924
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:14,717
He don't need
this aggravation.

925
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,749
Really. Thank you.

926
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,095
You said a month
and a half, right?

927
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,741
She's a beauty!

928
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,884
Wait a minute.
Where are the singers?

929
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:46,984

947
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,269
You gotta admit,
you're spendin'

948
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,370
like there's
no tomorrow.

949
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,771

How 'bout you lose
all your savings?

952
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,379

954
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,879

Hey, buddy!

This your idea
of havin' respect?

970
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:41,904
Huh? You're makin'
a fool of yourself

971
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,270
in front of the
whole neighborhood.

972
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:46,139

with you, huh?

973
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,937
If I was makin'
thousands of dollars

00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:52,008
That's exactly
my point.

976
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:52,940
The only reason
you should be

977
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,214
dancin' around
like a monkey

978
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:57,112
is if you're
gettin' paid for it.

979
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,020
What did
you call me?

980
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,220
Oh, dry up.

981
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,391
No, no, wait
a minute.

982
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,889
You called me
a monkey?!

983
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,490
Oh, come on,
i was just kidding.

984
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,963
What, in front of
all your friends

985
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:11,531
you call me
a monkey, huh?!

986
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:12,929
In front of
my friends,

987
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,301
you're actin'
like a monkey.

988
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,169
Yeah, well you know
what that means?

989
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,267
That means you
married a monkey.

990
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:23,009
A monkey or someone
who marries a monkey?!

991
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,178
Idiot.

992
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:42,456
We got a winner here.
Winner here.

993
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,590
Nice shot, pal.

994
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:47,925
What are ya
gonna have?

995
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,532
You know, what
do kids like?

996
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,595
Boy or girl?

997
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:52,603
Boy.

998
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:57,344
They like soldiers,
guns...All of that crap.

999
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,553
Junior, give
the man a gun.

1000
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:19,634
Visalo. Uh, I brought
somethin' here.

1001
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,301
A little gift.

1002
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,544
I got this at
the amusement park.

1003
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,667
Aah!

1004
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,072
Hey, what the hell?

1005
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:33,483
What--no, no, it's fake.
It's for the kid.

1006
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,321
You brought that
for my baby?

1007
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:50,034
Yeah, well, what--
what's the matter?

1008
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,658
What are you up to?

1009
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:54,103
Well, nothin', I just
figured I'd drop by

1010
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,428
and bring you
a little gift.

1011
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,203
Just like that.

1012
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:58,501
Um, if you must know,

1013
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:00,103
me and the wife,
we had a fight,

1014
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,944
and, well,
it was nothin' big,

1015
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,710
but I was just, uh,
wanderin' around,

1016
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,678
so, that's why
you did this.

1017
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:08,308
You wanted a little
place to come to

1018
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:11,283
whenever you and your wife
were on the outs?

1019
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,652
You're just like
all of them.

1020
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,650
All you Italians.

1021
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,352
You're all just
a race of pimps.

1022
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,654
You'd prey on a dying nun
if it suited you.

1023
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,516
God, don't say that.

1024
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:22,725
Go away.

1025
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,498
What's goin' on here?
What are you doin'?

1026
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:29,027
Whatsa matter
with you, huh?

1027
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,638
Fuckin' idiot, you're
a fuckin' pimp now?

1028
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,668
You're a monkey.
You embarrass people.

1029
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,984
Now, you're over here
with Jack--Jack itch.

1030
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,078
Fuckin' Jack itch.

1031
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,347
You bastard!

1032
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:49,393
I'll leave
tomorrow.

1033
00:49:49,387 --> 00:49:50,717
I'll pay for
everything, I will!

1034
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,522
I don't want
you to leave.

1035
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,193
Don't you think
i know that?

1036
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:55,562
No, that ain't why!

1037
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,100
Why, then?!

1038
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:02,497
I just want
to talk to someone.

1039
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,604
What's the matter
with you?

1040
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,235
I don't know.

1041
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,019
Look, get up here

1042
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,789
before some of
the neighbors see you.

1043
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,634
Buddy: I get these
uniforms made up, right,

1044
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:32,557
with, um, the name
of the business on them,

1045
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:35,463
and i--i show them
to her

1046
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,226
as soon as I get them,
and she says--

1047
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:39,065
you know what she says?
She says,

1048
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,240
"buddy, who are you
gonna sell these to

1049
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,709
when it goes out
of business?"

1050
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,180
You all right now?

1051
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,680
I'm, uh--yeah, listen,
I'm real sorry.

1052
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,822
I haven't done that
since I was a--

1053
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,149
a little kid, you know.

1054
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:57,454
Maybe even before that.

1055
00:50:57,455 --> 00:51:00,155
I've done a lot of it
myself lately.

1056
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,758
Yeah, well,
you're a broad.

1057
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,059
You're supposed to cry.

1058
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,562
I'm sure things'll
get better for you.

1059
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:11,395
You heard of
Julius larosa, right?

1060
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,472
No.

1061
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,440
Julius larosa,

1062
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,109
that big singing star

1063
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:19,677
on Godfrey's,
uh, TV show.

1064
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,537
Used to be, anyway.

1065
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,806
I've never had
a television.

1066
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:25,205
No kidding.

1067
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:27,316
Well, that could've
been me.

1068
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,188
Yeah, that was
my big shot.

1069
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,847
Godfrey saw me singing
when I was in the army,

1070
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:34,586
and he said,
"when you get out,

1071
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,762
you come and see me."

1072
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:41,162
I told estelle.
She said no.

1073
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,865
So you didn't do it?

1074
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,804
I thought
Italian men did

1075
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,643
whatever
they pleased.

1076
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,139
Yeah, well,
ever since then

1077
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:54,411
that's been
the way it goes, but--

1078
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,445
you know, I never--

1079
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,747
I never got
that kind of break

1080
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:59,848
thrown my way again.

1081
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:02,621
You know, so I figured
the least I could do

1082
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,490
if I'm not
a big singing star

1083
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:07,719
is I can be my own boss.

1084
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,555
So, I tell estelle.

1085
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,162
She says no.

1086
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,404
I go ahead,
i do it anyway.

1087
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:18,729
It don't work out.

1088
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:21,396
It hasn't yet.

1089
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,606
Uh, ahem. I'm gonna
leave you alone.

1090
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:30,754
Um, I'm--

1091
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:31,808
you sure
you're all right?

1092
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,446
Yeah, yeah. Whew!
Of course, yeah.

1093
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:37,322
I'm gonna fix that window
for you tomorrow.

1094
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,791
I'd appreciate it.

1095
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,723
And, uh, look,
I'm really sorry

1096
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:43,926
that I brought
such a stupid gift.

1097
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:45,688
Oh, well, they say

1098
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,696
it's the thought
that counts.

1099
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,795
Yeah.

1100
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,270
And, uh, look,

1101
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:56,713
I'm, um...

1102
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,837
I'm not this way
all the time, you know.

1103
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:02,613
I mean, um, crying
and talking and...

1104
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,353
You know, I'm just
like anyone else

1105
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:10,719
I'm afraid I don't
believe that, Mr. visalo.

1106
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:21,856
6:00, nino's,
don't forget!

1107
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,396
Ok! 6:00,
nino's.

1108
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:26,572
We'll be there!

1109
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,836
Chip: What am I gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

1110
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,211
What? He don't open
for another hour.

1111
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,741
He'll open up for us.
Come on, buddy.

1112
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,405
You know what?
On second thought, chip,

1113
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:38,484
I've got something
i gotta do. Errands.

1114
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:39,822
Errands?
It's a beautiful day.

1115
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:40,817
Let's go sit in a bar.

1116
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:41,878
I gotta find
these nails.

1117
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:42,916
They're
special nails.

1118
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,250
I can't find them
anywhere.

1119
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:46,485
No, that's all right.
I'll do it myself.

1120
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,690
You know, you helped me
enough, chip.

1121
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:49,892
Well, go get your nails
and come get hammered.

1122
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:50,864
All right.

1123
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:51,961
You know
where I'll be.

1124
00:53:51,963 --> 00:53:52,863
Yes, I do.

1125
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,833
I'll see you later.
Ok.

1126
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,902
Buddy: Mr. cicco
seen the kid?

1127
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:05,835
You tell me, all right?
I'll take care of him.

1128
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:08,913
We both appreciate it,
Mr. visalo.

1129
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,413
Yeah.

1130
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,914
So, has he got
a name?

1131
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,246
There was
no birth certificate,

1132
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,521
so there was
no need for a name.

1133
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,789
Well, jeez, if he
doesn't have a name,

1134
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:20,017
he's not a real
person legally.

1135
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:21,394
The same with
a birth certificate.

1136
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,632
They don't cost much
money, you know.

1137
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,358
What does it matter?

1138
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:26,503
Well, I mean,
you said

1139
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:27,757
you didn't want
to give him away.

1140
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,525
If that's the case,
then you ought to

1141
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,803
make him a legal
person, that's all.

1142
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:36,372
He's not getting a name
from me, Mr. visalo.

1143
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,384
I have to let him go.

1144
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,619
Wait a minute. You're
gonna get rid of him?

1145
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,850
What difference does
it make to you?

1146
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:52,594
Well, I don't know.
I mean, i--i thought

1147
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,690
it was kind of brave
keeping him.

1148
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:57,862
It showed
some balls.

1149
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:00,062
Excuse me. I mean--

1150
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,804
I don't know.
I was thinking

1151
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:02,929
maybe you and me,
we kind of got

1152
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,603
something in common
that way, you know.

1153
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:06,943
That's all.

1154
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:11,067
Are you making a pass
at me, Mr. visalo?

1155
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,675
What?

1156
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:15,937
Heh! You make me laugh.

1157
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,420
No, no, I wasn't
making a pass at you.

1158
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:20,577
If I was making
a pass at you,

1159
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,424
you'd know I was
making a pass at you.

1160
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,350
Don't flatter
yourself, huh?

1161
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:25,715
I think you like
your meat

1162
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:29,433
I think you should
probably leave.

1163
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:32,657
Yeah, you know what?
I probably should.

1164
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:36,903
I mean, who are you?
Miss morals of 1956?

1165
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,401
What the hell?

1166
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:40,842
Making
a pass at you.

1167
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,738
Hey, let me tell
you something, ok?

1168
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,670
I've been married
11 years.

1169
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:48,035
You're the one who
done that, not me.

1170
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,475
Christ!

1171
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,050
Mr. visalo!

1172
00:55:55,452 --> 00:56:00,022
I'm not used to people
doing good by me.

1173
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,025
Ah, skip it.

1174
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:09,832
Look, uh,

1175
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,804
look, you need
any money?

1176
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:13,602
For food, I mean.

1177
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:17,714
My sister sent me some.

1178
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,945
That's plenty.

1179
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,885
Mary: And 2 boxes
of...

1180
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,561
Ron-zani?

1181
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,159
What kind?

1182
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:38,591
What kind you got?

1183
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:39,996
Macaroni,
Linguini,

1184
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,767
capellini,
fettuccine.

1185
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:46,467
Yes, thank you.

1186
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:51,107
Buddy: Hey, what
do you think, huh?

1187
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:55,608
Buddy's tavern
or buddy's place?

1188
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,677
Buddy's tavern?

1189
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,061
Narrator:
That's the first time

1190
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,996
I remember
seeing buddy.

1191
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:20,902
How are you?

1192
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,610
And a bottle of--

1193
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,949
sh...Chi...

1194
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,093
Shanty.

1195
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,031
Chianti.

1196
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:51,474
Thank you.

1197
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,209
This is delicious.

1198
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:59,168
I don't normally
eat so much.

1199
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:00,606
Buddy:
Yeah, I noticed.

1200
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:03,011
You gotta keep up
your strength.

1201
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:05,513
Mmh.

1202
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:07,116
I can't cook like you.

1203
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,947
Actually, I'm not
a very good housewife.

1204
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:12,194
Yeah, I noticed
that, too.

1205
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:14,919
When I was up in
your house, I mean.

1206
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:17,655
I don't know why
Jim married me.

1207
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,561
Well, I mean I know why,

1208
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:23,804
but he wasn't
satisfied for long.

1209
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:26,901
Why'd you marry him?

1210
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,944
He was a friend
of my father's.

1211
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,870
When my father
was dying,

1212
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:33,036
I asked him
what I could do

1213
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:34,113
to make him happy.

1214
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:37,251
He told me to marry Jim,
so I did.

1215
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,678
I was 14.

1216
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,853
14?

1217
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,916
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

1218
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,761
Yeah.

1219
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,660
My husband...

1220
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:59,736
Had his own way
of diverting himself from me.

1221
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,567
After a while,
i suppose I needed

1222
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:03,172
a way for myself,

1223
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:06,213
and I don't like
to drink.

1224
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,913
Yeah, but why
with a...

1225
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,184
Well,
whoever it was.

1226
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,721
Is it really so hard
for you to understand?

1227
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,748

What?

1264
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:34,017
I just want
you to know...

1265
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:34,947
I didn't kiss you

1266
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,892
'cause I expect
anything.

1267
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,431
Yeah, well,

1268
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:46,827
it takes 2 to tango, huh?

1269
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:56,096
It's getting
dark out, huh?

1270
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,966
Must be late.

1271
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:02,975
Nino's at 6:00.
Jesus!

1272
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:21,027
Hey, Mary!

1273
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,580
Um, visalo?

1274
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:41,152
You almost got
killed over that.

1275
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,991
Excuse me. I'm gonna go
to the men's room.

1276
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,858
I mean, I thought
i looked bad.

1277
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:50,928
Buddy, come on!

1278
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:52,258
Where the fuck
you been?

1279
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,932
How long does it take
to get nails?

1280
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,061
Hey, I was--whoa!
You've been drinking?

1281
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,196
I'm fucking
tanked, man.

1282
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,071
I was at Angelo's
all afternoon

1283
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:00,069
waiting for you.

1284
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,200
So, you've been
eating or something?

1285
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:04,106
What? Oh, just a snack.

1286
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:05,107
Look, where are
the girls?

1287
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:07,578
They're in the back.
Come on, man.

1288
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:09,108
Jesus.

1289
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:10,082
Hey, hey!

1290
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,250
Look what
the wind blew in?

1291
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:13,378
Sorry
I'm late there.

1292
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,353
Hello.

1293
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,451
Hello. Hey.

1294
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:17,953
All right.

1295
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,445
I ordered you
the calamari.

1296
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:21,116
I know how much
you love that.

1297
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:24,164
All the goodies
that we got for you.

1298
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:25,961
It was half off
on all the socks,

1299
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,003
the underwear.
It was great.

1300
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:28,127
Underwear?
Lucky me, huh?

1301
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:31,071
Wait'll you see
the flannel jackets

1302
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:31,998
we got you.

1303
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:33,072
Flannel jackets?

1304
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:35,970
Oh, nice, nice.

1305
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,208
Who's that?

1306
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,941
He works
at the bank.

1307
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:44,646
Oh, yeah? What
are you doing

1308
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:46,508
going
to the bank?

1309
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:47,976
Why can't I go
to the bank?

1310
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:49,115
Well, you got
no reason to go

1311
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,189
to the bank.
You don't get

1312
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:52,087
a paycheck.
Here, salute.

1313
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:53,219
Salute.

1314
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,593
I wouldn't want
to intrude.

1315
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:59,532
Mr. brancaccio, this is
my husband buddy.

1316
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,929
Hey, how are you?

1317
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:05,172
I just wanted
to apologize again.

1318
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:06,468
Don't mention it.

1319
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:08,440
W-w-wait, what are
you talking about?

1320
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:11,008
Nothing, honey.
Thank you.

1321
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,568
No, no, you were right,
Mrs. visalo.

1322
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:15,006
There's no law against
the amount of money

1323
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:18,082
and it's really none
of our business.

1324
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,621
Look,
we're eating here, ok?

1325
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,555
What the hell,
huh, estelle?

1326
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:32,961
I'll tell you later.

1327
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:36,003
No, no,
you tell me now.

1328
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,129
They sent a letter,
the bank.

1329
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:38,634
They said we were
overspending

1330
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:39,965
or something,
i don't know.

1331
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,300
So, I was passing by
and went in,

1332
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:44,005
and I told them to mind
their own business.

1333
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:45,137
Ok?

1334
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:47,612
The bank sent <i>you</i>
<i>a letter?</i>

1335
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:50,051
To you.
I opened it by mistake.

1336
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:51,077
So why didn't
you tell me?

1337
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:54,221
Because I didn't want
you to worry.

1338
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,586
Excuse me.
Come here, will you?

1339
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,990
Mmph.

1340
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,027
Uh, tell me
what's going on.

1341
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,160
Buddy, what is
the big deal?

1342
01:06:08,165 --> 01:06:09,495
It's none of
his business.

1343
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,269
Let him talk,
all right?

1344
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,028
What's with this
letter stuff?

1345
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:14,266
I only wanted
to help.

1346
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:16,401
Our letter upset
your wife.

1347
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,336
We try to keep an eye

1348
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,511
on our first-time
homeowners.

1349
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:22,009
Nothing.
Our spending is outdoing

1350
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:23,282
our savings
or something.

1351
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,380
I believe it was
by 2 1/2 times.

1352
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:29,324
Wow.

1353
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,419
No, no, that's
not ok, ok?

1354
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,990
Why don't you
tell me that?

1355
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,049
Just eat your dinner,

1356
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:35,056
and we'll talk
about it later, ok?

1357
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:36,518
Listen, I got
a right to know.

1358
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:38,086
After all,
I'm a homeowner.

1359
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,095
Oh, here we go.
The big shot homeowner.

1360
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,057
Ok, so what did
she say to you?

1361
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:45,025
Mind his business, that
you know what you're doing,

1362
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,695
and that he
shouldn't worry, ok?

1363
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:48,603
Yeah, damn right.
That's right.

1364
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:50,035
Yeah, it's none
of your business.

1365
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,010
I know
what I'm doing.

1366
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:53,168
My apologies again.

1367
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,176
All right.

1368
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,437
Calm down.

1369
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,152
Can I have
the cheese?

1370
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,059
2 1/2 times!

1371
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:10,128
How come you don't tell me
something like that?

1372
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:12,087
Because you're
the big shot homeowner.

1373
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,055
You ought to know.
And you know what?

1374
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:15,404
If you don't,
it serves you right.

1375
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:17,729
You don't know nothing
about owning a house

1376
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:20,204
or running some bar, ok?
You know, buddy,

1377
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,643
you don't just
do these things

1378
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,168
because you feel
like it.

1379
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:24,513
You gotta have
the brains for it.

1380
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:26,268
Oh, ok, so what
are you saying?

1381
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:27,406
I don't go no brains?

1382
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:30,211
Buddy, I was just trying
to look out for you.

1383
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,053
I was trying
to help you, buddy.

1384
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,080
I bought a house,
right?

1385
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:35,284
That's gotta take
some brains.

1386
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:38,515
Narrator: The argument
was legendary, epic.

1387
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:39,822
I am stupid, and
I'm embarrassing.

1388
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:41,163
I'm ignoring you.
I'm eating.

1389
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:43,088
I'm ignoring you.
Watch this.

1390
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,793
Watch this.
I'm ignoring you.

1391
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:47,095
What do you mean
you did it for us?

1392
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:48,057
We're almost broke,

1393
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,095
and you don't
tell me about it?

1394
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,770
I didn't want to see
you fail again.

1395
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:53,798
Narrator: It went on
far into the night,

1396
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:56,104
encompassing virtually
every aspect

1397
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,136
of the 11-year union

1398
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,140
between buddy
and estelle visalo.

1399
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:00,412
This is not
our house.

1400
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,340
Why are you
making us do this?

1401
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,105
Wasn't everything ok?

1402
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,484
Don't you want to
better yourself?

1403
01:08:05,482 --> 01:08:07,082
I mean, don't you
want to do something

1404
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:07,824
with your life?

1405
01:08:07,818 --> 01:08:09,648
Like what, buddy?
Like what?

1406
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:12,123
Serving drinks
to a lot of bums, huh?

1407
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,322
You want to turn me
into a barmaid?

1408
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:15,594
Is that what
you want to do?

1409
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,492
Jesus, estelle, we own
our own business.

1410
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:21,825
We own our own home.
I mean, Jesus, estelle,

1411
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:24,772
I mean, this is America.
Where you living?

1412
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,198
This is the point.

1413
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:27,843
Most women, they want
their husbands

1414
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:30,438
you, you'd be happy
if we stayed back in--

1415
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,870
back where
we belong, buddy,

1416
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,435
not making fools
of ourselves,

1417
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,614
not having everybody

1418
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,512
laugh behind
our back.

1419
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:38,784
By who? Who?

1420
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,522
Your stupid friends?
My stupid friends?

1421
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:42,848
Who the fuck cares, huh?

1422
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:44,893
I got something
they ain't got.

1423
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:47,118
It's a crime for me
not to use what I got.

1424
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:48,624
What do you think
you got that's worth

1425
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,785
throwing away
our futures on?

1426
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,494
I've got talent!

1427
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:54,256
I could be
somebody, baby!

1428
01:08:54,264 --> 01:08:55,434
I could run my own life

1429
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:56,762
instead of
having to answer

1430
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,626
to some creep bastard
who's got a sign

1431
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,765
that says "supervisor"
on his desk.

1432
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:04,240
Buddy, your ideas,
they don't work.

1433
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:07,241
They haven't yet.

1434
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,277
But this time, they will.

1435
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,520
Why should they?
They never did before.

1436
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:18,547
Because I'm gonna make
it work, no matter what!

1437
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:19,917
Narrator:
"No matter what"

1438
01:09:19,923 --> 01:09:21,893
meant buddy needed
more money

1439
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:23,632
to spend
at this present rate.

1440
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:25,827
So you see, it's
just not possible

1441
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,299
on the wage
that you earn

1442
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:28,897
to make these
expenditures.

1443
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,529
Yeah, but it's just
till the bar's set up.

1444
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:32,425
Once it's open,

1445
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:33,835
I'll be
in the dough.

1446
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,497
Like with
the pizza store?

1447
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,905
Brancaccio: At this rate,
it doesn't look like

1448
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:39,367
you'll have
enough to finish.

1449
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:42,836
Why don't we just
rent out the downstairs?

1450
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,306
The bar's
half-built.

1451
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,954
So, then we only have
half a bar to pull out.

1452
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:49,750
Perhaps you could
postpone construction

1453
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:52,253
on the bar.

1454
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,886
Screw it.

1455
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:57,532
I'll work
the night shift.

1456
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:58,857
And when are
you gonna sleep?

1457
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,802
When the bar's open.

1458
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:02,597
Are we
done here?

1459
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:04,629
Narrator: And so,
as the working men

1460
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:06,504
looked forward
to the happiest part

1461
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:09,843
a drink at the local bar
with their friends,

1462
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,469
buddy prepared
to pay the price

1463
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:14,914
for his future
independence.

1464
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,877
Hey, one minute!

1465
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,621
Come on, get that
drill in there

1466
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,977
and joint it
to the semi.

1467
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,786
You'll get used to it.

1468
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,988
These day shift guys
start to look like suckers

1469
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:30,961
waking up at dawn
every morning.

1470
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:32,491
See, that's the best part.

1471
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,655
We get to go
to sleep at dawn.

1472
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,234
Dawn, yeah, yeah.

1473
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:39,803
You shift the shift
into the sliding machine.

1474
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:42,003
Make sure it's
a smooth flow,

1475
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:43,735
and then turn it around,

1476
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:44,670
then get it up,

1477
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,444
and then bring
it down again,

1478
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:47,843
but don't you breathe it,

1479
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:48,944
because if you breathe it,

1480
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,605
it's gonna get
in your lungs,

1481
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:52,954
and then we're gonna
have to replace you,

1482
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:55,879
not to mention the fire
when the gas gets in it.

1483
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:57,485
Ok, give it the button.

1484
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:00,657
Every minute,
set, set, you set.

1485
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:04,327
Go! Go, go,
go, go, go! Yeah!

1486
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,397
You know who's a grumbler?
My brother-in-law Pete.

1487
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:11,297
He does not appreciate
a goddamn thing.

1488
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:14,441
Look around you. How
beautiful this world is.

1489
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,897
You know, I don't
remember the last time

1490
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,835
I was awake
at 3:30 in the morning.

1491
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:19,911
You know, I don't
remember when I wasn't.

1492
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:22,709
Hey, how about
a couple...

1493
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:25,012
I know a place
that stays open.

1494
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:27,275
Rain check, huh?

1495
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:29,784
Ok, catch you later.

1496
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,916
See you tomorrow.

1497
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:05,418
Hey, Mary?

1498
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,573
You must be tired.

1499
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,943
I gotta do
what it takes.

1500
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:28,982
I figure she don't want me
to have my own bar,

1501
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:30,108
that's fine with me.

1502
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:33,683
She'll get used to it
eventually.

1503
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,923
See, the trouble
with estelle is

1504
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:38,049
she don't like failure.

1505
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:40,924
But with her,
it's like a disease.

1506
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:43,564
I don't want
to make you think

1507
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,990
something bad about her.

1508
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:47,804
She takes great care
of me and all.

1509
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:49,597
You don't seem
like the kind of man

1510
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:52,129
that needs
taking care of.

1511
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:57,036
Yeah, well, this one
can't go in the tank

1512
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,940
like all the others.

1513
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:00,512
It won't.

1514
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,680
We're all meant

1515
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:04,808
for something particular.

1516
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:06,854
This is what
you're meant for.

1517
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,980
You think so, huh?

1518
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:11,985
I know so, Mr. visalo.

1519
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:14,488
Hmm.

1520
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:18,527
I found an adoption agency
for the baby.

1521
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:22,928
They said they don't mind
what he looks like.

1522
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:25,572
I guess
they just must be

1523
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,998
starting out
or something, huh?

1524
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:33,035
It means I can stay
with my sister.

1525
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,442
When?

1526
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:36,814
A week.

1527
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:38,712
Maybe with the money
you'll save

1528
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:40,975
you won't have to
work so hard.

1529
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:42,524
Yeah, I suppose
so, but--

1530
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:45,119
it means I can try
and start over again

1531
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,591
like nothing
ever happened.

1532
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:48,689
Now, why you
gonna do that?

1533
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,431
I mean, maybe you're
never gonna want

1534
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:51,827
to tell anyone
what happened,

1535
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:54,798
but you can
remember it,

1536
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:57,568
just yourself.

1537
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:01,867
No, I can't.

1538
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,811
I guess it's a little
easier that way, huh?

1539
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:10,548
A lot easier.

1540
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:16,449
Well, in that case,
if you and me

1541
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,053
were to spend
some time together,

1542
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:21,224
you would just
forget about it anyway,

1543
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:23,834
and you know me,
I'd never tell.

1544
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:27,927
I mean, it would
be a lot easier,

1545
01:14:27,931 --> 01:14:31,201
just like you said.

1546
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,574
Why--

1547
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:37,000
why do you want me,
Mr. visalo?

1548
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,910
'Cause I got
a feeling about you

1549
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:43,209
I never felt before,

1550
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:46,113
not even with my wife.

1551
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:48,115
I mean, it's not
that I don't love her,

1552
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:51,187
even though she pisses
me off all the time.

1553
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:55,187
I don't know.
It's just this feeling.

1554
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:59,928
I've been
a good husband 11 years.

1555
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:02,828
I figure one week

1556
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,732
wouldn't really matter.

1557
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:12,073
I've been a bad girl
my whole life.

1558
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:17,075
I don't suppose a week
would matter to me, either.

1585

for 2 years.
He still ain't used to it.

1586
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:17,965
They say that ain't
healthy, you know.

1587
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,227
That working
all night,

1588
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:20,695
sleeping all day.

1589
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:22,343
How about
sleeping 2 hours

1590
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,268
and then going
back to work?

1591
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:26,743
I swear to god,
if he don't quit,

1592
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:27,883
I'm gonna make him.

1593
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:29,107
It's bad
for his health.

1594
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:30,982
It was worse
before the unions.

1595
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,680
Then they made them
work 6:00 to 6:00.

1596
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:34,823
My Harry used
to get home

1597
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,247
just in time
for me to wake up,

1598
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:37,992
get dressed,
and go to work.

1599
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,287
Back when
i had to work.

1600
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:41,718
I wouldn't let chip
work those hours.

1601
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:43,394
Unless
he wanted to open up

1602
01:17:43,393 --> 01:17:46,063
his own bar, huh?

1603
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,229
Well, what happened
after the unions?

1604
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:51,172
Used to be
6:00 to 6:00,

1605
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,827
now it's 6 P.M.
to 3 A.M.

1606
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,996
That's why we voted
for impastado.

1607
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,206
He made changes.

1608
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:00,007
That was the first
time I ever voted.

1609
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,239
You can't live on
those kind of hours.

1610
01:18:08,718 --> 01:18:12,288
That he husband was
simply not talented enough

1611
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:15,258
enterprising enough
to be a businessman,

1612
01:18:15,258 --> 01:18:17,188
or intelligent enough
to be anything

1613
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,863
but a factory worker.

1614
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,709
She also never doubted
his fidelity,

1615
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:34,307
his naive,
blundering honesty.

1616
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,382
How was work?

1617
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:42,352
Murder.

1618
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:52,461
That there might be
the slightest hint of deception

1619
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:54,932
in her husband.

1620
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,766
At one point, she thought
of how disappointing it might be

1621
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:03,240
if buddy were to simply
go to an all-night diner

1622
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,239
and sit there until 6:00.

1623
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,511
That would indicate
that he simply preferred

1624
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,440
to be anywhere but with her.

1625
01:20:03,099 --> 01:20:07,799
And those tomatoes--
not these, the strange ones.

1626
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:09,804
Sun-dried.

1627
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:12,166
Ok.

1628
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:24,051
Oh, and, uh, ricotta.

1629
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:27,593
<i>Ricotta secca.</i>

1630
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:40,971
You hurt yourself?

1631
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:41,940
Oh, I'm fine.

1632
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:43,338
This is a big bash,
though.

1633
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,339
Don't worry about it.

1634
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,314
Thank you.

1635
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,987
You live here?

1636
01:21:34,991 --> 01:21:37,391
Upstairs.

1637
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,400
How's the baby?

1638
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:44,297
He's fine.

1639
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:50,638
Well, I just came by
to see how you were doing.

1640
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,417
Working
the night shift?

1641
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,217
Eh, fuck 'em.

1642
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:04,349
I'm going home.

1643
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:05,623
Good for you.

1644
01:22:05,621 --> 01:22:07,251
Narrator:
He was lying, of course.

1645
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,186
He was going to see my mother,
who was hoping--

1646
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,262
praying that he would come by
early that night

1647
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,401
just to explain
the presence of his wife

1648
01:22:14,397 --> 01:22:16,097
in this
strange neighborhood.

1649
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:20,428
Mary, I have this great idea
for the bar.

1650
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,336
Every week,
I'm gonna have a cookout,

1651
01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:24,308
and everybody's gonna bring
their own recipe,

1652
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:26,007
and we'll do it
like a contest.

1653
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:26,608
Your wife--

1654
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:27,569
oh, she's gonna love it,

1655
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:30,376
she's gonna have to do
all the cooking.

1656
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:33,109
She came by.

1657
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:37,353
She--she came by here?

1658
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:42,123
She said she wanted
to see how I was doing.

1659
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:31,243
She's standing there
with a bag of groceries

1660
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,770
like the good
little housewife.

1661
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:35,605
She was probably
gonna cook for him.

1662
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:38,111
You mean the one
with the colored baby?

1663
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:40,754
Estelle: Yes, the one
with the colored baby,

1664
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,020
and he spent the night
with her, too.

1665
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,649
Oh! It's the worst
i ever heard,

1666
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:47,153
and my Harry slept
with some real <i>skivates--</i>

1667
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:49,316
I don't even know
who he is anymore.

1668
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:50,215
Are you gonna go back?

1669
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:51,556
I already
packed my stuff

1670
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,060
and moved back
to my mother's.

1671
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:54,402
Good.
Good.

1672
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:57,497
Besides, there's
hardly anything left.

1673
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,400
Huh?
What do you mean?

1674
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:01,472
I got
a little crazy, ok?

1675
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,270
Oh, Jesus, estelle,

1676
01:24:03,272 --> 01:24:04,812
after all that work
that you guys did.

1677
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:06,237
That's right.
After all that work

1678
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:08,582
so that he could go
do the hokey-pokey

1679
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:13,247
with some <i>putan</i>
<i>who'd sleep with a nigger</i>

1680
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:16,249
and have a baby!

1681
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,622
I mean,
am I that disgusting?

1682
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:19,551
No!
No!

1683
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,445
Shh. No.
No.

1684
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:22,356
Look, listen, listen.
Men...

1685
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:24,388
They got no sense
about this stuff.

1686
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,433
Some of them, they'll
sleep with anything.

1687
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:28,199
I mean it--
kids, animals--

1688
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:29,697
just as long as they got
someone at home

1689
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:31,428
who don't know about it.

1690
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:34,574
Listen, you guys,
you can't say nothing.

1691
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,570
Promise me,
teen, laur, please.

1692
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:39,712
Please, you can't say
nothing to nobody.

1693
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:42,838
I am so embarrassed.

1694
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,360
Buddy: You heard, huh?

1695
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:04,603
Down at the bar, yeah.

1696
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,504
How'd they find out?

1697
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:11,205
Estelle told the girls.

1698
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:14,877
They told the guys.
You know, that's that.

1699
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:20,305
Buddy:
I fucked up here, huh?

1700
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,649
Just tell me you
want her back, right?

1701
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:28,193
I mean, one time
in 11 years, what's that?

1702
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:32,160
So, uh, why don't you
give her a call?

1703
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:36,701
Now might be
a good time, you know?

1704
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:39,666
Buddy: Yeah.
Yeah, I'm listening.

1705
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:41,298
Narrator: Negotiations
were underway.

1706
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:45,243
Until he'd gone to my mother
and renounced her.

1707
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:48,441
That was the term
that was used...

1708
01:25:48,444 --> 01:25:49,484
"Renounce."

1709
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:50,808
Renounce?

1710
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,213
Well, what the hell
does that mean?

1711
01:25:52,214 --> 01:25:54,254
Narrator: Then she would
agree to see him,

1712
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,180
but at a neutral location...

1713
01:25:56,185 --> 01:25:58,515
The skyline diner.

1714
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:03,521
Hey, Mary!

1715
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:10,556
Buddy: Like a hurricane
hit that house--

1716
01:26:10,566 --> 01:26:14,166
that's what
it looks like.

1717
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:16,740
Oh, Christ.

1718
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:20,439
Visalo rides again.

1719
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:22,942
Christ.

1720
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:26,275
I'll be leaving tomorrow,

1721
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:31,392
so that should be the end
of your problems, really.

1722
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:38,333
I'm supposed
to renounce you,

1723
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:40,427
whatever that means.

1724
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:46,599
It means to make
like it never existed.

1725
01:26:46,602 --> 01:26:51,642
Is that what that means?

1726
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,640
Yeah, well, screw it.

1727
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:56,412
I'll say that I did,
but I don't.

1728
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,946
Thank you.

1729
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,845
Kid likes
a good show, huh.

1730
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:08,664
I suppose.

1731
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:16,856
Well, um...

1732
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:19,265
I guess since I'm
not gonna see you again,

1733
01:27:19,268 --> 01:27:21,298
I ought
to say something.

1734
01:27:21,303 --> 01:27:24,003
You don't have to.

1735
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:25,906
I know I don't have to.

1736
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:27,338
I want to.

1737
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:30,543
I have to go back
to my wife.

1738
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:36,319
Well, anyway,

1739
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:39,288
this is
what I'm thinking.

1740
01:27:39,288 --> 01:27:42,988
When you had
this situation and all,

1741
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:45,932
I had just done the hardest
thing I ever did.

1742
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:49,458
Nobody believed in me--
nobody...

1743
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:51,365
Except for my buddy chip,
you know,

1744
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:55,467
but, uh, what's he got
to lose, right?

1745
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:57,941
Anyway...

1746
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,940
Something about you,
what you did--

1747
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:04,344
I mean, everybody
was talking about it

1748
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:09,516
but--but it made me think
"what the hell?"

1749
01:28:09,518 --> 01:28:12,718
"What the hell?"

1750
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:15,921
You go on.
You know, things happen.

1751
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:19,064
The thing you did
was right for you--

1752
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:20,461
Mr. visalo,

1753
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:24,732
I think
you should leave.

1754
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,424
Hey, estelle.

1755
01:29:24,426 --> 01:29:26,556
Hi, buddy.

1756
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,863
Why they gotta be here?

1757
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:32,425
'Cause I want 'em here.

1758
01:29:32,434 --> 01:29:34,604
All right. All right.

1759
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:42,114
Ok.

1760
01:29:42,111 --> 01:29:45,411
First off, you gotta
believe something, ok?

1761
01:29:45,414 --> 01:29:48,624
It's the only time
this ever happened.

1762
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,047
I mean,
do you believe me?

1763
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:52,452
Yeah, I believe you.

1764
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:54,394
Ok.

1765
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,460
Ok, now the other thing.

1766
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:58,528
It was a big mistake.

1767
01:29:58,527 --> 01:30:01,697
Then why did you do it?

1768
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:05,097
I don't know why.

1769
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,530
Don't guess with me,
buddy.

1770
01:30:07,536 --> 01:30:12,136
You tell me why you would do
something like this to me.

1771
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:16,941
I know...

1772
01:30:16,945 --> 01:30:19,805
It had something to do
with us.

1773
01:30:19,815 --> 01:30:21,515
With us?

1774
01:30:21,517 --> 01:30:26,147
You've been riding me
real hard about the house, huh?

1775
01:30:26,155 --> 01:30:29,485
I mean, even you got to admit
that at times, you make it

1776
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:32,961
as though I'm trying
to ruin your life, you know?

1777
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:34,861
So what are you saying,
buddy?

1778
01:30:34,863 --> 01:30:37,133
Are you saying
it's my fault?

1779
01:30:37,132 --> 01:30:39,502
Huh?! Is that
what you're saying?!

1780
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:41,131
Are you saying
it's my fault?!

1781
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:43,666
No. Look,
i didn't say that, ok?

1782
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:46,572
Estelle, I'm just trying
to figure out myself

1783
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:50,905
let me make it easy
for you. Ok, you did it

1784
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:53,183
because you were feeling
like a big shot.

1785
01:30:53,182 --> 01:30:55,182
You did it
because you think

1786
01:30:55,184 --> 01:30:57,024
that you're somebody
you're not.

1787
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:58,449
You did it for the same
reason that you've

1788
01:30:58,454 --> 01:31:00,794
done every other crazy
thing in your life,

1789
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:03,689
because you think you're
somebody that you're not.

1790
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:06,832
Look...

1791
01:31:06,829 --> 01:31:08,729
You're no don Juan,

1792
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:11,100
so forget the singing,
forget that house,

1793
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:15,239
and we're going back
to my mother's.

1794
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:20,773
Buddy, I've been doing
some thinking, too.

1795
01:31:20,776 --> 01:31:24,176
About what?

1796
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,179
Well, you know
how I really...

1797
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:30,182
Never really liked--

1798
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:31,215
I mean, I liked it ok,

1799
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:35,820
maybe just
not as much...As you.

1800
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,532
What?

1801
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,003
Doing it.

1802
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,899
What are you talking,
here?

1803
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:51,172
Look, I've been thinking
about what you did,

1804
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:54,213
ok, and how men are
different from women.

1805
01:31:54,209 --> 01:31:57,539
You know, and they
have different needs,

1806
01:31:57,546 --> 01:32:00,876
and, uh...

1807
01:32:00,883 --> 01:32:03,523
If you feel...

1808
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:08,559
That you need
to go out and get it,

1809
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:11,527
then, maybe it's ok...

1810
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:15,027
I guess.

1811
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:21,574
I mean, it's not like you're
going anywhere, right?

1812
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:25,210
Wait, wait, now...So...

1813
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:28,637
You're not mad with me...

1814
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:31,144
About that?

1815
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:34,146
Look, buddy,

1816
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:38,119
if you wanted
to go fool around,

1817
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:42,590
I would have
looked the other way.

1818
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:45,231
I would have did that
for you.

1819
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:52,169
But for you to fool around
with that <i>putan...</i>

1820
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:54,627
That whore...

1821
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:58,666
That nigger-lover--

1822
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:01,878
look...

1823
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:06,607
Just try and have better
taste next time, ok?

1824
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:15,658
Buddy, what's wrong?

1825
01:33:15,657 --> 01:33:17,657
Buddy...

1826
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:20,959
Talk to me.

1827
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:28,229
What?

1828
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:30,336
Buddy, what?

1829
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:11,807
Of the people
he'd known all his life

1830
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:17,353
as his jailers,
until that moment.

1831
01:35:45,773 --> 01:35:48,243
He's just perfect.

1832
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:50,083
Mary: Thanks.

1833
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:52,008
I...Really
hadn't planned--

1834
01:35:52,013 --> 01:35:54,313
oh, don't--
don't explain.

1835
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:56,476
I mean,
we're not about that.

1836
01:35:56,485 --> 01:35:58,885
I know a couple
up in Woodstock

1837
01:35:58,887 --> 01:36:02,217
that would
just adore him. Yes.

1838
01:36:02,224 --> 01:36:05,134
They're professors
at some small college,

1839
01:36:05,127 --> 01:36:07,287
and they specified
they want a baby

1840
01:36:07,295 --> 01:36:10,455
Mary: I was married
when I had him.

1841
01:36:10,465 --> 01:36:12,395
Woman: Oh,
that's even better.

1842
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,240
You know, we do this
thing once a month.

1843
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:18,197
On race and sex"

1844
01:36:18,206 --> 01:36:19,406
down at the new school.

1845
01:36:19,407 --> 01:36:22,437
You'd fit in perfectly.

1846
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:25,354
Mr. visalo.

1847
01:36:25,347 --> 01:36:28,107
Hey, how are you?

1848
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:29,916
I was just--

1849
01:36:29,918 --> 01:36:30,978
yeah. Figured.

1850
01:36:30,986 --> 01:36:33,486
Um, listen,
could i--

1851
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:36,358
could I talk to you
for a minute?

1852
01:36:36,358 --> 01:36:38,888
Well, we're almost done--

1853
01:36:38,894 --> 01:36:40,534
buddy: I mean now.

1854
01:36:40,529 --> 01:36:42,559
Before...

1855
01:36:42,564 --> 01:36:46,034
Could you excuse me?

1856
01:36:46,034 --> 01:36:48,944
Sure. Sure.

1857
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,069
Outside.

1858
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:01,212
My wife and I,
we were trying to make up,

1859
01:37:01,216 --> 01:37:04,376
and all of a sudden,
i realized that,

1860
01:37:04,386 --> 01:37:08,386
see, well, I never
really understood her...

1861
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:11,186
What she wanted from me

1862
01:37:11,193 --> 01:37:13,363
or me from her,

1863
01:37:13,361 --> 01:37:15,331
I don't know, but, uh...

1864
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:17,260
It wasn't her fault.

1865
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:20,465
I hope everything
worked out.

1866
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:24,369
Really?

1867
01:37:24,372 --> 01:37:25,442
Of course.

1868
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:29,380
Well, no, don't say that.

1869
01:37:29,377 --> 01:37:32,477
Why would you say that?

1870
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:36,378
I don't know.

1871
01:37:36,384 --> 01:37:40,454
I just assumed that's what
you wanted me to say.

1872
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:43,359
I walked out.

1873
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:46,288
Love of god.

1874
01:37:46,294 --> 01:37:48,364
Because of you.

1875
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:51,403
Because I got
this feeling about you.

1876
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:52,429
I don't think you know--

1877
01:37:52,434 --> 01:37:54,274
i--i know
it's a little strange,

1878
01:37:54,269 --> 01:37:56,199
but I think maybe
I'm in love with you.

1879
01:37:56,204 --> 01:38:00,214
You don't know what
you're doing, Mr. visalo.

1880
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:03,408
I know I don't know
what I'm doing.

1881
01:38:23,597 --> 01:38:27,967
I've got to take care
of upstairs--

1882
01:38:27,969 --> 01:38:33,569
yeah, yeah. Um, where'd
you find that broad?

1883
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:37,335
Social services.

1884
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:40,405
Lose her.

1885
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:08,043
Narrator:
She had not expected

1886
01:39:08,043 --> 01:39:09,983
to stay in staten island...

1887
01:39:09,978 --> 01:39:11,948
And certainly not
in the house where she'd spent

1888
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:15,517
several very unhappy years
with her first husband...

1889
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:19,447
And certainly not with me.

1890
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:22,291
And the months
of working all day

1891
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,360
and rebuilding
buddy's tavern at night

1892
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:29,699
just in time for a festive
Christmas opening.

1893
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:42,277
Look what the wind
blew in.

1894
01:39:42,277 --> 01:39:43,477
How you doing, ang?

1895
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:46,378
Pretty good, you know.

1896
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:49,621

I'm gonna open next week,
Christmas Eve.

1899
01:39:56,658 --> 01:39:58,388
Oh, no shit, huh?

1900
01:39:58,393 --> 01:40:00,333
You're quite
a showman, buddy.

1901
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:03,328
You do things
in a big way, huh?

1902
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:11,172
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
you guys want to come down,

1903
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:14,372
you know, see the place.
I'm gonna sing.

Narrator: It couldn't
have been any other way.

1913
01:41:03,691 --> 01:41:06,461
The very act of bringing
my mother and myself

1914
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:08,661
into his home was blasphemy,

1915
01:41:08,663 --> 01:41:10,633
a rude rejection
of every value
