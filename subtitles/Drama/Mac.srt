1
00:00:02,518 --> 00:00:03,784
Coming up on Celebri Circus 3,

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,170
Rachel Ray and her
motorcycle jump of death

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,954
plus Alison Janney and Joey McIntyre

4
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:10,591
take on the trapeze from hell!

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,978
Pick up, Alex. Pick up. Pick up!

6
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:18,982
And we're back from commercial in one!

7
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,401
McIntyre, you're up in three.

8
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:21,435
Yeah, thanks.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,536
Dude, Joe, you're never
going to believe it.

10
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,521
Jerry Springer's out there
about to ride an elephant.

11
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:26,106
You're supposed to be my manager!

12
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,941
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all day.

13
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,276
Buddy, I've been slammed.

14
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,244
Don't buddy me.

15
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,662
What am I doing here?

16
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,280
Trapeze act, I don't know.

17
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:36,500
I mean on this silly
show, Celebri Circus.

18
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:39,420
We don't say no to primetime, Joe.

19
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,455
Fifteen million people
will be watching this.

20
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,723
I'm an actor, a good one.

21
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:43,957
No let me stop you right there.

22
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:45,175
You are a great actor.

23
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,543
Well they won't find
that out by watching

24
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,129
me catch Alison Janney by the ankles.

25
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:50,764
Stamos, do you mind?

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,966
We're trying to have
a serious conversation.

27
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:56,136
You are so hard on Stamos.

28
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:57,104
I'm putting my foot down.

29
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,273
No more reality, no more hosting gigs,

30
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:00,524
I want serious work.

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,009
Like the detective novels I optioned.

32
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:04,361
Yeah, I agree with you 100%.

33
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:05,529
That's why I'm gonna make the calls.

34
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:07,231
I'm gonna make it happen, trust me.

35
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:09,867
And now, with the death
defying motorcycle jump,

36
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,568
Rachel Ray!

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,960
All right, everyone stay calm.

38
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,246
It looks like Rachel's gonna be okay!

39
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:23,380
I'm gonna go make those calls.

40
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:24,882
Yeah, why don't you.

41
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,350
Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:30,187
I'm Joey McIntyre, you
know, the little guy

43
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:31,555
from New Kids on the Block.

44
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:33,673
- Since then, I've had my ups.
- _

45
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:35,609
- And I've had my downs. _

46
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,861
But I know I can make it
with the love of my family,

47
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,814
- hard work, and maybe better management.
- _

48
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:47,888
No! No cookies before dinner!

49
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,410
- Alex.
- Buddy!

50
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,778
You excited for the big meeting today?

51
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,913
Yes, I'm pumped!

52
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,114
I've been prepping all week.

53
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,232
This detective series
is perfect for HBO.

54
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,002
Slow your roll, Joe.

56
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:03,737
I didn't say it was with HBO.

57
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,706
I said it's like HBO.

58
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:08,074
- It's the Comfy Channel.
- The Comfy Channel?

59
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:09,293
I never even heard of that before!

60
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,044
It's because it just launched bro!

61
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,012
It's a brand new network.

62
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:14,131
They want to be the HBO for women.

63
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:16,133
I said no cookies before dinner!

64
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,935
Okay, whatever, the Comfy Channel.

65
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,219
I just want to get back to work.

66
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:20,420
Yeah, Joe, can I ask you something?

67
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,556
What's the rush right now?

68
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,391
Alex, I've been working
since I was a kid.

69
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:25,859
It's who I am.

70
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,195
And you know how I get
when I'm not working.

71
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,014
Plus, I'm doing school
pickups since the last tour.

72
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,868
Barrett even got me a
job jar which is great

73
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,288
because there's always something to do.

74
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,073
Dude, Barrett is right there, isn't she?

75
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,241
You're so screwed.

76
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:42,776
- Is that Alex?
- What up, B!

77
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,661
- Don't say hi.
- Joe, put Barrett on.

78
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,213
Uh, just text me the address,

79
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,998
- I'll see you at four.
- You can't be anywhere at four.

80
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,550
You have to take Reece to karate.

81
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,168
Oh, that's today?

82
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,669
This is why I'll never get married.

83
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,254
- You can't take him?
- Sure!

84
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,006
We can let the kids drive
themselves to the dentist.

85
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:57,307
Oh the dentist!

86
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,842
I can drive.

87
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:00,060
Or we can hitch hike.

88
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,846
If only we had a system
to track all this stuff.

89
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:04,765
Oh look!

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,966
A calendar!

91
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:06,984
Yeah.

92
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,736
Okay, can't they just
brush extra hard today?

93
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,137
I really got to make this meeting.

94
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:14,140
And they have teeth, which
I'd like them to keep.

95
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
Dude, just bring the Reece man along.

96
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,694
It's not that big of a deal.

97
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:20,614
You're sure? He's kind of a handful.

98
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,167
Yeah, it's a women's network, bro.

99
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,003
Chicks love kids.

100
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:33,961
Watch the vase.

101
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,012
Watch the vase!

102
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,298
Watch the vase. Watch the vase.

103
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,666
Oh! Reece man!

104
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:40,934
Uncle Alex!

105
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,973
Wait a... Really?

106
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:46,857
Come on, Joey he loves it.

107
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,942
Look at him.

108
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,893
You know what?

109
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:51,177
Do you have any... do
you have any crayons?

110
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:51,979
I got nothing, man.

111
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:52,946
You know what, this is fine.

112
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,513
Thank you.

113
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,148
Joey McIntyre.

114
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,701
Hi, I'm Sam's assistant, Soozie.

115
00:03:57,736 --> 00:04:00,871
That's one S to O's and a Z-I-E.

116
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:03,323
- Hey.
- Hi!

117
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,875
All right, Reece.

118
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,027
Listen, we're gonna color, okay?

119
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,578
And be nice to the nice man, okay?

120
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,047
All right, I'll see you in five minutes.

121
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,832
Thank you. Good.

122
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,533
You're not gonna leave
him here, are you?

123
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,218
Oh he's fine, he loves to color.

124
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,336
Oh!

125
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,143
If you hadn't guessed
it, I'm a Joey girl.

126
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:24,061
Ah.

127
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,178
I know I'm not supposed to wear buttons

128
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,713
to work but today was
a special occasion!

129
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,315
So I said to heck with it!

130
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,350
I make 'em myself.

131
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:36,239
- Do you want one?
- Oh, no I'm good.

132
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,825
I saw you in Rochester
in '94 and I swear

133
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,910
you looked right at me at the end of

134
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,111
"Please Don't Go Girl".

135
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,113
It's like you were reaching
directly into my chest

136
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,782
cavity and squeezing my heart
until I couldn't breathe.

137
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,835
Do you remember that?

138
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,672
- Maybe.
- Really?

139
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:53,707
He squeezes a lot of chest cavities.

140
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:55,241
Soozie!

141
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,094
Time to go in!

142
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,879
It's fine.

143
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,630
I mean mediocre is fine
if that's what you're...

144
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:01,715
It's regular water.

145
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,849
No I know it's regular water.

146
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,517
It's fine.

147
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,552
Joey Mac!

148
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,684
Paige Quan, VP of Development.

149
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,353
We are so pumped to
have you here at Comfy's.

150
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:13,556
Jan Candor, president of Comfy!

151
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,025
- Hi.
- Welcome Joseph!

152
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,397
- Right.
- Mm!

153
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:23,036
Oh, so sweet.

154
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:30,077
Glad.

155
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,745
Thank you.

156
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,380
- Joseph.
- I'm Alex, his manager...

157
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,999
I have been tasked
with transforming Comfy

158
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:39,953
into the vanguard women's channel.

159
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,621
And you're part of my vision.

160
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,761
Simply put, we love Joey...

161
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:49,730
- McIntyre.
- McIntyre.

162
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:51,031
What Sam is trying to say is that

163
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:54,000
we want to be in the Joey Mac business.

164
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,001
Awesome!

165
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:57,152
Well, I'm excited to
toss some ideas around.

166
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,689
The way you tossed Alison Janney
around in that circus show.

167
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,457
Ah, yeah.

168
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,159
- So good!
- Too soon.

169
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:06,045
It was truly, truly, inspiring.

170
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,029
You saw that, huh?

171
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,716
What I saw was an
undiscovered gold mine.

172
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:12,085
We were all just blown away
by your on screen presence.

173
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,553
So I had the idea...

174
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,037
Based on my original idea.

175
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:16,089
Which is mostly my idea.

176
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,423
It was mine, and then...

177
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:19,425
- I started with it.
- I did it and they ran!

178
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,210
Was incepted here.

179
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,212
I had research pull some old VHS tapes

180
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,565
of that time you filled
in for Carson Daly on TRL.

181
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,433
- You remember that?
- Uh...

182
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:28,568
How could we forget?

183
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:29,885
Vaguely, yeah.

184
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,437
We shared those clips
with the New York office.

185
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,388
New York City.

186
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:33,489
New York City.

187
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:37,944
And we all agreed that you are
exactly what we need for this network.

188
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:41,080
Joe, the 80's are huge with our demo.

189
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:42,498
That and weight gain.

190
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,900
We got some groundbreaking
events coming down the pipeline.

191
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,120
Our first event is a
movie of the week about

192
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,904
Corey Haim starring Corey Feldman.

193
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:50,906
We're calling it, "A Corey Story".

194
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:53,075
That rhymes, shows
that rhyme always work.

195
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:55,962
Why are you whispering?

196
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,464
Debbie Gibson will be
hosting a wine tasting show.

197
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:01,050
Which is interesting
because she doesn't drink.

198
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,019
That is her journey.

199
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:06,806
And now, we want you.

200
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,424
- For what exactly?
- What?

201
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,309
For your very own hour long show.

202
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,594
Awesome!

203
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:12,729
Yes.

204
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:16,149
As you know, I own the rights
to the Jeff Fisher crime novels.

205
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,951
Yeah, he does.

206
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,738
He owns all the rights, that guy.

207
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:24,574
You did tell them that, right?

208
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:25,541
I just did!

209
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:26,743
Jeff Richman? What is that?

210
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,378
Anyway, I think it
might be a perfect fit

211
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,631
for Comfy because the novels
are set in the 80's, so.

212
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,999
Can't wait to explore that.

213
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:36,002
But put a pin in it 'cause
we've got something even better!

214
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:38,588
Better.

215
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:42,642
We want to go to bed with you.

216
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,150
- Hello.
- Uh...

217
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,018
Excuse me?

218
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,319
Thought this was a G-rated network.

219
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:55,488
We want our viewers to curl up

220
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:58,474
and get cozy and comfy
with you on your own

221
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,860
late night talk show.

222
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,862
Done, sign him up!

223
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,947
A late night... a late night talk show?

224
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:06,315
Uh, so...

225
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:07,366
Not scripted?

226
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:08,785
That's... I don't... well...

227
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,652
Oh God no.

228
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,037
Well there could be skits and bits

229
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:11,987
that would be scripted.

230
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,372
Um, skits and bits.

231
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:14,990
Unscripted skits and bits.

232
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,292
Yeah, skits and bits, bits and skits.

233
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:19,345
And we could even probably
do a hybrid of the two.

234
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,847
Yeah, he loves that word.

235
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:23,099
Thank you very much for having me.

236
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,517
I really appreciate it.

237
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:25,668
You know, tell you what.

238
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,471
Why don't Joe and I discuss
and we'll get back to you.

239
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:29,889
- Great idea.
- Yeah.

240
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:31,357
- Circle back!
- Circle back.

241
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:32,558
- Circle back.
- Circle back!

242
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,843
Yes, let's circle back.

243
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:35,394
Thank you! Yeah.

244
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,980
This was great, thank you.

245
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,650
That went great.

246
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:44,403
Go Sam!

247
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,022
Circle back, I'll circle back.

248
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,207
Come on, don't be like that, Joe!

249
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,158
This show could work.

250
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:50,493
We said no more hosting gigs!

251
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,578
Yeah, it's not hosting, it's late night!

252
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,863
There's a big difference.

253
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:54,914
They are ga-ga over you, Joe!

254
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,467
They're gonna throw stupid
money in our direction!

255
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,885
It's not about the money,
it's about the work.

256
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,670
Okay, well then think about the work.

257
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:01,921
Joe, Joe, Joe, come on,
think about it, will you?

258
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:03,172
It's the best of both worlds!

259
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,258
You get out of the house,

260
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,311
and you still get to
see your kids everyday!

261
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:09,846
You really think they'd let me do*

262
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,013
my own skits and bits?

263
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:12,548
You see how long she hugged you for?

264
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,649
They love you, dude.

265
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,268
They bought a first class ticket aboard

266
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,569
the Joey Mac fun train.

267
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:18,154
Chugga-chugga-choo-choo, baby!

268
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,322
Where's this thing stopping?

269
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:21,357
Everybody's hearts if you want it to!

270
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,392
You could probably write
the whole thing if you want.

271
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:25,244
Written by Joey Mac, created by Joey Mac

272
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,112
and his best buddy Alex.

273
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,730
Everything you want is gonna happen.

274
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:29,582
You're creating it now?

275
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:30,733
I'm here with you.

276
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,752
Joe, with the amount of
money they're gonna throw you,

277
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:34,620
I can build that gazebo I always wanted.

278
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:36,289
And you know how bad
I wanted that gazebo!

279
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:37,507
Look me in the eyes.

280
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,926
Have I ever steered you wrong?

281
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,128
Don't answer that right now.
That's a rhetorical question.

282
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,346
Was he okay?

283
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,881
Yeah actually he was pretty quiet.

284
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,015
Thank you so much.

285
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,966
Come on Reecy.

286
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,017
Oh my God Reece.

287
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,602
What are you doing?

288
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,522
Oh, jeez. Reece come on!

289
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,928
Oh so embarrassing, Donnie.

290
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:01,448
Well what kind of an idiot
gives a sharpie to a little kid?

291
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,600
No, no, not that.

292
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:04,818
A talk show!

293
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,953
I want to be an actor,
not interview actors.

294
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:07,904
Who are you talking to?

295
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:09,573
Joey, he got offered his own talk show.

296
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,041
Well I think there's a
seat available on The View.

297
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,375
Well Joe, if you ask me.

298
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,793
I say do it.

299
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:14,828
I mean what do you got to lose?

300
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,047
If it sucks, nobody's
ever gonna see it anyway.

301
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,665
Who the hell has ever
heard of the Comfy Channel?

302
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,218
I love the Comfy Channel.

303
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,251
And you know our motto, Joe.

304
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:22,636
Don't be a slob.

305
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,054
... Be a slob, take the job.

306
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,555
You never know, it could lead to

307
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,307
bigger and better things anyway.

308
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:28,808
Maybe you're right.

309
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,977
I know I'm right.
Look at Talk Soup, Joe.

310
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,795
I mean those guys were talk show hosts,

311
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:35,031
went on to become big
actors, huge stars,

312
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,166
household names.

313
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,934
Both of them, Greg Kinnear,
and what's his name?

314
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:38,848
Who knows.

315
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,437
That's actually a very good point.

316
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:41,404
It is a good point!

317
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,089
God, this filter is awesome!

318
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,274
Look, I got to go, Joe.

319
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,139
All right?

320
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:46,860
Just trust me, take the job.

321
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:48,978
I think Whoopi would love him.

322
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,364
I don't know, they're both moody.

323
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,033
Alex.

324
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,251
Tell 'em I'm in.

325
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,119
Yeah, set the meeting.

326
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:58,955
Oh!

327
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,243
You both need to brush your teeth

328
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,862
before the doctor sees you.

329
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,381
Why, isn't that the dentist's job?

330
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,666
Oh it's like cleaning the house before

331
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:10,600
the cleaning lady comes.

332
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,435
It's just what you do.

333
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,436
Barrett!

334
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:15,395
Hey oh my God!

335
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,614
Mwah, mwah.

336
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,932
That purse makes me want to die!

337
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,100
How is Joe?

338
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,769
He's really good, very busy.

339
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:24,654
- Yeah.
- Hi Oliver!

340
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:26,039
I see you still have the head gear.

341
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:27,624
Yeah, just two more years right?

342
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,708
It's actually four.

343
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:30,109
Quinn, this dress!

344
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,128
Oh I know, right? It's a Monatague Clement.

345
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:33,496
But you probably saw it on Blake Lively,

346
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:34,998
'cause she wore it bestest.

347
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,383
Of course.

348
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,451
So your ears must be falling off

349
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,053
'cause I was just
working with Ann Hathaway

350
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:41,954
who adores you by the way.

351
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:42,955
Oh, she's so sweet.

352
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:44,057
Is she?

353
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:46,059
But we were just talking
about how much we miss you!

354
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:47,811
And you have to come
back to work for me.

355
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:48,676
Wow!

356
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,512
I mean, say anything, I'll do it.

357
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:50,647
Quinn, I loved working with you.

358
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:53,132
And I've been thinking about
going back into styling.

359
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:54,434
But...

360
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:57,270
I really need you please!

361
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,906
I'm up to my implants
in celebrities to dress.

362
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:01,074
Really, honestly, what can I do?

363
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,576
Well, I'd have to talk to Joe.

364
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:05,245
And I really want to.

365
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,496
Maybe I can make it work?

366
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:07,814
That's a yes, did you hear it?!

367
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,865
You did, didn't you?

368
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,368
Your ears are fine, just
your teeth are so messed up.

369
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,203
But you know what? Tomorrow, six A.M.

370
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,287
Don't be late or I'll fire you,

371
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:15,622
and then I'll rehire you.

372
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:16,506
Okay.

373
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,124
Bring me a latte, but no milk in it.

374
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,092
- Smooch smooch!
- Yes!

375
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,326
Come on.

376
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:20,993
Okay, bye.

377
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,512
Let's go get some pizza!

378
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:25,465
You can't eat it. But you
can watch Mommy smell it.

379
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,467
Hurray!

380
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:31,187
Babe, got some news!

381
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:32,856
- What's all this?
- It's so random.

382
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:34,391
I ran into Quinn today and she asked me

383
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:35,942
to start styling with her again.

384
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:36,860
Uh...

385
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:38,978
I thought we were gonna wait till...

386
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:40,447
Until the kids got a little bit older.

387
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,615
I know! But I couldn't pass this up!

388
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,484
I didn't know how much I missed it.

389
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,452
Hmm.

390
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,537
Well, I guess it's time
to look for a nanny.

391
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:50,123
But we decided one of us would
always stay home with the kids.

392
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:52,792
Yeah, that's what we said.

393
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:53,743
Um...

394
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:54,744
I should've talked to you before I said

395
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,463
yes but it happened so fast.

396
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:58,498
I... I just couldn't say no!

397
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,867
Eh, technically you could've said no

398
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:03,570
but you didn't, and that's great.

399
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,555
I got to start calling designers!

400
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,307
Thank God you're not working right now.

401
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:08,892
Yeah, not working.

402
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:10,176
I'm sorry.

403
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,178
How was the meeting at the Cozy Channel?

404
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:13,763
Comfy.

405
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:16,900
Uh, it was uh, it was fine.

406
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:17,851
Great hun.

407
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:21,982
And don't forget,
Reece, karate, Thursday.

408
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:24,724
Right here.

409
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,526
Gonna put it right on my forehead

410
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,278
so I won't forget, okay?

411
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:32,365
Please don't pass on this.

412
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,416
Dude it's your own show.

413
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,567
I can't believe you're
gonna turn this down.

414
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:35,535
I've been thinking about it,

415
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,270
Barrett's had my back for ten years.

416
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:38,404
It's her turn.

417
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,289
So you want me to tell 'em?

418
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:40,457
No, I should do it myself.

419
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:41,608
We'll be in and out quick.

420
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,583
Is it your birthday?

421
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:09,971
Uh, I'm really sorry about this, really.

422
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:14,725
And uh, we will be paying
for all the confetti, so.

423
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,076
I know it gets pricy, but we got it.

424
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:17,044
Joe's got it.

425
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:18,345
But we got it.

426
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,297
Well, we're obviously disappointed

427
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:23,601
that you're passing up
on what could be a huge

428
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:25,102
opportunity for you.

429
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:28,755
But we totally get
it, family comes first.

430
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,308
Guess I'll need your buttons back.

431
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,111
We just want you to be happy, right, Sam?

432
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:35,479
Yep.

433
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:36,614
Happy.

434
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:37,731
And if you wake up tomorrow,

435
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,533
realizing that you've
made a huge mistake,

436
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:41,435
our doors are always open.

437
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:44,455
Unless those doors are just
slammed shut in our face.

438
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:49,159
Well that's it, good luck in whatever

439
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:51,211
you attempt to achieve.

440
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:54,164
Once again, I'm very sorry and thank you

441
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,549
for the opportunity.

442
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:56,967
Yeah, and for the button.

443
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:59,803
It does not go unnoticed.

444
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:10,514
Shut it!

445
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,900
Leave it open.

446
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:16,867
So I'm gonna tell you what I like

447
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,205
and you write it down. Okay?

448
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,874
Got you.

449
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,376
Ew, j'adore, this.

450
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:23,844
Burn this, I never want to see it again.

451
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,580
And then send this and this to Olivia.

452
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,799
So is Joe pissed that I hijacked you?

453
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:30,551
No, he's been really supportive

454
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:31,686
about me going back to work.

455
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:32,920
Oh that's good.

456
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:34,755
He must really love doing daddy daycare.

457
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:35,806
'Cause I heard he passed on that show

458
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:37,943
- for the Comfy Channel.
- What?

459
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:39,143
Oh the Comfy Channel, it's like HBO

460
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:41,779
but without the dragons,
more bushes and more crying.

461
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:42,930
They don't wax there.

462
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,399
And I don't wax either,
I'm not a peasant, I laser.

463
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:46,734
So don't get me wrong but.

464
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:47,935
I know about the Comfy Channel.

465
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:49,937
What do you mean he passed on a show?

466
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,772
Oh I heard from my yoga-lates instructor

467
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,075
who is such a slut, she
heard it from another client

468
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,609
who like has really big mouth.

469
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:58,245
Did he... did he not tell you?

470
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,213
Oh my God.

471
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:00,881
I was going on and on
about how happy I was

472
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,500
he was gonna help out with the kids.

473
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,552
Well, that means he did it for you.

474
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:06,286
That's so romantic! Right?

475
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:08,422
Oh my God, look at this.

476
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:09,924
I would kill a baby for this.

477
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,809
I would puke on myself,
shower, then puke again.

478
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:13,561
Just look how cute this is!

479
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:14,895
Look at it move!

480
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,063
Will you send this to Emma?

481
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:17,315
- Roberts?
- No, the other one.

482
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,734
- Watson.
- No, this one.

483
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:22,770
- Got you.
- Yeah.

484
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:25,639
Don't write that down
though, 'cause you never know.

485
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:27,642
You know what? No, I hate it.

486
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:30,494
Don't!

487
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,363
Don't.

488
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,620
Just hear me out, Joe!

489
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:40,955
Look, I know you said no hosting.

490
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,456
But I got something that
you're really gonna love.

491
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:44,091
It's called Little Brother.

492
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,026
Why?

493
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:46,761
'Cause it's a show
about all little people

494
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:48,129
living in a tiny house.

495
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,430
America loves dwarves, Joe.

496
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:51,098
What does America
love more than dwarves?

497
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,551
Those dwarves living in tiny houses.

498
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,269
- Boom!
- What?

499
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:56,503
Tiny houses are very big right now.

500
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:58,723
Alex, I want to star in my own drama.

501
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,007
Oh you, you want a drama?

502
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:01,341
Well I got one for you, Joe.

503
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:03,844
It's about two waterpark security guards

504
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:08,232
who fight over the affection
of a sexy, young blonde.

505
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:09,349
January Jones?

506
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,901
Whoa, way too big.

507
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:12,953
I'm thinking Tara Ried on this one.

508
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,706
Oh!

509
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,041
Hello? Joe?

510
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,709
Joey McIntyre!

511
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,027
What the heck are you doing here?

512
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:21,045
Um...

513
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,863
I can't believe this!

514
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:25,032
I've been a huge fan for so long!

515
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,468
I had your doll, the
pillows, the sheets.

516
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:30,037
- I slept with you every night!
- Oh.

517
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,756
That sounded creepy, but...

518
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,540
No, that's pretty awesome.

519
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,810
I'm a pretty big fan of yours too.

520
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:36,894
What are you doing?

521
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,816
Um, oh I actually just
got offered to be a host

522
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:43,517
of this late night talk show.

523
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:46,854
Oh my God, you'd be perfect for that!

524
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:49,156
- Right?
- Yeah!

525
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,741
'Cause I kind of... you know,

526
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:54,578
I mean I'm good at all that
stuff like talking to people.

527
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:55,529
Yeah.

528
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:57,198
And interviewing...

529
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:59,500
Hey, hey!

530
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,118
Well I'd watch it every night.

531
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,903
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

532
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:05,756
Hey do you want to go get
some coffee or something?

533
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,141
Uh...

534
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:08,259
You know what?

535
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,683
Oh!

536
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:16,851
Okay.

537
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:18,219
Well, this is my son, Reece.

538
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,688
Hello, nice to meet you.

539
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:22,606
Aren't you cute!

540
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,524
Do you have a mom?

541
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:25,242
- Yeah.
- You do.

542
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:26,477
All right.

543
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:27,778
Well it was nice to meet you!

544
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:29,563
Let me know if you need a first guest.

545
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,399
Ah yeah!

546
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:35,736
I will call you.

547
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:45,713
Honey!

548
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:46,747
You got a second?

549
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,282
- Hey.
- Hey!

550
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,383
Oh, oh!

551
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:52,419
Oh, hun! You have to do the show!

552
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:53,587
How do you know about that?

553
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:56,173
- Quinn told me!
- Oh, okay.

554
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:57,457
Well I thought I was
gonna have to turn on

555
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:59,343
the old McIntyre charm
to get you on board.

556
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:00,511
I know we said no nannies.

557
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:02,346
But this is too important to pass up!

558
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,597
Thank you.

559
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,967
Your own detective series!

560
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:09,520
Yeah. Um, now I see the confusion.

561
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,072
It's not a detective series.

562
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,140
It's...

563
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,994
Well they offered me my
own late night talk show.

564
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:18,478
A talk show?

565
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:20,247
Yeah, a talk show.

566
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,282
What?

567
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:22,783
Nothing, I just thought
you were gonna wait

568
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:23,648
for the right project.

569
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:24,818
Well maybe this is it.

570
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:26,320
Really, Joe, a talk show?

571
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,822
Yeah, yes!

572
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:29,823
Yep!

573
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:32,326
What about being a serious actor?

574
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,627
You don't think I can do this.

575
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:34,595
Oh I know you can do it.

576
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,096
But why would you want to?

577
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,098
Well January Jones
thinks it's a great idea!

578
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,683
January Jones?

579
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,218
This was Alex's idea!

580
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,186
No.

581
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,471
- You should've fired him a long time ago!
- You know I can't fire Alex.

582
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:45,689
He's been with me forever!

583
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,875
I've noticed, he's in every
one of our wedding pictures!

584
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,144
Oh now you're exaggerating.

585
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:54,481
Look at how beautiful
you looked on that day.

586
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:56,033
Unbelievable.

587
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:58,068
All right, look.

588
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,519
This is me, okay?

589
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,039
And this could lead to bigger things.

590
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:05,025
But it's not going to if
I don't give it a shot.

591
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:06,360
All right, hun.

592
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:07,795
Okay?

593
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,746
Yeah.

594
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:11,232
Thank you.

595
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:13,851
And by the way, they don't
offer late night talk shows

596
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:16,303
to just anybody in this town, okay?

597
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,856
But they did, to you know who.

598
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:21,158
Hey, delivery to Joey McIntyre
from the Comfy Channel.

599
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:22,776
Thank you.

600
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:23,731
Look at that!

601
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:26,980
Welcome aboard, Joey Lawrence!

602
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,166
Joey Lawrence, what the fuck.

603
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
