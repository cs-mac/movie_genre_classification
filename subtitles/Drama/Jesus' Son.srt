00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,518
Captioning made possible by
lions gate entertainment.

2
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,063
I was hitching a ride.

3
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:37,365
I was looking for my girlfriend, Michelle,

4
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:43,337
who'd just run off with
a man called John Smith.

5
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:45,072
No, really, that was his name.

6
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:48,141
I knew him.
It was John Smith.

7
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:50,376
Once at a party he tried to sell me a gun.

8
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:52,077
And then later, at the vine,

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,112
he made everyone quiet down
for a few minutes

10
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,614
because I was singing along with the stereo.

11
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,285
And he liked my voice.

12
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:03,387
The traveling salesman had fed me pills

13
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,224
that made the lining of
my veins feel scraped out,

14
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,226
my jaw ached.

15
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,429
I knew every raindrop by its name.

16
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:17,833
I s... Sensed everything
before it happened.

17
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,171
I knew a certain oldsmobile
would stop for me

18
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,506
even before it slowed.

19
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:29,810
And by the sweet voices
of the family inside it,

20
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:34,347
I knew we'd have an accident in the storm.

21
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,152
I didn't care.

22
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:44,356
They said they'd take me all the way.

23
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,137
Pretty wet out there, isn't it?

24
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:02,405
We have kids so we're not
gonna go very fast.

25
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:07,342
Come and play.

26
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,177
Peek-a-boo.

27
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,815
Peek-a-boo,
I see you.

28
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:43,339
What a pair of lungs.

29
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:46,342
She shrieked as I imagined
an eagle would shriek.

30
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:51,313
It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it.

31
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:55,350
I've gone looking
for that feeling everywhere.

32
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,925
But I got ahead of myself.

33
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:23,529
Let me start at the beginning.

34
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,366
There were 2 men who got me
mixed up with Michelle.

35
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:32,470
I met the first man with
my friends tom and Richard.

36
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:35,406
I forgot my friends were even
with me, but there they were.

37
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:38,041
And, once again I have to tell
you I hated the two of them.

38
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:40,543
You see, the 3 of us had formed a group

39
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,412
based on something erroneous.

40
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:47,382
Some basic misunderstanding
that hadn't yet come to light,

41
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:50,418
and so we kept on in one another's company.

42
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,455
Yeah, anyway, we found the first man, Stan,

43
00:05:54,457 --> 00:06:00,561
the one I started to tell
you about, asleep in my car.

44
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:05,398
Who's this?

45
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,468
Get out of my car, man.

46
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,838
Get out of my car, man.

47
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:22,613
What do you do in a situation like this?

48
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:28,785
Using sign language, Stan led us to a place

49
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:32,555
that stood all by itself
out on the old highway.

50
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:35,491
I've been out on this road more than once,

51
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:40,028
and I never found anything
that made me happy.

52
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:03,001
If you called ahead

53
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,386
we would have encouraged
you not to bring him.

54
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:10,624
Anyway, he can't stay.

55
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,559
Tammy doesn't want him here.

56
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:16,896
OK, whoever Tammy is.

57
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:21,133
Now would be a good time
to take him out of here.

58
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:25,403
You should let him stay.

59
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,438
Nope.

60
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,172
Is he really deaf?

61
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,845
That's a good one.

62
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,647
She likes you guys.

63
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,148
Hey, you're a dancer.

64
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:20,034
Wait.

65
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,870
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Sorry.

66
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,105
Come on.

67
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,715
Michelle.

68
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,656
Would you get in the car?

69
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:58,234
Mcinnes.

70
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,707
Fuckhead.

71
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:30,764
Fh, narrating:
I was carrying a gun,

72
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,265
but I never would have used it.

73
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:35,334
It was so cheap I was sure
it would explode in my hands

74
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,753
if I ever pulled the trigger,

75
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:40,171
so it could only add to my humiliation.

76
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,207
Hey, where's mcinnes?

77
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,642
How the hell should I know?

78
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,182
What's wrong?

79
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,850
Come on.

80
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,285
Hey, we goin'?

81
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,826
Go. Go. Lose him.

82
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:08,761
See ya.
Shit.

83
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:11,196
Go. Go. Go.

84
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,164
Hey, man...
Lose him!

85
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,965
Get off my car.

86
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,233
Go! Lose him!
Lose him!

87
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,346
Do you think he's all right?

88
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,147
Yeah. Yeah.

89
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,116
He's fine. He's just gonna
go back to the party.

90
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:37,717
Don't worry about it.

91
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:40,619
It's mcinnes I'm worried about.

92
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,337
Mcinnes?

93
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,054
He caught me kissing Michelle.

94
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:47,291
Which one was Michelle?

95
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:56,265
All our lives clean, with the slate.

96
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:59,234
We just want you to be ready.

97
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:02,237
If he wanted to end it,
he'd have ended it by now.

98
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:05,840
Yeah, well, it is hard to know
what he's thinking sometimes.

99
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,508
Yeah.
I agree.

100
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,175
But patience is a part of believing,

101
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,728
it's a part of this.

102
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,279
And, in the meantime, you prepare.

103
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,146
You wait for the day...

104
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,015
hey, can I keep this?

105
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,916
I've moved around my whole life.

106
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:21,351
This is the longest
that I've lived anywhere,

107
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:23,353
18 months.

108
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,188
I don't have a job.

109
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,223
No kidding.

110
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,091
I smoke cigarettes.

111
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,359
And you talk nonstop.

112
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:34,128
No, I don't.

113
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,664
No, usually, I don't.

114
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,899
Except when I'm nervous.

115
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,834
Do I make you nervous?

116
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,735
No. No.

117
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:46,904
Yeah, maybe a little.

118
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:00,182
I heard about...

119
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:02,951
I heard about your boyfriend mcinnes.

120
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:07,055
I mean...

121
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,389
I was there.

122
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:10,724
I know.

123
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:14,227
I heard you tried to help him.

124
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:17,163
That you were the only one.

125
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,131
Is that true?

126
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,767
He... He almost made it.

127
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,181
What were you saying before

128
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,983
to those jehovah's witness guys?

129
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,218
Look what they gave me.

130
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,086
I was asking them if when we die,

131
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,354
if there's an ending to everything we know,

132
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:48,856
and if there is, then
why don't we just die now?

133
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:51,225
You know, die to everything we know.

134
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:55,028
I mean, maybe living and
dying are the same thing,

135
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,365
and maybe the fact that we've
turned them into 2 different things

136
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,201
is why we feel so lost.

137
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,606
Man.

138
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,374
Wow.

139
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,175
I'm not planning on dying anytime soon,

140
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:14,610
but if I do, I'll sure to come back

141
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:15,877
and tell you all about it.

142
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,913
No, don't do that.
Do us both a favor.

143
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:21,282
Rest in peace.

144
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,591
Can I kiss you now?

145
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:34,060
No.

146
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:42,299
Sorry, it sticks.

147
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:48,204
Oops, sorry.

148
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:54,975
The...
Kitchen area.

149
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,310
This way.

150
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,983
This is the bathroom.

151
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:09,453
And... Yeah,
don't look too close.

152
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:48,991
Wait. Hang on.

153
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:50,392
Wait. Wait. Wait.

154
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:51,960
Just slow down.

155
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:53,328
Sorry.

156
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,464
Can we take a second?
I just...

157
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:02,302
It seems kinda fast.

158
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:07,473
Well, I like it slow.

159
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:31,462
Hi.

160
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:36,966
You ever seen anyone shoot up before?

161
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:40,468
No.

162
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:42,328
Fh, narrating: I've been
staying at the holiday inn

163
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,729
with Michelle.

164
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:49,400
Honestly, the most beautiful
woman I'd ever known.

165
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,253
But wait a minute.

166
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,738
I never finished telling you about
what happened to mcinnes, did I?

167
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,306
Or about the 2 men who led me to Michelle.

168
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:00,643
I never even started describing
the second man dundun.

169
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:06,314
Hey.

170
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:12,118
Mcinnes isn't feeling too good today.

171
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:13,818
Mcinnes is here? Yeah.

172
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,352
Maybe I'll come back later.

173
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:18,321
Don't worry.
I just shot him.

174
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,326
Y-you mean
you killed him?

175
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:27,262
I didn't mean to.

176
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:28,763
Is he really dead?

177
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:33,300
No, he's sitting down now in the front room.

178
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:45,344
Dundun shot him?

179
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,813
Somebody shot somebody.

180
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:56,187
Here.

181
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,623
I don't want it.

182
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,225
OK.

183
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:03,426
Well, here, then.

184
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:05,378
No, thank you.

185
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,329
Aren't you taking him to
the hospital or anything?

186
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:08,363
We started to.

187
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,431
How you doing?

188
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,800
I can feel it right here.

189
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:16,303
It's just stuck in the muscle.

190
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,438
It's not bad.

191
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:25,144
The cap didn't explode right, I think.

192
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:28,046
Misfire.

193
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,680
It misfired a little bit, yeah.

194
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:34,317
Well, how about I take him to the hospital?

195
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:37,619
I don't know.

196
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:41,788
Do you promise not to tell them anything?

197
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:46,258
I don't think he hears you.

198
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,428
Tell them it was an accident, OK?!

199
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:57,668
Promise?

200
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:08,744
What do you say?

201
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:11,179
W-what do you mean,
what do I say?

202
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:15,315
You think I'm here because I
know all about this stuff?

203
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,749
He's dead.

204
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:20,752
All right!
I know he's dead!

205
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,255
Throw him out of the car?

206
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,858
Damn right! Throw him out of the car!

207
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,468
Do you think...

208
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:43,871
I'm glad he's dead.

209
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:47,574
He's the one who started
everybody calling me fuckhead.

210
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:51,310
Don't let it get you down.

211
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:56,547
What a lousy birthday.

212
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:01,218
Fh, narrating:
I don't know,

213
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,585
maybe he thought I might say something,

214
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:05,188
but will you believe me when I tell ya

215
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,291
that there was kindness in his heart?

216
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,861
His left hand didn't know what
his right hand was doin'.

217
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:14,763
It's just that certain important connections

218
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:17,265
have been burned through.

219
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,766
If I opened up your head

220
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:22,903
and ran a hot soldering iron
around in your brain,

221
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:26,973
I might turn you into someone like that.

222
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:36,347
So, there I was, staying at the holiday inn

223
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:41,885
with Michelle for 3 days under a phony name,

224
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:44,721
spending the last of her money.

225
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,858
Michelle loved to stay in hotels.

226
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:45,671
Christ, you've got a beautiful ass.

227
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,385
I like this ride.

228
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:06,053
How long have we been here?

229
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:10,590
We've got some dope left, too.

230
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:12,691
I don't care.

231
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:14,926
I don't care, either.

232
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:18,829
Fh, narrating: And then
came one of those moments.

233
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:22,032
How do you think that makes me feel?!

234
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,503
Hey, you... you
kicked me out.

235
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,005
She said I could crash... all right.

236
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,590
She said I could crash there,

237
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:33,174
and Tammy's not even your best friend.

238
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:34,875
I'd say you hardly even know her.

239
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:37,043
Look, I was getting ready for bed.

240
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:38,944
I was taking my clothes off
so I could go to sleep.

241
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:42,180
I... I wasn't gonna take
advantage of anyone.

242
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,048
You can kiss my ass!

243
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,683
She and you and her and everybody else!

244
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:48,418
Right!

245
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:50,052
Get out!
I will...

246
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,486
get out!

247
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:54,489
Get out! Get out!

248
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:55,189
Get out!

249
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:57,558
Can I have my shirt?

250
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,092
Wait.

251
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:09,634
Maybe my jacket, too?

252
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:26,215
Hey!

253
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:28,449
Where's my money?!

254
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:29,516
I need cab fare.

255
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,150
We're broke.

256
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,219
Are you just gonna leave me high and dry?

257
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:36,754
God, you're so fucked!

258
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:38,589
Do you even understand anything?

259
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:42,192
No wonder everybody calls you fuckhead.

260
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:43,493
Fuckhead.

261
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:44,544
Fuckhead.

262
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:45,594
You don't need to call me that.

263
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:46,762
Fuckhead.

264
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:48,230
Fuckhead, fuckhead, fuckhead, fuckhead.

265
00:24:48,232 --> 00:24:51,499
All right. Fuckhead, fuckhead,
fuckhead, fuckhead!

266
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:52,566
Fuckhead, fuckhead!

267
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,003
No.

268
00:24:57,004 --> 00:24:58,470
God, come here.
Are you OK?

269
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,473
Hey, what's up, buddy?

270
00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:02,474
All right, she's just feeling a little sick.

271
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:03,909
Bullshit. You punched
her in the gut.

272
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:08,713
He did.
He did. He did.

273
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,749
Somebody's going to get hurt over this.

274
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,969
Hey!

275
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,220
Stop, you stupid fuckin'
dick-suckin' bitch!

276
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:24,224
Fuckhead!

277
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,216
You...

278
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:57,284
I'm fine.

279
00:25:57,286 --> 00:25:58,885
You're the one.

280
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:00,052
What?

281
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:01,186
Last time you were in here,

282
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:02,754
you stiffed me.

283
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:04,088
No, I didn't.

284
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,289
Yes, you did.

285
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,157
You were with your friends.

286
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:10,193
They're not my friends anymore.

287
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,595
You owe me 8 bucks plus a tip.

288
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:14,697
You look very nice in your uniform.

289
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,966
How old are you, about 19?

290
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:05,212
Michelle didn't appear to be
coming back anytime soon,

291
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:06,813
so I shot the last of our dope

292
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:10,249
and I went to the vine to find...

293
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,251
Wayne.

294
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:15,220
Fuckin' Wayne.

295
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:21,191
Goddamn it.

296
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,375
Wah.

297
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:47,345
Hey, how would you feel
about making some money?

298
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:49,180
Aw, who knows?

299
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:53,184
I was just going to, go
over in the corner there

300
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:54,985
and nod out.

301
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,221
Well...

302
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:02,290
I have decided in my mind

303
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:05,359
that we're going to make some money.

304
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:12,097
That's the only place you're
gonna make some money.

305
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,798
So what?

306
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,066
I want you to come with me.

307
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:19,002
What, you mean, you need a ride?

308
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:21,821
I got the tools,

309
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:24,339
I just need your sorry-ass
car to get around in.

310
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,211
You know you're bleedin' from the nose?

311
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,148
We doin' a, burgu...
a burglary?

312
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,051
Can't burgulate if you got an empty house.

313
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,318
This is a salvage job.

314
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:19,189
This house has a terrible feeling about it.

315
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,297
Don't do that.

316
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,398
Why not?

317
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,900
It's stupid, that's why.

318
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:54,187
Sell the copper for scrap.

319
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:59,223
All right.

320
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,328
Hey, how much money do you
think we can make on this?

321
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,031
Enough to go to bed drunk tonight.

322
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,169
Pipes are dry.

323
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:12,499
Hey!

324
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,784
Who owned these houses, do you think?

325
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,787
This is my house.

326
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,289
It is?

327
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,824
Was.

328
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:56,018
All this work is messing with my high.

329
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,120
Can't you find some easier way

330
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:00,288
to make your dollar?

331
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:11,264
Move.

332
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:30,282
What is that?

333
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:34,286
That is one beautiful sight.

334
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,163
Yep.

335
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:17,494
That was my wife.

336
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,173
Fh, narrating: As nearly
as I could tell,

337
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,708
I'd wandered into some sort of dream

338
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,011
that Wayne was having
about his wife and his house,

339
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,013
but I didn't say anything more about it

340
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:40,115
because, well, after all, in small ways,

341
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,717
it was turning out to be one
of the best days of my life,

342
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:46,420
whether it was somebody else's dream or not.

343
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:50,590
We turned in the scrap wire for over $40...

344
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,424
Each!

345
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,159
Who'd you men pull off?!

346
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,361
No one. We worked.

347
00:33:55,363 --> 00:33:57,262
Buy me a drink, you little crooks.

348
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:58,296
Nurse?!

349
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,465
Jack Daniels.

350
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:02,706
And we'll drink to my very
favorite person who tends bar.

351
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,702
When you pour, darlin',

352
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:08,337
it's like hittin' the jackpot.

353
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:45,369
Honey, you got a good face,

354
00:34:45,371 --> 00:34:47,504
but you can't sing for shit.

355
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:50,573
What the goddamn fucking piss-hell

356
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:52,508
is that supposed to mean?

357
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:55,510
This ain't school.

358
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,660
Sit down now...

359
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:20,095
Buy you a drink.

360
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,463
Fuck you.

361
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:25,699
Asshole.

362
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,267
Hey, nurse.

363
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:31,570
All the really good times
happen when Wayne's around.

364
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:34,405
But this afternoon

365
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:37,474
was somehow the best of all those times.

366
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:38,541
We had money.

367
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:40,676
We were grimy and tired.

368
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:43,345
Usually, we felt guilty and frightened

369
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:45,347
because there was something wrong with us

370
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:47,749
and we didn't know what it was,

371
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,150
but today we had the feeling
of men who had worked.

372
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:51,218
Yes.

373
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:00,326
All right, so, great, OK.

374
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:12,403
So we bought some dope
and split it down the middle

375
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:15,372
and then I went looking for Michelle...

376
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,442
Knowing that when there were drugs around,

377
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,710
she surrendered.

378
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,513
Michelle?!

379
00:36:26,582 --> 00:36:28,348
Baby?!

380
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,616
Baby, baby?

381
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:56,762
Honey?

382
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,332
Honey?

383
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:03,268
Honey!

384
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:05,335
Honey!

385
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:09,338
Honey!

386
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,306
Fuck!

387
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:14,309
Honey!

388
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:15,276
Honey!

389
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:17,244
Honey!

390
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:18,411
Honey?!

391
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:19,845
You fucker!

392
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:20,712
Wake up!

393
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:22,646
Wake up!

394
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,982
Baby!

395
00:38:26,984 --> 00:38:28,350
Baby!

396
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,384
Baby!

397
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:31,486
Baby, sit up!

398
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:34,622
Honey, baby.

399
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:37,791
That's it.
Honey, come on.

400
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:39,392
Come on.

401
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,494
I think he passed the roses and garbage

402
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:46,431
and purple light and the
sorrowful mystery bullshit

403
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:49,000
to whatever's past that.

404
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:53,904
Michelle... Michelle...

405
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,706
I mean it, baby.

406
00:38:57,408 --> 00:39:00,942
Through the rain and the desert.

407
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:11,651
Who are you?

408
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:26,497
I'm the soul for your soul.

409
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,333
I am your man.

410
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,472
Fh, narrating:
As for Wayne...

411
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,340
He died.

412
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,341
I am still alive.

413
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:46,645
I've been working in the emergency ward

414
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:48,513
for about 3 weeks, I guess.

415
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:51,315
I'd taken the job because
Michelle was pregnant

416
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:53,850
and I was trying to be responsible.

417
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,518
I had nothing to do on the overnight shift,

418
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,020
so I went looking for Georgie, the orderly.

419
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:00,355
He often stole pills from the cabinet.

420
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:03,958
What am I gonna do about
these fuckin' shoes, man?

421
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:15,202
Whatever you stole,

422
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:17,070
I guess you ate it already, right?

423
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:20,339
Listen to how they squish.

424
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:29,879
Let me just check your pockets, OK?

425
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:31,479
All right.

426
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,449
Yeah.

427
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,651
No.

428
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:44,354
Yeah, I hear something.

429
00:40:44,356 --> 00:40:45,688
Right?

430
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,062
Yeah.

431
00:41:11,413 --> 00:41:14,080
I hope<i> you</i> didn't do this to him.

432
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:16,415
Me? No, he was like this.

433
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:18,816
My wife did it.

434
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:23,386
Who brought you in?

435
00:41:23,388 --> 00:41:25,821
Nobody.

436
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:27,389
I just walked down.

437
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:31,092
It's only 3 blocks.

438
00:41:31,094 --> 00:41:33,627
OK, we... we better
get you lying down.

439
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:36,296
OK.

440
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,964
I feel ready for something like that.

441
00:41:43,037 --> 00:41:44,002
Name?

442
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,403
Terrance weber.

443
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:46,471
Your face is dark.

444
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:47,538
I can't see what you're saying.

445
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,489
Georgie?

446
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,439
What are you saying, man?
I can't see.

447
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:50,973
What's going on, Georgie?

448
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,241
His face is dark.

449
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:53,508
How long ago did this happen?

450
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,210
Just a while ago.

451
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,511
My wife did it.

452
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,946
I was, peeping on the lady next door

453
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:01,548
while she was bathing.

454
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,917
My wife waited till I fell asleep

455
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,619
and then she decided she'd blind me.

456
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:08,687
Do you want me to call the police?

457
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,659
Not unless I die.

458
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:17,060
Here's the situation:

459
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:20,263
We need to get a team here.

460
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:21,998
An entire team.

461
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,599
I want...
a good eye man,

462
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:26,234
the best eye man,

463
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:27,702
a great eye man.

464
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:29,203
I want a brain surgeon,

465
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:31,838
and I want a really good gas man.

466
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,972
Get me a genius.

467
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:34,105
I-I'm not
touching that head.

468
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:35,740
W-we'll prep him,
we'll prep this guy

469
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:38,675
and we'll just sit back
and sit tight, all right?

470
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,613
Orderly?

471
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:47,249
Orderly?

472
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:49,784
Do you mean me?

473
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:51,251
Should I get him prepped?

474
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:54,188
Is this a hospital?

475
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,889
Is this the emergency room?

476
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:56,990
Is that the patient?

477
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,192
Are you the orderly?

478
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:01,644
Hey.

479
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,094
Hey, we got a guy down here

480
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:04,680
in the E.R.
with a knife st...

481
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,264
hunting knife sticking into his brain.

482
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:09,100
Yeah, it's sticking into his brain.

483
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:10,551
Yeah.

484
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:12,001
Yeah, the family service doctor is here,

485
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:14,938
but he is, limited,

486
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,608
and he says he's not
going to touch the head,

487
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,010
so we need a great eye man,

488
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:22,128
really quick,

489
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:23,245
like the best that you've got,

490
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:25,213
and a brain surgeon,

491
00:43:25,215 --> 00:43:28,316
and a genius gas man.

492
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:29,717
Yeah, a real good one...

493
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:30,684
OK.

494
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:32,185
OK, yeah, thanks a lot.

495
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:38,157
That person is not right,
not at all. Not one bit.

496
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,960
You know, as long as my
instructions are audible to him,

497
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:43,828
it does not concern me.

498
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,330
Well, OK, OK. Don't...
don't chew my head off.

499
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,264
OK.

500
00:43:47,266 --> 00:43:49,733
All right, the eye man

501
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:50,934
is on vacation or something,

502
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,235
but the operator is calling around

503
00:43:52,237 --> 00:43:53,869
to see if she can find someone

504
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,037
just as good.

505
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:56,204
All of the other specialists

506
00:43:56,206 --> 00:43:58,306
are hurrying through the night

507
00:43:58,308 --> 00:44:00,240
to join us.

508
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:07,012
Dr. shanis,
if you're in the building,

509
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:10,248
please call the nursing station.

510
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:50,070
What do you got?

511
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:51,220
A guy with a knife in his brain.

512
00:44:51,223 --> 00:44:52,989
Boy.

513
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,756
Patient complains of knife in the head.

514
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:55,791
Stabbing headache?

515
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:15,240
Where did you get that?

516
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,211
Your shoelace is untied.

517
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:34,256
How's the guy doin'?

518
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:36,991
Who?

519
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:40,260
Well, it's just a miracle

520
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:43,896
he didn't end up sightless or at least dead.

521
00:45:43,898 --> 00:45:45,163
He's not dead?

522
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,131
No. His vitals are normal

523
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:48,699
and he still has excellent vision

524
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:50,300
in his one good eye.

525
00:45:50,302 --> 00:45:51,635
So he's alive?

526
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:52,969
There's nothin' wrong with the guy.

527
00:45:52,971 --> 00:45:56,138
It's just one of those things.

528
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,341
What do you do around here, anyway?

529
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:02,243
I save lives.

530
00:46:05,915 --> 00:46:06,947
I think it's morning.

531
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:08,281
Do you want me to take you home?

532
00:46:08,283 --> 00:46:09,783
No, no way.

533
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:11,284
I feel like a giant helium balloon.

534
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:13,352
Got to...

535
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,120
Doctor.

536
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:17,788
I gotta come down before Michelle sees me.

537
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,158
Come down? Then what are you
doin' with my stash, man?

538
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,759
Hand it over.

539
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:24,227
All right.
Hand it over.

540
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:26,329
It was just to stay awake.

541
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:28,297
Try nescafé,

542
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:29,798
dad.

543
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,765
Dear.

544
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,222
Pretend it's the first time.

545
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:00,990
Like we're new.

546
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:04,259
Heh!

547
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:06,460
All right.

548
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,000
I know it's kind of fast...

549
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:27,811
I really like you.

550
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:36,451
Can we just wait one second?

551
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,119
Right.

552
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,786
It seems kind of fast.

553
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,224
I like it slow.

554
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,940
I don't care if it takes one second

555
00:48:01,942 --> 00:48:05,109
or it takes a million years.

556
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:14,984
I want to know everything about you.

557
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:17,252
All of it.

558
00:48:18,288 --> 00:48:19,520
Ask me.

559
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:23,257
Like, like what do you like?

560
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:24,825
Like what?

561
00:48:24,827 --> 00:48:29,563
Well, like what kind of music?

562
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,902
James brown.

563
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:45,342
You in love with me yet?

564
00:48:45,344 --> 00:48:47,277
Shit.

565
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:49,612
Shit.

566
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:51,946
Say it.

567
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:53,914
Shit, we're in trouble.

568
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:56,283
Say it.

569
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:06,391
I love you.

570
00:49:06,393 --> 00:49:09,026
I love you.

571
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:13,396
I love you.

572
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:16,098
I love you.

573
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:22,302
I love you.

574
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:24,404
I love you.

575
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:26,873
Love you.

576
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:31,577
We're wrecking like trains.

577
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:37,315
I have to hold on to this job.

578
00:49:37,317 --> 00:49:41,385
I have responsibilities now.

579
00:49:41,387 --> 00:49:45,489
We're on the 7-month
countdown to the baby.

580
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:47,591
You should clean out the
hospital's speed stash.

581
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:51,261
That way you could do double shifts.

582
00:49:51,263 --> 00:49:55,231
Me and Michelle are trying to stay clean.

583
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:57,466
I want to go to church.

584
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:59,935
You should go to the county fair.

585
00:49:59,937 --> 00:50:03,138
I'd like to worship.
I would.

586
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,274
They have these injured
hawks and eagles there

587
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:09,576
from the humane society.

588
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:17,316
I need a quiet chapel about now.

589
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:26,924
That was the worst fair I've been to.

590
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:27,925
Where were the rides?

591
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:29,293
Well, there were rides.

592
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:30,527
I didn't see one ride.

593
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:33,029
There was the,
merry-go-round,

594
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,497
there was a Ferris wheel,

595
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:37,433
and there was a thing they called the hammer

596
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,368
that people were bent over vomiting
from after they got off...

597
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,504
Are you completely blind?!

598
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:45,305
What was that?
A rabbit!

599
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:46,339
Something thumped.

600
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,041
You hit him.
He thumped.

601
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:52,677
Rabbit stew.

602
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:05,155
Where's my hunting knife?

603
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:07,557
Where's my hunting knife?

604
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,359
Georgie...

605
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,762
We'll camp in the wilderness.

606
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:18,699
In the morning, we'll
breakfast on its haunches.

607
00:51:49,394 --> 00:51:52,394
Man, I should've been a doctor.

608
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:57,498
No way I'm eating those things.

609
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,700
Take 'em. Take 'em,
I gotta drive, take 'em!

610
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:20,685
Yeah!!

611
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:23,287
We killed the mother and saved the children.

612
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:25,422
These rabbits better be kept warm.

613
00:52:25,424 --> 00:52:27,257
Yeah!

614
00:52:29,294 --> 00:52:30,726
No, they're hardly moving.

615
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:32,995
You know what we'll do?

616
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:35,263
We'll get some milk and sugar and all that.

617
00:52:35,265 --> 00:52:37,331
We'll raise 'em up ourselves.

618
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,433
They'll get as big as gorillas.

619
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:41,835
Hey, you think the blue ones are downers?

620
00:52:41,837 --> 00:52:43,487
Yeah, the blues one'll make you nod out,

621
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:45,138
and the yellows'll keep you
going for the duration.

622
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,207
Which one do you want? I'll take both.

623
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,446
Hoo-hoo!

624
00:52:56,448 --> 00:53:00,450
Do you realize it's going to snow?

625
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:04,320
This beautiful chill!

626
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:06,488
This... this... this
sudden Christmas!

627
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:10,492
The tang of everything stabbing me!

628
00:53:10,494 --> 00:53:11,659
Hoo-hoo!

629
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:14,428
What's that smell?

630
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,367
Hey, be careful about the bunnies.

631
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,769
I got 'em, I got 'em.

632
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:29,773
Ahead, yonder!

633
00:53:41,953 --> 00:53:45,520
I've never seen this cemetery before.

634
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,256
What cemetery?

635
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:54,559
Georgie, can't you see?

636
00:53:54,561 --> 00:53:57,295
See what?

637
00:53:57,297 --> 00:54:01,198
God, can't you see?

638
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,600
See what?

639
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,571
It's
the drive-in, man.

640
00:54:50,346 --> 00:54:52,830
Drive-in?

641
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,315
They're showing movies,
and nobody's even here.

642
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,451
I see.

643
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:11,262
I, I thought it was something else.

644
00:55:30,649 --> 00:55:33,749
I have to get back.

645
00:55:35,786 --> 00:55:39,420
How far are we from home?

646
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,389
We're right outside town.

647
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,357
We've just been driving around and around.

648
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,393
This is no place to camp.

649
00:55:47,562 --> 00:55:50,029
I can hear the interstate.

650
00:55:50,031 --> 00:55:52,431
Right over there.

651
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:55,567
We better get some milk for the bunnies.

652
00:56:01,307 --> 00:56:02,973
No, we don't...

653
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:04,374
We don't have milk.

654
00:56:04,376 --> 00:56:06,609
We'll mix sugar up with it.

655
00:56:11,382 --> 00:56:13,849
Just, forget it.

656
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,317
Forget... forget about
the milk all of a sudden.

657
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,353
They're mammals, man.

658
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:20,688
No, forget about the rabbits.

659
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,390
Where are they, anyway?

660
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:28,094
You're not listening to me.

661
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:32,364
Forget... About...
The rabbits.

662
00:56:36,803 --> 00:56:39,370
Where are they?

663
00:56:43,342 --> 00:56:46,076
They... They...

664
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:47,677
They...

665
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:53,349
They, they slid around
behind me and got squashed.

666
00:56:55,553 --> 00:56:58,787
They slid around behind?

667
00:57:02,492 --> 00:57:04,859
Man.

668
00:57:12,468 --> 00:57:14,501
My...

669
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:16,803
God!

670
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:20,473
Everything is here.

671
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:24,510
Little feet, eyelids, even whiskers.

672
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:27,446
Deceased!

673
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:31,148
Does everything you touch turn to shit?

674
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:35,552
Does this happen to you every time?

675
00:57:35,554 --> 00:57:38,087
No wonder everybody calls me fuckhead.

676
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:40,022
It's a name that's going to stick.

677
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:42,224
I realize that.

678
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,425
Fuckhead is gonna ride you to your grave.

679
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:45,160
I already said so.

680
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:48,963
I agreed with you in advance.

681
00:57:54,736 --> 00:57:56,869
Fh, narrating: Maybe
that wasn't the night

682
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:59,404
I rolled over on the bunnies
and flattened them.

683
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:02,407
Yeah, maybe that was
another... another time...

684
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:05,810
either way, it doesn't matter.

685
00:58:05,812 --> 00:58:09,413
Wh-what's important
for me to remember now

686
00:58:09,415 --> 00:58:11,014
is that... that early
the next morning

687
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:13,816
the snow was melting off
the... the windshield,

688
00:58:13,818 --> 00:58:18,453
and the daylight woke me up, and...

689
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:21,155
I was gonna be a father.

690
00:58:35,836 --> 00:58:39,470
I was 24, 25, something like that.

691
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,805
My fingertips were all yellow from smoking.

692
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:47,209
We'd come to Chicago because
Michelle was with child.

693
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:49,144
Hail Mary, full of grace,

694
00:58:49,146 --> 00:58:51,112
the lord is with thee.

695
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,480
Blessed art thou among women

696
00:58:52,482 --> 00:58:55,950
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb... Jesus.

697
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:57,885
Holy Mary, mother of God,

698
00:58:57,887 --> 00:58:58,986
pray for us sinners

699
00:58:58,988 --> 00:59:02,155
now and at the hour of our death, amen.

700
00:59:02,157 --> 00:59:05,591
Fh, narrating: There was nothing
stopping Michelle and me

701
00:59:05,593 --> 00:59:07,459
from having a baby,

702
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,494
except ourselves.

703
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:10,461
Name?

704
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,129
Sorry I'm late.

705
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,231
Michelle.
Michelle.

706
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:17,133
My appointment
was at 3:30.

707
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:19,185
Somewhere around there.

708
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:21,236
Here you are. Come with me, hon.

709
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:24,106
Let's get you settled.

710
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:52,834
You can't just stand there.

711
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:54,735
Then I'll go sit down over there.

712
00:59:54,737 --> 00:59:55,769
That'll be fine.

713
00:59:55,771 --> 00:59:58,104
I know that'll be fine.

714
00:59:58,106 --> 01:00:01,073
Or you can watch the film.

715
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:02,240
What's the film?

716
01:00:02,242 --> 01:00:04,976
Vasectomy is a very simple procedure.

717
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:08,879
It's performed right here in
the office setting as a rule.

718
01:00:08,881 --> 01:00:10,714
It, is intended

719
01:00:10,716 --> 01:00:13,149
to be a permanent type of a sterilization,

720
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:16,252
and I would hope that that's
what you had in mind.

721
01:00:16,254 --> 01:00:18,087
If you are not satisfied that this is...

722
01:00:25,095 --> 01:00:28,729
I'm not ever getting anybody pregnant again.

723
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:30,630
I know that much.

724
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:33,132
Would you like to make an appointment?

725
01:00:33,134 --> 01:00:35,701
Would you like to give me the money?

726
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:38,770
It won't take long to save the money.

727
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:40,004
It would take me

728
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:44,541
forever to save the money.

729
01:01:15,106 --> 01:01:18,273
Michelle is comfortable now.

730
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,179
Is she dead?

731
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:35,221
How you feeling?

732
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:40,258
I don't know.

733
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:48,865
What did they stick up you?

734
01:01:50,268 --> 01:01:52,701
What?

735
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,939
What?

736
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:01,308
Hey, OK, out of here.

737
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,144
Look, just... just
give me a minute.

738
01:02:04,146 --> 01:02:06,747
I'm sorry.

739
01:02:06,748 --> 01:02:09,349
Maybe we could...
maybe we could try again.

740
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,384
Something is wrong with you.

741
01:02:11,385 --> 01:02:13,418
I don't think this man really
needs to be in the building.

742
01:02:13,421 --> 01:02:15,187
I just...

743
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,221
Wait outside, please, sir.

744
01:02:16,223 --> 01:02:17,756
There just wasn't enough time...

745
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,290
if you want to go wait outside for her, sir.

746
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,858
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

747
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:24,261
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

748
01:02:25,063 --> 01:02:29,264
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

749
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:44,943
Fh, narrating: The catholics
splashed holy water on my cheek

750
01:02:44,945 --> 01:02:49,313
and the back of my neck,
and I didn't feel a thing.

751
01:02:49,315 --> 01:02:54,284
Not for many years.

752
01:02:57,355 --> 01:02:59,088
Think of being curled up

753
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,191
and floating in a darkness.

754
01:03:02,193 --> 01:03:04,426
Even if you could think,

755
01:03:04,428 --> 01:03:07,345
even if you had an imagination,

756
01:03:07,346 --> 01:03:10,263
would you ever imagine its opposite?

757
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:13,033
This miraculous world?

758
01:03:13,035 --> 01:03:17,003
The Asian taoists call it 10,000 things.

759
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:20,973
And if the darkness just got darker...

760
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:23,008
And then you were dead...

761
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,877
What would you care?

762
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,948
How would you even know the difference?

763
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,824
You're gonna be so happy when you get there.

764
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:47,195
Fh, narrating: The next morning
I got back to the rebel motel,

765
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:51,098
and there was John Smith.

766
01:03:52,968 --> 01:03:56,502
You drive around in this
striped, pink car-thing.

767
01:03:56,504 --> 01:03:59,238
It's like a real car, except smaller.

768
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,506
Everywhere you want to go.

769
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,882
Get out of my house.

770
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,817
If this is your house, pal,

771
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:20,353
it's no wonder your
woman's hitting the road.

772
01:04:20,355 --> 01:04:24,256
What? Wait.
Hey, where you going?

773
01:04:24,258 --> 01:04:25,290
Michelle?

774
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:27,225
Mexico.

775
01:04:28,294 --> 01:04:30,294
John's got some work for me.

776
01:04:31,613 --> 01:04:32,929
And there's these birds.

777
01:04:32,931 --> 01:04:34,263
You know those huge, white birds

778
01:04:34,265 --> 01:04:38,600
that float around on lakes
and stuff like that?

779
01:04:38,602 --> 01:04:40,234
They're called swans.

780
01:04:40,236 --> 01:04:41,501
Whatever they're called.

781
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:43,436
They're called swans.
They mate for life.

782
01:04:43,438 --> 01:04:46,372
I don't really give a
fuck who they mate for.

783
01:04:46,374 --> 01:04:50,275
Anyway, they're all over
the place down there.

784
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:52,410
It's like a paradise.
Michelle?

785
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:54,378
Are you high?

786
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,446
No.

787
01:04:56,448 --> 01:04:58,948
Yeah, but...

788
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:00,950
I need to talk to you.

789
01:05:00,952 --> 01:05:02,952
She's got her future to think of.

790
01:05:02,954 --> 01:05:05,554
John, just keep out of it.

791
01:05:07,224 --> 01:05:09,190
What if you just tried a little harder?

792
01:05:09,192 --> 01:05:13,260
What if you just try to make it work?

793
01:05:13,996 --> 01:05:18,864
What if you just pretend
that you were the one?

794
01:05:19,533 --> 01:05:22,567
Don't do this, baby.

795
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:26,969
Are you gonna answer my question or not?

796
01:05:28,372 --> 01:05:30,271
What question?

797
01:05:56,898 --> 01:06:03,669
Fh, narrating: There was a guy
down near the front of the car,

798
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:06,638
and there was something about him.

799
01:06:07,374 --> 01:06:13,344
I don't know what it was.

800
01:06:34,697 --> 01:06:37,230
I followed him because...

801
01:06:37,232 --> 01:06:41,300
I don't know why.
I guess he looked lucky.

802
01:07:30,242 --> 01:07:31,725
He had a hood on.

803
01:07:31,726 --> 01:07:33,209
They're looking for a guy with a hood on.

804
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:34,711
What he do?

805
01:07:34,712 --> 01:07:36,392
Nothing. Some guy got murdered last night.

806
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,763
Hey.

807
01:08:02,301 --> 01:08:04,768
You were on the El.

808
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:06,703
You following me?

809
01:08:22,453 --> 01:08:24,286
Hey!

810
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,456
Fh, narrating:
I took off

811
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:31,659
because my throat was closing up

812
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:32,660
and, suddenly, I had an erection.

813
01:08:32,662 --> 01:08:35,229
I knew men got that way about men,

814
01:08:35,231 --> 01:08:37,297
but I didn't know I did.

815
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:39,599
His chest was like Christ's.

816
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:43,702
That's probably who he was.

817
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:47,305
I could have followed
anybody off that train,

818
01:08:47,307 --> 01:08:50,074
it would have been the same.

819
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,578
Michelle.

820
01:08:54,579 --> 01:08:56,446
Michelle, Michelle, Michelle, Michelle.

821
01:08:58,683 --> 01:09:00,983
Yeah, for some reason,

822
01:09:00,984 --> 01:09:03,284
Mexico stands out in my mind.

823
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:16,562
Hello?

824
01:09:17,731 --> 01:09:20,298
Wait. Iowa city?

825
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:25,302
Fh, narrating: Anyway, like I
started to tell you before,

826
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:30,606
I was hitching a ride looking for Michelle.

827
01:09:30,608 --> 01:09:33,709
I'm gifted with love.
I love my kids.

828
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,045
I love all my relatives.

829
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,380
Fh, narrating: The pills the
traveling salesman had fed me

830
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:40,715
made the lining of my veins
feel scraped out.

831
01:09:40,717 --> 01:09:42,283
My jaw ached...

832
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:44,552
She's cute.

833
01:09:44,553 --> 01:09:46,820
I knew every raindrop by its name.

834
01:09:46,822 --> 01:09:51,157
I sensed everything before it happened.

835
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:55,728
I knew a certain oldsmobile
would stop for me

836
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,698
even before it slowed.

837
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:01,667
And by the sweet voices
of the family inside it,

838
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:05,337
I knew we'd have an accident in the storm.

839
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:44,239
It's all right.

840
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:47,675
You're gonna be OK.

841
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,324
There's been an accident!

842
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:07,260
Go for help!

843
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:31,549
You smell.

844
01:11:38,724 --> 01:11:41,424
So how was Mexico?

845
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:43,526
Hot.

846
01:11:45,396 --> 01:11:47,496
But I made good money.

847
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:52,434
I was gonna go down there and find you,

848
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:54,902
but then I heard you were here.

849
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:01,408
I was in a bad car wreck.

850
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:03,943
What?

851
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,078
Were you driving?

852
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,313
What difference does it make?

853
01:12:08,315 --> 01:12:09,480
People died.

854
01:12:09,482 --> 01:12:13,350
I saved the baby.

855
01:12:16,421 --> 01:12:19,455
What are you talking about?

856
01:12:24,395 --> 01:12:25,394
Nothing.

857
01:12:25,396 --> 01:12:28,663
Forget about it.

858
01:12:31,334 --> 01:12:32,966
I shouldn't have come here.

859
01:12:32,968 --> 01:12:34,834
I'm going.

860
01:12:34,836 --> 01:12:37,570
No. Come inside.

861
01:12:37,572 --> 01:12:38,571
Really?

862
01:12:38,573 --> 01:12:41,040
No. Just wait.

863
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:44,376
I'm clean.

864
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:47,378
Look, I can help you.

865
01:12:52,784 --> 01:12:55,751
Fh, narrating: We stayed
in that place for a week.

866
01:12:55,753 --> 01:12:57,419
We made love in the bed,

867
01:12:57,421 --> 01:13:01,456
ate steaks at the restaurant,

868
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:03,391
we fought, cried,

869
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:05,393
begged of one another,

870
01:13:05,395 --> 01:13:09,663
forgave, promised...

871
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:12,399
And...

872
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:15,501
Carried one another to heaven.

873
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:22,407
All the time, see?

874
01:13:25,545 --> 01:13:28,546
You're back.

875
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,853
Fh, narrating: Then one night,
after one of our fights,

876
01:13:36,855 --> 01:13:39,956
I left and walked the streets.

877
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:55,703
I'm sorry...

878
01:13:55,705 --> 01:13:57,871
My sweet angel.

879
01:13:57,873 --> 01:14:00,073
I'm sorry.

880
01:14:02,444 --> 01:14:05,411
What?

881
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:25,029
Baby...

882
01:14:28,701 --> 01:14:32,869
Michelle, wake up.
Wake up.

883
01:14:47,084 --> 01:14:48,850
Baby?

884
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,652
Baby!

885
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,186
Baby!

886
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:58,023
Wake up!

887
01:14:58,825 --> 01:15:00,757
My God!

888
01:15:03,228 --> 01:15:06,194
Wake up!
Wake up!

889
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:11,198
Come on!

890
01:16:54,201 --> 01:16:56,634
Hey, wake up.

891
01:16:56,636 --> 01:17:00,804
Hey, do you want to try a pill?

892
01:17:01,306 --> 01:17:04,173
What kind of pill?

893
01:17:05,743 --> 01:17:07,142
Psychedelic mushrooms,

894
01:17:07,144 --> 01:17:10,177
all ground up.

895
01:17:13,048 --> 01:17:16,782
That's the biggest pill I've ever seen.

896
01:17:18,819 --> 01:17:20,852
Look at it.

897
01:17:22,188 --> 01:17:24,821
It's like an egg.

898
01:17:26,825 --> 01:17:30,092
It's like
an easter-thing.

899
01:17:59,923 --> 01:18:04,859
Are you hearing any
unusual sounds or voices?

900
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:12,565
Not exactly.

901
01:18:12,566 --> 01:18:14,232
Not exactly.
Now what does that mean?

902
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:18,069
I'm not ready to go into that.

903
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:21,238
It's OK.

904
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,907
You'll be OK.

905
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:26,642
Gauze.

906
01:18:38,186 --> 01:18:40,252
OK, convulsing.

907
01:18:40,254 --> 01:18:42,687
We need an orderly in here, quick!

908
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:46,223
Nurse's voice, echoing:
Quick, quick, quick...

909
01:19:01,173 --> 01:19:04,907
Don't get tricky with the mustache.

910
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:09,210
OK, so far?

911
01:19:09,212 --> 01:19:11,145
Yeah, so far.

912
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:14,314
I'll do the other side.

913
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:16,415
That would make sense, partner.

914
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,755
There are some people out there

915
01:19:22,757 --> 01:19:24,256
who would like to know
a thing or 2 about you.

916
01:19:24,258 --> 01:19:29,227
Would you describe yourself
for those people?

917
01:19:30,363 --> 01:19:32,996
I don't know.

918
01:19:38,335 --> 01:19:40,935
I'm like a fat piece of shit, I guess.

919
01:19:40,937 --> 01:19:43,237
He's overweight.

920
01:19:43,239 --> 01:19:45,439
I've been shot twice, though.

921
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:46,273
Twice?

922
01:19:46,275 --> 01:19:48,241
Yeah, once by each wife.

923
01:19:48,243 --> 01:19:50,309
Total of 3 bullets

924
01:19:50,311 --> 01:19:52,311
making 4 holes.

925
01:19:52,313 --> 01:19:54,980
3 in, one out.

926
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:57,382
And you're still alive?

927
01:19:57,384 --> 01:19:59,717
Are you kidding?

928
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:01,144
No.

929
01:20:01,145 --> 01:20:02,570
Well, that is too bad

930
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:03,996
because it makes you sound awful stupid

931
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:05,422
asking if I'm alive 'cause obviously I am.

932
01:20:05,424 --> 01:20:07,090
Well...

933
01:20:07,092 --> 01:20:09,859
Maybe I mean alive...

934
01:20:09,861 --> 01:20:10,826
Careful.

935
01:20:10,828 --> 01:20:12,894
In a deeper sense.

936
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:15,930
You could be talking and still not be alive

937
01:20:15,932 --> 01:20:18,232
in a deeper sense.

938
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:19,266
Well, there's no deeper shit

939
01:20:19,268 --> 01:20:21,301
than the kind we're in right now,

940
01:20:21,303 --> 01:20:22,201
I'll tell you that.

941
01:20:22,203 --> 01:20:24,303
What are you talking about?

942
01:20:24,305 --> 01:20:25,871
It's great here.

943
01:20:25,873 --> 01:20:27,138
They even give you cigarettes.

944
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,340
Well, they didn't give me any yet.

945
01:20:35,214 --> 01:20:36,446
Here you go.

946
01:20:36,448 --> 01:20:38,315
Thanks.

947
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:40,183
Pay me back when you get yours?

948
01:20:41,452 --> 01:20:43,318
Maybe.

949
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,920
You got a wife?

950
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:49,322
No.
I mean... No.

951
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:52,291
I... but I just can't talk
about that right now.

952
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:54,126
Look, there's no problem.

953
01:20:54,128 --> 01:20:56,928
You don't have to talk about it.

954
01:21:02,334 --> 01:21:05,301
So, what did you say when she shot you?

955
01:21:05,303 --> 01:21:07,236
I said,
"you shot me."

956
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,205
Both times?
Both wives?

957
01:21:10,207 --> 01:21:12,040
Well, the first time I didn't say anything

958
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:14,142
'cause she shot me in the mouth.

959
01:21:14,144 --> 01:21:15,243
So you couldn't talk?

960
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:18,112
No, well, I mean, I was knocked out cold

961
01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:19,480
is the reason that I couldn't talk.

962
01:21:19,482 --> 01:21:23,183
And I still remember the dream that I had

963
01:21:23,185 --> 01:21:24,851
when I was knocked out that time.

964
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:26,219
What was the dream?

965
01:21:26,221 --> 01:21:29,322
Well, now, how can I explain that to you?

966
01:21:29,324 --> 01:21:30,690
I mean, it was a dream.

967
01:21:30,691 --> 01:21:32,057
It didn't mean a fucking thing, man.

968
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:35,227
Anything.
Anything at all.

969
01:21:35,462 --> 01:21:37,261
Well, there is one thing.

970
01:21:39,731 --> 01:21:42,198
The dream that I had keeps
coming back over and over.

971
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:44,334
And I mean when I'm awake.

972
01:21:44,336 --> 01:21:46,402
Every time I think about my first wife,

973
01:21:46,404 --> 01:21:49,271
I remember that she
pulled the trigger on me,

974
01:21:49,273 --> 01:21:51,873
then here comes the dream.

975
01:21:54,244 --> 01:21:56,844
Did you ever see that Elvis
Presley movie <i>follow that dream?</i>

976
01:21:56,846 --> 01:21:58,378
<i>Follow that dream,</i> I did see that,

977
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,282
and I was just gonna mention that.

978
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:03,416
You saw that?

979
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:06,185
No.
OK, you're all done.

980
01:22:08,088 --> 01:22:09,988
There was a song, <i>follow that dream,</i> too.

981
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:11,422
Look in the mirror.

982
01:22:11,424 --> 01:22:13,123
Right.

983
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:14,924
What do you see?

984
01:22:14,926 --> 01:22:19,227
How did I get so fat when I hardly eat?

985
01:22:19,229 --> 01:22:21,328
Is that all?

986
01:22:24,099 --> 01:22:26,532
Wrecked cars.

987
01:22:27,535 --> 01:22:29,268
Any people in them?

988
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:31,103
Yeah.

989
01:22:32,506 --> 01:22:35,307
Who?

990
01:22:35,308 --> 01:22:38,109
The people are just dead meat now, man.

991
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:40,377
Is that really how it is?

992
01:22:40,379 --> 01:22:41,544
How would I know how it is?

993
01:22:41,546 --> 01:22:44,313
I just got here and it stinks.

994
01:22:44,315 --> 01:22:46,332
Are you kidding?

995
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:48,350
Hey, they're pumping halidol by the quart.

996
01:22:48,352 --> 01:22:50,285
It's a playpen.

997
01:22:50,286 --> 01:22:52,219
Yeah, well, I'm older than you are.

998
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:53,822
You can still go on the wheel

999
01:22:53,823 --> 01:22:55,423
a couple more times, you know, and get off

1000
01:22:55,425 --> 01:22:59,260
with all your arms and legs stuck on right.

1001
01:22:59,262 --> 01:23:00,494
Not me.

1002
01:23:00,496 --> 01:23:03,530
Hey, you're doing fine.

1003
01:23:03,532 --> 01:23:09,168
Hey, talk into here.

1004
01:23:10,204 --> 01:23:13,305
Talk into your bullet hole?

1005
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:14,572
Yeah.

1006
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:17,241
Talk into my bullet hole,

1007
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:21,111
and tell me that I'm fine.

1008
01:23:27,318 --> 01:23:30,252
Fh, narrating: So, that...
that brings me up to...

1009
01:23:30,254 --> 01:23:33,321
to Phoenix.

1010
01:23:44,033 --> 01:23:46,299
I was a whimpering dog inside,

1011
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:48,301
nothing more than that.

1012
01:23:48,303 --> 01:23:52,238
When I found a job writing
the Beverly home newsletter,

1013
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,607
I believed I was happy about it

1014
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:56,342
because people...

1015
01:23:56,344 --> 01:24:00,412
counselors, narcotics
anonymous members and such...

1016
01:24:00,414 --> 01:24:05,316
seemed to think a job was a happy thing.

1017
01:24:05,318 --> 01:24:07,651
Not all of the people living
at the Beverly home were old.

1018
01:24:07,653 --> 01:24:09,686
Some were young, but paralyzed...

1019
01:24:09,687 --> 01:24:11,720
Some weren't past middle age,
but were already demented...

1020
01:24:11,723 --> 01:24:13,489
Others were fine, except they couldn't

1021
01:24:13,491 --> 01:24:15,307
be allowed out on the streets

1022
01:24:15,308 --> 01:24:17,124
with their impossible deformities.

1023
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:21,395
They made God look like a senseless maniac.

1024
01:24:21,397 --> 01:24:23,797
There's a price to be paid

1025
01:24:23,799 --> 01:24:26,432
for dreaming.

1026
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:33,805
Fh, narrating: You and I don't
know about these diseases

1027
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:37,058
until we get them,

1028
01:24:37,059 --> 01:24:40,310
in which case we will
also be put out of sight.

1029
01:24:43,815 --> 01:24:46,649
Well, here he is.
Gotta go.

1030
01:24:46,651 --> 01:24:48,083
How's it going?

1031
01:24:48,085 --> 01:24:49,384
Hi.

1032
01:24:49,386 --> 01:24:51,753
Here's the...

1033
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:53,722
There's the next issue.

1034
01:24:53,723 --> 01:24:55,690
You know, it's part of your job
to touch the residents here.

1035
01:24:55,692 --> 01:25:00,194
These people, more than anything,
they need to be touched.

1036
01:25:00,196 --> 01:25:02,629
OK.

1037
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:04,263
So, when you say hello to them,

1038
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,531
be sure to put your hands on them.

1039
01:25:06,533 --> 01:25:09,333
OK. OK.

1040
01:25:09,335 --> 01:25:11,501
OK.
OK.

1041
01:25:14,205 --> 01:25:16,305
OK.

1042
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,115
Fh, narrating: Each day,
on my way to Beverly home,

1043
01:25:27,117 --> 01:25:29,784
I'd walk by a row of houses
on the way to the bus stop.

1044
01:25:29,786 --> 01:25:35,089
And one day I heard the
sound of a woman singing.

1045
01:25:35,091 --> 01:25:37,291
She must not have understood

1046
01:25:37,293 --> 01:25:40,661
that somebody might be able to hear her.

1047
01:25:43,332 --> 01:25:46,332
I thought of mermaids.

1048
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:24,332
I used to walk around at night all alone,

1049
01:26:24,334 --> 01:26:27,301
and, you know, all screwed up.

1050
01:26:27,303 --> 01:26:28,635
You know?

1051
01:26:28,637 --> 01:26:30,903
You ever do that?

1052
01:26:30,905 --> 01:26:32,671
You know, walk past the houses

1053
01:26:32,673 --> 01:26:34,339
with the curtains in the windows

1054
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:35,541
and you feel like you're toting

1055
01:26:35,542 --> 01:26:37,808
a big cart of sins behind you?

1056
01:26:41,212 --> 01:26:44,613
And did you ever think
that behind those windows,

1057
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,382
behind those curtains,

1058
01:26:46,384 --> 01:26:50,285
that people are leading normal, happy lives?

1059
01:26:52,522 --> 01:26:54,588
Well, that's my goal now

1060
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:56,423
is to be one of those people

1061
01:26:56,425 --> 01:27:01,327
on the other side of those curtains.

1062
01:27:01,329 --> 01:27:03,629
Have my own window, you know?

1063
01:27:03,631 --> 01:27:05,364
Hi.

1064
01:27:05,366 --> 01:27:09,401
Thanks, Chris. Thanks a
lot for your story, man.

1065
01:27:09,403 --> 01:27:11,469
Don't forget, everybody...

1066
01:27:15,241 --> 01:27:16,206
I'll drive.

1067
01:27:16,208 --> 01:27:17,791
Is anyone going downtown?

1068
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:19,375
No, sorry, I'm not.
Are you going home?

1069
01:27:19,377 --> 01:27:21,810
Yeah, but I'm stopping by my mother's.

1070
01:27:21,812 --> 01:27:23,078
Where you headed?

1071
01:27:23,079 --> 01:27:24,345
Las colinas boulevard?

1072
01:27:24,347 --> 01:27:28,282
I'll take you there.
Come on.

1073
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:30,951
So what brought you here?

1074
01:27:30,953 --> 01:27:32,285
You mean to a.A.?

1075
01:27:32,287 --> 01:27:33,586
No, to Phoenix.

1076
01:27:33,588 --> 01:27:38,190
I don't know.
I thought my...

1077
01:27:38,192 --> 01:27:39,458
a couple of reasons.

1078
01:27:39,459 --> 01:27:40,725
For one, I thought my brother was here.

1079
01:27:40,727 --> 01:27:42,393
Well, is he?

1080
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:43,260
No.

1081
01:27:43,262 --> 01:27:45,095
It's right here.

1082
01:27:45,096 --> 01:27:46,929
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know where he is.

1083
01:27:46,932 --> 01:27:49,465
What was the other reason?

1084
01:27:49,467 --> 01:27:51,467
My...
my girl...

1085
01:27:51,469 --> 01:27:54,236
my girlfriend's not here...
around anymore.

1086
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:57,205
I mean, she oded.

1087
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:58,939
God.

1088
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:02,242
I know what that's like.

1089
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,610
It's open.

1090
01:28:07,647 --> 01:28:08,779
Can you hold this?

1091
01:28:08,781 --> 01:28:11,314
Yeah.
Thanks.

1092
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:27,562
Nurse!

1093
01:28:27,997 --> 01:28:29,930
Here you are.
Let me help you.

1094
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:31,765
Get off the chair!

1095
01:28:31,767 --> 01:28:34,234
Off the chair!
Get your hands off!

1096
01:28:34,236 --> 01:28:36,669
OK. OK. OK.

1097
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:38,436
Help me.

1098
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,371
I'm stuck.

1099
01:28:42,575 --> 01:28:44,308
All right, there you go.

1100
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:45,309
Off the chair!

1101
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:48,345
I know where I'm going.

1102
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:28,314
Sometimes her husband
came home before I left.

1103
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:32,484
Seeing them in their getup, I understood.

1104
01:29:32,486 --> 01:29:34,318
They were amish.

1105
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:40,489
Or more likely mennonites.

1106
01:30:01,477 --> 01:30:02,477
What?

1107
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:07,079
I can't...
I'm sorry, but...

1108
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:09,047
I... I can't understand.

1109
01:30:09,049 --> 01:30:12,650
It's all right, Max.
It's all right.

1110
01:30:12,652 --> 01:30:14,418
Here, let go.

1111
01:30:16,321 --> 01:30:18,521
All right, fine.

1112
01:30:19,657 --> 01:30:21,657
Max got a letter today.

1113
01:30:21,659 --> 01:30:24,660
His wife's divorcing him.

1114
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:27,662
She dropped him off here 2
years ago and never came back.

1115
01:30:28,998 --> 01:30:33,499
Here. I think
you'd better wait outside.

1116
01:30:35,703 --> 01:30:38,070
Come on now.
Let's go inside.

1117
01:30:51,117 --> 01:30:53,417
No more pretending for him.

1118
01:30:53,419 --> 01:30:57,888
He was completely and openly a mess.

1119
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:02,025
Meanwhile the rest of us go on
trying to fool each other.

1120
01:32:12,824 --> 01:32:14,290
Take what you need.

1121
01:32:39,682 --> 01:32:41,214
Shit!

1122
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:48,787
I had one boyfriend
who got killed by a train.

1123
01:32:48,789 --> 01:32:50,555
His car stalled on the tracks.

1124
01:32:50,557 --> 01:32:53,190
And he thought he could get his motor firing

1125
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:57,194
before the engine caught
him, but he was wrong.

1126
01:32:57,196 --> 01:33:02,198
My first husband fell through
a thousand evergreen branches

1127
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,233
in the mountains up around chollo.

1128
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:11,271
He was a tree surgeon,
and he crushed his head.

1129
01:33:11,273 --> 01:33:14,907
I had a boyfriend in the marines
who got it in viet nam.

1130
01:33:14,909 --> 01:33:18,243
Well, 2 boyfriends who died in the marines.

1131
01:33:18,245 --> 01:33:22,313
Another one named Zack got
killed in a one-car accident...

1132
01:33:22,315 --> 01:33:26,734
Right out of basic training.

1133
01:33:26,735 --> 01:33:31,154
Almost... Every man I've ever
loved ended up getting killed.

1134
01:33:31,156 --> 01:33:33,956
I told you about my third husband, didn't I?

1135
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:37,592
The one who almost bought the pet shop?

1136
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:48,901
He was the one who wrote
to me he was going to o.D.

1137
01:33:48,903 --> 01:33:50,168
You know, if it wasn't for him dying young,

1138
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:54,238
I probably'd still be out
there with that old man.

1139
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:57,107
I was married to a black guy once,

1140
01:33:57,109 --> 01:33:58,641
but...

1141
01:33:59,210 --> 01:34:00,275
He got shanked in prison.

1142
01:34:00,277 --> 01:34:04,611
That means stabbed.
Stabbed to death.

1143
01:34:07,282 --> 01:34:08,981
Doesn't it make you grateful

1144
01:34:08,983 --> 01:34:13,818
because they were people just like us?

1145
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:15,953
Only unluckier.

1146
01:34:32,303 --> 01:34:35,871
I have an announcement to make...

1147
01:34:35,873 --> 01:34:37,205
And an apology.

1148
01:34:37,207 --> 01:34:41,275
It seems that I forgot,

1149
01:34:41,277 --> 01:34:42,342
left out,

1150
01:34:42,344 --> 01:34:45,278
somebody's birthday last month.

1151
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:48,681
Isaac christopherson...

1152
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:52,184
Turned an impressive 70.

1153
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:53,186
Hoo.

1154
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,654
Hoo!

1155
01:34:58,189 --> 01:35:01,323
Many happy returns to you, Isaac.

1156
01:35:01,325 --> 01:35:03,191
There will be...

1157
01:35:03,193 --> 01:35:08,162
6 birthday people next month.

1158
01:35:08,164 --> 01:35:10,965
6?
6?

1159
01:35:10,966 --> 01:35:13,767
And watch for the November <i>Beverly home news</i>

1160
01:35:13,769 --> 01:35:15,401
to find out who they are.

1161
01:35:15,403 --> 01:35:19,304
Hoo!
Way to go!

1162
01:35:19,306 --> 01:35:21,706
Hoo.

1163
01:35:32,984 --> 01:35:34,249
Hey, old friend.

1164
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:37,352
Hey!

1165
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,465
Hi.

1166
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:57,134
Hi.

1167
01:35:57,136 --> 01:35:58,468
How are you?

1168
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:00,269
I'm fine.
What about you?

1169
01:36:00,271 --> 01:36:03,938
I was... I was hoping
maybe I'd see you here.

1170
01:36:05,341 --> 01:36:06,273
Want this?

1171
01:36:06,275 --> 01:36:08,742
OK, thanks.

1172
01:36:08,744 --> 01:36:10,276
Yeah?

1173
01:36:12,246 --> 01:36:14,279
You weren't at the last couple of meetings.

1174
01:36:14,281 --> 01:36:17,348
Yeah. Well, I don't
come to all the meetings.

1175
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,883
It was really my husband's...

1176
01:36:19,885 --> 01:36:21,117
my last husband...

1177
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,352
I just come for the support.

1178
01:36:23,354 --> 01:36:27,022
I didn't know.

1179
01:36:27,024 --> 01:36:28,923
So how 'bout you?

1180
01:36:28,925 --> 01:36:29,823
How's it going?

1181
01:36:29,825 --> 01:36:32,959
I'm...
It's all right.

1182
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:35,261
I'm taking a new approach to life.

1183
01:36:35,263 --> 01:36:38,764
I'm not stealing.

1184
01:36:38,966 --> 01:36:43,301
I'm trying to see each task
through to its end,

1185
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:46,237
that kind of thing, you know, simple?

1186
01:36:47,406 --> 01:36:50,273
That's good.

1187
01:36:58,414 --> 01:36:59,846
Do you dance?

1188
01:36:59,848 --> 01:37:01,747
I mean, do y...
would you...

1189
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:03,248
do you think you'd like to dance?

1190
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,350
Well, usually, I just watch.

1191
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:08,753
Yeah. Yeah.

1192
01:37:09,122 --> 01:37:11,021
Yeah.
But OK.

1193
01:37:11,023 --> 01:37:12,288
Really?
Sure.

1194
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:15,391
It's no big thing.

1195
01:37:20,063 --> 01:37:21,063
Here the...

1196
01:37:21,998 --> 01:37:23,998
no.
That's OK.

1197
01:38:13,907 --> 01:38:17,108
That's nice.
Just like that.

1198
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:40,262
Damn.

1199
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:44,098
God.

1200
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,233
Fuck it.

1201
01:39:05,918 --> 01:39:08,518
As for the mennonite couple
after about a month,

1202
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,321
you could almost say
our schedules were coordinated.

1203
01:39:12,323 --> 01:39:15,257
I just got so I enjoyed seeing them

1204
01:39:15,259 --> 01:39:17,225
sitting in their living room talking...

1205
01:39:17,227 --> 01:39:21,262
Or saying grace or eating their supper.

1206
01:39:33,308 --> 01:39:35,374
You're not being fair.

1207
01:39:38,011 --> 01:39:40,244
I don't wanna talk now.

1208
01:41:03,162 --> 01:41:05,195
I was still learning to live sober.

1209
01:41:05,197 --> 01:41:07,497
And in fact, I was often confused.

1210
01:41:07,499 --> 01:41:11,967
But I was in a little
better shape every day.

1211
01:41:12,369 --> 01:41:14,168
I was getting my looks back.

1212
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:19,406
And this was, all in all,
a happy time for me.

1213
01:41:19,674 --> 01:41:21,273
I didn't spend a lot of time there,

1214
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:24,777
but I felt about the circular
hallway of the Beverly home

1215
01:41:24,779 --> 01:41:30,481
as I felt about the place where...

1216
01:41:30,483 --> 01:41:33,417
Between our lives on this earth we go back

1217
01:41:33,419 --> 01:41:37,854
to mingle with other souls
waiting to be born.

1218
01:41:44,595 --> 01:41:47,395
All these... Weirdos

1219
01:41:47,397 --> 01:41:51,799
and me getting a little better every day

1220
01:41:51,801 --> 01:41:54,868
right in the middle of 'em.

1221
01:41:56,571 --> 01:41:58,837
I had never known...

1222
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:04,842
I had never even imagined for a heartbeat...

1223
01:42:04,844 --> 01:42:11,348
That there might be a place in
the world for people like us.
