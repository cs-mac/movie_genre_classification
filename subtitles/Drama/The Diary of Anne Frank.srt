1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:05,005

2
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,165

3
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,168

4
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:47,723

5
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,806

6
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,364

7
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,733
Mr. Frank.

8
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,818
Mr. Frank?

9
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,951
Kraler?

10
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,165
Mr. Kraler.

11
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,251
Miep.

12
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,005
My good friends.

13
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,007
Oh, it-

14
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:54,344
it is so good
to see you home.

15
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,429
We had heard nothing.

16
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,685
I'm alone.

17
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,688
You must
come home
with us...

18
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,773
and rest now.

19
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,403
You must stay with us.
No, Miep. I can't
stay in Amsterdam.

20
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:16,491
Mr. Frank,
this is your home.

21
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,493
Amsterdam
is your home.

22
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,996
It has too many
memories for me.

23
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,998
Everywhere there's
something, Miep.
Everywhere.

24
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,834
Even seeing
you and Mr. Kraler.

25
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,299
Forgive me. I shouldn't
talk to you like this
after all that you did.

26
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,384
We would
do it again.

27
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,264
Everything's gone-
the book.

28
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,266
They took
everything...

29
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,268
except some papers.

30
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,854
We saved
your letters
and papers.

31
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,237
Please burn them.

32
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,239
Burn everything.

33
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:59,242
I- I...

34
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:03,455
told Anne
if I got back here,
I'd find her book.

35
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,292
Anne's diary?
It's where she left it.

36
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,971
"The ninth of July, 1942."

37
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:06,643
1942.
Is it possible, Miep?

38
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,521
Only three years ago.

39
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,525
"Dear Diary,
since you and I are going
to be great friends,

40
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,028
"I will start
by telling you
all about myself.

41
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,280
"My name is Anne Frank.

42
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,282
"I am 13 years old.

43
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,284
"I was born in Germany,

44
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:25,286
"but since my family
is Jewish,

45
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,790
"we emigrated to Holland
when Hitler came to power.

46
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,793
"Things went well for us...

47
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,796
"until the war came,
and the German occupation.

48
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,799
"Then things got very bad
for the Jews.

49
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,428
You could not do this,
and you could not do that.

50
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,431
We had to wear
yellow stars.

51
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,766
I had to turn in my bike.

52
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,769
I couldn't go
to a Dutch school anymore.

53
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:53,273
I couldn't go to the movies
or ride in an automobile,

54
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,275
or even on a streetcar,

55
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,111
and a million other things.

56
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:02,782
But somehow we children
still managed to have fun.

57
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:06,119
This morning Father
woke me at 5:00...

58
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,622
and told me
to hurry and get dressed.

59
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:12,292
We were going into hiding.

60
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,628
I was to put on
as many clothes as I could.

61
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:19,716
It would look too suspicious
if we walked along
carrying suitcases.

62
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,720
We were going to disappear,

63
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,473
vanish into thin air.

64
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,730
I'm living
a great adventure.

65
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,656
Three other people
were coming in with us.

66
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:46,493
Father knew them,
but we had never met them.

67
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,578

68
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,381
Something's
happened.

69
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,342
They have three miles
to walk.

70
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,886
Mother-
They've been
arrested. I know.

71
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,514
Will you
stop that?
Mother! Father!

72
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,891
We're here.

73
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,976
See?

74
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,439
Mr. Van Daan.
Hello, hello.

75
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:19,609
Mrs. Van Daan. Peter.
Mr. Frank.

76
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,612
There were too many
of the Green Police
on the streets.

77
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,073
We had to take
the long way around.

78
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,494
Did you introduce yourself?
My daughter Anne. My wife Edith.
Hello.

79
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,496
Margot.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
Hello.

80
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,499
Oh, and this is
our son Peter.

81
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:39,420
So, now, please,
let us take off
some of these clothes.

82
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,422
Good morning.

83
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,925
Hello, Mr. Kraler.
Good morning,
Mr. Kraler.

84
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,594
Mr. Frank.
Ah, you're all here.
That is good.

85
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,097
We had hoped to have
everything in order.

86
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,599
Please, Mr. Kraler,
don't even think of it.

87
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,561
After all, we'll have
plenty of leisure to arrange
everything ourselves.

88
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:57,605
I brought some sandwiches
for your lunch.
Thank you, Miep.

89
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,567
The canned goods are here,
and your stores
of dried beans and potatoes.

90
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:04,112
I'll get you ration books
this afternoon.
Ration books?

91
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,448
If they see our names
on ration books,
they'll know we're here.

92
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,702
Don't worry.
It won't be your names
that'll be on them.

93
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,080

94
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,082
Father!
The Westertoren!

95
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,167
Anne, no!

96
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,713
You must never
touch a curtain.
Never.

97
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,216
No one must ever
touch a curtain,
day or night.

98
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:28,761
If someone on the streets
should look up, or someone
in those houses should see,

99
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,680
we would be lost.

100
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,683
Please remember,
it's not only our lives
that are at stake,

101
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,643
but also Miep's
and Mr. Kraler's.

102
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,605
You have but 13 minutes
to get settled.
Thank you.

103
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:43,568
Miep or I will be up each day
to bring you food and news.
Come, Miep. We must go.

104
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,653
Good-bye for now.

105
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,990
How can we thank you?

106
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,494
I never thought
I'd live to see the day...

107
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,497
when a man like Mr. Frank
would have to go into hiding.

108
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,750
When you think of the-

109
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,793
Good-bye.
Thank you,
Mr. Kraler.

110
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,879
Good-bye, Miep.
Good-bye.

111
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,761
Good-bye.

112
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,812
Anne!
It's all right.
I have on three more.

113
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,814
Excuse me,
Mr. Frank.

114
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,484
What did he mean,
just 13 minutes?

115
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,486
Before
the workmen come.

116
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,489
Now, while the men are
in the building below,

117
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,491
we must have
complete quiet.

118
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,993
Every sound can be
heard down there,

119
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,996
not only in the offices
but in the workrooms too.

120
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,957
The men come at about 8:30,
they leave at about 5:30,

121
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,461
so to be perfectly safe,
from 8:00 in the morning
until 6:00 in the evening...

122
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,964
we must move about up here
only when it is
absolutely necessary,

123
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,966
and then
in stocking feet.

124
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,969
We must not speak
above a whisper.
We must not run any water.

125
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,473
We cannot use the sink
or even- forgive me-
the W.C.

126
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,934
The pipes go down
through the workrooms.

127
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,062
No trash must ever be-

128
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,822

129
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,408

130
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:22,542
No trash must ever be
thrown out which might reveal
that someone is living up here.

131
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,544
Not even
a potato peeling.

132
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,547
We must burn everything
in this stove at night.

133
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:32,218
This is the way that we must
live until it is over,
if we are to survive.

134
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,721
Until it is over.

135
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,724
After 6:00
we can move about.

136
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,018
We can talk and laugh,
have our supper,
read, play games,

137
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,020
just as we would
at home.

138
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:47,525
Now I think it would be wise
if we all went to our rooms
and were settled before 8:00.

139
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,944
Mrs. Van Daan,
you and your husband
will be upstairs.

140
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,947
I regret that
there's no place up there
for Peter,

141
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,949
but he'll be here,
near us.

142
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,953
- And where am I?
- You and Margot will be in there, Annele.

143
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,414
Excuse me, Mr. Frank.
Yes?

144
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,585
Where do you
and Mrs. Frank sleep?
This room is also our bedroom.

145
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,545
Oh, no.
You take the upstairs.

146
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,590
It's not right.
It's your place.
We'll sleep down here.

147
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,384
I've thought this out for weeks.
It's the best arrangement.
The only arrangement.

148
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,386
Uh, Edith?

149
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,388
Hmm?

150
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:19,390
You must have
some rest, dear.

151
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,350
You didn't
close your eyes
last night.

152
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,145
Please go in
the girls' room with Margot.
How about Anne?

153
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,149
I feel fine.
I'm going to help Father.

154
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,401
This way,
Mrs. Van Daan.

155
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,573
Excuse me.

156
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,702
Up here.

157
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,569

158
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,910

159
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,955
Mr. Frank.

160
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,541
- Mr. Frank?
- Peter?

161
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,503
- Do I still have time
to get some water for my cat?
- Have you got a cat?

162
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,422
Go ahead, but be quick.
You only have five minutes.

163
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,758
He couldn't live
without that cat.

164
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,100
I didn't know
you had a cat.

165
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,102
I love cats.

166
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,938
What's its name?
Mouschi.

167
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,941
What is it? Mouschi.
A him or her?

168
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,944
It's a tom, and it
doesn't like strangers.

169
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,030
Well, I'll have to stop
being a stranger, won't I?
Is he fixed?

170
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,032
No.

171
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,536
Well, you ought to
have him fixed to
keep him from fighting.

172
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,913
What a nice cat.

173
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,917
Where do you
go to school?

174
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,919
Jewish Secondary.

175
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,921
That's where
Margot and I go.

176
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,923
Yeah, I know.

177
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,925
I've never
seen you around.

178
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,927
I used to see you
sometimes.

179
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,929
You did?

180
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,932
But why didn't you
ever come over?

181
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,894
Oh, I don't know.
I'm sort of a lone wolf.

182
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,187
Can't be
a lone wolf here.

183
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,986
Wonder what our friends
will say when
we don't show up today?

184
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,905
I had a date
with Sanne.

185
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,865
Do you know
Sanne de Vries?

186
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,910
No.
Sanne's
my best friend.

187
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,746
She's thin like me.

188
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,541
They always yell at us,
"Anne and Sanne,
the skinny bananas."

189
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,837
You took off
your star.

190
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,757
That's right.

191
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,677
You can't do that.
They'll arrest you if you
go out without your star.

192
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,679
Who's going out?

193
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,681

194
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,642
Help me.

195
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,727
I'm helping.

196
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,523
- What are you going to do with it?
- Burn it.

197
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,610
That's funny.
I don't think I could burn mine.

198
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,612
I don't know why.

199
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:23,199
You couldn't?
Something they make you wear
so they can kick you around?

200
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,201
I know.

201
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:29,914
But, after all,
it is the Star of David, isn't it?

202
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,376
Annele?
It's almost 8:00.

203
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:39,256
Don't you want to come
and sit with us, Peter?
It's going to be a long day.

204
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,384
No, thanks.
This is fine.

205
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,470
You won't forget
to take off your shoes,
will you?

206
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,475
Peter.

207
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,061
It's nice
to have you with us.

208
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,356
Yes, Mr. Frank.

209
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,527
See you later.

210
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:05,199
Do you know he went to
the same school that-

211
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,419

212
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,196
It's comforting to think that
Mr. Kraler and his secretary...

213
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,366
are down there below us
in the office.

214
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,368
Our protectors,
we call them.

215
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,370

216
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:54,874
I asked Father
what would happen to them
if anyone found out...

217
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,876
they were hiding us.

218
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,213
Father said they would suffer
the same fate that we would.

219
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,549

220
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,093
We are over
an old spice factory.

221
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,513
You can smell the spices
all through the building.

222
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,861
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

223
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:27,031
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

224
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,326
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

225
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,496
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

226
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,290
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

227
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,375

228
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,027

229
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,664

230
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,516

231
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,360

232
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:05,254

233
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:15,598

234
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:07,399
I read A Tale of Two Cities
through in that first day.

235
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,488
"It is a far,
far better thing I do...

236
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,115
"than I have ever done.

237
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,119
"It is a far, far better
rest that I go to...

238
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:22,039
"than I have ever known.

239
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,084
The end."

240
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:28,712
It was the saddest book
I ever read.

241
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,942

242
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,333

243
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,380
It is us,
Miep and Kraler.

244
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,304

245
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,806
Good evening, Mr. Kraler.
Good evening, Miep.

246
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,766

247
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,810
Evening, Annele.
Hello. Hello.

248
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,603
Hello.

249
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,605
Oh, Mr. Frank.
Yes?

250
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,607
This is the box
you asked for.
Thank you.

251
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,652
Good evening, Mr. Kraler.
My dear friends,
you are so quiet up here.

252
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,738
I thought
you'd gone out
for a walk.

253
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,574
Can you imagine me?
I didn't talk.

254
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:42,745
I hardly moved for
one whole day. I wish they
could hear that at school.

255
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,747
- Mouschi! Mouschi!

256
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,082
- Peter!

257
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,460
Mouschi!

258
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,587

259
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,882
Shh!
Shh. Annele.

260
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,343
Annele!
Peter,
I'm warning you.

261
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,429
[Mr. Frank]
Please, quiet.
Margot. Margot!

262
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,391
What are these?
You don't have to
whisper.

263
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,811

264
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,855

265
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,486
Oh, there you are.

266
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,571
It's such a nice cat.

267
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,921
Thank you.

268
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,006
You're welcome.

269
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,886
Annele.
There's a box there.

270
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,971
Will you open it,
please?

271
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:47,184
You know how I'm going
to think of it here?

272
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:51,063
As a boardinghouse.
A very peculiar
boardinghouse.

273
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,899
Father, my film stars!

274
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,152
I was wondering
where they were.

275
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:03,158
And Queen Wilhelmina.
How wonderful.

276
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,160
There's
something more.

277
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,246
Go on.
Look further.

278
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:21,260
A diary.

279
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,012
I've never had a diary,

280
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:27,015
and I've always wanted one.

281
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,518
Ohh.

282
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,520
A pencil?

283
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,647
I'm going downstairs
to get a pencil.

284
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,150
Anne, no.
But there's nobody
down there now.

285
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,403
It doesn't matter.
Don't ever go
beyond that door.
Ever?

286
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:42,489
Never.
I'm sorry, Anne.
It isn't safe.

287
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,663
I see.
It'll be hard.
I know that.

288
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,665
But always remember this,
Anneke:

289
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:55,669
there are no walls, no locks,
no bolts that anyone
can put on your mind.

290
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,672
As a matter of fact,
just between us, Annele,

291
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,674
being here has
certain advantages
for you.

292
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,678
For instance, remember that
battle you had with your mother
on the subject of overshoes?

293
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:07,306
You said you'd rather die
than wear overshoes.

294
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,308
Remember?
Well, what happened?

295
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,311
In the end,
you had to wear them.

296
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,314
Now, for as long
as we are here you won't
have to wear overshoes.

297
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,316
Isn't that good?

298
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,318
And the piano?

299
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,321
You won't have to
practice on the piano.

300
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:26,408
I tell you, this is going
to be a fine life for you.

301
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:54,436
It's an odd idea for someone
like me to keep a diary.

302
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,773
Not only because
I have never done so before,

303
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:02,778
but because it seems to me
that neither I, nor for
that matter anyone else,

304
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:08,492
will be interested
in the unbosomings
of a 13-year-old schoolgirl.

305
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:12,496
Still,
what does that matter?

306
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,706
I want to write.

307
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,792
But more than that,

308
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,795
I want to bring out
all kinds of things...

309
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,881
that lie buried
deep in my heart.

310
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:27,094
First of all, I expect
I should be describing...

311
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:30,055
what it's like
to go into hiding.

312
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:33,183
But I don't really
know yet myself.

313
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:38,897
I only know it's funny
never to be able
to go outdoors,

314
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,899
never to breathe
fresh air,

315
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,901

316
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,487
never to run
and shout and jump.

317
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:56,248
Wednesday,
the 23rd of September, 1942.

318
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,917
The news of the war is good.

319
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,712
Stalingrad
is still holding out.

320
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:05,841
The Russian offensive continues
in the Moscow area.

321
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,771
It's safe now.
The last workman has left.
Whee!

322
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:22,482
Anne!
I'm first
for the W.C.

323
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,111
It's 6:00, Margot.
School is over.

324
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,113
Where are
my shoes?

325
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,782

326
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,535
Have you seen my shoes?

327
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,705
- What shoes?
- You're gonna be sorry.

328
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,749
- I am?
- Anne dear.

329
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,335
Wait till I get you.
I'm waiting.

330
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,257
Stop! Peter. Ouch!

331
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,884
Anne! Peter!

332
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,387

333
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:59,102
Hey,
where are you going?

334
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,104
Going to give Mouschi
his dinner.

335
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,106
Peter!

336
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:06,610
Anne dear, I think
you shouldn't play
like that with Peter.

337
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,612
It's not dignified.

338
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,615
Who wants to be dignified?
I don't want to be dignified.

339
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:15,327
You complain that I don't
treat you like a grown-up,
but when I do you resent it.

340
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,412
I only want
some fun.

341
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:22,125
I don't know
what's the matter
with that boy.

342
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:29,299
Give him a little time.
He isn't used to girls.

343
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,635
Time?
Isn't two months time?

344
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,637
I could cry.

345
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:36,640
I wonder where Miep is.
She's usually so prompt.

346
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,226

347
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,861

348
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,742

349
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,748
Margot, come and dance
with me, please.

350
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,751
I've got more work to do,
Anne.

351
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,089
You know,
we're going to forget
how to dance.

352
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:11,842
When we get out,
we won't remember a thing.

353
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:15,846

354
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,141

355
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,229

356
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,815

357
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,445

358
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,867
Where's Peter?

359
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,286
Where would he be?
With his cat.

360
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,872
He hasn't finished
his lessons, has he?

361
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:44,791
Peter.

362
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,044
- Peter!
- What is it?

363
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,839
Your mother says
to come out!

364
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,842
I'm giving Mouschi
his dinner.
I'm feeding my cat.

365
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:57,179
You know what your father says
about you wasting
all your time with that cat.

366
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:01,141
I haven't even looked
at him since lunch.
I'm only telling you.

367
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,978
I'll feed him.

368
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:08,440
You stay out of here.
And I mean out.

369
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:12,652
Is that any way for you
to talk to your little girlfriend?

370
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,156
Mother,

371
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,034
I asked you,
would you please not say that?

372
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,203
Look, he's blushing.

373
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,996
He's blushing.

374
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,792
Please. I'm not, but-
Leave me alone, will you.

375
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,544
What did I say?
You act like it's something
to be ashamed of.

376
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,547
It's nothing
to be ashamed of to have
a little girlfriend.

377
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:35,759
- That's crazy. She's only 13.
- So what? And you're 16. It's just perfect.

378
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,720
Your father is 10 years
older than I am.

379
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:42,974
Mr. Frank, I warn you,
this war lasts much longer,
we're gonna be related.

380
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,726
Mazel tov.

381
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:48,021
I haven't seen my cat
since lunch.

382
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,106
I'm giving Mouschi
his dinner.

383
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,359
My little Mouschi.

384
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,362
I couldn't live
without my precious Mouschi.

385
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:58,240
You wonderful cat,
you!

386
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,451
All right,
Miss Quack-Quack.

387
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,162
What's that?
Miss Quack-Quack!

388
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:07,457
Heard all about you.
How you talk so much in class,
they call you Miss Quack-Quack.

389
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,877
You're the most intolerable,
insufferable boy I ever met!
Quack-quack-quack!

390
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,339
I'll give it to you
good!
Quack!

391
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,341
- Ooh!

392
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:19,219
Anne dear,
you're hot.

393
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,513
You're warm.
Are you feeling all right?

394
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,558
Mother, please.
You don't have a fever,
do you?

395
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,561
No.
You know we can't call
a doctor here, ever.

396
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:30,564
There's only one thing to do:
watch carefully.

397
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:34,234
Prevent an illness
before it comes.
Let me see your tongue.

398
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,736
Mother, this is
perfectly absurd.

399
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,155
Anne dear,
don't be such a baby.

400
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:42,701
Let me see
your tongue.

401
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,661
Otto.
Anne.

402
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,998
You hear your mother,
don't you?
Come on, open up.

403
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:51,835
Quack.

404
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,837

405
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,839
Anne.

406
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,924
Otto.
Anne.

407
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,730
You're all right.

408
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:17,777

409
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:24,200
I think there's nothing
the matter with our Anne
that a ride on her bike...

410
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:27,829
or a visit with
her friend Sanne de Vries
wouldn't cure.

411
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,831
Isn't that so, Annele?

412
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,917

413
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,173
I keep wishing
that Peter was a girl...

414
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,175
instead of a boy.

415
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:43,261
Then I'd have someone
to talk to.

416
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,981
With all the boys
in the world,

417
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:58,068
why did I have to get
locked up with him?

418
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:03,114

419
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,126
Is it someone?

420
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,212
Is it Miep?

421
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,636
It's strange
we don't hear.

422
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,638
Maybe she got hurt-
the flak.

423
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,641
She'll come.
I wish
she'd get here.

424
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,726
I'm going crazy
without cigarettes.

425
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,608
Anne, you got an "excellent"
in your history paper today...

426
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,610
and a "very good"
in Latin.

427
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,612
Yes, but how about
algebra?

428
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,614
Well, I have
a confession to make.

429
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:47,617
Up until now I managed
to stay ahead of you
in algebra.

430
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:49,619
Today you caught up
with me.

431
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:52,122
We'll leave it to Margot
to correct.

432
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,791
Isn't algebra vile,
Father?
Vile.

433
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,751
How did I do?

434
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,129
Excellent,
of course.
Anne, Anne, please.

435
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:02,465
Your French composition today
was wonderful, just wonderful.

436
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,968
Mrs. Van Daan,
may I try it on?

437
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,970
No, Anne.

438
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,139
It's all right.
Really.

439
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:12,142
But please,
be careful with it.

440
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:16,146
My father gave me this coat
the year before he died.

441
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,399
He always bought me
the best money could buy.

442
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:55,310
Mrs. Van Daan, did you have
a lot of boyfriends...

443
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,312
before you
were married?

444
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,314
Anne, that's
a personal question.

445
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:02,317
It's not courteous
to ask personal questions.

446
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:04,319
I don't mind.

447
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,572
Anneke, our house
was always swarming
with boys.

448
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:11,284
- When I was a young girl-
- Oh, no. Not again.

449
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,828
Shut up!

450
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:19,250
One summer we had a big house
in Hilversum.

451
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:22,170
The boys-

452
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:30,095
The boys would come
buzzing around like bees
around a jam pot.

453
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,097
When I was 17-

454
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:35,100
Well, we were wearing
our skirts very short
in those days,

455
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,435
and I had
such good-looking legs.

456
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,023
I still have. I may not be
as pretty as I used to be,
but I still have my legs.

457
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,025
How about it,
Mr. Frank?

458
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,196
All right,
all right.
We see them.

459
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,241
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking Mr. Frank.

460
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,992
Mother,
for heaven's sakes.

461
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,994
Oh, I embarrass you too,
do I?

462
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,124
Well, I only hope
the girl you marry
has as good.

463
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:03,711
Anneke, my father
used to worry about me with
all the boys hanging around.

464
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:06,714
And he used to say to me,
"If any of those boys
get fresh,

465
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,716
"you just say to him,

466
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:12,762
'Remember, Mr. So-and-so,
remember, I am a lady."'

467
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:15,223
Look at you,
talking that way
in front of her.

468
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:18,518
Don't you know she puts it
all down in that damned diary?
So what if she does?

469
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,728
I'm only telling
the truth.

470
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:24,732
Haven't you
finished yet?

471
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,985
No.

472
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:28,778
Oh. The thinker.

473
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,780
Leave him alone.

474
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,825
All right, all right.
I'm a dunce, a hopeless case.

475
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,827
You're not hopeless.

476
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,706
It's just that you haven't
got anyone to help you
like Father helps Anne and me.

477
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,668
Well, if I-
Well, if we could help-

478
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,171
What about it, Peter?
Would you like to study with us?

479
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:49,007
Shall we make
our school coeducational?

480
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,593
Thanks. Yes.

481
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:55,263
Mr. Frank, you are an angel,
an absolute angel.

482
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,683
Why didn't I meet you
before I met that one there?

483
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:02,604
I... think
it might be better...

484
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:05,106
if you went
into your room,
Peter, to work.

485
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:07,108
Excuse me.

486
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:11,571
You listen to Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank is
a highly educated man.

487
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,035
It's after 8:00.
Where are they?

488
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:20,788
At least one of them
should have come.
They'll come. Don't worry.

489
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:23,791
Don't tell me.
I know something's wrong.

490
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:27,253
Isn't it bad enough around here
without you sprawling
all over the place?

491
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:30,215
If you didn't smoke
all the time, you wouldn't
be so bad-tempered.

492
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:33,760
Do you see me smoking?
Oh, you already smoked up
all the cigarettes?

493
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:36,763
One package.
Miep only brought me
one package.

494
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:39,641
It's a filthy habit,
and this is a good time
to break yourself of it.

495
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:42,644
- Oh, stop it.
- You're smoking up
all our money!

496
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,104
Will you shut up!

497
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,652
And what are you
staring at?

498
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:54,739
I never heard grown-ups
quarrel like that before.

499
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,741
I thought
only children quarreled.

500
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:59,786
This isn't a quarrel.
It's a discussion.

501
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,122
- And I never heard children
so rude before.
- I, rude?

502
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:05,124
Yes!
Anne,
drink your milk.

503
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:09,087
The trouble with you is,
you've been spoiled.
You need a spanking.

504
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:12,090
Remember, Mr. So-and-so,
that I am a lady.

505
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:15,093
Mmm, you're
the most aggravating-

506
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:18,096
Why aren't you nice and quiet
like your sister Margot?

507
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,598
Why do you
have to show off
all the time?

508
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:24,102
Let me give you
a little advice, young lady-
men don't like that in a girl.

509
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:27,563
Do you know that?
A man likes a girl who will
listen to him once in a while.

510
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:31,609
A domestic girl
who loves to cook and clean-
I'd cut my throat first!

511
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:33,945
I'd open my veins.

512
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,322
I'm going to be
remarkable.

513
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:40,493
I'm going to Paris
to study music and art.
Paris? Yeah, yeah.

514
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:44,747
I'm going to be an actress,
or a writer, or a dancer.

515
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:46,833

516
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,876
Look what you did.
I'm so sorry.

517
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,337
You clumsy little fool!

518
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:54,382
This is the coat
my father gave me!
I'm so sorry.

519
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:57,385
You ruined it.
What do you care?
Ruined it!

520
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:00,388
I could kill you!
I could just kill you!

521
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,891
Petronella.
Liebchen, Liebchen.

522
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,893
Petronella.

523
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:07,895
It's only a coat.

524
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,898
Anne, you must not
behave in that way.

525
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:14,193
It was an accident.
Anyone can have an accident.

526
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:17,196
I don't mean that.
I mean the answering back.

527
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:19,198
You must not
answer back.

528
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,200
They're
our guests.

529
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:24,537
You don't hear Margot
getting into any arguments
with them, do you?

530
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,040
Try to be
like Margot.

531
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:31,044
And have them
walk all over me the way
they do her? No, thanks.

532
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:34,047
I don't know what
happens to you, Anne.

533
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:37,258
If I had ever
talked to my mother
as you talk to me-

534
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:39,177
Things have changed,
Mother.

535
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:41,512
People aren't
like that anymore.

536
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:45,516
"Yes, Mother." "No, Mother."
"Anything you say, Mother."

537
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,061
I've got to
fight things out
for myself.

538
00:44:48,145 --> 00:44:50,063
But-
Make something
of myself.

539
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:53,066
It isn't necessary
to fight to do it.
Margot doesn't fight.

540
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,068
Margot!
That's all I hear.

541
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:57,070
"Why aren't you like Margot?"

542
00:44:57,154 --> 00:45:00,573
Everything she does is right,
and everything I do is wrong!

543
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:04,494
You're all against me,
and you worst of all!

544
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:08,206

545
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,209
I don't know how
we can go on living this way.

546
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:14,545
I can't say a word to Anne,
she flies at me.

547
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,549
You know Anne.
In a half hour she'll be out here
laughing and joking.

548
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,885
And, uh-

549
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,888
I told your father it wouldn't work-
two families.

550
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:26,891
But no, no,
he had to ask them.

551
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,893

552
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:30,978
Shh.

553
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:37,360

554
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:39,862

555
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:46,452

556
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,454

557
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:51,457
Every time
I hear that sound,
my heart stops.

558
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:53,543
It's Miep.
Father!

559
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:56,963
Yes?
It's Miep.

560
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:03,136
Here's your list.

561
00:46:03,262 --> 00:46:05,179
Is it Miep?
Yes.

562
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:07,181
At last I'll have
some cigarettes.

563
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:09,183
Miep's here.

564
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:12,687
I can't tell you
how sorry I am
about the coat.

565
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:14,647
Don't worry.

566
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,691
Hello, hello.
Miep.

567
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,693
Mr. Kraler!

568
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:21,654
When Mr. Kraler comes,
the sun begins to shine.

569
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,699
Dirk has had
to leave.
Dirk is Miep's fiancé.

570
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:28,202
He had to go into hiding
in the country
to escape a labor call-up.

571
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:31,205
But he has let me
have the radio for you.

572
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,207
He shouldn't have.

573
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,209
Oh, it was
too dangerous.

574
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,211

It gives us our eyes and ears

We listen to the German station

Please open.
And Miep.

635
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:17,690
Oh, bless them.
They are here.

636
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:22,069
And Miep, yes. Open, please.

637
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:30,911
Well, we had
a visitor last night.
A visitor last night?

638
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:32,663
Yes, yes.
A thief.

639
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,540
It was a thief?
Did you
hear him?

640
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:36,458
Yes, we heard him.
He was
right under you.

641
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:39,336
- In the office right under here.
- We did not know.

642
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:41,797
We thought it was
the Green Police.

643
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:46,677
Are you sure, Miep?
You were, of course,
quiet?

644
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:50,723
We didn't move.
We hardly breathed
all night.

645
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:54,852
That is good.
It was close.
Too close.

646
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:57,271
He went through everything.
The desk and the files.

647
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:00,941
The desk and the files.
And he found the safe, but
he could not get it open.

648
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:03,694
He was looking for
our ration card supply
from the Underground.

649
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:06,071
Somebody knows.
They're in that safe.

650
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:11,076
They'll come back.
Get rid of that safe.
Get it out of here.

651
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:13,162
Yes. Put a sign on
the door:

652
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:17,082
"Burglars, do not come back.
The safe is gone."
Jokes, yet.

653
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,460
Mr. Frank,
I must talk to you.
Yes, of course.

654
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:21,712
Maybe it's the radio.
We should get rid of
the radio.

655
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:25,257
Put it in the stove, burn it.
If the Green Police
found that radio-

656
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,342
And they'd find her diary.
We'll burn that too.

657
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:29,219
Not my diary.

658
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:32,264
My diary goes,
I go with it.
Where is it?

659
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:35,476
If they find us,
they might just as well
find the diary, the radio.

660
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,019
What'll be
the difference?

661
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:37,436
What'll be
the difference?

662
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,773
Usually, when I come up here,
I try to bring good news.
Yes, I know.

663
00:56:40,857 --> 00:56:43,358
Something has happened.
A man came to me.

664
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:46,361
He told me that
he has a Jewish friend- a dentist.

665
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:50,365
He begged me,
could I find him a hiding place?
So I have come to you.

666
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,744
I know it is a terrible thing to ask,
living the way you are,

667
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,830
but could you take him in?

668
00:56:56,915 --> 00:57:00,084
Well, of course
we will.
His name is Jan Dussel.

669
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:04,588
Dussel. Wait a minute.
I think I know him.
It's fine to have him.

670
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:07,424
But, Otto, where are
we going to put him? Where?

671
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:09,718
There's so little food as it is,
and to take in another person-

672
00:57:09,803 --> 00:57:11,720
We can stretch the food
a little, Mr. Van Daan.

673
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:14,431
He can have my bed.
No, thank you, Peter.

674
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,975
Margot will move
in here with us,
and he can have her bed.

675
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,395
- I'll get my things out.

676
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:50,384

677
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,520
Mr. Dussel.

678
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:13,407
Don't bump your head.

679
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:20,330
Come in, Mr. Dussel.

680
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:24,084
This is Mr. Frank.
Mr. Otto Frank?

681
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,837
Yes. Let me have
your things, please.

682
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:30,507
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
I leave you in good hands.

683
00:58:30,592 --> 00:58:32,342
Mr. Dussel?
Hmm?

684
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:35,095
I must return
your coat.

685
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:39,266
What can I say to thank you?

686
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:43,228
Mr. Kraler and Miep,
they're our lifeline.
Without them, we couldn't live.

687
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:46,106
Please, you make us
seem very heroic.
It isn't that at all.

688
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:51,111
We simply don't like the Nazis.
We don't like their methods-
I know. I know.

689
00:58:51,196 --> 00:58:53,864
"Nobody's gonna tell
us Dutchmen what to do
with our damn Jews."

690
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:57,993
We will be
up tomorrow to see that
they are treating you right.

691
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:01,955
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.
Good-bye, Miep.

692
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:05,209
Welcome, Mr. Dussel.
Thank you.

693
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:08,921
This is my wife, Edith.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.

694
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:13,467
Their son, Peter,
my daughters Margot and Anne.

695
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:15,928
Anne.
How do you do.

696
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:20,807
Margot.
Please, Mr. Dussel,
sit down.

697
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:24,519
Thank you.

698
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:27,272
I'm dreaming,
I know it.

699
00:59:27,357 --> 00:59:30,651
Mr. Otto Frank, here.

700
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:35,322
You're not in Switzerland, then?
Someone said that
you escaped to Switzerland.

701
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:40,953
And you've been here
all this time?
Ever since July.

702
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:47,251
Did Mr. Kraler warn you
you won't get much to eat here?

703
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:52,506
You can imagine...
three ration cards
among the seven of us.

704
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,926
Now you make eight.

705
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,471
Mr. Van Daan, you don't realize
what's happening outside...

706
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:02,224
that you should warn me
of a thing like that.

707
01:00:03,685 --> 01:00:08,355
You don't realize what's going on
right here in Amsterdam.

708
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,649
Every day, hundreds
of Jews disappear.

709
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:17,656
They surround a block,
and they search
house by house.

710
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:24,079
Every day children
come home from school
to find their parents gone.

711
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:27,416
Hundreds are being deported.

712
01:00:30,003 --> 01:00:33,672
People that you and I know-
the Hallensteins, the Wessels.

713
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:35,674
Oh, no.

714
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:38,802
You get your
call-up notice-

715
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:42,848
come to the station
on such and such a day and hour.

716
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:45,600
Bring only what
you can carry.

717
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:49,104
If you don't go, they come
and drag you from your home...

718
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:52,107
and ship you off to Mauthausen-
the death camp.

719
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:54,609
We didn't know
that things had got
so much worse.

720
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:58,155
Forgive me
for speaking so.

721
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,450
Do you know the de Vries?

722
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:03,535
They're gone.

723
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:12,753
Sanne and I
are in the same class.

724
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:16,631
Sanne is my best-
my best friend.

725
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:20,886
She returned home from school
to find her parents gone.

726
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:27,476
She was alone for two days,
and then they came
and took her away.

727
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:32,147
Gone?

728
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:41,156
With all the others.

729
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:45,285
Oh, no.

730
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:54,419
Some people named Meyerberg,
they lived near us-

731
01:01:54,504 --> 01:01:57,047
I think we should
put this off until later,
Mrs. Van Daan.

732
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:59,299
I'm sure Mr. Dussel would
like to get settled now.

733
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:02,386
Annele, would you like to
take Mr. Dussel to his room?

734
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:05,138
If you’ll come with me,
Mr. Dussel.

735
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:12,396
Uh, forgive me
if I haven't expressed
my gratitude.

736
01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:17,651
This has been
such a shock to me.

737
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,654
I always thought of
myself as Dutch.

738
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:23,323
I was born in Holland.

739
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:27,411
My father was born
in Holland,
and my grandfather.

740
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:31,832
And now after
all these years-

741
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:36,837
If you will excuse me.


744
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:18,962
It's so different
from what Mr. Kraler
tells us.

745
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:21,673
Mr. Kraler says that
things are improving.

746
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:25,677
I like it better
the way Kraler tells it.

750
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:20,106
Good night, Bubele.

751
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:25,403
Say good night.
Good night, Mother.

752
01:04:30,493 --> 01:04:32,202
Good night, Mr. Frank.
Good night.

753
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,788
Good night.

754
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:39,960
Do you have any children,
Mr. Dussel?

755
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:43,046
No, I never married.

756
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:50,136
Have you no family
at all?
No one.

757
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:59,980
How dreadful.
You must be terribly lonely.

758
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:03,692
Mm. I'm used to it.

759
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:07,487
I don't think I could
ever get used to it.

760
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:12,576
Didn't you even have
a pet? A cat or a dog?
No.

761
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,622
No, no. I have an allergy
to fur-bearing animals.

762
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:21,585
Gives me asthma.
Oh, dear.

763
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:24,504
What?
Peter has a cat.

764
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,384
He has?
He has it here?
Yes.

767
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:54,159
We hardly ever see it.
He keeps it in his room
all the time.

768
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:56,578
I'm sure it will
be all right.

769
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:58,663
Mm-hmm.
Well, I hope so.

770
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:06,963
I hope I'm not going to be
too much of a bother
to you, Mr. Dussel.

771
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:08,965
No.

772
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:12,552
I seem to be able to
get everyone's back up.

773
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:16,640
Oh, I always get along
very well with young people.

774
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:19,309
My patients all bring
their children to me...

775
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:22,479
because they know
I get along well with them.

776
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:24,564
So don't you worry
about that.

777
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:28,818
Thank you,
Mr. Dussel.

778
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:32,697
Good night.
I'll be back.

779
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:36,451
Good night, Mr. Dussel.

780
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:44,751
Careful.

785
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:10,420
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

794
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:37,906
Sanne.

795
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,450
Sanne?

796
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,702
Sanne.

798
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,966
Halt!

802
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:13,817
Save me! Save me!
No, no!

803
01:09:13,943 --> 01:09:17,737
Oh! No, don't take me!
Stop it. Stop it.

805
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:29,833
Save me.
Hush, darling.

806
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:32,335
Hush. It's all right.
It's all right.

807
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:35,964
Please, Mr. Dussel,
turn on the light.
It was just a dream.

808
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:38,925
You're here, safe.
You see?

809
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:43,012
Something must be done
with that child,
yelling like that.

810
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:47,141
Who knows who might be in the street.
She's endangering all our lives.

811
01:09:47,226 --> 01:09:51,688
Mr. Dussel, after all,
Anne is not exactly
a trained, frontline soldier.

812
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:54,691
Please, Mr. Dussel,
go back to bed.

813
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:58,194
She'll be herself
in a minute or two.
Won't you, Anne?

814
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:03,491
Go back to bed.

815
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:10,665
Excuse me. I'm going to the W.C.,
the one room where there's peace.

816
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:13,042
Go back to bed now.

817
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:17,797
Would you like
some water?

818
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:21,467
Was it a very bad dream?

819
01:10:21,552 --> 01:10:23,636
Perhaps if you
told me.

820
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:27,974
I'd rather not talk about it.
Try to sleep then.

821
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:33,980
I'll sit right here
beside you.
You don't have to.

822
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:39,694
But I'd like to stay
with you very much. Really.

823
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:42,196
I'd rather you didn't.

825
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:00,757
You'll be all right?
There's nothing
that you want?

826
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:05,011
Will you please
ask Father to come?

827
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:13,686
Yes, of course,
Anne dear.

828
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:24,405
She asks for you.

829
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:28,326
Edith.
Go to her, Otto.

830
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,079
She's still trembling with fear.

831
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:54,185
She wants nothing of me.

832
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:56,604
She pulled away when
I leaned down to kiss her.

833
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:59,190
The Green Police
broke down a door
and grabbed me...

834
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:01,693
and tried to drag me out
the way they did Sanne.

835
01:12:01,777 --> 01:12:04,612
It's just a phase.

836
01:12:04,697 --> 01:12:07,615
All girls turn to their
fathers at this age.

837
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,034
They give all their love
to their fathers.

838
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:14,247
You weren't like this.
You didn't shut me out.

839
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,459
So...

840
01:12:20,129 --> 01:12:22,463
now, do you want me to
read to you for a while?

841
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:25,842
No. Just sit with me
for a minute.

842
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:29,220
Was I awful?
Do you think anyone outside
could've heard me?

843
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:34,183
No. Now lie down quietly.
So, like this.

844
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:36,853
Now try to sleep.

845
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:42,608
I'm a terrible coward.
I'm so disappointed in myself.

846
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:45,028

847
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:47,447
I think I'm really grown up,

848
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:51,325
and then something happens
and I run to you like a baby.

849
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,203
I love you, Father.
I don't love anyone but you.

850
01:12:54,288 --> 01:12:56,664
Annele. Annele.

851
01:12:56,749 --> 01:13:00,376
It's true.
You're the only one I love.

852
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:04,464
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

853
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:09,260
It's fine- It's fine to have you
tell me that you love me,

854
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:13,556
but I'd be much happier
if you said that you
loved your mother as well.

855
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,809
She needs your help so much.

856
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:20,980
Your love.
We have nothing in common.

857
01:13:21,065 --> 01:13:23,483
She doesn't understand me.

858
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:27,320
Whenever I try to
explain my views on life,
she asks me if I'm constipated.

859
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:33,326
You hurt her very much just now.
She's crying. She's in there crying.

860
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:47,423
Oh, Father,
I was horrible, wasn't I?

861
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:50,468
What's the matter with me?
Tell me.

862
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:53,513
Don't say it's just a phase.
Help me.

863
01:13:55,974 --> 01:14:00,770
There's so little we parents can do
to help our children, Anne.

864
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:05,358
We can only try to
set a good example.
Point the way.

865
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:07,985
The rest you must do yourself.

866
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:12,615
I'm trying. Really, I am.

867
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:17,870
Every night I think back
over all the things I did that day
that were wrong.

868
01:14:17,955 --> 01:14:20,873
Like putting the wet mop
in Mrs. Van Daan's bed.

870
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:27,839
And now this with Mother.

871
01:14:27,923 --> 01:14:30,925
I say to myself,
"That was wrong."

872
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:34,595
And I make up my mind I'm never
going to do that again. Never.

873
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:39,142
I may do something worse,
but I'll never do that again.

874
01:14:39,226 --> 01:14:43,563
I have a nicer side, Father.

875
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:46,357
But I'm scared to show it.

876
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:49,777
I'm afraid people
will laugh at me.

877
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:55,491
So the mean Anne
comes to the outside...

878
01:14:55,576 --> 01:14:58,578
and the good Anne
stays in the inside.

879
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:04,000
And I keep on trying to
switch them around...

880
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:09,088
and have the good Anne outside
and the bad Anne inside.

881
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:13,843
It would be what I'd like to be...

882
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:19,599
and might be... if only-

884
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:43,706
She's asleep.

885
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:56,445
Thursday, the 29th
of October, 1942.

886
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,573
Mr. Dussel and I
had a great battle yesterday.

887
01:16:59,658 --> 01:17:03,202
Yes, Mr. Dussel.

888
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:07,456
According to him, nothing,
I repeat, nothing is right about me.

889
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:12,503
While he was going on at me,
I thought,

890
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:16,132
"Someday, I'm going to
give you such a smack...

891
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:19,218
that you'll fly
right up to the ceiling."

892
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:25,891
Why is it that every
grown-up thinks he knows
the way to bring up children?

893
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:36,068
Particularly the grown-ups
that haven't any.

894
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:41,741
Monday, the ninth of
November, 1942.

895
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:46,203
Wonderful news.
The Allies have landed in Africa.

896
01:17:46,288 --> 01:17:48,956
Churchill spoke
on the BBC from London.

897
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:52,918
Which they have so often
meted out to others.

898
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:56,172
Ah, this is not the end.

899
01:17:56,256 --> 01:18:00,676
No, it is not even
the beginning of the end.

900
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:04,430
But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.

901
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:06,849
The air raids are getting worse.

902
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:10,311
The British planes
come over day and night
on their way to Germany.

907
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:48,516
It's too much.
Just too much.

909
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:58,901
Suppose they hit
this house?
What will we do?

910
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:02,655
We can't go out
in the street.
What will we do?

911
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:06,617
If they hit this house,
your worries will be over.

912
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:14,417
That noise- that big explosion-
they hit one of the English planes.

913
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:16,293
It fell right in this block.
Peter!

914
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:21,715
Peter!

916
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:35,438
It's far away from here.
Don't be nervous.

917
01:19:35,522 --> 01:19:38,941
Look. Just look at them.
Why, Mrs. Van Daan,
this should be music to your ears.

918
01:19:39,067 --> 01:19:40,985
Music?
Of course.

919
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:43,279
The more planes
the British send over,

920
01:19:43,363 --> 01:19:46,365
the sooner the war will be over,
the sooner we'll be out of here
and home again.

921
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,576
I don't believe
it'll ever be over.

922
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:53,372
You know what I'd like right now?
A cup of tea.

923
01:19:53,457 --> 01:19:55,583
Oh, yes, please.

924
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:57,751
You can't have tea
then for breakfast.

925
01:19:57,878 --> 01:20:00,796
If you have tea now,
you won't have any tomorrow.
I don't care.

926
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:04,592
- Neither do I. Now, please.
- Me, too, please.

927
01:20:04,676 --> 01:20:07,678
How about you, Mr. Dussel?
Would you like your tea now
or tomorrow morning?

928
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:10,973
Tomorrow morning.
Sure?

929
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:13,893
- Sure.

930
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:20,065
I'll take mine now.

931
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,651
The skylight!

932
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:24,862
Edith, come!

933
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:31,327
Peter! Peter!
Peter! Peter!

934
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:37,416
Peter!

937
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:29,426
"Praised be Thou,
O Lord our God,

938
01:21:29,511 --> 01:21:33,430
"ruler of the universe
who has sanctified us
with Thy commandments...

939
01:21:33,515 --> 01:21:36,642
"and bidden us kindle
the Hanukkah lights.

940
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:41,063
"Praise be Thou,
O Lord our God,
ruler of the universe...

941
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:46,235
"who has wrought
wondrous deliverances
for our fathers in days of old.

942
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:49,321
"Praise be Thou,
O Lord our God,
ruler of the universe...

943
01:21:49,406 --> 01:21:54,243
"that Thou has given us life
and sustenance and brought us
to this happy season.

944
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:57,705
Amen."
Amen.

945
01:21:57,789 --> 01:22:01,500
Monday, the seventh
of December, 1942.

946
01:22:01,585 --> 01:22:04,753
The Hanukkah holiday
came early this year.

947
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:08,924
"We kindle this Hanukkah light
to celebrate the great
and wonderful deeds...

948
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:11,635
"wrought through the zeal
with which God filled the hearts...

949
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:15,097
"of the heroic Maccabees
2,000 years ago.

950
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:19,184
"They fought against
indifference, against
tyranny and oppression...

951
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:21,687
"and they restored
our temple to us.

952
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:25,107
"May these lights remind us
that we should ever look to God,

953
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:27,318
"whence cometh our help.

954
01:22:27,444 --> 01:22:29,778
Amen."
[All]
Amen.

955
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:40,831
"I lift up mine eyes
unto the mountains from
whence cometh my help.

956
01:22:40,915 --> 01:22:44,251
"My help cometh from
the Lord who made
heaven and Earth.

957
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,503
"He will not suffer
thy foot to be moved.

958
01:22:46,588 --> 01:22:49,632
"He that keepeth thee
will not slumber.

959
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:53,510
"He that keepeth Israel
doth neither slumber nor sleep.

960
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:58,515
"The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

961
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,355
"The Lord shall keep thee from all evil.
He shall keep thy soul.

962
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:08,025
"The Lord shall guard thy going out
and thy coming in,

963
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:10,986
"from this time forth
and forevermore.

964
01:23:11,071 --> 01:23:12,946
Amen."
Amen.

965
01:23:13,073 --> 01:23:17,117
Amen.
May I have the hats, please?
Thank you.

966
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:20,120
Very nice.
Very nice.
That was very moving.

967
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:22,456
Sit down.
Sit down.

968
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:26,251
Where are you going?
There's lots more.
Songs and presents.

969
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,754
Presents?
Not this year,
unfortunately.

970
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:31,965
But always on Hanukkah
everyone gives presents.
Everyone.

971
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:34,343
That's right.
Like our
Saint Nicholas day.

972
01:23:34,469 --> 01:23:37,471
Saint Nicholas day.
No, not like
Saint Nicholas day.

973
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:40,057
What kind of a Jew are you
that you don't know Hanukkah?

974
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:43,811
I remember particularly
the candles.
First one, as we have tonight.

975
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:46,480
Then the second night,
you light two candles.
The next night, three.

976
01:23:46,564 --> 01:23:49,358
And so on, until there
are eight candles burning.

977
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:53,445
When there are
eight candles,
it's truly beautiful.

978
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:56,156
What I remember best
are the presents
we used to get.

979
01:23:56,241 --> 01:23:59,868
Eight days of presents,
and, well, each day
they got better and better.

980
01:23:59,953 --> 01:24:03,414
We're all here... alive.
That's present enough.

981
01:24:03,498 --> 01:24:08,085
- No, it isn't. I've got something.
- What is it?

982
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:10,212
L'Chaim.
L'Chaim.

983
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:14,675
Presents.
Real presents?

984
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:16,719
She made it
herself.
Look at that.

985
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:20,305
Isn't it festive?
Isn't it gay?
Oh, that's beautiful.

986
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:23,434
For Margot.
Ah.

987
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:32,276
Read it out loud.

988
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,028
"You have never
lost your temper.

989
01:24:35,155 --> 01:24:38,157
"You never will,
I fear.

990
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:42,369
You are so good,
but if you should,
put all your cross words here."

991
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:44,371
Aww.

992
01:24:44,456 --> 01:24:45,998
Let's see what it is.

993
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:49,418
It's a new
crossword puzzle book.

994
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:51,587
It's one you've done,
but I rubbed it all out...

995
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:53,964
and if you wait a little
and forget,
you can do it again.

997
01:24:56,134 --> 01:24:59,636
Clever, clever.
Thank you.

998
01:25:01,848 --> 01:25:05,017
For Mrs. Van Daan.
Ah-hah.

999
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:08,437
I feel terrible.
I don't have a thing
for anybody.

1000
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:13,942
It's hair shampoo.

1001
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:17,905
I took odds and ends of soap
and mixed them with the last
of my toilet water.

1002
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:20,449
Oh, thank you,
Anneke.
That was nice.

1003
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:23,702
I wanted to write a poem
for all of them,
but I didn't have time.

1004
01:25:23,787 --> 01:25:25,662
That's all right,
Anne.

1005
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:27,873
Yours, Mr. Van Daan,
is really something.
Mmm?

1006
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:31,960
Something you want
more than anything.
Hmm.

1007
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:42,387
- Cigarettes!
- Look at that.

1008
01:25:42,472 --> 01:25:44,389
Cigarettes.
Two of them.

1009
01:25:44,474 --> 01:25:47,142
Father found some old pipe tobacco
in the pocket lining of his coat,

1010
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:50,896
and we made them-
rather, Father did.

1011
01:25:52,524 --> 01:25:55,150
Look at that.

1012
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:58,237
Light it!
Go on and light it!

1013
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:02,991
It's tobacco.
Really, it is.

1014
01:26:03,076 --> 01:26:06,078
There's a little fluff in it,
but not much.

1015
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:18,507
It works!
Look at him.

1016
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:20,592
Thank you, Anne.
Thank you.

1017
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:26,306
Mr. Van Daan!

1018
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:31,061
For Mother.
Hanukkah greeting.

1019
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:36,024
"Here's an I.O.U.
that I promise to pay.

1020
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:37,192
"Ten hours of doing...

1021
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,947
"whatever you say.

1022
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:44,533
Signed, Anne Frank."

1023
01:26:51,624 --> 01:26:56,253
- Ten hours of doing what you're told?
Anything you're told?
- That's right.

1024
01:26:59,465 --> 01:27:02,426
You wouldn't want to
sell that, Mrs. Frank,
would you?

1025
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:06,305
Never. This is the most
precious gift I've ever had.

1026
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:14,062
For Father.
Annele, I wasn't supposed to
have a present.

1027
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:16,189
Look at that.
It's a muffler.

1028
01:27:16,274 --> 01:27:19,610
Oh, I know.
To wear around your neck
like an ascot, you know.

1029
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:26,909
I knitted it in the dark each night.
I'm afraid it looks better in the dark.

1030
01:27:26,993 --> 01:27:29,494
It's fine.
Thank you, Annele.
Thank you.

1031
01:27:29,621 --> 01:27:33,290
Isn't it beautiful.
Lovely, huh?
Thank you, Anne.

1032
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:41,798
- For Mouschi.
- [Mrs. Van Daan]
He'll like it.

1033
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:48,847
And this is for you. Yourself.
From Miss Quack-Quack.

1034
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:52,559
Go on. Open it.

1035
01:27:52,644 --> 01:27:56,313
Aren't you
going to open it?

1036
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:03,278
[Mrs. Van Daan]
Come on. Show us what it is.
It's a safety razor.

1037
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:07,699
It's not new.
Miep got it for me second-hand.
But you do need a razor now.

1038
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:14,289
What for?
Look at his upper lip.
See?

1039
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:16,458
He wants to
get rid of that?

1040
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:21,546
Put some milk on it
and let the cat lick it off.

1041
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:23,674
You think you're funny,
don't you?

1042
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:27,219
Look, he can't wait.
He's going in to try it now.

1043
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:30,263
I'm going to give
Mouschi his present.

1044
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:33,392
Mouschi, Mouschi, Mouschi.
Enough.

1045
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:37,813
And last, but never least,
my roommate, Mr. Dussel.

1046
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:40,232
Something for me?

1047
01:28:46,948 --> 01:28:50,450
Capsules.
They're earplugs to
put in your ears...

1048
01:28:50,535 --> 01:28:53,245
so you won't hear me
when I thrash around
at night.

1049
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:56,999
I made them myself.
Try them. See if
you can hear me.

1050
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:04,131
Wait, I'll put- Like that?
Is that what you mean?

1051
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:06,299
Are you ready?
What?

1052
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:11,596
- Are you ready?
- They work.

1053
01:29:17,562 --> 01:29:20,814
They went in.
They went in.

1054
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:23,650
He can't get 'em out.
What's the matter with you?
Get 'em out.

1055
01:29:23,735 --> 01:29:25,861
Take 'em out.

1056
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:27,946
I got 'em.

1057
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:33,952
- Thank you.

1058
01:29:34,037 --> 01:29:36,705
And now let's sing
the song, Father.

1059
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:39,541
Wait till you hear
the Hanukkah song,
Mr. Dussel.

1060
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:42,586
♪ O Hanukkah, O Hanukkah
The sweet celebration ♪
Annele.

1061
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:45,005
Annele, we shouldn't
sing the song tonight.

1062
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:48,383
You see, Mr. Dussel,
it's a song of jubilation
and of rejoicing.

1063
01:29:48,468 --> 01:29:50,969
One is apt to become
just a little too enthusiastic
about it.

1064
01:29:51,054 --> 01:29:53,597
Please, let's
sing the song, Father.
I promise not to shout.

1065
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:56,975
Very well, but quietly, Anne.
I'll keep my eye on you-
Oh!

1066
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:01,563
Oh! I told you
not to come in here
with that cat.

1067
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:05,400
Get out of here.

1068
01:30:05,485 --> 01:30:08,612
What's the matter
with you?
Haven't you any sense?

1069
01:30:08,696 --> 01:30:11,239
Get that cat
out of here.
Cat?

1070
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:15,202
You heard me.
Get it out of here!

1071
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:19,331
I have no cat.

1072
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:21,833
Mr. Dussel!

1073
01:30:21,918 --> 01:30:24,669
It doesn't have to
be the cat.

1074
01:30:24,754 --> 01:30:28,381
Just the hairs on his clothing
from the cat is enough.

1075
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:31,718
When he comes in the room-
Don't worry, you won't be
bothered anymore.

1076
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:34,930
We're getting rid
of it.
At last, you listen to me.

1077
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:38,642
I'm not doing it for you.
That's all in your mind.
All of it.

1078
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:43,021
I'm doing it because
I'm sick of seeing that cat
eat all our food.

1079
01:30:43,106 --> 01:30:45,023
That's not true.
I only give him scraps.

1080
01:30:45,108 --> 01:30:49,611
Don't tell me.
He gets fatter every day.

1081
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:52,739
Damn cat looks better than any of us.
Out he goes tonight.

1082
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:55,992
No!
Mr. Van Daan,
you can't do that.

1083
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:59,955
That's Peter's cat.
Peter loves that cat.
Anne.

1084
01:31:01,374 --> 01:31:05,252
- If he goes, I go.
- Go. Go.

1085
01:31:05,336 --> 01:31:07,963
He's not going,
and the cat's not going.
What's the matter with you?

1086
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:13,051
It's Hanukkah.
It's Hanukkah.
Please, Anne, sing.

1087
01:31:13,136 --> 01:31:16,596
♪ O Hanukkah, O Hanukkah
The sweet celebration ♪

1088
01:31:16,722 --> 01:31:18,890
♪ Around the feast
we gather ♪
Annele.

1089
01:31:18,975 --> 01:31:21,017
I think we should first
blow out the candles.

1090
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:23,019
Then we'll have something
for tomorrow night.

1091
01:31:23,104 --> 01:31:27,107
Father, you're supposed to
let it burn itself out.

1092
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:30,110
I'm sure that God
understands shortages.

1093
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:32,112
Praise be Thou,
O Lord our God,
who has sustained us...

1094
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:34,447
and permitted us
to celebrate
this joyous festival.

1095
01:31:34,574 --> 01:31:36,533
Amen.
Amen.

1103
01:35:16,003 --> 01:35:19,672
I think
they've gone.
They found us.

1104
01:35:19,757 --> 01:35:21,925
If they had,
they would be
up here by now.

1105
01:35:22,009 --> 01:35:26,513
I know it was
the Green Police.
They've gone to get help.

1106
01:35:26,597 --> 01:35:28,807
It may be the Gestapo,
looking for papers.

1107
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:32,977
- Or another thief
looking for money.

1108
01:35:39,276 --> 01:35:41,861
I'm going down.

1109
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:45,448
They may still be there.
Annele,
this is Saturday.

1110
01:35:45,533 --> 01:35:49,911
We have no way of knowing
what has happened down there
until Miep and Mr. Kraler come.

1111
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:53,998
We cannot live
with this uncertainty.
Now, please. Please.

1112
01:36:15,938 --> 01:36:19,357
Get our money.
They say you can buy them off.
So much a head.

1113
01:36:19,442 --> 01:36:21,901
- Quick, go upstairs and get the money.
- Keep still.

1114
01:36:21,986 --> 01:36:25,321
You wanna be dragged off
to a concentration camp?

1115
01:36:25,406 --> 01:36:27,449
You gonna stand there
until they come up here and get you?

1116
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:29,534
Will you keep still!

1117
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:49,929
Someone go
and make Father come back.

1118
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:03,443
Haven't you
done enough?
Please, Mr. Van Daan.

1119
01:37:09,033 --> 01:37:11,117
Anne!
Shh.

1120
01:37:30,054 --> 01:37:35,016
I lift up mine eyes
unto the mountains
from whence cometh my help.

1121
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,436
My help cometh from the Lord
who made heaven and Earth.

1122
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:20,061
He that keepeth thee
will not slumber.

1123
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:24,399
He that keepeth Israel
doth neither slumber nor sleep.

1124
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:28,653
The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade from-

1125
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:46,671
- No.

1127
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,868
I better go
and look and make sure.
Ja.

1128
01:39:29,673 --> 01:39:33,384
Pray that the Lord
shall keep thee from all evil.

1129
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:36,763
He shall keep thy soul.
Hear me, O Israel.

1130
01:39:36,847 --> 01:39:39,849
The Lord shall guard
thy going out
and thy coming in.

1131
01:39:46,899 --> 01:39:49,484
[Mr. Frank]
He took the typewriter
and ran away in such a hurry,

1132
01:39:49,568 --> 01:39:52,111
he didn't stop to
shut the street door-
it was swinging wide open.

1133
01:39:52,196 --> 01:39:54,572
A watchman was passing.

1135
01:40:40,577 --> 01:40:43,454
Look. Tools.

1141
01:44:33,268 --> 01:44:35,436
Ja.

1142
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:41,150
Meetz-meetz-meetz.
Meetz-meetz-meetz.
Meow, meow.

1143
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:44,862
They had a burglary.
He got out
as he heard me coming.

1144
01:44:47,866 --> 01:44:52,870
- Meetz-meetz.

1145
01:45:11,264 --> 01:45:15,059
I will lock the door
and report it.

1146
01:45:23,986 --> 01:45:26,570
They've gone.
They've locked the door.

1147
01:45:26,655 --> 01:45:28,572
Thank God they've gone.

1148
01:45:28,657 --> 01:45:32,660
I'd just as soon they'd
take us than to continue
with this terrible agony.

1149
01:45:32,744 --> 01:45:35,538
I can't stand it.
It's all right, Annele.

1150
01:45:35,664 --> 01:45:39,458
The danger has passed.
Who says
the danger is passed?

1151
01:45:39,543 --> 01:45:42,503
Don't you realize that
we're in greater danger
than ever?

1152
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:44,755
Please, Mr. Dussel,
will you keep still.

1153
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,843
Thanks to this clumsy fool,
someone now knows
we're up here.

1154
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:52,054
- Someone now knows
that we're up here hiding.
- It's a thief.

1155
01:45:52,139 --> 01:45:54,056
You think the thief is going to
go to the Green Police and say,

1156
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:57,184
"I was robbing a place the other night,
and I heard a noise above my head"?

1157
01:45:57,310 --> 01:45:59,562
You think a thief
is going to do that?
Yes, he will.

1158
01:45:59,688 --> 01:46:03,858
You're crazy.
I think that someday
the thief will be caught.

1159
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:06,777
He'll make a bargain
with the Gestapo.

1160
01:46:06,862 --> 01:46:09,572
He'll say to the Gestapo,
"If you let me off,

1161
01:46:09,656 --> 01:46:11,741
I'll show you where
some Jews are hiding."

1162
01:46:11,867 --> 01:46:13,993
That's what I think.
Oy!

1163
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:17,329
He's right.
Oh, Mother,
let's get out of here.

1164
01:46:17,456 --> 01:46:21,375
We can't stay here now.
Please,
let's go.

1165
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,961
Go? Where?

1166
01:46:28,175 --> 01:46:30,593
Yes, where?

1167
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:34,221
Have we lost all faith?

1168
01:46:35,307 --> 01:46:37,558
All courage?

1169
01:46:37,642 --> 01:46:40,603
A few moments ago,
we thought they had
come for us, didn't we?

1170
01:46:40,687 --> 01:46:45,858
We thought it was the end.
Well, it was not the end.
We are alive. We are safe.

1171
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:49,236
We thank Thee,
O Lord, our God,
that in Thy infinite mercy,

1172
01:46:49,321 --> 01:46:52,073
Thou hast again
seen fit to spare us.

1173
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:54,867
Amen.
Amen.

1174
01:46:59,873 --> 01:47:02,374
Annele.

1175
01:47:02,459 --> 01:47:04,460
The song, hmm?

1176
01:47:05,921 --> 01:47:07,922
How about the song?

1177
01:47:09,341 --> 01:47:14,386

1189
01:47:57,931 --> 01:47:59,932
Happy Hanukkah.

1191
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:14,071

1192
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:43,684
Saturday, the first
of January, 1944.

1193
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:49,106
Another new year has begun,
and we find ourselves
still in our hiding place.

1194
01:48:54,279 --> 01:48:59,617
We have been here now
for one year, five months
and 25 days.

1195
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,748
One of our family
has left us.

1196
01:49:05,832 --> 01:49:10,127
Mouschi ran away.

1197
01:49:10,212 --> 01:49:13,214
We're all a little thinner.

1198
01:49:13,298 --> 01:49:17,718
The Van Daans' discussions
are as violent as ever.

1199
01:49:17,802 --> 01:49:20,888
Mother still doesn't
understand me,

1200
01:49:20,972 --> 01:49:24,141
but then
I don't understand her either.

1201
01:49:27,812 --> 01:49:32,650
There is one great change, however.
A change in myself.

1202
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:39,990
I read somewhere that girls
of my age don't feel
quite certain of themselves,

1203
01:49:40,075 --> 01:49:42,076
that they become
quiet within...

1204
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,996
and begin to think of the miracle
that is taking place in their bodies.

1205
01:49:48,291 --> 01:49:53,087
I think that
what is happening to me
is so wonderful.

1206
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:58,676
Not only what can be seen,
but what is taking place inside.

1207
01:50:00,178 --> 01:50:04,932
Each time it has happened,
I feel I have a sweet secret,

1208
01:50:05,016 --> 01:50:10,688
and I long for the time
when I shall feel that secret
within me again.

1209
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:01,673
Annele. Peter.

1210
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:06,011
A wonderful surprise.
Mr. Kraler
and Miep are here.

1211
01:52:06,096 --> 01:52:08,931
Oh, thank you.
You shouldn't have come.

1212
01:52:09,015 --> 01:52:13,227
You should have at least
one day to yourselves.

1213
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:16,063
Don't say that.
It's so wonderful
to see them.

1214
01:52:16,189 --> 01:52:18,857
What is it?
What is it?
Mr. Kraler.

1215
01:52:18,942 --> 01:52:22,736
- Happy New Year, Mr. Dussel.
- Happy New Year.

1216
01:52:22,821 --> 01:52:26,323
How are you, Margot?
Feeling any better?
I'm all right.

1217
01:52:26,408 --> 01:52:28,367
We filled her full
of every kind of pill,

1218
01:52:28,451 --> 01:52:31,829
so she won't cough
and make a noise.

1219
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:36,083
Look what Miep has brought us.
A cake.

1220
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:38,043
Mmm.

1221
01:52:38,169 --> 01:52:41,797
Cake.
Well.

1222
01:52:41,923 --> 01:52:45,884
I'll get some plates.
Thank you, Miepia.

1223
01:52:45,969 --> 01:52:49,096
You must have used
all of your sugar rations
for weeks.

1224
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:53,016
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

1225
01:52:53,101 --> 01:52:55,519
It's ages since
I've even seen a cake.

1226
01:52:55,603 --> 01:52:57,604
Not since you brought
the one last year, remember?

1227
01:52:57,689 --> 01:53:00,691
It had "Peace in 1943"
written on-

1228
01:53:04,571 --> 01:53:06,697
"Peace in 1944."

1229
01:53:08,533 --> 01:53:10,993
- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.

1230
01:53:10,994 --> 01:53:14,288
- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.

1231
01:53:14,372 --> 01:53:16,748
Now, how many of us
are there?

1232
01:53:16,875 --> 01:53:18,959
None for me,
thank you.
Oh, you must.

1233
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:20,961
Please, Miep.

1234
01:53:21,045 --> 01:53:25,340
Good. That leaves one,
two, three- seven of us.

1235
01:53:25,425 --> 01:53:30,262
Eight. The same
as it always is.

1236
01:53:30,346 --> 01:53:33,140
I left Margot out.
I take it for granted
Margot won't eat any.

1237
01:53:33,266 --> 01:53:35,809
Why wouldn't she?
I think it
won't harm her.

1238
01:53:35,894 --> 01:53:39,897
All right, all right.
I just didn't want her to
start coughing again.

1239
01:53:41,316 --> 01:53:45,611
And, please,
Mrs. Frank
should cut the cake.

1240
01:53:45,737 --> 01:53:49,781
What do you mean?
Well, Mrs. Frank
divides things better.

1241
01:53:49,908 --> 01:53:54,578
Just what are you
trying to say?
Forget it. We're wasting time.

1242
01:53:54,662 --> 01:53:57,956
No, no.
Don't I always give everybody
exactly the same?

1243
01:53:59,918 --> 01:54:03,420
Don't I?
Forget it, Kerli.

1244
01:54:03,505 --> 01:54:05,714
No, I want an answer.
Don't I?

1245
01:54:05,798 --> 01:54:10,886
Yes. Yes, yes.
Everybody gets
exactly the same.

1246
01:54:12,263 --> 01:54:14,973
Except Mr. Van Daan
gets a little bit more.

1247
01:54:15,099 --> 01:54:18,644
That's a lie.
She always cuts the same.
Mr. Van Daan, please.

1248
01:54:18,728 --> 01:54:21,688
You see, Miep,
what a little sugar cake
does to us?

1249
01:54:21,773 --> 01:54:24,691
It goes right to our heads.

1250
01:54:24,776 --> 01:54:28,946
Here you are,
Mrs. Frank.
Thank you.

1251
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,582
You sure you won't
have any?
Very sure.

1252
01:54:42,085 --> 01:54:44,086
Miep?
No, thank you.
Really.

1253
01:54:45,755 --> 01:54:49,925
Cut the cake.
All right.

1254
01:55:10,029 --> 01:55:12,030
Thank you, Peter.

1255
01:55:16,327 --> 01:55:18,328
That's yours, Peter.

1256
01:55:21,207 --> 01:55:23,792
Maybe Mouschi
went back to our house.

1257
01:55:23,876 --> 01:55:27,254
Do you ever get over there?
Do you think that you could?

1258
01:55:27,338 --> 01:55:30,465
I'm afraid with
him gone a week, Peter-

1259
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:34,678
Make up your mind.
Already someone has had
a big nice meal from that cat.

1260
01:55:34,762 --> 01:55:36,680

1261
01:55:41,603 --> 01:55:44,521
Mmm, it's delicious, Miep.
Delicious.

1262
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:55,866
Well, I must run.
There's a party tonight.

1263
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:58,619
How heavenly.

1264
01:55:58,703 --> 01:56:00,787
Remember now
what everyone's wearing...

1265
01:56:00,872 --> 01:56:03,957
and what you have to eat
and everything so you can
tell us tomorrow.

1266
01:56:04,042 --> 01:56:06,918
I'll give you
a full report.
Good-bye, everyone.

1267
01:56:07,045 --> 01:56:08,962
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Miep.

1268
01:56:09,047 --> 01:56:12,799
Hey, just a minute.
There's something
I'd like you to do for me.

1269
01:56:12,884 --> 01:56:15,385
Putti, where are you going?

1270
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:17,471
Putti, what are you
gonna do?

1271
01:56:18,973 --> 01:56:21,391
Putti.

1272
01:56:21,476 --> 01:56:23,769
No, no, no.
Don't you dare
take that coat.

1273
01:56:23,853 --> 01:56:25,771
What is wrong?

1274
01:56:25,855 --> 01:56:28,899
Father says he's gonna
sell her fur coat.

1275
01:56:28,983 --> 01:56:30,942
She's crazy about
that old fur coat.

1276
01:56:31,069 --> 01:56:34,112
It's mine, you hear me?
My father gave me that coat.
I want the coat.

1277
01:56:34,238 --> 01:56:36,239
No, you have no right.
Get your hands off it.

1278
01:56:36,324 --> 01:56:40,535
Is it possible
that anyone can...
be silly enough...

1279
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:43,705
to worry about a fur coat
at a time like this?

1280
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:45,832
It's none of
your darn business.

1281
01:56:45,917 --> 01:56:48,418
And if you say
one more thing-
Peter.

1282
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:51,421

1283
01:56:55,551 --> 01:56:57,594
Just a...

1284
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:01,807
little discussion
on the advisability
of selling this coat.

1285
01:57:01,891 --> 01:57:03,975
As I have often
reminded Mrs. Van Daan,

1286
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:08,438
it's selfish of her to keep it
when people outside are in
such desperate need of clothing.

1287
01:57:10,316 --> 01:57:12,359
So if you please
to sell it for us.

1288
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:14,528
It should fetch
a good price.

1289
01:57:14,612 --> 01:57:17,364
And by the way,
would you get me cigarettes?

1290
01:57:17,448 --> 01:57:20,450
I don't care
what kind they are.
Get all you can.

1291
01:57:20,535 --> 01:57:23,870
It is very difficult
to get them, Mr. Van Daan.

1292
01:57:23,955 --> 01:57:26,707
But I will try.
Good-bye.

1293
01:57:26,833 --> 01:57:28,750
Good-bye.
Bye, Miep.

1294
01:57:28,835 --> 01:57:30,836
Mr. Frank,
could I talk to you?

1295
01:57:35,842 --> 01:57:38,885
Something's happened,
hasn't it, Mr. Kraler?
What's happened?

1296
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:42,681
If it is something
that concerns us here,
we'd better all hear it.

1297
01:57:42,807 --> 01:57:46,935
The children-
What they'd imagine would be
worse than any reality.

1298
01:57:47,019 --> 01:57:51,565
It is a man in the storeroom.
His name is Karl.
You knew him.

1299
01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:54,985
One day he came to the office.
He closed the door
and asked me,

1300
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:57,529
"What do you hear from
your friend Mr. Frank?"

1301
01:57:57,613 --> 01:58:00,532
I told him there was a rumor
that you were in Switzerland.

1302
01:58:00,616 --> 01:58:04,703
He said he had heard
that rumor too, but he thought
I might know something more.

1303
01:58:04,787 --> 01:58:07,831
I did not pay much attention.
I- I tried to forget it.

1304
01:58:07,915 --> 01:58:10,584
And then yesterday...

1305
01:58:10,668 --> 01:58:14,212
we were coming out of
the storeroom out there.

1306
01:58:14,297 --> 01:58:17,799
I had started down
to the office.

1307
01:58:17,884 --> 01:58:19,843
I looked back.

1308
01:58:19,927 --> 01:58:22,554
He was standing,
staring at the bookcase.

1309
01:58:22,638 --> 01:58:27,517
He said, "I thought
I remember a door up here.

1310
01:58:27,602 --> 01:58:32,189
Was not there a door here
leading to the loft?"

1311
01:58:32,273 --> 01:58:35,734
Then he asked me for more money.
Twenty gilders more a week.

1312
01:58:35,818 --> 01:58:39,279
- Blackmail.
- Twenty gilders?
Very modest blackmail.

1313
01:58:39,363 --> 01:58:41,531
That's just
the beginning.

1314
01:58:42,742 --> 01:58:44,910
You know what I think?

1315
01:58:44,994 --> 01:58:48,455
He's the thief who was
down there that night.

1316
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:50,624
That's how
he knows we're here.

1317
01:58:50,708 --> 01:58:53,126
How was it left?
What did you tell him?

1318
01:58:53,211 --> 01:58:55,504
I told him
I had to think about it.

1319
01:58:55,588 --> 01:58:57,589
What shall I do?
Pay him the money?

1320
01:58:57,673 --> 01:58:59,591
Take a chance
on firing him or what?

1321
01:58:59,717 --> 01:59:02,928
I do not know.
For heaven's sakes,
don't fire him.

1322
01:59:03,012 --> 01:59:06,598
Pay him what he asks.
Keep him here where you can
keep your eye on him.

1323
01:59:06,682 --> 01:59:09,935
Is it so much that he is asking?
I mean, what are
they paying nowadays?

1324
01:59:10,061 --> 01:59:12,145
He could get it
in a war plant.
Mm-hmm.

1325
01:59:12,230 --> 01:59:17,025
But this is not a war plant.
Mind you, I do not know
if he knows or not.

1326
01:59:21,447 --> 01:59:24,991
Offer him half.
Then we'll soon know
if it is blackmail or not.

1327
01:59:25,076 --> 01:59:28,954
And if it is,
we've gotta pay, haven't we?

1328
01:59:29,038 --> 01:59:31,164
Whatever he asks,
we've gotta pay.

1329
01:59:31,249 --> 01:59:35,168
Let us decide that
when the time comes.

1330
01:59:35,253 --> 01:59:37,337
This may be all my imagination.

1331
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:41,508
You get to a point these days
where you suspect everyone
and everything.

1334
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:01,695
What does that mean,
the telephone ringing
on a holiday?

1335
02:00:05,283 --> 02:00:09,494
That's my wife.
I told her I had to go over
some papers in my office,

1336
02:00:09,579 --> 02:00:11,705
to call me here
when she got out of church.

1337
02:00:11,789 --> 02:00:14,124
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

1338
02:00:14,208 --> 02:00:16,209
Happy New Year.

1339
02:00:16,294 --> 02:00:18,753
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.

1341
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:23,425
I will offer him half then.

1342
02:00:23,509 --> 02:00:25,510
Thank you, Mr. Kraler.

1343
02:00:30,057 --> 02:00:31,641
You can thank your son for this.

1344
02:00:31,642 --> 02:00:33,643
You can thank your son for this.

1345
02:00:33,728 --> 02:00:36,730
Him and his damn cat.
That night. There.

1346
02:00:38,983 --> 02:00:43,486
I tell you, it's-it's-it's-
it's just a question
of time now.

1347
02:00:49,493 --> 02:00:53,163
Sometimes I wish the end would come,
whatever it is.

1348
02:00:53,289 --> 02:00:57,167
Margot!
Well, then at least
we'd know where we were.

1349
02:00:58,461 --> 02:01:01,546
You should be ashamed of yourself,
talking that way.

1350
02:01:02,548 --> 02:01:04,507
Think how lucky we are.

1351
02:01:05,968 --> 02:01:10,597
Think of the thousands
dying in the war every day.

1352
02:01:10,681 --> 02:01:13,683
Think of the people
in concentration camps.
What's the good of that?

1353
02:01:15,353 --> 02:01:19,522
What's the good of
thinking of misery when
you're already miserable?

1354
02:01:19,607 --> 02:01:22,025
That's stupid.

1355
02:01:22,109 --> 02:01:24,611
We're young,
Margot and Peter and I.

1356
02:01:24,695 --> 02:01:26,863
You grown-ups
have had your chance.

1357
02:01:29,033 --> 02:01:34,204
Look at us. If we begin
thinking of all the horror
in the world, we're lost.

1358
02:01:34,288 --> 02:01:37,123
We're trying to hold on
to some kind of ideals,

1359
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:41,670
when everything- ideals, hope-
everything is being destroyed.

1360
02:01:43,339 --> 02:01:46,466
It isn't our fault
the world is in such a mess.

1361
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:48,510
We weren't around
when all this started.

1362
02:01:48,594 --> 02:01:52,263
- Now you listen to me.
- So don't try to take it out on us.

1364
02:02:01,732 --> 02:02:05,068
She talks as if
we started the war.

1365
02:02:06,112 --> 02:02:08,279
Did we start the war?

1366
02:02:17,415 --> 02:02:19,416
You left this.

1367
02:02:20,418 --> 02:02:22,419
Thanks.

1368
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:29,175
I thought you were fine
just now.

1369
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:32,637
You know just how to talk to 'em.
I can never think when I'm mad.

1370
02:02:33,848 --> 02:02:36,474
I say too much.

1371
02:02:36,559 --> 02:02:38,893
I hurt people's feelings.

1372
02:02:41,313 --> 02:02:43,398
I think you're just fine.

1373
02:02:54,285 --> 02:02:56,286
Thank you, Peter.

1374
02:03:02,334 --> 02:03:06,129
That Dussel,
what he said about Mouschi,
about somebody eating him,

1375
02:03:06,213 --> 02:03:08,465
all I could think is
I wanted to hit him.

1376
02:03:08,549 --> 02:03:11,134
That's what I used to do
in school, but,

1377
02:03:11,218 --> 02:03:13,720
here a fight starts,
I just duck in my room.

1378
02:03:13,804 --> 02:03:16,973
You're lucky
having a room to go to.

1379
02:03:17,058 --> 02:03:20,060
His Lordship is always in mine.

1380
02:03:20,144 --> 02:03:24,230
When they start in on me,
I have to stand and take it.

1381
02:03:24,315 --> 02:03:27,233
You gave some of it
back to them just now.

1382
02:03:27,318 --> 02:03:30,278
I get so mad.

1383
02:03:30,362 --> 02:03:32,864
They've formed their opinions.

1384
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:34,866
About everything.

1385
02:03:35,868 --> 02:03:38,286
But we're still trying to find out.

1386
02:03:40,331 --> 02:03:44,959
We have problems here that
no other people our age have ever had.

1387
02:03:46,087 --> 02:03:48,505
And just as you think
you've solved them,

1388
02:03:48,589 --> 02:03:51,132
something comes along
and, bang,

1389
02:03:53,302 --> 02:03:56,513
you have to start all over again.

1390
02:03:59,517 --> 02:04:01,518
I think your father's fine.

1391
02:04:01,602 --> 02:04:04,312
Oh, he is, Peter.
He is.

1392
02:04:04,396 --> 02:04:08,358
He's the only one
who's ever given me the feeling
that I have any sense.

1393
02:04:14,115 --> 02:04:16,199
Isn't it funny, you and I?

1394
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:20,328
Here we've been together all this time...

1395
02:04:20,412 --> 02:04:22,914
and this is the first time
we've ever really talked.

1396
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:29,838
It helps a lot to have someone
to talk to, doesn't it?

1397
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:33,091
It helps you let off steam.

1398
02:04:34,718 --> 02:04:36,719

1399
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:52,986
Any time that...

1400
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:55,738
you want to let off steam,

1401
02:04:55,823 --> 02:04:57,991
you can come into my room.

1402
02:04:59,285 --> 02:05:02,620
I can get up
an awful lot of steam.

1403
02:05:02,705 --> 02:05:04,789
It's all right with me.

1404
02:05:05,958 --> 02:05:07,917
Do you mean that?

1405
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:14,215
I said it, didn't I?

1406
02:05:30,274 --> 02:05:30,732
Good night.
Good night.

1407
02:05:30,733 --> 02:05:32,775
Good night.
Good night.

1408
02:05:32,902 --> 02:05:35,528
Good night.
Good night.

1409
02:05:45,789 --> 02:05:50,585
May I come in?
No, Mr. Dussel.
I'm not dressed yet.

1410
02:05:50,669 --> 02:05:52,629
Oh.

1411
02:06:17,154 --> 02:06:19,113
Margot.
Hmm?

1412
02:06:19,198 --> 02:06:22,492
Tell me, am I terribly ugly?

1413
02:06:22,618 --> 02:06:24,661
Oh, stop fishing.
No. Tell me.

1414
02:06:24,745 --> 02:06:28,790
Of course you're not.
You've got nice eyes...

1415
02:06:28,874 --> 02:06:32,710
and a lot of animation
and- and-

1416
02:06:53,482 --> 02:06:55,692
- May I come in?
- Come in, Mother.

1417
02:06:56,777 --> 02:06:59,237
Mr. Dussel is impatient
to get in here.

1418
02:06:59,321 --> 02:07:02,240
He takes the room
for himself the entire day.

1419
02:07:02,324 --> 02:07:05,159
You're not going in again
tonight to see Peter, hmm?

1420
02:07:06,161 --> 02:07:08,579
That is my intention.

1421
02:07:11,834 --> 02:07:14,794
Aren't you afraid
you're disturbing him?

1422
02:07:14,878 --> 02:07:17,171
Mother, I have some intuition.

1423
02:07:17,256 --> 02:07:19,424
Then may I ask you
this much, Annie?

1424
02:07:19,508 --> 02:07:22,093
Please don't shut the door
when you go in.

1425
02:07:24,805 --> 02:07:27,307
You sound like
Mrs. Van Daan.

1426
02:07:27,391 --> 02:07:30,685
Oh, no. I don't mean
to suggest anything wrong.

1427
02:07:30,769 --> 02:07:33,938
I only wish you wouldn't
expose yourself to criticism.

1428
02:07:34,023 --> 02:07:37,942
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm going to Peter's room.

1429
02:07:38,027 --> 02:07:41,821
I'm not going to let
Petronella Van Daan
spoil our friendship.

1430
02:07:47,703 --> 02:07:49,787
Just a moment, Mr. Dussel.

1431
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:55,126
In my day the boys
called on the girls.

1432
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:58,921
You know how
young people are. Peter's room
is the only place they can talk.

1433
02:07:59,006 --> 02:08:01,007
Talk?

1434
02:08:01,091 --> 02:08:03,593
That's not what they called it
when I was a girl.

1435
02:08:06,096 --> 02:08:10,099
I'm sorry, Margot,
that you have to be
the one left out.

1436
02:08:11,894 --> 02:08:14,520
I feel so guilty about you.

1437
02:08:14,605 --> 02:08:16,814
Why?

1438
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:21,444
I mean, every time
I go to Peter-

1439
02:08:21,528 --> 02:08:25,239
into Peter's room,
I have the feeling
that I'm hurting you.

1440
02:08:26,909 --> 02:08:30,078
I know if it were me,
I'd be desperately jealous.

1441
02:08:32,915 --> 02:08:34,874
I am jealous a little.

1442
02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:36,959
Not of you and Peter.

1443
02:08:38,253 --> 02:08:40,213
I'm-

1444
02:08:40,297 --> 02:08:43,591
I'm only feeling sorry
that I haven't anyone...

1445
02:08:43,675 --> 02:08:46,552
with whom to-
to discuss my feelings.

1446
02:08:46,637 --> 02:08:48,554
Margot, I won't even-

1447
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:52,433
Listen, you've found
a companionship,
and I want you to enjoy it.

1448
02:08:52,518 --> 02:08:57,146
Only... in my heart I feel
that I've got a right to share
feelings with someone too.

1449
02:08:59,650 --> 02:09:04,278
But I'm sure that Peter-
that that boy, he could just
never be that person for me.

1450
02:09:04,363 --> 02:09:06,280

1451
02:09:06,365 --> 02:09:08,908
Maybe there's nothing
to be jealous about.

1452
02:09:10,494 --> 02:09:12,870
Maybe I'm just
taking the place of his cat.

1453
02:09:12,955 --> 02:09:14,872
Will you please let me
in my room?

1454
02:09:14,957 --> 02:09:18,501
Just a minute,
dear, dear Mr. Dussel.

1455
02:09:29,471 --> 02:09:32,265
Well, here I go...

1456
02:09:32,349 --> 02:09:34,308
to run the gauntlet.

1457
02:09:37,271 --> 02:09:39,313
Thank you so much.

1458
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:49,532

1459
02:09:51,201 --> 02:09:53,619
Look at her.

1460
02:09:53,704 --> 02:09:57,373
A lot of good it did me
to have a son.
I never see him.

1461
02:09:59,209 --> 02:10:01,210
Just a minute, dear.

1462
02:10:02,671 --> 02:10:06,382
I'd like to say
a few words to my son.
Do you mind?

1463
02:10:06,467 --> 02:10:10,052
Peter, I do not want you staying
up till all hours tonight.

1464
02:10:10,137 --> 02:10:12,180
You need your sleep.
You are a growing boy.

1465
02:10:12,264 --> 02:10:15,850
Anne won't stay late.
She's going to bed
promptly at 9:00.

1466
02:10:15,976 --> 02:10:19,812
Aren't you, Anne?
Yes, Mother. May we go now?

1467
02:10:19,897 --> 02:10:22,190
Listen for the chimes, dear.

1468
02:10:42,127 --> 02:10:44,253
Aren't they impossible?

1469
02:10:45,964 --> 02:10:49,091
Treating us as if
we're still in the nursery.

1470
02:10:50,677 --> 02:10:53,679
Don't let it bother you.
It- It doesn't bother me.

1471
02:10:57,768 --> 02:11:00,144
I suppose you can't
really blame them.

1472
02:11:01,522 --> 02:11:04,273
They think back
to what they were like
at our age.

1473
02:11:05,567 --> 02:11:09,278
They don't realize
how much more advanced
we are.

1476
02:11:20,207 --> 02:11:22,959
Already I know
what I want to do.
Don't you?

1477
02:11:24,127 --> 02:11:27,088
I want to be
a journalist
or something.

1478
02:11:27,172 --> 02:11:29,173
I love to write.

1479
02:11:30,592 --> 02:11:32,593
What do you want to do?

1480
02:11:34,721 --> 02:11:36,722
I know
what I'd like right now.

1481
02:11:36,807 --> 02:11:40,351
I'd like to make it to England,
get with the Free Dutch Forces
over there.

1482
02:11:40,435 --> 02:11:43,563
Peter, you wouldn't
try a thing like that.

1483
02:11:44,565 --> 02:11:47,984
You'd never make it.
I'd make it.

1484
02:11:53,115 --> 02:11:55,866
Only a few of the hundreds
that try do.

1485
02:11:57,661 --> 02:12:01,831
I know, but... I'd like to get in it
and- and hit back.

1486
02:12:01,915 --> 02:12:05,209
To just sit here, it's not for me.

1487
02:12:10,424 --> 02:12:12,717
You like Margot, don't you?

1488
02:12:12,801 --> 02:12:14,719
Right from the start
you liked her.

1489
02:12:14,803 --> 02:12:16,721
Liked her better than me.

1490
02:12:18,557 --> 02:12:20,558
Oh, I don't know.

1491
02:12:20,642 --> 02:12:22,560
It's all right.

1492
02:12:22,644 --> 02:12:24,770
Everyone feels that way.

1493
02:12:24,855 --> 02:12:26,981
Margot's so good.

1494
02:12:27,065 --> 02:12:31,611
She's sweet and bright
and beautiful, and I'm not.

1495
02:12:31,695 --> 02:12:33,613
I wouldn't say that.

1496
02:12:33,697 --> 02:12:36,866
Oh, no, I'm not.
I know that.

1497
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:40,077
I know quite well
that I'm not a beauty.

1498
02:12:40,162 --> 02:12:42,330
I never have been
and never shall be.

1499
02:12:42,414 --> 02:12:45,166
I don't agree at all.

1500
02:12:47,002 --> 02:12:49,587
I think you're pretty.

1501
02:12:49,671 --> 02:12:51,714
That's not true.

1502
02:12:51,798 --> 02:12:54,216
A-And another thing.

1503
02:12:54,301 --> 02:12:57,470
You've changed.
From the first, I mean.

1504
02:12:57,554 --> 02:12:59,597
I have?

1505
02:13:01,725 --> 02:13:05,561
I used to think that
you were awful noisy.

1506
02:13:05,646 --> 02:13:09,231
And what
do you think now, Peter?

1507
02:13:09,316 --> 02:13:11,275
How have I changed?

1508
02:13:12,819 --> 02:13:15,404
Well, you-

1509
02:13:15,489 --> 02:13:17,406
You're quieter.

1510
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:22,912
I'm glad
you don’t just hate me.

1511
02:13:23,997 --> 02:13:25,998
I never said that.

1512
02:13:47,979 --> 02:13:51,774
I bet when you get out of here,
you'll never think of me again.

1513
02:13:53,151 --> 02:13:55,236
That's crazy.

1514
02:13:56,738 --> 02:13:58,823
When you get back
with all your friends,

1515
02:13:58,907 --> 02:14:00,866
you're going to say,

1516
02:14:00,951 --> 02:14:03,703
"Now, what did I ever see
in that Miss Quack-Quack?"

1517
02:14:04,996 --> 02:14:08,499
I haven't got any friends.
Peter, of course you have.

1518
02:14:09,668 --> 02:14:12,002
Everyone has friends.

1519
02:14:12,087 --> 02:14:15,256
Not me. I don't want any.

1520
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:17,800
I get along fine without 'em.

1521
02:14:20,637 --> 02:14:23,764
Does that mean you can
get along without me too?

1522
02:14:25,934 --> 02:14:28,769
I think of myself
as your friend.

1523
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:32,857
No.

1524
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:35,651
If they were all like you,

1525
02:14:35,736 --> 02:14:37,653
it'd be different.

1527
02:14:48,331 --> 02:14:51,417
Peter-
Hmm?

1528
02:14:51,501 --> 02:14:53,836
Did you ever kiss a girl?

1529
02:14:57,841 --> 02:14:59,800
Yes.

1530
02:14:59,885 --> 02:15:01,844
Once.

1531
02:15:02,846 --> 02:15:05,139
Was she pretty?

1532
02:15:05,223 --> 02:15:07,933
The girl you kissed.

1533
02:15:08,018 --> 02:15:10,770
I don't know.
I was blindfolded.

1534
02:15:10,854 --> 02:15:13,439
It was at a party.
One of those kissing games.

1535
02:15:13,523 --> 02:15:15,441
Oh.

1536
02:15:15,525 --> 02:15:18,110
I don't suppose that
really counts, does it?

1537
02:15:20,655 --> 02:15:22,698
It didn't with me.

1538
02:15:24,868 --> 02:15:26,869
I've been kissed twice.

1539
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:32,750
Once a man
I'd never seen before
kissed me on the cheek...

1540
02:15:32,834 --> 02:15:34,960
when he picked me up
off the ice.

1541
02:15:36,046 --> 02:15:38,047
I was crying.

1542
02:15:39,716 --> 02:15:44,178
And the other was
a friend of Father's
who kissed my hand.

1543
02:15:47,224 --> 02:15:50,226
You wouldn't say those
counted, would you?

1544
02:15:51,812 --> 02:15:54,563
I wouldn't say so.

1546
02:16:07,577 --> 02:16:09,662
I know almost for certain...

1547
02:16:09,746 --> 02:16:13,582
Margot would never
kiss anyone unless
she was engaged to them.

1548
02:16:17,254 --> 02:16:20,923
And I'm sure too
that Mother never
touched a man before Father.

1549
02:16:24,052 --> 02:16:26,011
But I don't know.

1550
02:16:27,013 --> 02:16:29,265
Things are so different now.

1551
02:16:31,101 --> 02:16:33,269
What do you think?

1552
02:16:34,771 --> 02:16:37,189
Do you think a girl
shouldn't kiss anyone...

1553
02:16:37,274 --> 02:16:39,942
except if she's engaged
or something?

1554
02:16:43,947 --> 02:16:47,074
It's so hard
to try to think what to do,

1555
02:16:48,577 --> 02:16:52,413
when here we are
with the whole world
falling around our ears.

1556
02:16:53,915 --> 02:16:56,959
And you think,

1557
02:16:57,043 --> 02:17:00,170
well, you don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow.

1558
02:17:02,924 --> 02:17:04,842
What do you think?

1559
02:17:06,094 --> 02:17:08,554
Well, uh,

1560
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:11,682
I suppose it-
it depends on the girl.

1561
02:17:13,476 --> 02:17:17,313
With some, n-no matter
what they do, it's wrong.

1562
02:17:18,356 --> 02:17:20,316
But others,

1563
02:17:21,818 --> 02:17:24,570
it wouldn't necessarily
be wrong with them.

1564
02:17:24,654 --> 02:17:26,822
I always thought that...

1565
02:17:26,907 --> 02:17:28,824
when two people-

1566
02:17:28,909 --> 02:17:31,035
I think I should go now.

1567
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:35,331
That's right.

1568
02:17:38,501 --> 02:17:40,502
Good night.

1569
02:17:45,508 --> 02:17:49,345
You won't let 'em
stop you from coming?
No.

1570
02:17:50,347 --> 02:17:53,223
I might bring my diary.

1571
02:17:53,308 --> 02:17:56,852
There are so many
things in it I want to
talk over with you.

1572
02:17:56,937 --> 02:17:59,104
There's a lot about you.

1573
02:17:59,189 --> 02:18:01,148
What kind of things?

1574
02:18:03,818 --> 02:18:06,195
Well,

1575
02:18:06,279 --> 02:18:08,572
I wouldn't want you
to see some of it.

1576
02:18:09,574 --> 02:18:11,867
I thought you were nothing.

1577
02:18:12,911 --> 02:18:15,245
Just the way
you thought about me.

1578
02:18:17,666 --> 02:18:19,875
Did you change your mind,

1579
02:18:21,086 --> 02:18:23,545
the way I changed my mind
about you?

1580
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:27,841
Well, you'll see.

1581
02:19:47,589 --> 02:19:49,590
Good night, Annele.

1582
02:19:54,846 --> 02:19:56,847
Good night, angel.
Good night.

1583
02:20:14,115 --> 02:20:18,035

1584
02:20:23,374 --> 02:20:25,334
Mm-hmm.

1585
02:20:38,139 --> 02:20:40,766
Outside there is
a quiet excitement.

1586
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:42,059
Invasion fever is mounting
from day to day,

1587
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:43,936
Invasion fever is mounting
from day to day,

1588
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:47,022
and people talk of nothing else
but the hope of liberation.

1589
02:20:48,024 --> 02:20:49,942
It had best come soon.

1590
02:20:50,026 --> 02:20:52,486
We here have had bad news.

1591
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:56,490
The people from whom
Miep got our ration cards
have been arrested.

1592
02:20:58,493 --> 02:21:01,745
Mr. Kraler is in the hospital.

1593
02:21:01,830 --> 02:21:04,456
It seems he has ulcers.

1594
02:21:04,541 --> 02:21:07,042
I'm afraid we are his ulcers.

1595
02:21:08,253 --> 02:21:10,879
Miep has to run the business
and us too.

1596
02:21:13,091 --> 02:21:15,134
How very fortunate we are...

1597
02:21:15,218 --> 02:21:17,928
when you think of
what is happening outside.

1598
02:22:18,198 --> 02:22:20,616
I feel that spring is coming.

1599
02:22:21,701 --> 02:22:24,453
I feel it
in my whole body and soul.

1600
02:22:25,663 --> 02:22:27,789
I'm utterly confused.

1601
02:22:29,709 --> 02:22:33,712
I am longing-
so longing for everything.

1605
02:25:17,919 --> 02:25:20,962
Otto! Otto, quick.
He's stealing the food!

1606
02:25:21,047 --> 02:25:23,215
Edith, Edith!
Mr. Van Daan,
let me see that!

1607
02:25:23,299 --> 02:25:25,759
Mr. Van Daan, come-
Let me-

1608
02:25:25,885 --> 02:25:28,929
Give me-
What happened?
Mr. Van Daan. Mr.-

1609
02:25:29,013 --> 02:25:30,931
Look, the bread!

1610
02:25:31,015 --> 02:25:32,891
You dirty thief.

1611
02:25:33,017 --> 02:25:35,727
You good-for-nothing.
Let him go, Mr. Dussel.
Help me, Peter.

1612
02:25:35,812 --> 02:25:38,355
Let him go!
Peter, help me!

1613
02:25:38,439 --> 02:25:41,316
Let him go!

1615
02:25:52,412 --> 02:25:54,996
Putti,
what is it?

1616
02:25:55,081 --> 02:25:57,999
He was stealing the bread.

1617
02:25:58,084 --> 02:26:02,337
It was you.
And all the time
we thought it was the rats.

1618
02:26:02,422 --> 02:26:05,173
Mr. Van Daan,
how could you?

1619
02:26:06,467 --> 02:26:09,928
I'm hungry.
We're all of us hungry.

1620
02:26:10,012 --> 02:26:13,223
I see the children getting
thinner and thinner.

1621
02:26:13,307 --> 02:26:17,102
Your own son, I've heard him
moan in his sleep,
he's so hungry.

1622
02:26:17,186 --> 02:26:22,023
And you come down in the night
and steal food that should
go to them, the children.

1623
02:26:24,193 --> 02:26:26,319
He needs more food
than the rest of us.

1624
02:26:26,404 --> 02:26:28,822
He's used to more.
He's a big man.

1625
02:26:28,906 --> 02:26:30,991
And you!

1626
02:26:31,075 --> 02:26:33,702
You're worse than he is.
You're a mother,

1627
02:26:33,786 --> 02:26:36,663
and yet you sacrifice
your son to this man,
this-this-

1628
02:26:36,747 --> 02:26:38,665
Edith.

1629
02:26:38,749 --> 02:26:40,792
Don't think I haven't seen you.

1630
02:26:40,877 --> 02:26:44,629
Always saving
the choicest bits for him.
I've watched you.

1631
02:26:44,714 --> 02:26:47,549
Day after day,
and I've held my tongue,
but not any longer.

1632
02:26:47,633 --> 02:26:49,551
Not after this!

1633
02:26:49,635 --> 02:26:52,971
Now I want him to go.
I want him to
get out of here!

1634
02:26:53,055 --> 02:26:54,973
Edith.

1635
02:26:55,057 --> 02:26:57,559
Get out of here?

1636
02:26:59,061 --> 02:27:02,355
What do you mean?
Just that.
Take your things and get out.

1637
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:05,358
You're speaking in anger.
You cannot mean
what you're saying.

1638
02:27:05,485 --> 02:27:09,070
I mean exactly that.
For two long years
we have lived here side by side.

1639
02:27:09,155 --> 02:27:11,198
We have respected
each other's rights.

1640
02:27:11,282 --> 02:27:14,242
We have managed to live in peace.
Are we going to throw it all away?

1641
02:27:16,329 --> 02:27:18,330
Mr. Van Daan,

1642
02:27:18,414 --> 02:27:21,124
I know this is never going
to happen again, is it?

1643
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:25,128
No, no.
Ah, he steals once,
he'll steal again.

1644
02:27:25,213 --> 02:27:28,173
I want them to leave.
You go now!

1645
02:27:35,848 --> 02:27:37,766
Mother.

1646
02:27:37,850 --> 02:27:41,520
You're not putting Peter out?
Peter hasn't done anything.

1647
02:27:41,604 --> 02:27:44,773
I don't mean Peter.
Peter can stay.

1648
02:27:44,857 --> 02:27:48,109
I'll have to go if he goes.
That's my father.

1649
02:27:48,194 --> 02:27:50,654
He's no father to you,
that man.

1650
02:27:50,738 --> 02:27:52,864
He doesn't know
what it means to be a father.

1651
02:27:52,949 --> 02:27:55,617
I wouldn't feel right.
I couldn't stay.

1652
02:27:55,701 --> 02:27:57,786
Very well then.

1653
02:27:57,870 --> 02:27:59,788
Peter. No.

1654
02:28:03,292 --> 02:28:07,671
Mrs. Frank,
you would put us
out in the street?

1655
02:28:08,965 --> 02:28:10,924
You can find
another hiding place.

1656
02:28:12,176 --> 02:28:15,971
Where would we even find
a cellar- a-a closet?

1657
02:28:22,562 --> 02:28:24,479
Mr. Frank,

1658
02:28:27,358 --> 02:28:29,526
you told Putti...

1659
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:33,905
you would never forget
what he did for you when
you first came to Holland.

1660
02:28:33,990 --> 02:28:36,241
You said you never
would be able to repay him.

1661
02:28:36,325 --> 02:28:39,911
If my husband had
any obligations to you,
he has paid it over and over.

1662
02:28:39,996 --> 02:28:43,540
Edith, I don't know you.
I've never seen you like this.

1663
02:28:43,624 --> 02:28:46,126
I should have
spoken out long ago.

1664
02:28:46,210 --> 02:28:48,378
You can't be nice
to some people.

1665
02:28:48,462 --> 02:28:51,548
There would have been plenty
for all of us if you hadn't
come in here!

1666
02:28:51,632 --> 02:28:54,759
No, no, Mrs. Van Daan.
Please.

1668
02:28:58,764 --> 02:29:02,100
We don't need the Nazis
to destroy us.

1669
02:29:02,184 --> 02:29:04,728
We're destroying ourselves.

1670
02:29:09,859 --> 02:29:12,777
Mother, please don't
send them away.

1671
02:29:12,862 --> 02:29:16,197
It's daylight.
And they'll be caught.

1672
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:20,160
Supreme headquarters-
They're not going now.

1673
02:29:20,244 --> 02:29:26,124
- They'll stay until Miep
finds them a place to hide.
- Mrs. Frank, Mr. Frank, Margot.

1674
02:29:26,208 --> 02:29:28,168
Oh, no, no.

1675
02:29:28,252 --> 02:29:32,797
We haven't sunk so low
that we're gonna fight
amongst ourselves over food.

1676
02:29:32,882 --> 02:29:37,218
That's Anne.
That's Mrs. Van Daan,
Mr. Van Daan.

1677
02:29:37,303 --> 02:29:38,303
You see what he's doing?

1678
02:29:38,304 --> 02:29:39,679
You see what he's doing?

1679
02:29:39,764 --> 02:29:42,515
"I'm still standing by
to bring you further news
of the invasion."

1680
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:45,977
Did you hear that?
"For those of you who may not
have heard, let me repeat.

1681
02:29:46,062 --> 02:29:48,438
The landings began this morning
on the coast of Normandy."

1682
02:29:48,564 --> 02:29:50,523
It's started. Listen!
D-Day has come.

1683
02:29:50,608 --> 02:29:53,360
During the night
and in the early hours
of this morning,

1684
02:29:53,486 --> 02:29:55,111
an immense armada-
Listen!

1685
02:29:55,196 --> 02:29:57,572
4,000 ships and thousands
of smaller craft-
Peter, myself.

1686
02:29:57,698 --> 02:29:59,616
You're keeping all
the big ones for yourself.
No.

1687
02:29:59,742 --> 02:30:01,660
Yes, you are.
All the big ones.

1688
02:30:01,786 --> 02:30:03,662
Look at the size of that one.
That's mine.

1689
02:30:03,788 --> 02:30:05,747
And look at that one.
That's Mr. Van Daan's.

1690
02:30:05,873 --> 02:30:07,791
Well, look at-
Stop it! Stop it!

1691
02:30:07,917 --> 02:30:10,335
Stop counting potatoes!
It's Miep. Let me in.

1692
02:30:10,419 --> 02:30:13,088
Mr. Frank and Mrs. Frank!

1693
02:30:13,172 --> 02:30:15,840
Mr. Dussel, I beg of you,
don't let her see
a thing like this.

1694
02:30:15,925 --> 02:30:17,801
Well, this is-
Mrs. Frank-

1695
02:30:17,927 --> 02:30:20,178
The invasion has begun!

1696
02:30:20,262 --> 02:30:23,056
The most wonderful news.
The invasion has begun!

1697
02:30:25,393 --> 02:30:27,352
[Man]
Only preliminary reports
have come in-

1698
02:30:27,436 --> 02:30:29,437
Did you hear?
They have landed!

1699
02:30:29,522 --> 02:30:32,732
On the coast of France.
In Normandy.

1700
02:30:32,817 --> 02:30:35,485
The British, the Americans.
They're all in it!

1701
02:30:35,569 --> 02:30:38,571
Dutch, French, Poles,
Norwegians, everyone.

1702
02:30:38,698 --> 02:30:39,823
D-Day they call it.
D-Day.

1703
02:30:39,949 --> 02:30:42,283
At last! Oh!

1704
02:30:42,368 --> 02:30:44,911
- It's me. Kraler.
- It cannot be Mr. Kraler.

1705
02:30:44,995 --> 02:30:48,456
- But it is Mr. Kraler.

1707
02:30:50,584 --> 02:30:52,627
Did you hear?

1708
02:30:52,712 --> 02:30:54,796
Isn't it wonderful?

1709
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:56,798
When the nurse
told me the news,

1710
02:30:56,882 --> 02:31:00,051
I said to myself there’s
only one place for me to be-
with my friends.

Quick.

I'll be up later.

1724
02:31:48,142 --> 02:31:50,935
Good-bye,
my dear friends.
Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.

1725
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:52,937
Thank you, Miep.

1726
02:31:53,022 --> 02:31:55,774

1727
02:31:55,858 --> 02:31:58,818
Putti, what is it?
What happened?

1728
02:31:58,903 --> 02:32:01,946
I am so ashamed!

1729
02:32:02,072 --> 02:32:04,783
Oh, for heaven's sake.

1730
02:32:04,867 --> 02:32:07,660
Putti, don't.

1731
02:32:07,745 --> 02:32:11,080
Mr. Van Daan,
didn't you hear?

1732
02:32:11,207 --> 02:32:13,958
We're going to be liberated.

1733
02:32:14,043 --> 02:32:16,085
This is a time to celebrate.

1734
02:32:18,547 --> 02:32:21,299
To steal bread
from children.

1735
02:32:21,383 --> 02:32:24,886
Oh, we've all done things
that we're ashamed of.

1736
02:32:24,970 --> 02:32:28,765
Look at the way
I treated Mother-
so mean and horrid to her.

1737
02:32:28,849 --> 02:32:32,143
No, Anneke. No.
Oh, I was, Mother.
I was awful.

1738
02:32:32,228 --> 02:32:34,312
Not like me.

1739
02:32:34,396 --> 02:32:36,564
No one is
as bad as me.

1740
02:32:36,649 --> 02:32:38,983
Torpedo boats
join British warships...

1741
02:32:39,068 --> 02:32:42,737
and thousands of Allied planes
in laying down
an earthshaking bombardment.

1742
02:32:42,863 --> 02:32:45,455
Stop it!

1743
02:32:45,533 --> 02:32:48,076
Let's be happy!

1744
02:32:51,914 --> 02:32:53,873
Edith.

1745
02:32:55,042 --> 02:32:59,546
When I think of
the terrible things I said.

1746
02:32:59,630 --> 02:33:02,423
No, no.
You were right.

1747
02:33:03,926 --> 02:33:06,511
That I should speak
that way to you,

1748
02:33:06,595 --> 02:33:09,138
our friends, our guests.

1750
02:33:11,767 --> 02:33:15,562
Stop it! You're spoiling
the whole invasion.

1751
02:33:50,472 --> 02:33:52,640
Almighty God,

1752
02:33:52,725 --> 02:33:54,642
our sons,

1753
02:33:54,727 --> 02:33:57,020
pride of our nation,

1754
02:33:57,104 --> 02:34:00,273
this day have set upon
a mighty endeavor-

1755
02:34:00,357 --> 02:34:02,275
Lift up your hearts.

1756
02:34:02,359 --> 02:34:04,485
Out of the depths of sorrow...

1757
02:34:04,570 --> 02:34:06,487
and of sacrifice...

1758
02:34:06,572 --> 02:34:09,741
will be born again
the glory of mankind.

1762
02:34:43,651 --> 02:34:46,319
We are all in much better
spirits these days.

1763
02:34:46,403 --> 02:34:50,156
There is still excellent news
of the invasion.

1764
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:55,078
And the best part about it
is that I have a feeling
that friends are coming.

1765
02:34:56,205 --> 02:34:58,122
Our beloved queen spoke.

1766
02:34:58,207 --> 02:35:00,375
She used words like "soon,"

1767
02:35:00,459 --> 02:35:03,795
"when I am back,"
"speedy liberation."

1768
02:35:03,879 --> 02:35:05,797
Who knows?

1769
02:35:05,881 --> 02:35:08,299
I may be back in school by fall.

1770
02:35:17,851 --> 02:35:21,104
Wednesday,
the second of July, 1944.

1771
02:35:21,188 --> 02:35:23,648
Fierce counterattacks
by enemy panzer divisions-

1772
02:35:23,732 --> 02:35:26,401
The invasion seems
temporarily bogged down.

1775
02:35:35,119 --> 02:35:37,829
Mr. Kraler is back in the hospital.

1776
02:35:37,913 --> 02:35:40,665
He has to have an operation.

1777
02:35:40,749 --> 02:35:43,126
It seems D-Day
was too much for him.

1778
02:35:44,670 --> 02:35:46,838
Thank you.
Here you are.

1779
02:35:48,215 --> 02:35:50,717
Ha ha. The joke is on us.

1780
02:35:50,801 --> 02:35:53,845
Miep tells us the warehouseman
doesn't know a thing,

1781
02:35:53,929 --> 02:35:56,514
and we're paying him
all that money.

1785
02:36:34,011 --> 02:36:39,307
Our dear vegetable man is on his way
to a concentration camp.

1786
02:36:39,391 --> 02:36:42,977
He was picked up today for
hiding two Jews in his house.

1788
02:36:50,694 --> 02:36:52,820
There's not much.

1789
02:36:52,905 --> 02:36:55,656
It was Mr. Hauk,
our greengrocer,
they arrested.

1790
02:36:57,618 --> 02:36:59,535
And the other news is...

1791
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:02,121
the Gestapo have found
our typewriter that was stolen.

1792
02:37:02,247 --> 02:37:04,457
No.
Uh-huh.

1793
02:37:04,541 --> 02:37:08,878
They'll trace it back and back
till it gets to us.

1794
02:37:08,962 --> 02:37:10,963
You watch, you-

1796
02:37:24,353 --> 02:37:26,479
Everyone is low.

1797
02:37:26,563 --> 02:37:29,148
Even Father can't raise
their spirits.

1798
02:37:30,192 --> 02:37:33,027
I have often
been downcast myself,

1799
02:37:33,112 --> 02:37:35,113
but never in despair.

1800
02:37:35,197 --> 02:37:39,784
I can shake off everything
if I write, but-

1801
02:37:39,868 --> 02:37:42,578
and that is the great question-

1802
02:37:42,663 --> 02:37:45,498
will I ever be able
to write well?

1803
02:37:45,582 --> 02:37:48,084
I want to so much.

1804
02:37:48,168 --> 02:37:51,295
I want to go on living
even after my death.

1807
02:38:08,605 --> 02:38:10,565

1808
02:38:16,780 --> 02:38:19,574
There it goes again.

1809
02:38:19,658 --> 02:38:21,701
Mr. Frank, do you hear?

1810
02:38:21,785 --> 02:38:24,495
Yes, I hear.

1811
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:27,498
This is the third time.

1812
02:38:27,583 --> 02:38:31,836
The third time
in quick succession.

1813
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:34,547
It's a signal.

1814
02:38:34,631 --> 02:38:37,425
I tell you it's Miep
trying to get us.

1815
02:38:38,594 --> 02:38:40,553
For some reason she-
she can't come to us,

1816
02:38:40,637 --> 02:38:42,597
and she's trying to
warn us of something.

1817
02:38:42,681 --> 02:38:44,640
Please, Mr. Dussel.
Please.

1818
02:38:44,766 --> 02:38:48,144
You're wasting
your breath.

1819
02:38:48,270 --> 02:38:51,856
Something has happened,
Mr. Frank.

1820
02:38:51,940 --> 02:38:56,360
It's been three days now
that Miep hasn't been to see us.

1821
02:39:02,868 --> 02:39:05,703
And today not a man
has come to work.

1822
02:39:05,787 --> 02:39:08,122
There hasn't been a sound
in the building.

1823
02:39:09,499 --> 02:39:11,542
Perhaps it's Sunday.

1824
02:39:11,627 --> 02:39:14,670
We may have lost track
of the days.

1825
02:39:14,755 --> 02:39:18,216
You with the diary there,
what day is it?

1826
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:21,510
I don't lose track
of the days.

1827
02:39:21,595 --> 02:39:23,763
I know exactly
what day it is.

1828
02:39:25,307 --> 02:39:28,601
It's Friday,
the fourth of August.

1829
02:39:28,685 --> 02:39:31,395
It's Friday,
and-and not a man at work.


1831
02:39:35,317 --> 02:39:37,610
I tell you,
Mr. Kraler is dead.

1832
02:39:38,820 --> 02:39:40,821
That's the only explanation.

1833
02:39:40,906 --> 02:39:43,115
He's dead, and they've
closed down the building,

1834
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:45,117
and that's what Miep's
trying to tell us.

1835
02:39:45,202 --> 02:39:47,578
She would never
telephone us, Mr. Dussel.

1836
02:39:47,663 --> 02:39:50,164
Please, I beg of you,
Mr. Frank, answer the phone.

1837
02:39:50,290 --> 02:39:52,792
No.
Just pick it up and listen.
You don't have to speak.

1838
02:39:52,876 --> 02:39:56,003
-Just listen and see if it's Miep.

1839
02:39:56,088 --> 02:39:58,714
For God's sake,
answer the telephone!

1840
02:39:58,799 --> 02:40:00,800
I've told you, no.

1841
02:40:00,884 --> 02:40:02,517

1842
02:40:06,098 --> 02:40:10,059
I'll do nothing
that might let anyone know
that we are in this building.

1843
02:40:10,143 --> 02:40:12,645
Mr. Frank's right.

1844
02:40:12,729 --> 02:40:14,981
There's no need to tell us
what side you're on.

1845
02:40:15,065 --> 02:40:20,278
If we wait here quietly
and... patiently,
I believe that help will come.

1846
02:40:24,157 --> 02:40:27,243

1847
02:40:27,327 --> 02:40:30,079
Mr. Dussel-

1848
02:40:30,163 --> 02:40:33,124
No, Mr.- Mr. Dussel-
Mr. Dussel!

1849
02:40:33,208 --> 02:40:34,750

1850
02:40:47,681 --> 02:40:49,598
Too late.

1851
02:40:56,898 --> 02:41:01,444
So we just wait here...
until we die.

1852
02:41:01,528 --> 02:41:04,322
I can't stand it.
I'll kill myself.

1853
02:41:04,406 --> 02:41:06,991
For heaven's sake,
stop it.

1854
02:41:07,075 --> 02:41:10,578
I think you would be glad if I did.
You want me to die.

1855
02:41:10,662 --> 02:41:12,663
Whose fault is it
we're here?

1856
02:41:12,748 --> 02:41:15,333
We could have been safe
in America or Switzerland.

1857
02:41:15,417 --> 02:41:18,544
But no, no.
You wouldn't leave
when I wanted to.

1858
02:41:18,628 --> 02:41:20,838
You couldn't leave
your precious things.

1859
02:41:20,964 --> 02:41:23,424
Your furniture.
That's right.

1860
02:41:23,508 --> 02:41:26,594
Blame it all on me.
It's all my fault.

1861
02:41:26,678 --> 02:41:29,305
Your hats, your shoes,
your dishes.

1862
02:41:29,389 --> 02:41:31,599
For your comfort
we had anything.

1863
02:41:31,725 --> 02:41:35,519
My comfort.
I never had anything
I really wanted.

1864
02:41:35,604 --> 02:41:37,688
Everything was
for your pleasure!

1865
02:41:37,773 --> 02:41:38,689

1866
02:41:38,690 --> 02:41:39,774

1867
02:41:40,776 --> 02:41:42,777

1868
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:48,657
Look, Peter.
Look at the sky.

1869
02:41:49,951 --> 02:41:53,245
Aren't the clouds beautiful?

1870
02:41:54,623 --> 02:41:57,416
A lovely, lovely day.

1871
02:42:06,593 --> 02:42:08,511
You know what I do...

1872
02:42:08,595 --> 02:42:12,473
when I think
I can't stand another minute
of being cooped up?

1873
02:42:14,476 --> 02:42:16,977
I think myself outside.

1874
02:42:19,356 --> 02:42:23,109
I think I'm on a walk
in the park where
I used to go with Father,

1875
02:42:23,193 --> 02:42:27,738
where the crocus and
the jonquils and the violets
grow along the slopes.

1876
02:42:32,035 --> 02:42:34,995
You know...

1877
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:39,125
the most wonderful part
of thinking yourself outside?

1878
02:42:46,842 --> 02:42:50,177
You can have it
any way you like.

1879
02:42:52,180 --> 02:42:57,184
You can have roses and violets
and tulips all blooming
in the same season.

1880
02:43:00,230 --> 02:43:02,565
Isn't that wonderful?

1881
02:43:06,862 --> 02:43:10,781
When I was outside,
I used to take it all for granted.

1882
02:43:10,866 --> 02:43:14,034
And now in here I've just
gone crazy about nature.

1883
02:43:17,372 --> 02:43:19,373
I've just gone crazy.

1884
02:43:20,542 --> 02:43:23,878
I think if something
doesn't happen soon-

1885
02:43:23,962 --> 02:43:26,881
if we don't
get out of here-

1886
02:43:26,965 --> 02:43:30,801
I can't stand
much more of this.

1887
02:43:30,886 --> 02:43:33,554
I wish you had a religion, Peter.

1888
02:43:35,265 --> 02:43:37,475
No, thanks.

1889
02:43:37,559 --> 02:43:39,477
Not me.

1890
02:43:39,561 --> 02:43:41,896
I don't mean
you have to be Orthodox...

1891
02:43:43,315 --> 02:43:46,859
or believe in heaven and hell
and purgatory and things.

1892
02:43:47,861 --> 02:43:50,196
I just mean some religion.

1893
02:43:51,656 --> 02:43:53,824
It doesn't matter what.

1894
02:43:53,909 --> 02:43:55,910
Just to believe in something.

1895
02:44:01,082 --> 02:44:03,250
When I think of
all that's out there,

1896
02:44:03,335 --> 02:44:05,669
the trees and flowers...

1897
02:44:06,755 --> 02:44:08,756
and those seagulls-

1898
02:44:13,094 --> 02:44:16,138
When I think of
the dearness of you, Peter...

1899
02:44:23,230 --> 02:44:25,856
and the goodness
of the people we know-

1900
02:44:25,941 --> 02:44:28,817
Mr. Kraler and Miep,
the vegetable man-

1901
02:44:30,612 --> 02:44:34,073
all of them risking their lives
for us every day-

1902
02:44:36,034 --> 02:44:40,454
When I think of these good things,
I'm not afraid anymore.

1903
02:44:40,539 --> 02:44:43,123
I find myself...

1904
02:44:43,208 --> 02:44:45,125
in God, and I-

1905
02:44:45,210 --> 02:44:48,587
That's-
That's fine, but-

1906
02:44:51,424 --> 02:44:54,051
When I begin to think, well,

1907
02:44:54,135 --> 02:44:56,971
I get mad.

1908
02:44:57,055 --> 02:44:59,723
Look at us.

1909
02:44:59,808 --> 02:45:01,976
Hiding out here
for two years.

1910
02:45:03,270 --> 02:45:05,271
Not able to move.
Caught like-

1911
02:45:08,483 --> 02:45:11,110
Waiting for them
to come and get us.

1912
02:45:22,289 --> 02:45:25,833
We're not the only people
that have had to suffer.

1913
02:45:25,917 --> 02:45:29,044
There have always been
people that have had to.

1914
02:45:29,129 --> 02:45:32,756
Sometimes one race,
sometimes another, and yet-

1915
02:45:32,841 --> 02:45:35,050
That doesn't
make me feel any better.

1916
02:45:38,013 --> 02:45:41,348
I know it's terrible,
trying to have any faith...

1917
02:45:41,433 --> 02:45:43,642
when people are doing
such horrible-

1918
02:45:45,145 --> 02:45:48,606
But you know what
I sometimes think?

1919
02:45:48,690 --> 02:45:51,775
I think the world may be
going through a phase,

1920
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:54,653
the way I was with Mother.

1921
02:45:54,738 --> 02:45:57,573
It'll pass.

1922
02:45:57,657 --> 02:45:59,992
Maybe not
for hundreds of years,

1923
02:46:00,076 --> 02:46:02,161
but someday.

1924
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,249
I still believe,

1925
02:46:07,334 --> 02:46:09,627
in spite of everything,

1926
02:46:09,711 --> 02:46:12,046
that people are
really good at heart.

1927
02:46:19,220 --> 02:46:21,930
I want to see something now,

1928
02:46:22,015 --> 02:46:24,850
not a thousand years from now.

1929
02:46:24,934 --> 02:46:26,894
But, Peter,

1930
02:46:26,978 --> 02:46:31,315
if you’d only look at it
as part of a great pattern,

1931
02:46:31,399 --> 02:46:34,276
that we're just
a little minute in life.

1932
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:37,988

1933
02:46:38,073 --> 02:46:42,534
Listen to us, going at each other
like a couple of stupid grown-ups.

1934
02:46:42,619 --> 02:46:44,620

1935
02:46:46,081 --> 02:46:48,123
Look at the sky.

1936
02:46:48,208 --> 02:46:50,459
Isn't it lovely?

1937
02:46:51,961 --> 02:46:54,546

1938
02:46:54,631 --> 02:46:57,591
Someday,
when we get outside again,

1939
02:46:58,677 --> 02:47:01,220
I'm going to-

1975
02:50:07,407 --> 02:50:10,492
For the past two years
we have lived in fear.

1976
02:50:10,577 --> 02:50:12,578
Now we can live in hope.

1977
02:50:14,664 --> 02:50:17,207

1978
02:50:17,292 --> 02:50:19,334

1979
02:50:24,048 --> 02:50:26,633

1980
02:50:26,718 --> 02:50:29,970

1981
02:50:34,642 --> 02:50:38,228
And so it seems our stay here is over.

1982
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:42,733
They've given us just a moment
to get our things.

1983
02:50:42,817 --> 02:50:44,943
We can each take a bag...

1984
02:50:45,028 --> 02:50:47,029
and whatever it will hold
of clothing.

1985
02:50:48,114 --> 02:50:50,866
Nothing else.

1986
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:52,993
So, dear... Diary,

1987
02:50:54,996 --> 02:50:57,748
that means
I must leave you behind.

1988
02:50:59,375 --> 02:51:01,919
Good-bye for a while.

1989
02:51:03,046 --> 02:51:06,506
P.S.
Please, please, anyone,

1990
02:51:07,884 --> 02:51:10,510
if you should find this diary,

1991
02:51:10,595 --> 02:51:13,430
will you please
keep it safe for me,

1992
02:51:13,514 --> 02:51:15,849
because someday I hope that-

1993
02:51:19,771 --> 02:51:21,813
No more.

1994
02:51:23,024 --> 02:51:25,943
I had gone to the country
to try to find food.

1995
02:51:26,027 --> 02:51:28,987
When I got back,
the police were in the building.

1996
02:51:29,072 --> 02:51:32,115
We made it our business
to learn how they knew.

1997
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:34,117
It was the thief
who told them.

1998
02:51:34,202 --> 02:51:36,161
We know the thief.
He was-

1999
02:51:36,245 --> 02:51:38,872
It seems strange to me now,

2000
02:51:38,957 --> 02:51:43,293
but we were all so full of hope
in the camp here in Holland
where they first took us.

2001
02:51:43,378 --> 02:51:45,796
The news of the war was good.

2002
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:48,256
The British and Americans
were sweeping through France.

2003
02:51:48,341 --> 02:51:51,426
We felt sure they would
get to us in time to-

2004
02:51:53,388 --> 02:51:55,389
But...

2005
02:51:56,432 --> 02:51:58,392
in September
we were shipped to Poland.

2006
02:51:58,476 --> 02:52:01,645
The men to one camp,
the women to another.

2007
02:52:03,398 --> 02:52:07,693
From there...
they were sent to Belsen.

2008
02:52:07,777 --> 02:52:10,404
I stayed in Auschwitz.

2009
02:52:10,488 --> 02:52:13,782
In January we were freed,
the few of us who were left.

2010
02:52:15,076 --> 02:52:17,244
The war was not yet over, no.

2011
02:52:19,747 --> 02:52:23,000
It took us a long time
to get home.

2012
02:52:23,084 --> 02:52:25,752
Each time the train
would stop, we'd...

2013
02:52:25,837 --> 02:52:28,797
all get out, you know,
at a siding or a crossing, and...

2014
02:52:28,881 --> 02:52:31,091
walk from group to group.

2015
02:52:32,468 --> 02:52:34,594
"Where were you?"

2016
02:52:34,679 --> 02:52:36,596
"Were you at Belsen?"

2017
02:52:36,681 --> 02:52:38,890
"At Buchenwald?"

2018
02:52:38,975 --> 02:52:41,852
"At Mauthausen? Where?"

2019
02:52:41,936 --> 02:52:44,354
"Is it possible that
you ever knew my wife?"

2020
02:52:44,439 --> 02:52:47,357
"Did you ever see
my husband, my son,

2021
02:52:47,442 --> 02:52:49,443
my daughter?"

2022
02:52:57,243 --> 02:53:00,537
That's how I found out
about my wife's death,

2023
02:53:00,621 --> 02:53:04,041
Margot's, Van Daans',

2024
02:53:04,125 --> 02:53:07,085
Peter, Dussel.

2025
02:53:08,337 --> 02:53:10,338
But...

2026
02:53:11,466 --> 02:53:13,425
Anne-

2027
02:53:13,509 --> 02:53:15,635
I still hoped-

2028
02:53:16,637 --> 02:53:21,016
Yesterday I was in Rotterdam.

2029
02:53:21,100 --> 02:53:24,102
I met a woman there.

2030
02:53:24,187 --> 02:53:27,397
She'd been in Belsen...
with Anne.

2031
02:53:32,111 --> 02:53:34,112
I know now.

2032
02:53:41,788 --> 02:53:43,789

2033
02:53:48,503 --> 02:53:50,796
In spite of everything,

2034
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:55,425
I still believe that people
are really good at heart.

2035
02:53:55,510 --> 02:53:58,220
She puts me to shame.
