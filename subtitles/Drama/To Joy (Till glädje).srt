1
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:14,361
TO JOY

2
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,527
Hello... Hello?
Who do you want to speak to?

3
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:36,199
Stig Ericsson?
He's in rehearsal at the moment.

4
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:41,080
Goodness... Yes, wait a moment
and l'll go and call him.

5
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,011
Hello...

6
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,559
Hello?

7
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,942
Grandmother sent me.
She couldn't travel.

8
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:49,111
l tried calling you at work, but l...

9
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,114
But what has happened?

10
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:01,334
The paraffin stove exploded.

11
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:06,047
Marta was badly burned.
Both her and the little girl.

12
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:09,884
Marta is dead.

13
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:13,304
The girl is okay,
they said at the infirmary.

14
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:20,438
They called just before l left and
they said that she was out of danger.

15
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:27,278
The paraffin stove exploded.
We heard it go off and came running.

16
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:32,075
Marta died on the way
to the infirmary.

17
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:44,464
Grandmother said her and grandfather
are coming tomorrow and will call you.

18
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:57,770
Lasse and l will go
and buy a mourning band.

19
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,791
THE STORY
OF STlG AND MARTA'S MARRlAGE -

20
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:21,672
- BEGlNS ON AN AUTUMN DAY
SEVEN YEARS EARLlER...

21
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:59,711
Today starts a new season. l think
it's good. l don't know about you.

22
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:05,927
We welcome two new members
to Helsinborg's Orchestra.

23
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,598
And that is Stig Ericsson...

24
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:14,771
...in place of Sunkan who died last
summer. God rest his soul.

25
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:17,774
Then we have
a woman in the orchestra.

26
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:21,486
lt's a little silly
and totally against nature.

27
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:27,618
But she's very talented. She 's
over there if you haven't seen her.

28
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,330
Her name is Marta.
Welcome to both of you.

29
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:37,044
Right... let's start.

30
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,672
Gentlemen...

31
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,554
Let's have the wind section.
From fortissimo.

32
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,671
And let's have everything.
Everything!

33
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:40,183
Well... you sounded awful today.
But that's natural.

34
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:43,687
Good afternoon, gentlemen...
and lady.

35
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:47,692
Kurt H. is coming on Thursday.
Then we'll have some music.

36
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:58,079
Hello Stig. lmagine us ending up
here. How's your summer been?

37
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:04,043
l was abroad with my brother and
heard lots of music. And you?

38
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:06,629
- Summer orchestra.
- Poor thing!

39
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:10,300
l never want to play
''Gold and Silver'' again.

40
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:14,472
- Have you worked?
- l studied Mendelssohn and others...

41
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:17,933
- Why do you sound so angry?
- l don't sound angry.

42
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:22,480
- Have you found anywhere to stay?
- Yes. And you?

43
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:27,694
- lt's a nightmare, but cheap.
- lt's my birthday. You want to come?

44
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:32,366
- l don't feel like it. Who's coming?
- You'll see if you come.

45
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:38,163
Can you lend me a tenner? lt's
awkward asking for an advance, but...

46
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:41,793
- lt'd be great if you could lend me.
- lf you come tonight.

47
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:46,130
- lf you lend me twenty l'll come.
- Will you cut your hair, too?

48
00:10:46,464 --> 00:10:51,261
- Cut my hair? What's that about?
- And buy a present for 1,50.

49
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:57,267
And try to be happy and nice
and don't shout about it as usual.

50
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,704
- What's up?
- l'm cursing my fate.

51
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:21,169
You look inexplicably comical
when you're newly cut and combed.

52
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:24,088
- ls that Marta's work?
- You know her?

53
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:29,929
- We had a thing together. And you?
- No, just from the academy.

54
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:33,264
She has a matchless personality,
but is very rash.

55
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:37,186
- Ripe for love, if you get me.
- l didn't ask for an analysis!

56
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,982
She left me in a way
that almost made me ask for her hand.

57
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:44,235
- And?
- l stopped myself at the last minute.

58
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,865
- But it was damn close.
- Well, l'm not interested.

59
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,367
- So you're not coming this evening?
- No time or desire.

60
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:58,375
'Course you will. Bring your violin and
we'll make music before we get drunk.

61
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:25,655
l would like something for 1,50.

62
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:32,662
- That. The bear over there.
- This?

63
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:36,751
- lt costs 4,80.
- l'll take it anyway.

64
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:40,797
- Shall l wrap it?
- No, thanks, l'll take it as it is.

65
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:47,053
- He looks so nice, l think.
- Yes, those bears are very popular...

66
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:49,806
Thanks...

67
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,809
Stop that bloody nonsense!

68
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:58,274
And he slammed down his fist and
said, ''Stop that bloody nonsense!''

69
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:05,281
... it's quite funny. l'll tell it to
you next time, when we have time.

70
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,132
No, no... Don't do that.
Don't be silly.

71
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:13,606
- What are you grinning at?
- At you, of course.

72
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,361
You'd better bloody stop it. As you are
drunk, l don't wish to hurt you.

73
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:28,998
l am magnificent when l am on stage.

74
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:35,255
Have you heard me play violin? All the
most famous players are charlatans.

75
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,259
They live by cheap tricks.
But l can see through their charade.

76
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:46,391
l'll tell you the secret of real art.
lt's created when you are unhappy.

77
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:53,984
l prefer being unhappy.
God knows l'm mostly in that state.

78
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:58,446
l'll show all you bastards
what violin playing is all about!

79
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,451
You're all here with a bad conscience.
l know what you're thinking.

80
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:07,206
Are we artists, we who only think
of drinking, women and a pension?

81
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,503
Yes, l'm drunk, l admit it. lf l wasn't
l wouldn't dare say a thing.

82
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:16,424
But let me tell you
l see through you and through me!

83
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:20,303
And l say take it away.
lt's worth nothing!

84
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:25,768
We'll all die and come back to life.
And then you'll hear violin playing!

85
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:29,856
Because humility...
is what it comes down to.

86
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,694
Remember that, you horrible loafers,
as you wallow there -

87
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:38,531
- and slobber and burp
with stained ties!

88
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:44,955
- How do you feel?
- Go to blazes!

89
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:51,338
Shame on you. Have you had a haircut?
You look like an oiled cat.

90
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:55,508
Yes, that's your fault.

91
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:09,483
l can't understand who l am.

92
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:14,446
Why l can't be like a respectable
person even though l'm talented.

93
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,910
Because l'm really talented
even though l'm drunk.

94
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:39,806
Have you met my wife, Nelly?

95
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,020
l assure you
that she's an acquaintance to make.

96
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:47,148
She's a fun little creature.

97
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:51,903
With a mouth like a...
like a red flower.

98
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:58,494
l'm thinking of giving you to her.
She'll appreciate that.

99
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:18,307
- Why are you shouting?
- The roof fell in.

100
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,230
Although l saw it was the curtain.
l must lie down, l feel awful.

101
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:27,484
- You overdid it a bit yesterday.
- Yes...

102
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:31,279
l must sit up...

103
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,911
- What time is it and where am l?
- lt's 5.00 and you're at my place.

104
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:40,957
- What for?
- You couldn't be moved.

105
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,337
No, no, Stig, cut that out.
Don't argue.

106
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:50,050
- You're the one making a scene.
- lf you can't keep calm you must go.

107
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:55,181
- l'm awfully silly.
- Yes, you are.

108
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:59,268
- People like me shouldn't live.
- You're harmless.

109
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:03,648
You could have bought me
a birthday present couldn't you?

110
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,527
- But l have. Of course!
- But you've forgotten it.

111
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:11,364
No, wait, you'll see. Where's my coat?

112
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:28,300
Maybe you think it's really stupid.
lt was all l could come up with.

113
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:35,975
Thanks so much, Stig.
lt's a very nice birthday present.

114
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:43,691
We should get some sleep. We're
rehearsing at 9.00am tomorrow.

115
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:58,207
Perhaps one acts crazily
and stupidly sometimes.

116
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,004
The main thing, however, is that one
wants to be a real person and artist.

117
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:07,801
Hey... You must agree with that?

118
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:11,764
Yes, l do... Good night.

119
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:14,434
Night.

120
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:27,447
AUTUMN HAS TAKEN HOLD

121
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:40,085
- Sönderby is nice.
- He's a little boring.

122
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:46,009
- Would you like to be like him?
- He's done good. l'd also like to.

123
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:50,556
l'm 25. When you're that age
you should have become someone...

124
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,352
- ...someone with responsibility.
- l'm happy.

125
00:19:57,188 --> 00:20:02,944
l'd like to start a string quartet
that's brilliant and tours the world.

126
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:05,947
- We'd be best!
- Of course.

127
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:11,037
- You have a strange grin l don't like.
- l simply feel friendly.

128
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:17,960
- What about you? What do you want?
- Nothing.

129
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:22,257
l'd like to bury myself. Really deeply
so that nothing got to me.

130
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:28,389
- But you're not unhappy.
- Some have an unnaturally happy air.

131
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,979
We've always talked about me when
we've met. l know nothing about you.

132
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:40,067
- Maybe it's better for you and for me.
- Don't talk nonsense.

133
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:44,615
Hey... Stig?

134
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:49,495
Do you care about me at all?

135
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:54,625
- What do you mean?
- l haven't let you sleep with me.

136
00:20:54,959 --> 00:21:00,089
lf you were to make love to me,
would you then care a little for me?

137
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:05,637
Answer honestly. You don't
have to be afraid of hurting me.

138
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:11,977
- There you are! You can't answer.
- l have to think about it first.

139
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,443
Of course l've thought about why
you've been so awkward, but...

140
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:23,324
- But we've had fun anyway.
- You haven't answered.

141
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:29,331
l know exactly what you mean.
You want an assurance that l love you.

142
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,916
Otherwise you'll have moral pangs.

143
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,088
- God, you're stupid.
- Then don't speak in riddles.

144
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,260
l want the two of us to be together.

145
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:51,312
Sorry... One talks this way and that
and forgets one's addressing a person.

146
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:58,153
There's so much misery, laxity and
indifference, in body and in mind.

147
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:03,492
ln the end you don't believe in
anything. You think that's how it is.

148
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:07,245
- That's the whole meaning.
- There doesn't have to be a meaning.

149
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,335
Yes, there must be. lf there isn't you
make one up. Otherwise you can't live.

150
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:21,429
l've been married. You know that.
But it's just lies and deception.

151
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:27,184
l've cheated with the job as well.
Was mildly talented... you know.

152
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:31,939
Almost all l've done has been a cheat.
My whole life.

153
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:36,028
- l don't believe that.
- That's easy to say.

154
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:40,616
l don't want what's between us
to be a cheat. lt must be either or...

155
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:46,830
- Are you scared?
- One can take things too seriously.

156
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:52,503
This will be just like playing
with words for you.

157
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:56,258
l want to be together with you,
you've noticed that.

158
00:22:56,592 --> 00:23:02,390
But you can't talk about love
and marriage at every turn either.

159
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:07,729
- l promise l'll be as nice as l can.
- We won't make any pledges.

160
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:12,317
But we can promise each other to be
honest. That's absolutely necessary.

161
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:18,532
- And we won't insult one another.
- No. lf we get tired we'll say so.

162
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:21,952
lt'll be you who gets tired.

163
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:27,499
You don't believe that.
No, we won't be under any illusions.

164
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:33,506
lt'll often be difficult. More
difficult than we can soberly foresee.

165
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,177
- Let's stop now.
- Yes.

166
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,265
You know what? Let's move your
things over to mine. lt'll be cheaper.

167
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,561
Good. l hate my room. l would
have contracted rheumatism there.

168
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:50,609
- From next month we'll split the rent.
- Yes...

169
00:23:55,656 --> 00:24:01,162
l promise you won't have to lie
on that uncomfortable sofa.

170
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:04,790
Unless you really want to, of course.

171
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:20,497
What have you been up to
over Christmas?

172
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:24,961
ln this blasted town
where people just eat and eat!

173
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,505
You blobs!

174
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,802
- This is amongst the most difficult.
- Not for someone talented.

175
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:37,308
But there are lazybones and blockheads.
Once more from the top.

176
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:07,465
l can't bear
this frightful squealing.

177
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,468
We'll take a ten minute break.

178
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:41,753
- We have to ask for time off.
-Time off?

179
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:47,885
- Are you crazy?
- You said we could leave before 1 .00.

180
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:52,681
- l didn't realise you were untalented.
- Anyhow, we have to go.

181
00:26:53,015 --> 00:26:56,853
- Really?
- We're getting married at 2.30.

182
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:01,065
God... Goodness...

183
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,237
l forgot. lt's probably best l apply
for my pension and stop working.

184
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:10,534
- l was meant to be...
- You were meant to be the witness.

185
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:17,667
No... wonderful. We'll just have
to call the mayor and postpone it.

186
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,172
You can't postpone a wedding
without valid reason.

187
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:26,384
- But you can cancel a rehearsal?
- A wedding is valid even in war.

188
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:32,433
- But this isn't a military unit.
- lt can be like a concentration camp.

189
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:36,813
- lmpudence! We'll rehearse all day.
- Not with Marta and me.

190
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:43,486
- Then you can leave my orchestra.
- We're what makes your orchestra.

191
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,573
You weren't given
the strap as a child!

192
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:49,785
And you're becoming a child again.

193
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:55,792
- Go to hell!
- l don't want to be where you are.

194
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:10,182
You know l shouldn't be this angry.
You're ungrateful, inconsiderate...

195
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:14,103
- l could get a cardiac arrest and die.
- Good riddance.

196
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:20,568
- At least honest folk could marry.
- The result of women in orchestras.

197
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:26,324
What happened to her?

198
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:32,623
- Have you looked in the toolbox?
- And your jewel-case...

199
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:37,796
- Go and buy a new stud.
- How can it just disappear like that?

200
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,466
- Are you sure you haven't seen it?
- l haven't got time.

201
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,803
- Where is it?
- l'm coming.

202
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:48,933
Here l am.
Goodness, we're in a hurry.

203
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:54,147
Marrying is both time-consuming
and nerve-wracking. Admit it.

204
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,401
- Do you regret it?
- lf l'm honest, l regret it terribly.

205
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:03,365
- Me too. What ideas one has at times.
- We'll call and cancel.

206
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:08,955
We made all this fuss to get away.
What would Sönderby say?

207
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,125
- You handled him well, anyway.
- What do you mean?

208
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,379
The way you fainted broke him.

209
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:20,383
- lt was for real.
- Don't try. lt was amateur dramatics.

210
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,888
- l see... there you go...
- Did you really feel faint?

211
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,807
- What if l did?
- Why?

212
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:31,813
lt's not so strange.
With child, you understand...

213
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,984
You don't seem especially enthusiastic.
You don't have to be.

214
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,528
- How'd it happen?
- ln the usual way.

215
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,991
- Don't be funny.
- A stupid answer to a stupid question.

216
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:46,537
- Have you known long?
- Yes, almost three months.

217
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,168
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Because l want a child. Understand?

218
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:55,213
- You get them if you want to or not.
- You're really naive.

219
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:57,507
- You mean that...?
- Yes!

220
00:29:57,841 --> 00:30:00,135
- You never said.
- Would it change anything?

221
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:04,390
lf you had an abortion before you can
do it again. lt's all disgusting.

222
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:08,854
- What's disgusting?
- You've almost had it behind my back.

223
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:11,732
How do l know it's mine?

224
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:16,611
Besides, we haven't got space.
Nappies and pee and child care -

225
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:20,782
- and babysitters and cots and hell,
your grandmother...

226
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:26,205
Think of all the crying and noise.
Where will l rehearse? Thanks for this.

227
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:31,294
How'd you thought of organising this?
You would have had to tell me.

228
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:36,008
Had you thought of coming one day
saying, ''Here's a child for you, Dad''?

229
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:38,719
- Well?
- Should l apologise?

230
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:44,308
You don't understand.
l don't want a child, l hate children!

231
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:49,481
You think this is a good world
to come into? l prefer extinction.

232
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:55,279
- Why don't you say anything?
- l'm listening to you.

233
00:30:55,612 --> 00:31:00,534
You've no idea what you're talking
about, you're talking rubbish.

234
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:05,623
What do you want me to do? Embrace
you and say he'll be Prime Minister?

235
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:09,586
- l'd like you to react like a man!
- A superman?

236
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,839
- A simple man.
- Now l'm not a man!

237
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:17,845
l knew that you were neurotic.
That you were childish and egotistic...

238
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:21,850
- But l didn't know you were cruel.
- Really...

239
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:26,646
lt's good l found out before the
marriage, because there won't be one.

240
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:34,738
- We can't cancel now!
- And they say we are so conventional.

241
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:38,701
- What will happen now?
- l'm going to the tobacconist to call.

242
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:43,039
As you don't want to. You can
stay and live here, l don't care.

243
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:46,208
l never saw it
as more than board and lodging.

244
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:51,172
You're crazy, absolutely crazy!
Are you crying?

245
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:55,303
- l've never seen you cry. Are you sad?
- No.

246
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:59,140
No, l'm just tired. Of you...

247
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:05,604
Have l spoilt everything? Why are
you crying, you know how l am!

248
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:10,569
l'm crying just because
l'm angry that l'm crying.

249
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:14,489
lf l wasn't completely drained
l would cry...

250
00:32:14,824 --> 00:32:18,911
Perhaps you thought l'd be happy?

251
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:22,875
ln my heart l knew
it would be just like this.

252
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:28,005
Of course one imagines
a whole lot of things. l don't know...

253
00:32:28,338 --> 00:32:32,592
- lt's part of it.
- Did you do that the last time too?

254
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:35,680
Then... everything was wrong.

255
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:41,770
- There was no place for imaginings.
- You mean that now...

256
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:46,357
l kind of thought
that what was between you and me...

257
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:52,030
...was something else. l should have
understood that nothing changes.

258
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:55,660
Everything is the same always.

259
00:32:55,994 --> 00:33:00,914
- Even the words one says.
- Damn it, l love you...

260
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:09,133
But, sweetheart...
You know, l've never liked surprises.

261
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:14,388
When l was small l got angry and
afraid when people surprised me.

262
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:18,101
l think it was the same this time.

263
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:22,355
l must say that you could have found
a more opportune time.

264
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:27,944
When l think about it, we'll get
child support which is hunky dory.

265
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:34,243
The little guy will almost support us.
And they can't toss you out with baby.

266
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:37,539
Putte's sister is almost always
knocked up -

267
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:41,668
- and she just sits there
playing with her belly in the air.

268
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:48,342
And when she can't play anymore,
then l think she gets half pay.

269
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:53,806
Of course we could change
flats if we needed to.

270
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,809
- Hey...
- You talk a lot.

271
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:02,274
The thing with surprises is true
and it's also psychologically credible.

272
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:12,535
Look at what l look like. My nose
gets twice as big when l cry...

273
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:29,679
Say what you like, this will be a
wedding both you and l will remember.

274
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:53,853
Marriage is for the individual's
well being and society's good.

275
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,816
You've indicated your willingness
to enter into marriage.

276
00:35:58,149 --> 00:36:04,532
Stig Ericsson, do you take Marta
Olsson to be your lawful wife?

277
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:09,078
Marta Olsson, do you take Stig
Ericsson to be your lawful husband?

278
00:36:09,412 --> 00:36:13,040
- l do.
- Will you now exchange rings.

279
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:24,345
By the power invested in me,
l declare you man and wife.

280
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,098
Never forget the promise of fidelity
that you have made.

281
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:34,522
Live together in mutual love
and safeguard the future generation.

282
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:39,278
May harmony and happiness
remain intrinsic to your marriage.

283
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,212
Maybe he will be prime minister.
lf he's like you, anyway.

284
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:42,805
The stud...
We'll keep it as a souvenir.

285
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,568
Well... we've got 14 days.

286
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:57,780
We've gone through the concert twice.

287
00:37:58,114 --> 00:38:02,034
- You should handle it adequately.
- Sure.

288
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:06,038
Sure, you say...
But l know what you're thinking.

289
00:38:06,372 --> 00:38:10,043
- What does your wife say?
- Nothing.

290
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:15,800
- That's worrying...
- You're both trying to put me down.

291
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:20,512
lf l were honest,
l'd prefer to avoid this balancing act.

292
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:24,475
But what do you do
when your solo violinist packs it in?

293
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:29,940
But you consider the case concluded.
What are you staring at?

294
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:34,194
Well, l'll tell you...

295
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:39,157
l'm staring at that devil called
ambition twinkling in your eyes.

296
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:43,287
- And is that so strange?
- No...

297
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:48,126
No, it's not. lt's not at all strange.

298
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,296
But you've
only been here six months -

299
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,552
- and you haven't discovered
that music is a goal, not a means.

300
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:09,733
- Well, what did he say?
- lt worked. Now l have my chance.

301
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:15,990
Now l'll show them how to play violin.
lt can go on to become whatever...

302
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:20,577
Maybe l'll get to Stockholm. l actually
don't know what could happen.

303
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:25,208
lt's a wonderful feeling.
To have everything before you.

304
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:29,255
To know no limits.
But you're happy too, this...

305
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:33,466
- This goes for you as well as me.
- Of course l'm happy.

306
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:58,421
- Come on.
- l'm not going in. l'm no clown!

307
00:43:58,755 --> 00:44:04,095
You'll go in if it's the last thing
you do. lt's not about you now.

308
00:44:04,387 --> 00:44:06,389
Come on.

309
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:47,350
Rehearsal isn't until 10.00 tomorrow.
You know...

310
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:51,604
Bastard! Bloody bastard.
Now he's happy, of course.

311
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:54,816
Let's go home and have a drink.
We both need it.

312
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,653
Yes, come on. We can't stay here.

313
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,615
Bloody bastard!
l'm simply mediocre!

314
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,746
- That went better than expected.
- Go and jump in the deepest lake.

315
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:31,731
Read it. lt's better if you read it.

316
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:55,549
Read it aloud.

317
00:45:55,883 --> 00:46:01,138
- There isn't much.
- Read what's there.

318
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:05,685
''Stig Ericsson debuted prematurely
in Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto.''

319
00:46:06,018 --> 00:46:10,065
''lt's surprising that an experienced
conductor like Sönderby'' -

320
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:15,154
- ''didn't avert
this rather unnecessary suicide.''

321
00:46:15,488 --> 00:46:18,491
''lt's possible
that Ericsson is talented.''

322
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:23,913
''According to the programme,
he's been to the best schools.''

323
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:29,836
- Go on.
- There isn't anything else.

324
00:46:30,837 --> 00:46:33,507
There isn't...?

325
00:46:36,636 --> 00:46:39,555
ls it that bad?

326
00:46:43,893 --> 00:46:47,897
Are you happy now?
You and Sönderby?

327
00:46:48,231 --> 00:46:51,527
Just think how everyone
is going to laugh.

328
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:58,827
- Where are you off to?
- Making coffee.

329
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,455
- l don't want coffee.
- But l do.

330
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:07,794
You think, of course,
that this doesn't matter.

331
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:24,354
- Close the window, l'm freezing.
- l feel bad, l want some fresh air.

332
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:29,026
Why don't you say anything?

333
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,073
But, Stig, what shall l say?
Shall l say that the concert went well?

334
00:47:34,406 --> 00:47:37,619
That they printed lies,
that everyone is wrong?

335
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:41,330
Shall l comfort you and say
that it'll be better next time?

336
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:45,377
There'll be no next time,
you know that as well as l.

337
00:47:49,048 --> 00:47:52,259
- l'd be happy for one thing.
- What's that?

338
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:57,598
Well... that l could go to rehearsal
today at 10.00 o'clock -

339
00:47:57,932 --> 00:48:01,143
- sit as usual at my usual place
and do my job.

340
00:48:01,685 --> 00:48:06,274
That shows how little you know.
l'm going out for a walk. Alone!

341
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:10,696
No, Stig... Can l go with you?
Please, Stig, can l go with you?

342
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,201
l want to go alone, l said.
l don't want to drag your load.

343
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:21,207
- Are you going to the rehearsal?
- l don't know.

344
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,045
- lt's nothing to do with you.
- You shouldn't push me away.

345
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:29,509
There's so much l shouldn't do.

346
00:48:30,593 --> 00:48:34,971
lt's easier when there are two of you,
l'm sure of it.

347
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:37,975
You are never two.
lnside you're always alone.

348
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:41,604
What you're saying
is just jabber and sentimentality.

349
00:48:41,939 --> 00:48:45,818
l'm alone as l've always been.
No more to say about it.

350
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,615
Why are you so scared of me?

351
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:54,993
Scared? How comical...

352
00:48:55,328 --> 00:48:59,540
l want to be left alone and that's it.
Goodbye.

353
00:49:18,728 --> 00:49:24,360
- So you're sitting here brooding?
- And you? You don't look so happy.

354
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:26,695
lnsomnia...

355
00:49:27,404 --> 00:49:31,075
Perhaps a character is developing?
A creative act.

356
00:49:31,408 --> 00:49:35,956
Not at all. l heard Mendelssohn
yesterday. lt was awful.

357
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:41,753
- l didn't dare sleeping afterwards.
- Nice of you to take it like that.

358
00:49:42,088 --> 00:49:47,760
- You understand.
- l know it myself. The great silence.

359
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:52,515
Why are you grinning? Everyone is.
Am l comical or is it coincidence?

360
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:55,644
Of course you're comical,
because you failed.

361
00:49:55,977 --> 00:50:00,273
Come on, we'll go drink
a cup of coffee at my place.

362
00:50:03,945 --> 00:50:07,156
Goodness, it looks messy here!

363
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:12,119
- l can't clean up every day.
- You never clean up, dear heart.

364
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:15,122
We'll pull the blinds
so we don't have to see it.

365
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:19,336
Once it was so untidy
the health authorities came around.

366
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,507
They said we'd have to move
if we didn't improve.

367
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:28,637
- We had a dog then, but he died.
- He had puppies, then he died.

368
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,641
Probably from surprise.

369
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:42,529
- You look so sad.
- l'd hoped to catch the moon in a net.

370
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:47,616
But just as l was going to pull it up,
he disappeared deep under me.

371
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,829
- Like a fish?
- No, like a big, big coin.

372
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:54,707
Oh, now l understand.

373
00:50:55,041 --> 00:51:00,047
You're a treasure hunter who sets out
to sea and fishes for sunken planets.

374
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:06,095
l was going to buy a bomb and blow up
a certain warehouse. lncluding vermin.

375
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:13,228
Puppy sickness, my boy.
Word diarrhoea... blow up, crash -

376
00:51:13,561 --> 00:51:16,941
- slam down your fist
and curse the heavens!

377
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:22,821
lt all ends in a pension and a medal
for faithful service. Cheers!

378
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,993
- Shut up, l'm talking to your wife.
- Marriage to an old pig is worthless.

379
00:51:28,327 --> 00:51:31,998
lt's moving, isn't it!

380
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:36,462
- l'm going home. l have a rehearsal.
- Good morning.

381
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:41,925
Remember that you're always welcome
here, in whatever state you're in.

382
00:51:43,094 --> 00:51:45,179
- Come back soon.
- Never.

383
00:51:45,513 --> 00:51:47,807
- Why not?
- l don't like you.

384
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,812
- lt doesn't seem so.
- Besides, this place is filthy.

385
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:56,776
- Shame on you.
- You have a nice body. lt ends there.

386
00:51:57,109 --> 00:52:00,612
- That's enough.
- You seem totally mad.

387
00:52:00,946 --> 00:52:04,450
lf you think l'll share you with
that old bugger, you're wrong.

388
00:52:04,784 --> 00:52:08,496
- l'm not at the bottom yet.
- Welcome back, anyway.

389
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:14,795
- We can always talk about the moon.
- lf nothing else...

390
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:18,674
Cut that out!

391
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:55,172
l went for a walk as well. Although,
l was hoping to bump into you.

392
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:59,551
- We can go in opposite directions.
- l was at Mikael Bror's.

393
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,553
Really?

394
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:08,645
- Do we have to talk more about this?
- No, we'll never talk about it again.

395
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:13,067
Yes, one day in the future, when we're
older and things don't hurt as much.

396
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,321
- Have you hurt yourself?
- Have l?

397
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:20,658
- No, it's just lipstick.
- Oh, really?

398
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:26,498
lt was that strange bird
who insisted on trying to kiss me.

399
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,903
- How are you?
- lt's on its way.

400
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:15,324
- Can l help you?
- Are you afraid?

401
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:18,453
Yes, l am. Are you?

402
00:55:18,787 --> 00:55:21,831
l don't know.
l haven't felt like finding out.

403
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:25,294
ln some way it feels good
to be rid of it.

404
00:55:25,627 --> 00:55:30,216
- l'm glad it's not me doing this.
- Me too.

405
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:36,973
Listen, l feel awful.
Wouldn't it be best if we got going?

406
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:42,103
Not yet. The worst would be
them sending us home again.

407
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:45,231
That would be humiliating.

408
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:54,825
Poor thing! Shall l make some tea
and fix a sandwich?

409
00:55:55,159 --> 00:56:01,291
Yes, please. l can't understand what's
wrong. l probably ate something bad.

410
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:05,003
Some tribal people are so smart
that when the wife goes into labour -

411
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:08,465
- the man goes to bed
and screams and performs.

412
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,846
He takes all the congratulations
as well. That's fair, l guess.

413
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,267
Not so, Stig...?

414
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:34,911
Mrs Ericsson, come with me.
Please stay here, Mr Ericsson.

415
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:38,749
Take good care, darling.

416
01:01:00,617 --> 01:01:03,745
NOW lT'S AUGUST
THREE YEARS LATER

417
01:01:11,462 --> 01:01:17,552
They were so poor, so very poor...
They had no food... no food...

418
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:31,650
<i>It's nice not being an author.</i>

419
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:36,198
<i>If I were to take it upon myseIf
to portray Stig and Marta -</i>

420
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:39,408
<i>-from the first time
we met four years ago -</i>

421
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:44,789
<i>-what an untruthfuI,
incompIete picture I wouId paint.</i>

422
01:01:45,123 --> 01:01:48,919
<i>I'II probabIy never forget
the episode from Iast winter-</i>

423
01:01:49,295 --> 01:01:52,298
<i>-when I came round to drop off
a score for Stig.</i>

424
01:01:52,632 --> 01:01:56,345
<i>Perhaps aIso to taIk,
I'm starting to get oId.</i>

425
01:01:56,678 --> 01:02:01,474
<i>One has to watch oneseIf
so carefuIIy... so carefuIIy.</i>

426
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:05,854
<i>The doorbeII was broken,
so I just waIked in.</i>

427
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:11,402
<i>I stood in the haII, which was dark,
and Iooked into the Iiving room.</i>

428
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:15,908
<i>How can I portray the way
they heId each other?</i>

429
01:02:16,283 --> 01:02:21,913
<i>So boundIessIy tender,
but aIso deepIy eroticaIIy aware.</i>

430
01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:27,336
<i>Why was there so much IoneIiness
and chiIdish fear in their stiIIness?</i>

431
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,802
<i>I went out again
and knocked on the door.</i>

432
01:02:35,928 --> 01:02:40,933
<i>When Marta came to the door,
she stiII had everything in her eyes.</i>

433
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:45,064
<i>Yes...
Yes, she's a remarkabIe IittIe woman.</i>

434
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:51,321
<i>Or the day they'd argued.
I noticed it straight away.</i>

435
01:02:51,654 --> 01:02:55,699
<i>It was in the air.
Marta was a IittIe quiet.</i>

436
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:59,829
<i>She sat huddIed on the sofa
and Iooked at Stig.</i>

437
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:04,793
<i>He taIked to me the whoIe time,
but it was just chatter.</i>

438
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:10,383
<i>He got up to fetch the cognac,
but on the way back he passed Marta.</i>

439
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:14,011
<i>He crept onto the sofa,
they Iooked at one another-</i>

440
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:17,932
<i>-and Stig suddenIy said,
''Hi, IittIe one!''</i>

441
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:22,061
<i>This seemed to be an invocation
because the strained atmosphere -</i>

442
01:03:22,395 --> 01:03:26,442
<i>-Iightened and disappeared
Iike a puff of wind from the open sea.</i>

443
01:03:26,776 --> 01:03:30,363
<i>I don't know why, I can't teII you.</i>

444
01:03:30,697 --> 01:03:35,409
<i>Imagine trying to decipher
this compIicated, secret Ianguage -</i>

445
01:03:35,743 --> 01:03:38,914
<i>-that two Iovers deveIop
and taIk unhindered -</i>

446
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:42,877
<i>-to conceaI their most secret
and deIicate emotions.</i>

447
01:03:44,503 --> 01:03:47,465
<i>Depicting a singIe day
of their Iives -</i>

448
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:51,260
<i>-wouId fiII many sheIves
with Iarge voIumes.</i>

449
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:56,099
<i>Thank goodness that's not my task.
I just have to reproduce -</i>

450
01:03:56,433 --> 01:04:01,772
<i>-what the big composers
created in truth and spirit.</i>

451
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:08,362
That's my pleasure.
No one can take that from me.

452
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:23,671
- l've become immensely rich.
- Rich? You haven't told me.

453
01:04:24,005 --> 01:04:28,800
l've got you and the kids...
And old Sönderby snoring over there.

454
01:04:29,134 --> 01:04:33,473
And it's summer and the sun
is shining. And l have no worries.

455
01:04:33,806 --> 01:04:39,062
And we're all hale and hearty.
l thought you'd won the lottery.

456
01:04:39,396 --> 01:04:42,942
This is more than l thought
any person could have.

457
01:04:43,276 --> 01:04:47,654
Sure. You're a woman.
lt's different for you..

458
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:52,410
You think so?
l can also worry and think...

459
01:04:52,744 --> 01:04:57,708
Will it be like this now? All my life?
Small concerns, small joys...

460
01:04:58,042 --> 01:05:02,046
Small tribulations.
Nothing that carries me away.

461
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:07,051
lt's horrible that l should get
ticked off. Not so?

462
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:12,265
l think it distinguished. lt's not
written that man should be content.

463
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:15,727
- Not even that they should be happy.
- Stig?

464
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:21,692
lt's about time we set off. lf we're
going to get to the concert on time.

465
01:05:22,903 --> 01:05:25,988
You're working on Beethoven.
How's it going?

466
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,576
- Not at all. Why'd you ask?
- But you're carrying on.

467
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:33,246
- And so?
- Abandon the idea of being a soloist.

468
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:38,294
- You're a good orchestra musician.
- l didn't ask for your advice.

469
01:05:38,627 --> 01:05:42,213
- Fair enough.
- There's no time. That's the thing.

470
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:47,553
l'm going to take time off and take
lessons with Professor Chabatska.

471
01:05:47,887 --> 01:05:50,974
- l've already written to him.
- Pride, nothing else.

472
01:05:51,308 --> 01:05:54,686
Just because you're an old failure
doesn't mean l have to be.

473
01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:00,692
We second-raters are also necessary.
Without worker bees, no beehive.

474
01:06:01,026 --> 01:06:05,948
lt's awful hearing you talk. Like
hearing someone already dead.

475
01:07:02,468 --> 01:07:07,223
l've told you not to come here. Our
relationship is nothing to advertise.

476
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:11,145
l've told Mikael that l love you.

477
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:17,026
l wish l could leave you,
but l can't be bothered.

478
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,822
Come on,
we can't sit here all evening.

479
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:32,626
Listen to this: ''Everything is part
of what is called spiritual science''.

480
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:38,299
''This may include the self, society,
the state, morals or religion''.

481
01:07:38,632 --> 01:07:41,552
''This is simply an intellectual game
with expressions'' -

482
01:07:41,886 --> 01:07:46,516
- ''which one uses
as if to denote something real.''

483
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:50,563
He's on the money, Hagersten,
and he has my total sympathy.

484
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:55,692
- Mine too, but l don't give a damn.
- l think Stig is tired tonight.

485
01:07:56,027 --> 01:08:01,532
Our lodger. lt's awful,
but we have to do it for the money.

486
01:08:03,327 --> 01:08:06,496
Evening! So, you're not in bed yet?

487
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:11,585
- l had a bite to eat at the Grand.
- Hi. Didn't know you lived here.

488
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:16,716
l didn't before.
But l do now. From yesterday.

489
01:08:22,263 --> 01:08:28,395
So... you move in these circles.
l didn't know that.

490
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:39,306
<i>...first variabIe, and then
predominantIy from the north.</i>

491
01:09:39,639 --> 01:09:45,020
<i>PartIy cIoudy and severaI
thundershowers. Somewhat warmer.</i>

492
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:50,234
<i>The west coast, Vaner district,
GötaIand and GotIand.</i>

493
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:10,322
l must ask.
Can't we move into town?

494
01:11:10,655 --> 01:11:13,992
Straight away. As fast as possible.

495
01:11:28,382 --> 01:11:33,221
Was it necessary for you to move into
town? The country was so good.

496
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:38,435
Why don't you answer me?

497
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:52,909
Why are you treating me
like a criminal?

498
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:56,997
- Chabatska hasn't replied.
- You're hurting me.

499
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,792
- You and Sönderby have written...
- You're mad, let me go.

500
01:12:02,962 --> 01:12:05,756
Oh, look, has your Teddy broken?

501
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:10,220
lt doesn't matter, l'll sew him
tomorrow. lt takes a second.

502
01:12:12,347 --> 01:12:15,933
Don't argue so that the kids see.
Remember that, Stig.

503
01:12:16,268 --> 01:12:19,855
Whatever happens,
no arguments so that the kids see.

504
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:09,284
- What time is it?
- 10.30.

505
01:13:13,705 --> 01:13:18,502
- There'll be an awful fog tonight.
- l can hear it.

506
01:13:18,836 --> 01:13:24,050
Remember what Sönderby said?
Sounds like cows in a freight car.

507
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:52,539
- What is it?
- l don't like you looking like that.

508
01:13:52,873 --> 01:13:57,086
- lt's like you were comparing.
- Maybe so...

509
01:14:08,055 --> 01:14:11,310
Can't we be nice to each other again?

510
01:14:11,643 --> 01:14:17,608
- Why can't we talk about anything?
- lt isn't worth it.

511
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:53,355
No, leave me alone.
lt's disgusting.

512
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,901
l can't help it.
l think it's disgusting!

513
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:08,204
Don't blubber, no one can hear you.

514
01:15:09,915 --> 01:15:15,045
l can't stand...
l've done my best...

515
01:15:16,423 --> 01:15:20,760
l've never accused or reproached you.

516
01:15:21,093 --> 01:15:26,516
l have tried to understand you.
All the time...

517
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:30,646
- So the fault is mine?
- l've never asked questions.

518
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,942
Don't ask questions about things
that don't concern you.

519
01:15:35,276 --> 01:15:38,447
- You and Nelly doesn't concern me?
- Not really.

520
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:43,660
You may be condemnatory, but keep
it to yourself, l'm not interested.

521
01:15:43,994 --> 01:15:48,665
So because l didn't look up
l've landed in a mess.

522
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:54,463
- That you can!
- You can talk...

523
01:15:54,797 --> 01:16:00,219
When we met, men were all around.
You were even together with Marcel!

524
01:16:00,553 --> 01:16:04,016
That was before we had the kids.
Don't they mean anything?

525
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:07,144
You got rid of the earlier ones.

526
01:16:07,477 --> 01:16:10,732
l regret insisting
when you didn't want children.

527
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:17,697
- So you see, you see, Marta?
- l see. How shabby we've become.

528
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:27,624
l know what the problem is. We don't
think we're gaining from our lives.

529
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,920
We've both been struck by clarity.

530
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:36,300
With clarity comes disgust.
lt's a natural consequence.

531
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:40,263
We could also argue
and be nasty to each other before.

532
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:44,643
But then we just needed
to reach out and it was fine again.

533
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:50,525
- lt was such a great comfort.
- Now we've found there's no comfort.

534
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:55,028
Remember what you said here
on our first night together?

535
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:59,033
The main thing is
that one becomes a real person.

536
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:04,915
One talked so much at that time.
lt was a lie, Marta!

537
01:17:05,249 --> 01:17:10,630
The morning l came home with a cut
hand, that's when my clarity began.

538
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:13,882
l was so wayward l stuck
my hand through a window -

539
01:17:14,216 --> 01:17:18,555
- to mess it up so l wouldn't
dream of being a soloist anymore.

540
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:22,559
Standing there with a bloody hand
l thought how stupid l was.

541
01:17:22,892 --> 01:17:27,898
Why doesn't someone laugh at that
second rate who won't accept it?

542
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:32,236
Me, me, me! Don't you realise
how awful you sound?

543
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:35,447
l apologise. We won't talk about it.

544
01:17:39,578 --> 01:17:43,499
l'll go to grandmother's.
lt's better for the kids there as well.

545
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:48,587
How will you get money for that trip?
l don't have money.

546
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:52,383
- You got last week.
- For the telephone and milk.

547
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:55,386
- There was enough before.
- You want receipts?

548
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,725
- You don't save, that's just it.
- Take an advance like everyone else.

549
01:18:00,058 --> 01:18:04,021
- l've already done that.
- You must have expenses... l have...

550
01:18:04,355 --> 01:18:06,649
- lt's not yours!
- When it's housekeeping!

551
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:11,195
Anyway, l don't have money
for your hastily planned trip.

552
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:15,700
We're quite poor and can't afford
expenses of an emotional nature.

553
01:18:16,033 --> 01:18:18,579
- You spend on Nelly.
- Shut up!

554
01:18:18,912 --> 01:18:21,331
- What tone is that?
- The same as yours!

555
01:18:21,665 --> 01:18:25,962
- Mistresses cost money.
- A fixed price is more honest.

556
01:18:26,296 --> 01:18:29,298
- You're quite crude.
- You've become sensitive.

557
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:34,470
- Must have been tricky with Marcel.
- How can you have a lover?

558
01:18:34,804 --> 01:18:38,183
- You perform the minimum required.
- That's your fault.

559
01:18:38,517 --> 01:18:42,354
- l was naive to think of fidelity.
- Stop, Marta.

560
01:18:42,688 --> 01:18:48,277
You need an outlet for your artistic
temperament. She nurtures your genius.

561
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:51,030
Can't have been easy for her...

562
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:04,754
Forgive me, Marta. Forgive me...

563
01:19:12,804 --> 01:19:17,768
- That was my fault. l blame myself.
- Forgive me anyway.

564
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:21,939
But l don't forgive the other.

565
01:19:22,273 --> 01:19:25,776
You can be sure
l'll get the money for the trip.

566
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:30,574
Even if l have to beg for it
on the street. Don't touch me!

567
01:19:30,907 --> 01:19:34,452
You disgust me so totally,
l'd like to spit in your face.

568
01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:40,001
Fine. You want it like this,
you will get your way.

569
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:45,548
l'll ask Sönderby for the money
and it'll be great to be rid of you.

570
01:19:57,145 --> 01:20:00,148
''The doctor says it's a stroke'' -

571
01:20:00,481 --> 01:20:04,026
- ''but l know Nelly
has poisoned me.''

572
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:22,045
- Do you think he's suffering?
- Probably.

573
01:20:22,379 --> 01:20:26,634
Good. l wish he was in such pain
he wanted to scream all the time.

574
01:20:26,968 --> 01:20:32,933
- He can't scream, he's paralysed.
- That's what's good.

575
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:39,273
- You must hate him...
- He'll be dead soon.

576
01:20:39,606 --> 01:20:43,444
Sometimes it's like a dream.

577
01:20:43,778 --> 01:20:50,536
l'm scared of him. Sometimes at night
l think he'll beat or strangle me.

578
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:57,085
- l almost think you have poisoned him.
- l often thought l should.

579
01:20:58,252 --> 01:21:02,005
- What's he actually done to you?
- What's he done to me?

580
01:21:02,339 --> 01:21:06,761
He just exists.
ln some way l'm dependent on him.

581
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:10,891
- l don't know...
- You can divorce.

582
01:21:11,225 --> 01:21:15,521
Where would l go?
No one cares for me.

583
01:21:15,854 --> 01:21:20,526
lt's because you're so bloody nasty
and lack human feeling.

584
01:21:24,573 --> 01:21:29,327
- l think it's cold.
- Hmm, it's 13 below.

585
01:21:32,665 --> 01:21:36,042
You go in. He can't stand seeing me.

586
01:21:57,316 --> 01:22:01,737
- What's up with you? Hung over?
- ls there only organ music?

587
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:07,202
Mikael likes to hear it. Listen,
you shouldn't drink like that.

588
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:10,832
''Listen, you shouldn't drink
like that.'' Nelly...

589
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:14,876
lf you weren't so stupid l could point
out that l'm always well dressed.

590
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:18,840
- And so?
- Take that idiot Stig... He suffers.

591
01:22:19,173 --> 01:22:24,805
He thinks life is terrible, you're
disgusting. He can't take his failure.

592
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:28,934
That's why he goes around with dirty
shirts and leaves his wife.

593
01:22:29,268 --> 01:22:33,105
- He's in there with Mikael.
- Yes, he may as well hear!

594
01:22:33,438 --> 01:22:37,235
l drink you say? l do my job,
l'm handsome and orderly.

595
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:41,656
l'm polite and friendly.
And l'm living my life!

596
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,369
And between times l'm bloody happy.

597
01:22:45,703 --> 01:22:51,041
No, l think l'll go in and sleep,
it's all one can do on a Sunday.

598
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:56,548
Are you coming with?

599
01:23:01,219 --> 01:23:05,182
''l'm a bastard
and l'm getting what l deserve.''

600
01:23:05,516 --> 01:23:09,060
''But you should watch out.
Watch out, Stig.''

601
01:23:10,521 --> 01:23:14,400
Listen, Mikael. l'm leaving now
and l'm never coming back.

602
01:23:14,733 --> 01:23:17,529
l'm grateful for everything
you've taught me -

603
01:23:17,862 --> 01:23:21,866
- but l don't want to stay any longer.
l don't want to be like you three.

604
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,038
There's only one person
that can help me and that's Marta.

605
01:23:39,678 --> 01:23:45,559
<i>Dear Marta. You're surprised after
not hearing from me in three months.</i>

606
01:23:45,892 --> 01:23:49,396
<i>I had to write because things
have happened to me.</i>

607
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:53,067
<i>It's as if I suddenIy understood
my madness.</i>

608
01:23:53,568 --> 01:23:57,698
<i>I found out how I'd squandered
the onIy thing that has vaIue in Iife.</i>

609
01:24:01,118 --> 01:24:05,372
<i>Dear Stig. When I got your Ietter
I was very worried at first -</i>

610
01:24:05,706 --> 01:24:11,212
<i>-as I feIt that you've been aIone
and had a hard time in many ways.</i>

611
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:17,928
<i>I read it many times and understood
something important has happened.</i>

612
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:22,932
<i>I've aIso been thinking and now
know that we'II never separate.</i>

613
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:29,648
<i>It'd be a mistake. I won't be coming
home, however, but I Iong for you.</i>

614
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:36,907
<i>Dear, darIing Marta. I was so gIad
over your words I aImost had to cry.</i>

615
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:42,578
<i>One hides so many feeIings and
I did that with you and the kids.</i>

616
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:49,044
<i>Because it hurt too much. Or I've
never understood how much I care.</i>

617
01:24:49,837 --> 01:24:55,009
<i>I want you to come and fetch us soon.
There's so much to pIan for summer.</i>

618
01:24:55,343 --> 01:24:59,807
<i>Isn't there? DarIing,
it feeIs stupid and strange to write.</i>

619
01:25:00,139 --> 01:25:04,895
<i>I'd Iike to say so much, but it Iooks
siIIy and sentimentaI on paper.</i>

620
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:11,027
<i>I've tried, beIieve me. By the way,
we don't need to taIk when we meet.</i>

621
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:15,865
<i>I know exactIy how to show you how
much I Iike you. Can you guess?</i>

622
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:18,702
<i>Come soon...</i>

623
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:30,465
<i>This train is very sIow. I'd Iike
to hop off and run beside it.</i>

624
01:25:30,841 --> 01:25:33,718
<i>Maybe I'd heIp it up the hiII.</i>

625
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,682
<i>It'II be so strange
to hear her voice say:</i>

626
01:25:39,015 --> 01:25:41,685
<i>'You are pretty siIIy...''or...</i>

627
01:25:42,018 --> 01:25:44,605
<i>''Have you washed
your ears properIy?''</i>

628
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:48,818
<i>Or sit in the kitchen after a concert
and eat from the pantry -</i>

629
01:25:49,151 --> 01:25:53,740
<i>- drink vodka and beer and taIk
and joke and not say a serious word.</i>

630
01:25:56,367 --> 01:25:59,538
<i>Quite pretty.
How brown I've become.</i>

631
01:25:59,871 --> 01:26:02,874
<i>You can't see
I didn't sIeep Iast night, either.</i>

632
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:08,756
<i>How siIIy! I'm just going to meet my
husband. We're sated on one another.</i>

633
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:11,969
<i>And stiII everything is new... new!</i>

634
01:26:12,302 --> 01:26:16,305
<i>NewIy cIeaned and bathed.
How fun it wiII be to cook again -</i>

635
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,769
<i>-have my own kitchen
and sIeep in our own bed.</i>

636
01:26:21,103 --> 01:26:24,440
<i>FeeI his warmth,
have him sIeeping beside me.</i>

637
01:26:24,774 --> 01:26:28,569
<i>Never to be aIone again.
Never aIone again.</i>

638
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,701
<i>Her mouth which is so deIicious
and soft to kiss.</i>

639
01:26:35,034 --> 01:26:39,039
<i>I Iove her body as weII.
The smooth skin of her shouIders.</i>

640
01:26:39,373 --> 01:26:42,042
<i>Her breasts that never
recovered from the kids -</i>

641
01:26:42,376 --> 01:26:45,547
<i>- but are so sensitive,
Iike Iiving beings.</i>

642
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,469
<i>The fine hairs of her neck,
the soft curves of her beIIy.</i>

643
01:26:50,803 --> 01:26:55,348
<i>A waist so smaII
I can wrap my hands around it.</i>

644
01:26:55,682 --> 01:26:59,895
<i>I Iove her because we've hit
each other, we've hurt each other-</i>

645
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:05,151
<i>- but aIso for the 1000 nights we've
had in joy and absoIute pIeasure.</i>

646
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,009
SOME YEARS LATER

647
01:28:08,177 --> 01:28:10,973
You've been bad so you can't come -

648
01:28:11,306 --> 01:28:15,936
- when we set off
to visit grandmother.

649
01:28:20,024 --> 01:28:25,613
We'll catch really big fish and
a nice one we can have in the bath -

650
01:28:25,947 --> 01:28:28,199
- and that l'll teach how to talk.

651
01:28:28,533 --> 01:28:32,121
- Fish can't talk.
- You can teach them.

652
01:28:33,247 --> 01:28:37,001
- Lasse is lying!
- Stig, can you call for a car?

653
01:28:37,335 --> 01:28:39,546
Sure...

654
01:28:45,885 --> 01:28:51,058
- Dad... Lasse is lying.
- No, he's only making things up.

655
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:57,399
Taxi... Why shouldn't a fish be
able to speak? You never know.

656
01:28:57,732 --> 01:29:01,903
Yes, could l have a car
for Prastgatatan 7b?

657
01:29:02,278 --> 01:29:05,657
Ericsson... Oh, miss, miss...!

658
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:11,413
lt must be a big car as there
are four people and lots of things.

659
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:15,000
That's right. And what do you want?

660
01:29:15,334 --> 01:29:20,465
Ask Sönderby over this evening.
There's mineral water in the fridge.

661
01:29:20,799 --> 01:29:24,344
- l think this will be lonesome.
- No, you don't.

662
01:29:24,678 --> 01:29:28,974
- You think it will be lovely.
- Thanks very much.

663
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:34,438
The kids can go
and you should stay with me.

664
01:29:34,772 --> 01:29:37,567
You're silly.
What would grandmother say?

665
01:29:37,901 --> 01:29:40,945
You have enough stuff
to last until Judgement Day.

666
01:29:41,278 --> 01:29:45,408
You don't have to come
to the station. l can use a porter.

667
01:29:46,701 --> 01:29:50,915
- What's this? ls it a bomb?
- No, it's a paraffin stove.

668
01:29:51,249 --> 01:29:54,085
- You taking a stove with you?
- Yes, it's better.

669
01:29:54,418 --> 01:29:59,757
We'll stay in the cottage, cook our
food and leave the others in peace.

670
01:30:00,049 --> 01:30:04,930
You just sigh... You'll think
it really nice when you come.

671
01:30:10,895 --> 01:30:14,649
- You should cut your hair.
- lt's awful, you get hair all over.

672
01:30:14,982 --> 01:30:18,403
- lf you came with me l could cut it.
- l'll come later.

673
01:30:18,736 --> 01:30:21,656
- lt's strange. l always miss you.
- Why's it strange?

674
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:27,120
We've been married so long. Lasse,
don't lick the window, it's dirty.

675
01:30:27,454 --> 01:30:33,086
- The weather will be good.
- lt looks like spring is coming.

676
01:30:33,419 --> 01:30:36,881
- Won't it ever leave?
- You want to get rid of us?

677
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:40,969
lt always feels so silly
standing on the platform.

678
01:30:48,644 --> 01:30:52,190
We'll catch a fish that can talk!

679
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:13,820
l heard what happened... l'm...

680
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:17,324
You see l...

681
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:20,911
You don't have to come here
if you don't want to.

682
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:25,667
- Thanks, it's better to work.
- Yes...

683
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,795
- You do as you please.
- Don't touch me.

684
01:32:53,863 --> 01:32:59,954
Cellos and basses
should sing like blazes!

685
01:33:00,287 --> 01:33:03,290
lt's a question of joy, you see.

686
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:07,836
Not a joy that expresses itself
in laughter.

687
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:12,133
Or a joy that says l am happy.

688
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:16,846
What l mean is a joy
that is so great -

689
01:33:17,181 --> 01:33:22,978
- so particular, that it lies
beyond pain and boundless despair.

690
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:29,235
You understand,
it's a joy beyond all understanding.

691
01:33:29,568 --> 01:33:33,281
lt's... Well, l...

692
01:33:33,615 --> 01:33:36,618
l can't explain it any better.
