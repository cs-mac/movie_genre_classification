1
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,200
You know, I was waiting
for a ride here tonight

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,066
watching the headlights
go by.

3
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,467
And I got to thinking
how different it was

4
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,433
back in the old days.

5
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:58,266
Standing in front
of a burger stand and waiting.

6
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,600
Yeah, those were the days

7
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,934
of the really
important headlights.

8
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:05,233
"That him?"

9
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:08,166
No. Too narrow."

10
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,533
"That him? No."

11
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,900
"Is that him?

12
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,000
No, no."

13
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,133
You know, you'd think
after several hundreds cars,

14
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,634
you'd lose interest.

15
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:24,467
But that's the one thing
about waiting for drugs.

16
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,133
You never lose interest.

17
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah?

18
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,066
Hey, Martin. What?

19
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:43,866
Uh...

20
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,433
Whoa, slow down.
What account?

21
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,767
Oh, yeah, that account.
That account, okay.

22
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,767
What problem?

23
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:56,000
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,100
No, no, no.

25
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,567
That's just a...
You know, the balance on that

26
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:00,967
is gonna shift
from time to time.

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,933
Yeah.

28
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,734
Yeah. Well,
it's a very fluid account.

29
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,066
Yeah.

30
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:12,866
Wait a minute.

31
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:16,083
So you're telling me
the whole $80,000...

32
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:19,300
All right.
The entire 92,000 isn't there?

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,667
Martin, it's there.

34
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,367
Are we talking about
the same thing?

35
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:24,367
The escrow account, right?

36
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,967
Yeah.
Believe me, it's all there.

37
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:29,367
Check with the bank
on Monday.

38
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:32,634
Check with the bank on Monday,
Martin.

39
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:36,033
Martin, check with the bank
on Monday, would you?

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,700
Yeah. No.

41
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,367
No problem. It's okay.

42
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,833
All right, man.

43
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,633
Absolutely. Monday, Martin.

44
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,800
Fuck.

45
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,033
Mm. Yeah.
Where do you get this stuff?

46
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,800
Here.

47
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,133
Get your heart started.

48
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,467
Mm.

49
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,400
Come on,
you little munchkin.

50
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,767
Appears to be comatose.

51
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:53,133
Yeah, respiration's shallow.

52
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,166
Got anything for me?

53
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,300
Where's your coke?

54
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,967
Excuse me?

55
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,734
Hey, I hardly knew her.

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,967
Give me a second,
will you?

57
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah, but now
is not a good time.

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,333
It has nothing to do
with the quality.

59
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,567
It's just a bad time.

60
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:25,633
No. Don't.
Hey, I won't be here.

61
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,066
Hey, I will pay you!

62
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:30,267
Listen...

63
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,767
Listen to me, kid.

64
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,734
I know you wanna win a bike,
but I already subscribed.

65
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,667
Hey, uh,

66
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,100
she's gonna be all right,
isn't she?

67
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,967
Well, you better hope so,
asshole.

68
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,266
Stay close to home, huh?

69
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,433
Absolutely.

70
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:04,533
There will be a 20-minute
weather delay.

71
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,500
Attention please.
Attention please.

72
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,467
Flight 38 to Boston
is now boarding

73
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,534
at Gate 9, terminal...

74
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,400
Give me a ticket on the 8:45
to Toronto.

75
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,100
Sir, I see a delay in our
connecting flight in Buffalo.

76
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,100
Fine. What else you got?

77
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,500
What do you mean?
Going where?

78
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,734
I don't care. Vancouver,
Ottawa. It doesn't matter.

79
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:22,934
I'm afraid we're not getting
an authorization on this card.

80
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,850
Bullshit. It's paid.
Come on.

81
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,608
I'm sorry.
If you have another...

82
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,367
How about cash?
You want cash?

83
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,100
You take that, right?

84
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,834
Give me the fucking card!

85
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:34,066
Fuck!

86
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:40,983
You always remember
the moment you knew.

87
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,900
You know, the time you went,
"This is it."

88
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,967
Mine was July 14th, '79.

89
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,133
I was in the shower

90
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,700
after a little
two-day extravaganza.

91
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,467
And I slipped.

92
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,500
So I looked in the mirror

93
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,400
and my nose
was completely bent

94
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,300
all the way over
across my face.

95
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,883
All the way to one side.

96
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,267
So I decided to fix it.

97
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:12,467
I got a hammer
and began banging it back

98
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:16,734
to right angle with my face.

99
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,500
Suddenly,
I saw myself in the mirror.

100
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,567
You know, hammer in my hand,
blood on my face.

101
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,133
And something inside me
said,

102
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,066
"Richard,

103
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:34,800
your life
is no longer manageable."

104
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,667
Either gonna go
to the lake of fire

105
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,200
or in heaven.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,133
God won't force it.
It's your decision.

107
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,400
And I pray in Jesus' name that
you need to pray that prayer.

108
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,066
You, uh...
You want something to eat

109
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,066
or something?

110
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,600
Uh, no, thanks.
Do you have any beer?

111
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,966
I think so.

112
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:00,966
Wow.
Thanks, honey.

113
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,233
You have
the most amazing hands.

114
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,534
Seriously.

115
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,200
I knew this chick once.
She had...

116
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,167
She was a hand model.

117
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,000
You know, she used
to get paid 7 grand

118
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,533
to hold up a can
of creamed corn.

119
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:14,666
Thanks, Debbie.

120
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:15,900
Yeah, Deb.

121
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,133
I'm sorry, man.

122
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,266
Some girl had a heart attack
in my bed.

123
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:37,533
What?

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,300
The cops think
it might have been drugs.

125
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,966
Who was she?
I don't know.

126
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,533
Some girl I met in a mall.

127
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,767
Hey, Martin,
I need a place to stay.

128
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,800
Honey.

129
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
Uh, hey,
I don't mean to be rude,

130
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,300
but we have this
tennis thing.

131
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,400
You...

132
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,166
Go ahead, man, go ahead,
you know.

133
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,934
Finish your beer.

134
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:16,400
Hey, Martin.
Just for a couple of weeks?

135
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,267
Here?

136
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,900
If she dies, they're gonna say
I did a John Belushi on her.

137
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,433
Hey, how am I gonna handle
the escrow thing

138
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,934
when God knows I'm in a fucking
interrogation chamber?

139
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:27,100
You took the money, didn't you?
No!

140
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,400
Well...

141
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,500
Look, it's real complicated.
I can't explain it now.

142
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,933
Martin!

143
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,700
Look, Daryl.

144
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
I don't think so.

145
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:46,100
You don't look very well,
you know?

146
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,667
Maybe you should see
a doctor.

147
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,700
Okay, I get it.

148
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,700
So then, basically,
it's "Fuck you, Daryl," right?

149
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:56,483
Okay.

150
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:57,934
Hey.

151
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,033
You mind giving me another one
of those beers?

152
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,066
WCAU news at 10. Philadelphia.

153
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,833
Did you know that alcoholism
and drug addiction

154
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,600
affect the lives of more than
70 million Americans?

155
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,933
Seventy million? Jesus.

156
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,567
I'm Dr. Paul...
Who do I believe?

157
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,166
Director of Crossroads Center
for chemical dependents.

158
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,033

and confidentiality.

165
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,166
No one need ever know
you're here.

166
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,266
Furthermore, the program...

167
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,200
Call the insurance company?

168
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,866
Absolutely.
You can write them.

169
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,734
It'll just take
a little longer. Um...

170
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,734
That's fine.

171
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:20,567
All right. Let me know
if I can be of any help.

172
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,534
Hi.
Hi.

173
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:25,734
How you doing?

174
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:26,934
Good.

175
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,716
These your barns?

176
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,225
No. Afraid not.

177
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,745
Can I help you?

178
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:34,066
Nice barns.

179
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,266
Yeah. Um, I heard
about the program

180
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,267
and it sounds good to me.

181
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,150
I just wanna make sure
I understand the deals

182
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,033
as far as the, uh,
confidentiality aspect

183
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,133
is concerned.

184
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,667
Yes. Well, The program
is completely confidential.

185
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:48,067
So no one
would know I was in here?

186
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:50,467
Not unless you wanted them to.
No.

187
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,700
Great. You take Blue Cross?

188
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,433
Yes, we do.

189
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:54,800
Good.

190
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,166
Let's say someone,
um, found out I was here

191
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:02,233
and tried to call me

192
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,533
or wanted to get in here
and bother me or something.

193
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,100
Let me tell you why I ask,
uh...

194
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,467
I'm gonna level with you.

195
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,300
Uh, I got the police
after me

196
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,667
for some old bullshit
traffic violations.

197
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:21,267
And, you know, I think
it'd be a really good idea

198
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:24,667
if I just avoided any
outside pressure for a while.

199
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:30,033
Well, then, this is probably
the safest place you could be.

200
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,066
It's a 21-day program
which begins here in detox.

201
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,867
I'll see what chemicals
you've been using,

202
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:34,767
prescribe medicine.

203
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,600
Probably Librium
to moderate the effects

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,734
of detoxification
on your body.

205
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,333
Most patients using combination
of alcohol and cocaine

206
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,900
remain here detox
for about 48 hours.

207
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,267
Wait a minute,
when you say 48 hours...

208
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,600
The time necessary
for full detoxification varies

209
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,133
with body weight, levels of...
Yeah,

210
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,266
but is 48 hours the norm?

211
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,734
Give or take.

212
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:50,734
You got a phone I can use?

213
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,900
Sorry,
no calls till downstairs.

214
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,233
You'll probably suffer
from acute nausea

215
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,233
and repeated vomiting.

216
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:58,700
If you don't make it
to the bowl, fine.

217
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,150
Just push that button, someone
will come by to clean it up.

218
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,600
We keep the room cold, as those
chemicals leave your body,

219
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,634
you're gonna begin to sweat.

220
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,433
There's a television lounge
down the hall,

221
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:09,000
but most patients end up
spending their time in bed.

222
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,866
You'll sleep on and off.
But you'll sleep.

223
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,649
Probably have one or two poison
dreams, little nightmares.

224
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:16,433
The thing to keep in mind is
it only last a couple of days.

225
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,800
Yes, about 48 hours, right?

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,567
Because that's what the doctor
said. He says about 48 hours.

227
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,600
If you need anything,
have any discomfort,

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,816
just hit the button.

229
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,033
Can I use a phone?

230
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:30,800
Lie down and go to sleep, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

231
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,833
...95, Evergreen Streets
of 20 to 25 miles an hour,

232
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,834
and the Ben Franklin Bridge
backed up to the 30.

233
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:50,733
Repeating our top story
of the hour.

234
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,433
A group
of unidentified terrorists

235
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,667
have seized an American
passenger plane in Lima, Peru,

236
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,066
and claim
to have set explosives

237
00:13:57,266 --> 00:14:00,433
timed to go off approximately
46 hours from now.

238
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,367
Turning to local weather...

239
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,600
Fucking bitch.

240
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,500
Putting me in this rat hole.

241
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,734
It's your ass.

242
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:25,133
Even names of the flight crew
at this point

243
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,066
are being withheld from us.

244
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,000
How are you doing?

245
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,133
Any communication
between the jetliner

246
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,133
and any government sources,

247
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,066
that is to say
any communication of any...

248
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:49,133
And my sources back in America
tell me

249
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,367
that nothing is forthcoming
on their end as well.

250
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,834
So all we can do
at this point is...

251
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:54,567
Hey.

252
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,650
Forty-three hours
until the threatened time

253
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,175
when this terrorist group
had let be known

254
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,500
that they're prepared
to blow up this jetliner

255
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,634
and everyone on board
in order to prove their point.

256
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:08,734
What their point is this point
is a mystery to everyone's...

257
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,966
Anybody care
if I change this?

258
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,967
We'll keep you informed,
giving you information,

259
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,333
as we secure it.

260
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,333
Um, it is cold day
here in Lima...

261
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:19,934
That's all right, I guess.

262
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:25,300
Fuck it! Fuck it!
Fuck this goddamn place!

263
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,800
Hey!

264
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,400
Hey!

265
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Open up! Open up!
Open this fucking door!

266
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,667
Call the doctor!

267
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,033
Open it up!

268
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,100
Stop it!
Stop it!

269
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,333
Someone call a doctor.

270
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,600
Get the hell fuck away
from me!

271
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,867
Get the fuck out,
you goddamn it!

272
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,867
Get the fuck out of here.

273
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:44,966
Where is that exit?

274
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,066
Where is that goddamned door?
Goddamn it.

275
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:52,133
You wanna say it?
You see that?

276
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,667
Nurse!

277
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,100
Where is that goddamn door!

278
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,667
I told you to keep away
from me!

279
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:02,533
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me, goddamn it!

280
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,600
Get out of my face,
you motherfucker!

281
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,467
Xavier, we're here to help you.

282
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:10,700
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

283
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,933
Fuck.

284
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,100
Nurse!

285
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,567
Can I please have a Librium?

286
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,634
You are free to move around.

287
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:08,567
And in here,
we normally have TV and coffee.

288
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:16,734
Oh, great.

289
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:19,066
Is that what I'm gonna
look like tomorrow?

290
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,100
This word just in.

291
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,367
And it has been confirmed

292
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,500
by our American ambassador
here in Lima.

293
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,734
The passengers
will be released.

294
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:06,200
Here we go.
Goddamn.

295
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,667
And the passengers...

296
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,700
Oh, my God! I don't believe it!
The bomb went off!

297
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,467
It's a fireball!
All those lives!

298
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,967
So, what's next?

299
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,066
Welcome
to the Social Rehab Center.

300
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,433
This is the where you'll spend
the rest of your time.

301
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,200
Someone will get you
a schedule.

302
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,900
All therapy, education,
and activities are mandatory.

303
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,734
If you leave the area
for any reason,

304
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,100
you'll be tested
for chemicals.

305
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,300
If you fail to participate
or comply,

306
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,634
you'll be discharged.

307
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:38,900
Now, each patient is given one
24-hour pass during their stay.

308
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,333
When their counselor feels
they're ready for the outside.

309
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,200
When you return,

310
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,700
you'll again be tested
for drugs.

311
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,433
If you have any questions,
just ask your counselor.

312
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:49,500
He's a recovering addict
himself.

313
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,667
His name is Craig
and this is his office.

314
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,600
He'll be back in a minute.

315
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
Okay.

316
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,433
Hey, Spence. Big D, man.
How you doing?

317
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,133
Yeah. Look, you've gotta do me
a favor, okay?

318
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,233
Oh, fuck you.

319
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:38,367
Look, you've gotta send me
some product, okay?

320
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,683
I don't know,
about 5 grams, probably.

321
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:43,000
What do you mean
you don't have any?

322
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,300
It's your fucking job, man.

323
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,400
Of... Hey, come on, man.

324
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,633
I'm gonna pay you.
I always pay you.

325
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,633
Come on. Hey, Spence.

326
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,200
Hey, Spence.

327
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,834
You fucking asshole.

328
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,467
Coronary Care, please.

329
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,200
Yeah.

330
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,834
I wanna check the condition
of a Karen Peluso.

331
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,950
I don't know
how to spell it.

332
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,066
Yeah. No.
Look, I just wanna know

333
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,000
if she's gonna be all right.

334
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,967
I just wanna check
her condition, please.

335
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,100
Fine. What's ICU?

336
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,433
Never mind that. Never mind
that. Who's her doctor?

337
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,800
What do you mean
you don't know?

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,700
You wanna hang up the phone,
please?

339
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,266
Obviously, I'm a relative.
Of course, I'm a relative.

340
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:56,367
Hang up the phone.

341
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,600
Hey, you wanna give me
a fucking minute, man, okay?

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,700
I'm her uncle, all right?

343
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,433
I'm her uncle.

344
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,750
We like to get patients
focused on the program

345
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,133
before they start dealing
with the outside.

346
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,333
You must be Daryl.

347
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm Craig.

348
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,700
Well, it's a real pleasure,
Craig.

349
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,367
Except you interrupted a pretty
important fucking phone call.

350
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:33,033
You can tell me what the big
deal is about the phone here.

351
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,166
I don't understand this.
I mean, what's the story?

352
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:37,633
I mean, life goes on,
right, Craig?

353
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,734
It's my phone.

354
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:42,017
Oh, fuck.

355
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,925
Fine. Here.

356
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,834
Tell you what,

357
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,767
we're even.

358
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:52,667
I think not.

359
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,734
You know what the addict's
least favorite word is?

360
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,066
"No."

361
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,934
Ask me if you can use
my phone now.

362
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,266
Say, Craig,

363
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,967
may I use your phone?

364
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,033
No.

365
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,033
Come on,
I'll show you to your room.

366
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Ah.
I'm feeling better already.

367
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:45,033
Hi!

368
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,367
I think
I'm your roommate.

369
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,233
Is this yours?

370
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:06,950
Go ahead.

371
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,667
Your bed?

372
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,633
I'm Donald.

373
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,033
Donald Towle.

374
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,500
Daryl.

375
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,700
I was in detox
for five days.

376
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,533
Five days is the longest
I've ever been without a drink.

377
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,033
Ever.

378
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,100
I've been drinking
since I was 9.

379
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,266
So how about you?
What's your...?

380
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:12,200
Bob. Alcoholic.

381
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,367
I'm with American Cyanamid.

382
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:18,166
And I wanna stop.

383
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,200
I know I can stop.

384
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,200
I gotta stop.

385
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,533
Roger Tiller.
Alcoholic, addict.

386
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm a hair consultant.

387
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,667
Color and whatnot.

388
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:41,066
I promised a friend
I'd do this.

389
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,900
Oh, um, Iris.

390
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,400
Listen. I gotta run down
the bathroom for a minute.

391
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,033
I mean, I don't know what
I'm supposed to be doing here.

392
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,467
I take that back. I'm here.

393
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,967
And I'm glad I'm here.

394
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:09,734
I guess.

395
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,333
Come on, come on, come on.

396
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,966
Hey, Spence, how you doing?
Big D again.

397
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,600
Listen, I gotta talk to you
for a minute.

398
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,433
Don't hang up on me.
Don't...

399
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:27,600
Fuck you! Fuck you!

400
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,634
Here's a healthy liver.

401
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,967
It weighs
about 3 and a half pounds.

402
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:34,300
This liver
of a chronic alcoholic

403
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,734
weighed 15 pounds.

404
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,433
The microscopic picture here
shows healthy liver cells.

405
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:44,433
Alcohol replaces them
with massive deposits of fat

406
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,066
which obstruct
the liver's functions.

407
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:50,666
I had been drinking vodka
for a long time.

408
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:54,266
But there was no indication
that I was sick.

409
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:56,066
I didn't consider myself
an...

410
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:57,966
Look, all you gotta do
is go to my desk, okay?

411
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,800
There's an envelope, bottom
right-hand drawer in the back.

412
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,033
It's a little
recreational stuff.

413
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:03,734
Now you take that envelope,
seal it up,

414
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:04,800
take it to Federal Express,

415
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
and you tell them
it's a priority delivery.

416
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,600
A top fucking priority.

417
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,333
Bang that into their heads,
Martin.

418
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:12,433
Daryl, I'm with clients.

419
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,883
All right, all right.

420
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,333
Give me the address.

421
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,266
It's a hospital?

422
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:23,433
You're in a hospital?

423
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:25,416
Yeah,
I'm having some tests done.

424
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,400
I'm just having some tests
done.

425
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
Exercise.

426
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,966
Good for the body,
good for the soul.

427
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,734
Helps us build up
a little appetite for dinner.

428
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:37,650
Some of our
chemically-dependent bodies

429
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,567
are not used
to a little physical exertion.

430
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,033
Huh, Daryl?

431
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:47,934
Best way to break old habits
is to start new ones.

432
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:49,233
One, two...

433
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,649
Right, Bob?

434
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,066
Yes, sir.

435
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:54,966
Fun, huh?

436
00:26:55,166 --> 00:27:01,266
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

437
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:04,000
Focus on the program, huh?

438
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,534
Three, four, five, six...

439
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,083
"That's right, Daryl.
Thanks for asking."

440
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,633
And basically,
Fuck you, Daryl. Okay.

441
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,000
Cheryl Ann.

442
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,834
I'm an alcoholic,
I'm an addict.

443
00:27:28,034 --> 00:27:29,433
I'm a mother too.

444
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,216
At least I was
when I got here.

445
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm having
a pretty hard time here.

446
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,467
No shit.

447
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,433
I just really
wanna get my life back.

448
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:42,866
Me too.

449
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:45,166
Give me a drink.

450
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,700
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, come on, Gordon,

451
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,266
just tell me where we stand
on DW Industries, all right?

452
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:05,734
Fuck it.
Yeah, I'll hold.

453
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,033
Craig said
I could use the phone.

454
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:17,433
I don't understand, did Craig
say you could use the phone?

455
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,416
Then use somebody else's
terminal.

456
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,200
I gave you $90,000,
for Christ's sake!

457
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
And you want me not to know
how my money is doing

458
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,500
because some asshole spilled a
Tab on your fucking terminal?

459
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,767
You're gonna be here long?
A minute, yeah.

460
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:31,066
Come on.
Pardon me, asshole.

461
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:34,066
You're a delicate young thing.
Fuck you!

462
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:35,066
Gordon.

463
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,600
Oh, no shit. Really?

464
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Yeah. If it went from 60,000
to 40,000 in three fucking days,

465
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,767
I guess it is sloping downward.
You fucking jerk.

466
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,033
Sell it all
and we'll short it.

467
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:51,233
Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,950
Listen, I want you to do me
a favor, okay?

469
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,667
I want you to call this guy
at my office.

470
00:28:56,867 --> 00:29:00,233
Yeah. His name is Martin.

471
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah.
I'll call you back, okay?

472
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,967
Thanks.
I just had to make a...

473
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,333
I think you better leave.

474
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,500
Is there a problem?

475
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,800
Just take this
to the front office.

476
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,867
Wait a second,
I don't understand, uh...

477
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,333
Was there a problem?

478
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:16,600
I want you out of here.

479
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,100
Why? Because I used
your fucking phone?

480
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,500
That was a 90,000-dollar
phone call, man.

481
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,233
Ninety thousand dollars.

482
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,467
Ninety grand, man!

483
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,000
That's the stock market,
babe!

484
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,834
It doesn't give a fuck
if I'm in the hospital or not.

485
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,400
Hey,
the American Stock Exchange

486
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,233
really doesn't care

487
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,950
if some asshole
makes $300 a week,

488
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,667
says I can't use
the fucking phone!

489
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,617
I'm close, right, Craig?

490
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:48,367
Like 310, maybe 315, right?

491
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,567
Right? That's about it,
isn't it, Craigy?

492
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,734
Yeah.
Oh, boy, big 307 a week.

493
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:56,567
Boy, you gotta allocate
that motherfucker, don't you?

494
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:59,400
What, that lean cuisine?
Maybe some pork and beans?

495
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,233
Hey, why don't you get yourself
another pair

496
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,433
of those plastic shoes?

497
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,433
Fine!
You want me out of here?

498
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,066
I'm fucking out of here!

499
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:07,233
I'm gone!

500
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:10,100
Motherfucker,
look at his back.

501
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,233
Fuck!

502
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,834
Gone, baby. The big fade.

503
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,433
Fucking A, baby.
Fucking B, C and D too, man.

504
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,567
I'm out of here, asshole!

505
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:42,600
Fuck you!

506
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,600
I don't fucking
believe it.

507
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,367
Fuck!

508
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,800
Fuck.

509
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,133
It's okay.

510
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,066
I work here.

511
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,700
I come back.

512
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,267
I got an emergency deal.

513
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:44,066
I need to find this contract,
really. It's okay.

514
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,467
This guy, he's nuts.
He never sleeps.

515
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:47,700
I'll come back.

516
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,700
Okay. Hey, I'll straight up
all this paper work, okay?

517
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,800
By the time you come back,

518
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,133
you wouldn't even know
I was here, all right?

519
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,967
It's all right, really.

520
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:59,800
It's okay.

521
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,200
Okay?

522
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,834
It's all right.

523
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,466
Hi. Daryl.

524
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,433
How are you?

525
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:45,500
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry, Ma.

526
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,866
I... Is it really?

527
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,933
Yeah, I was working
in the office here

528
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,934
and I didn't realize
how late it had gotten.

529
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:52,367
I'm sorry.

530
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,167
Yeah.

531
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,550
No, I'm fine, really.

532
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,734
I just remembered

533
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,967
how I hadn't called you
in a while, I thought...

534
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:02,500
No. No, everything's great.
Great. Yeah.

535
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,633
How are you, guys?

536
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,934
Well, make him get somebody
to do the lawn, Ma.

537
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:14,433
Well, then, you know, you get
somebody to do the lawn, Ma.

538
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,216
I mean, the lawn
is not gonna look much good

539
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,000
with a dead guy
lying in the middle of it

540
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,467
clutching his heart, is it?

541
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,167
Yeah.

542
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,333
No, everything's fine,
I'm telling you.

543
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,200
Yeah. I'm great.

544
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,900
Well, you know, I mean,
there is one thing I...

545
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,633
I'm in a little bit
of a, uh...

546
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:35,333
I'm in the middle
of a cash-crunch thing here,

547
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,433
a little bit.
I was just wondering

548
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:40,500
if I maybe could hit you guys
up for a little advance.

549
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:45,033
Um...

550
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:47,633
About $30,000.

551
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,933
Yeah. No, I know.

552
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,133
I know how much money that is.
You didn't bring me stupid, Ma.

553
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,700
Yeah.

554
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,933
Well, as a matter of fact

555
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,667
I do know where you can get
that kind of money.

556
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:03,667
Yeah.

557
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,600
Well,
I'm talking about the house.

558
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
Right. You do a second.

559
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,633
And then,
you send me the payment book.

560
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,167
Wait a minute.

561
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:13,734
Wait a minute... Ma.

562
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:14,767
I know exact...

563
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:16,700
I know how long you've lived
in that house.

564
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,866
Yes, this is not... No!

565
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,867
Calm down.
Nobody's telling you to move.

566
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:22,483
You don't have to move.

567
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:23,900
You just go to a bank.

568
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,367
It's done all the time.
It's...

569
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,167
Forget that.

570
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,033
Forget about that.

571
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:33,934
Let me talk to you
about something else.

572
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,167
Do you remember last year

573
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,800
when you and Dad went
to Fort Wayne

574
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,567
and you had the will
drawn up?

575
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,166
Are you gonna leave me anything
in that?

576
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,133
Ma.

577
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,983
What are you crying for?

578
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:52,000
Ma, what are you crying for?

579
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,600
I'm just trying
to figure out a way...

580
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,467
Ma!

581
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,066
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

582
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,866
What's gonna give you
more pleasure?

583
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:03,033
What's gonna give you
more pleasure than, you know,

584
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:05,000
give me that money now
while you're still alive,

585
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,333
when you get a chance to see me
get some use out of it?

586
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,734
Or later
when I may or may not?

587
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:10,667
Ma.

588
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,634
Ma, stop crying, would you?

589
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:16,767
Stop crying and put...
Put dad on the phone.

590
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,433
Put Dad on the phone.

591
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:45,966
You got somewhere to go?

592
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,066
You better go there.

593
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:48,900
Look.

594
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,967
Just leave me alone
for a minute.

595
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,467
I call police.

596
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,316
You got somewhere to go,

597
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:58,166
you better go there.

598
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,500
So, yeah, you know.

599
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,934
I'm out there driving around
and looking for a program.

600
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,433
Thanks.

601
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:15,266
And I say to myself,
"Well, hey, I'm already in one.

602
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,100
They got all the paperwork.

603
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,600
I know all the people.

604
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,700
I really like that counselor,
Craig."

605
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,367
Yeah.

606
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:31,000
They're gonna be pretty happy
with this one, Craig.

607
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,433
Pretty fucking happy.

608
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,734
How many of you have been
to an AA meeting before?

609
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:16,033
Okay.

610
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:20,667
Now, your job tonight
is to find a sponsor.

611
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,400
What's a sponsor?

612
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,966
Somebody you can relate to.

613
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:28,467
Somebody who's heard
all your bullshit before.

614
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,367
Somebody who...

615
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,933
Well, you'll know who.

616
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,333
You'll know him right away.

617
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:40,000
Hi, I'm Jane,

618
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,934
your Alcoholics secretary.

619
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,333
Hi, Jane.

620
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,834
Sheila is gonna be leading the
meeting this evening. Sheila.

621
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:49,667
I'm okay.

622
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,733
Hi. I'm Sheila.

623
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,499
Alcoholic addict.

624
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:58,066
Hi, Sheila.

625
00:38:58,266 --> 00:39:00,316
"Rarely have we seen
a person fail

626
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:02,367
"who has thoroughly followed
our path.

627
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:05,500
"Those who do not recover
are people who cannot

628
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,100
"or will not completely
give themselves

629
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,333
to this simple program."
You wanna be my sponsor?

630
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,567
"Usually, men and women
drew a constitutionally..."

631
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:12,833
No, thanks.

632
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:16,066
Hey, I'm serious on this.

633
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:20,000
"They are not at fault..."
It's a good deal.

634
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,567
"There are those too
who suffer

635
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,166
"from great emotional
and mental disorders.

636
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:25,667
"But many of them do recover

637
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,734
if they have the capacity
to be honest."

638
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:29,734
Thank you.

639
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,383
We have a 30-day chip
going to Mark

640
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,200
for his first 30 days
of sobriety.

641
00:40:18,734 --> 00:40:19,933
Hi.
Hi.

642
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:23,367
Daryl Poynter.
Addict, alcoholic.

643
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,834
You know, I thought you did
an amazing job

644
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:27,467
of running the meeting
tonight.

645
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,467
Really.

646
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,700
I mean, I... You know,
this is my first meeting

647
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,834
and actually, I was...
I was really moved.

648
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:36,417
Really?

649
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:37,800
Truly.

650
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,367
Truly. You know, it's funny
we should be talking here

651
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:42,600
because, actually,
I'm, uh...

652
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,867
Kind of, you know,
looking for a sponsor.

653
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:50,033
A sponsor?

654
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:56,867
Yeah.
You know, a sponsor, and...

655
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,066
Um, I'm sorry.

656
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,066
I don't think so.

657
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:03,166
You know,
but I you could help me.

658
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:05,266
See, I think
you could help me a lot.

659
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:07,367
A whole lot.

660
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,633
That was very nice.
Very smooth.

661
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,683
Yeah. You like that?

662
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,708
I got a million of them.

663
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:28,734
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

664
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,900
Hey, sorry about that situation
at the phone the other day.

665
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,866
Don't worry about it.

666
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:38,834
I was kind of wrapped up
on something.

667
00:41:39,034 --> 00:41:40,333
Yeah.

668
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,700
What's your name?
Charlie.

669
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,767
Charlene. Charlie

670
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,634
Charlie? Okay.

671
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:53,900
You having any luck, uh,
finding someone?

672
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,866
No. Not really.

673
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:57,167
Yeah, well, me neither.

674
00:41:57,367 --> 00:41:58,867
I guess guys
aren't supposed to have

675
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:01,800
female sponsors
or something.

676
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,850
That's too bad.

677
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,900
Tell me about it.

678
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,567
You're a newcomer.

679
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:39,000
Excuse me?

680
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,800
Sheila said
you're looking for a sponsor.

681
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah. Well,

682
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,900
I just came out here
to get some fresh air.

683
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,100
Really can't wait to get
to that phone, can you?

684
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:54,767
Here. Give me your back.

685
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,633
If you're looking
for a sponsor,

686
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,233
you phone this number.

687
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:12,967
Name's Richard.

688
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:14,767
Good night.

689
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,467
Someone's here to see you.

690
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,433
Said it's important.

691
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:51,133
Martin. You dog.

692
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,767
How are you?
All right.

693
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,367
How are you doing, buddy?
Jesus.

694
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,600
I practically had to beg
the guy to let me in here.

695
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, a classy joint.

696
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,333
You didn't tell me
what it was.

697
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:02,200
Yeah. Well, how you doing?
How's the office?

698
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,900
Good.

699
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,166
Well, somebody broke in
a couple of nights ago

700
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:08,467
and trashed the place.

701
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,300
Jesus.

702
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,933
Mm.

703
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:14,466
Hey, I really appreciate your
coming down here this late.

704
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:17,000
You know, you could have gotten
a messenger to do it.

705
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,883
It's empty.

706
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,767
It's what?

707
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,267
There's nothing in it.

708
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:27,233
What the fuck
are you talking about?

709
00:44:27,433 --> 00:44:29,100
I flushed it
down the toilet.

710
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:41,866
Look, Daryl.

711
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:44,683
We had an incident
yesterday morning, okay?

712
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:47,500
Some crazy guy came in
shouting and screaming.

713
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,400
What guy?

714
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,634
A man named Peluso.

715
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:52,333
He came in, said you gave drugs
to his daughter.

716
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:55,033
But half the staff heard him,
including Kramer.

717
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,100
Fucking great.

718
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,800
She died, Daryl.

719
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:08,467
What?

720
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,450
He said she died.

721
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,433
Night before last.

722
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,700
He threatened
to make a lot of trouble.

723
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,200
And then a guy
from the DA's office came by,

724
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,600
and interviewed all of us,
Daryl.

725
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
Kramer too. I mean, Kramer...

726
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,300
Kramer really wants
to talk to you, Daryl.

727
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,700
Now, I can tell him you're
in the hospital, but, hey, man,

728
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,016
at some point, you're gonna
have to deal with him.

729
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:33,333
And you gotta to come up
with the money you took.

730
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:42,200
Look, I gotta go.
I had to work late.

731
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,133
Debbie's waiting.

732
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,800
Daryl, you okay?

733
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:57,600
Look, Daryl.

734
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:01,467
I really gotta go now.

735
00:46:12,266 --> 00:46:13,867
Shall we?

736
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,734
Tell me how happy I'm gonna be
with this one, Daryl.

737
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:24,767
Am I going to be happy?

738
00:46:32,934 --> 00:46:34,867
Let me ask you something.

739
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:38,467
What the fuck
are you doing here?

740
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,133
You got a problem, Daryl?

741
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,867
You don't even know
you've got a problem, do you?

742
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,533
You know how long
you've been straight, man?

743
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:11,266
Twelve days.

744
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,700
Twelve whole days.

745
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:26,400
Twelve days,
three hours and 20 seconds.

746
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:30,150
Twenty-four seconds.

747
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,834
Twenty-six seconds.

748
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:38,200
That's how we do it, Daryl.

749
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,166
A second at a time.

750
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,333
A minute at a time.

751
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,734
One day at a time.

752
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,266
But you gotta know
you got problem.

753
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,300
Drink up, will you?

754
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:46,133
Hey.

755
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,833
All right, uh,
ladies and gentlemen,

756
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:04,700
can I have
your attention please?

757
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,433
Hello?

758
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,633
Hello?

759
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,500
Good morning.

760
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,300
My name is Craig.

761
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,233
And I would like to welcome you
to family group.

762
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,567
Now, I know how hard this is
for everybody.

763
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,900
A lot of us have been...

764
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:36,567
very angry,

765
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,500
very worried
for a long time.

766
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:44,866
But don't be afraid
to speak honestly.

767
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,233
What do you mean, bitch?
You took my fucking rock!

768
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:50,850
What the hell
do you expect?

769
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,467
Your old man steals
your visa,

770
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:54,800
kicks your ass every day!

771
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,767
You'd jam his damn freebase
down the sink too!

772
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,167
I wanna ask a question.

773
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,500
I wanna know
what is she doing here?

774
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,966
Jesus, Lenny.

775
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,500
They were gonna fire me,
right?

776
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,433
And they didn't fire me,
which is good.

777
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:09,500
Because I like buying gas

778
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,834
so you can make it to your
probation officer, okay?

779
00:50:12,034 --> 00:50:14,966
Good. Thanks.

780
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:19,033
Everybody hear that?
I'm on probation.

781
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:21,900
Way to go, Charlie.

782
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,567
I'm sorry.

783
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,233
And fuck your job!

784
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:26,767
Hey, no.

785
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:29,833
No, I can't fuck my job!

786
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:31,734
I like having a steel mill
to go to

787
00:50:31,934 --> 00:50:34,367
when you're throwing fucking
telephones to the window.

788
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,767
Beats throwing her
through the fucking window,

789
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:40,967
Doesn't it?

790
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,533
Oh, Christ.

791
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:56,800
Fuck!

792
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,900
All right, people,
time for shower.

793
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:33,033
How you feeling, Daryl?

794
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,233
I was feeling just dandy,
Craig, old pal,

795
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:38,300
till you shoved your foot
up my ass.

796
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,734
Listen.

797
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:45,133
I'm starting to give
some of the people passes.

798
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,099
A little time
to be on their own.

799
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:51,066
You think
you can handle that?

800
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,400
Possibly.

801
00:51:58,667 --> 00:51:59,667
Yeah.

802
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:03,200
You gonna fuck with me?

803
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,467
No.

804
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:10,834
All right.

805
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,900
This is Spence.

806
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,600
I'm out for a while.
Leave your name and number

807
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,767
where you can be reached
at the beep.

808
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,433
Spence. Daryl.
Pick up, will you?

809
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:10,100
I wanna do some business,
man.

810
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:13,800
Come on, Spence, pick up.
This is Daryl.

811
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,567
Shit!

812
00:53:28,934 --> 00:53:30,967
We're sorry, you have reached
a number that...

813
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:47,866
Hello?

814
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:49,499
Hey, Larry.
This is Daryl.

815
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:50,933
I'd like to do
some business.

816
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:53,850
You would, huh?
Well, I would too, Daryl,

817
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,575
but I think you dialed
the wrong number.

818
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,300
This is Richard.
We met the other night.

819
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,367
Oh, Richard.

820
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,100
Jesus, I got the wrong number.
I was just...

821
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,467
Where are you?

822
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:11,633
Daryl, Daryl. Listen to me.
I... I wanna see you.

823
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,967
I can't get away now,
but how about 12:30?

824
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:16,900
Why?

825
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,033
Why? Why do you think why?

826
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:21,333
Daryl, lets... I want you to do
something for me.

827
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:23,650
Do you know
what an inventory is?

828
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,808
It's a list of everything
you've done

829
00:54:26,008 --> 00:54:27,967
that caused harm
to other people.

830
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:29,100
I want you to make one.

831
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,750
A fearless and searching
moral inventory, Daryl.

832
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,400
Write it down
and have it with you at 12:30.

833
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,233
Fearless and searching
moral inventory.

834
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:37,033
Hey, look...

835
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,367
Daryl, Daryl.
Now, just do it.

836
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,567
It will take your mind off
calling Larry.

837
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:42,600
There's a coffee shop

838
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,600
at the corner
of Second and Market.

839
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,667
Yeah, I'll bet there is.

840
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:46,734
What are you gonna bring?

841
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,000
Drugs. Lots of drugs.

842
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,667
An inventory.

843
00:54:51,867 --> 00:54:53,167
Now, you got an hour
and a half.

844
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:56,033
Go park yourself someplace
and do it.

845
00:55:25,734 --> 00:55:27,367
Sorry, I'm late.

846
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:28,934
Addicts are always late.

847
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:30,633
Thanks, hon.

848
00:55:32,066 --> 00:55:33,633
No.

849
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,166
What is it with you guys
and food?

850
00:55:37,366 --> 00:55:39,450
You're like wild dogs.

851
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,341
Addicts are compulsive.

852
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:43,233
You got your inventory?

853
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:44,567
Uh-huh.

854
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,767
Call Larry?
No.

855
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,100
Do you want something to eat?

856
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,533
No, it's all right.

857
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:01,333
"Halloween, 1964,

858
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:04,000
"I put a cherry bomb
in this guy's air conditioner.

859
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,333
"1970,
I faked a stamp on my hand

860
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,100
"to get into a church dance.

861
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,667
"1976, I told some girls

862
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,433
"I played
in the Pam American Games

863
00:56:11,633 --> 00:56:13,600
"when I really didn't.

864
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,333
"Two weeks ago,
I borrowed $92,000

865
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:18,000
"from an escrow account.

866
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,300
"1981, I guess,
I first moved out here.

867
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,816
"Took a blender back to Sears
that I broke.

868
00:56:24,016 --> 00:56:26,333
Told them it was fucked up
when I bought it."

869
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:27,133
You asleep yet?

870
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,834
What's with this 92,000?

871
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:35,066
I was a little short.
For coke?

872
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,266
I needed a few
thousand dollars, so...

873
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:44,133
I put some money
in some stock options.

874
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:47,166
Made a little at first
then the market got weird.

875
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:48,166
How much you lose?

876
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,016
Fifty-two thousand dollars.

877
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:53,866
You get along
with your boss?

878
00:56:54,066 --> 00:56:56,734
There some way
he'll let you pay it back?

879
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,967
I don't know.

880
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:04,166
I don't know.

881
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,166
You see,

882
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:12,667
this guy...

883
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:24,834
His daughter had a heart attack
in my bed.

884
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:28,200
And he went into the office,

885
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,433
screaming, yelling
how I killed his daughter,

886
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:31,567
because I gave her drugs.

887
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:34,867
Did you?
No. She gave them to me.

888
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:36,933
What about the police?

889
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:40,467
You know,
told me not to leave town.

890
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,500
You an addict, Daryl?

891
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:46,966
Funny how the mind works.

892
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:50,633
Proof that you're not an addict
because you're not dead, right?

893
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,100
I don't believe this shit.

894
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:53,900
What?

895
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,966
That I'm fucking here.

896
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,033
Are you an addict, Daryl?

897
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,867
Fuck you.

898
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,717
Yeah, I tell you, Craig,
old pal.

899
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:10,967
All you're gonna find
in this one,

900
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:12,833
a couple of milkshakes,
baby.

901
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:14,700
Well, more than that,
actually.

902
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,534
Five. Five milkshakes.

903
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:19,467
The chemical equivalent
of nitro-fucking-glycerine.

904
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,233
Yeah, I can barely
see straight, man.

905
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,500
Get that snake out of there.
Come on, you python.

906
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,367
There you go.

907
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:31,934
I got him all coiled up
after lasso practice.

908
00:58:58,567 --> 00:59:01,834
Well, we've been together
a long time.

909
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,400
It's hard with him,
you know.

910
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,367
Why? What makes it hard?

911
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,834
I don't know. He's stupid.

912
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,534
Like I...

913
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:26,233
He... He... He ripped off
all this cable, you know,

914
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:28,433
from the phone company,
uh...

915
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:31,367
You know,
all those spools they've got

916
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:34,066
that lie underground,
you know?

917
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:39,900
I come home one night

918
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:46,967
and there's 152-ton spools
of wire in my backyard.

919
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,966
And there was this
Mafia fuck

920
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:52,133
who was supposed to broker
it all for the copper.

921
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:57,066
So Lenny and him,
they got into an argument.

922
00:59:57,266 --> 01:00:01,667
and Lenny shoots him
in the foot.

923
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:13,633
Then the cops come
and Lenny goes to jail.

924
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:21,066
You do any drugs
while Lenny was away?

925
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,283
How you doing, Daryl?

926
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:53,567
Just groovy, Craig.

927
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,166
Iris?

928
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,400
Okay.

929
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,700
Oh, yeah?

930
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,533
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

931
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:09,200
Where'd you get the stuff?

932
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:12,233
What do you mean?

933
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:16,667
I mean the stuff you took
before you came in here.

934
01:01:23,033 --> 01:01:25,266
I can see it in your eyes.

935
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:28,500
My eyes are fine.

936
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,700
Then you don't know
what I'm talking about?

937
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,933
Afraid not.

938
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:35,867
There are a lot of people
here trying hard

939
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,000
to stay clean, Iris.

940
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,533
I think you owe it to them
to tell me the truth.

941
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,634
All right, Iris,

942
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:53,934
if you're using,
I want you to leave.

943
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,533
Right now.

944
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,734
Hey, Chuck, what's shaking?

945
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:51,500
Besides you, I mean.

946
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:56,667
Hey, too bad about Iris,
huh?

947
01:02:56,867 --> 01:02:59,200
Yeah, too bad.

948
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,200
She was your roommate,
right?

949
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,500
You take two desserts?

950
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,100
Okay.

951
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:10,100
So I guess you're gonna be
all alone up there

952
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,233
for the last few days.

953
01:03:12,433 --> 01:03:15,866
Tough duty, Chuck.
Tough duty.

954
01:03:16,066 --> 01:03:18,683
Look. I just want you to know,
you know,

955
01:03:18,883 --> 01:03:21,500
if sleeping alone
starts to get you down...

956
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,633
You know what I mean.
I mean, sometimes...

957
01:03:26,233 --> 01:03:27,633
I just know
how tough it's gonna be

958
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:28,633
to have to sleep alone.

959
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,166
I'll bet you do.

01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,400
I go to your house for dinner.
You're coming to my house?

1131
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,200
Yeah. I wanna come
to your house for dinner.

1132
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,066
You, me and Lenny?

1133
01:12:00,266 --> 01:12:02,133
People do it all the time.

1134
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,100
You're nuts.

1135
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:15,100
♪ For you ♪

1136
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,066
Be honest with yourselves.

1137
01:12:24,934 --> 01:12:26,800
Go to your meetings.

1138
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:31,834
Talk to your sponsors.

1139
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,767
And for Christ's sake,
talk to each other.

1140
01:12:36,967 --> 01:12:38,934
If you need a phone number,

1141
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:40,700
call me.

1142
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,800
I'll put you in touch.

1143
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,166
You'll make it.

1144
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,934
Jesus.

1145
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:40,967
You got ants in your tuner.

1146
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:45,266
Where's your stash?

1147
01:13:45,466 --> 01:13:46,600
Stash?

1148
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,200
What stash? The cops
were all over this place.

1149
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,633
You mind if I take a look?

1150
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,367
Now, I'm going to assume

1151
01:14:16,567 --> 01:14:18,367
that more to your friends
these days

1152
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:19,667
are selling drugs.

1153
01:14:19,867 --> 01:14:23,100
So I want you to screen
all of your calls.

1154
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:28,400
What's your situation
at work?

1155
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,467
Damn, you don't let up,
do you?

1156
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,000
I want you to spend
the next day or two

1157
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,633
figuring exactly how you're
gonna straighten things out.

1158
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:38,934
Don't worry,
I'll handle it.

1159
01:14:39,134 --> 01:14:40,300
How?

1160
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,233
You mean,
you dance around the problem

1161
01:14:44,433 --> 01:14:46,083
till it gets so big
you can't handle it?

1162
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:47,934
Pretty good excuse
for getting high, right?

1163
01:14:48,134 --> 01:14:50,117
Hey, look...
No, no, no. You look.

1164
01:14:50,317 --> 01:14:52,100
Now, what you do
is you sit down

1165
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,834
and write out exactly what
you're gonna tell your boss.

1166
01:14:55,034 --> 01:14:55,866
If you're afraid of him,

1167
01:14:56,066 --> 01:14:58,466
you take the paper
and use it like a script.

1168
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:01,066
But whatever the case,
you tell him everything.

1169
01:15:01,266 --> 01:15:03,200
You tell him the truth.

1170
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,567
Yeah, right.

1171
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:09,767
And he congratulates me
and give me a raise.

1172
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,400
It's an AA schedule.
Don't lose it.

1173
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,383
Anytime you wanna go
to a meeting,

1174
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,367
look in there.
You'll find one.

1175
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:33,900
Motherfucking...

1176
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,500
Motherfucking god...

1177
01:17:27,266 --> 01:17:29,700
Hi. Is this Mrs. Towle?

1178
01:17:30,967 --> 01:17:32,100
Yeah.
My name's Daryl Poynter.

1179
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,100
I was your son's roommate
at the clinic.

1180
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,633
Yeah. I'm thinking about going
to one of those AA meetings.

1181
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:40,867
I was just wondering
if Donald wanted to go

1182
01:17:41,067 --> 01:17:44,233
or he needed a ride.
I don't know.

1183
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:47,300
Oh, he's not.

1184
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,266
No, no. That's all right.
Just tell him I called.

1185
01:17:52,466 --> 01:17:53,967
Okay. Thank you.

Hey, Chuck.

1195
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:43,100
I was just
in the neighborhood.

1196
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,033
I thought I'd stop by.

1197
01:18:46,066 --> 01:18:49,300
Yeah? Well,

1198
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,500
I'm fixing dinner.

1199
01:18:55,266 --> 01:18:57,534
Yeah, well, uh...

1200
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:59,567
Yeah, I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

1201
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:00,367
How are you doing?

1202
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:03,266
I got an 8:00 shift.

1203
01:19:03,466 --> 01:19:05,100
Okay.

1204
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,433
Okay. We don't want...
I'll stop some other time.

1205
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:11,266
Hey.

1206
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:16,266
You could join us
if you like.

1207
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:25,467
This is nice.

1208
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:44,633
Are you sure
this is okay?

1209
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,367
Sure. Why not?

1210
01:19:47,467 --> 01:19:49,900
Lenny!

1211
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:53,500
What?

1212
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,467
What?

1213
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:05,333
This is one of the guys
from the clinic.

1214
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:08,433
Hi. How you doing?
Daryl Poynter.

1215
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,033
Doing all right.

1216
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:35,734
So why do debutantes
hate group sex?

1217
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:37,033
Oh, Jesus.

1218
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,000
They have to write
too many thank you notes.

1219
01:20:56,533 --> 01:20:58,000
You live around here?

1220
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,016
Oh, yeah. Kind of.

1221
01:21:00,216 --> 01:21:01,833
I... Sort of... Yeah.

1222
01:21:02,033 --> 01:21:04,834
No. I thought it was,
you know, a good idea

1223
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:06,233
to just keep in touch

1224
01:21:06,433 --> 01:21:09,300
with some of the people
in the program.

1225
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,734
You wouldn't believe
what a mess this guy was.

1226
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:15,200
Yeah, well.

1227
01:21:28,266 --> 01:21:29,867
So, Lenny,
what kind of work are you in?

1228
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,700
I'm a doctor.

1229
01:21:41,533 --> 01:21:42,934
A brain surgeon.

1230
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,467
Hmm.

1231
01:21:47,867 --> 01:21:49,900
I'm through.

1232
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,217
You know,
I don't know you very well,

1233
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:56,734
and probably
none of my business,

1234
01:22:56,934 --> 01:22:59,600
but you figure that's really
a smart thing to do

1235
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,967
around Charlie and me,
you know?

1236
01:23:05,066 --> 01:23:06,934
Dinner's over.

1237
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,200
She's gotta go to work.

1238
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,700
Why don't you get
the fuck out of here.

1239
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,783
I don't think
you understand...

1240
01:23:15,983 --> 01:23:17,867
Lenny,
are you driving me to work

1241
01:23:18,067 --> 01:23:20,066
or am driving myself?

1242
01:23:31,433 --> 01:23:33,634
Sorry.
It's okay.

1243
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:35,833
It keeps life
interesting.

1244
01:23:36,033 --> 01:23:38,033
It keeps Lenny
on his toes.

1245
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,800
It was really
kind of nice.

1246
01:23:52,367 --> 01:23:54,667
So, what's next?

1247
01:23:54,867 --> 01:23:56,633
What do you mean
what's next?

1248
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:57,600
I don't know.

1249
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,100
I wanna take you to a movie
or something.

1250
01:24:01,533 --> 01:24:02,866
I... I don't think so.

1251
01:24:03,066 --> 01:24:04,400
Come on.
There's a movie theater

1252
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,167
right down the street.

1253
01:24:06,367 --> 01:24:07,734
Tomorrow's Saturday.

1254
01:24:07,934 --> 01:24:10,533
Just tell him you're going
shopping or something.

1255
01:24:21,066 --> 01:24:24,100
Tomorrow at 3.

1256
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:37,033
Hi. This is Daryl.

1257
01:24:37,233 --> 01:24:38,500
You know what to do
and when to do it.

1258
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,667
Daryl? Richard Dirks.

1259
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,550
Now, what's the deal
with your boss?

1260
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,433
You gotta take care of that
right now.

1261
01:24:44,633 --> 01:24:45,600
You know that.

1262
01:25:06,066 --> 01:25:07,734
All right, you made it.

1263
01:25:07,934 --> 01:25:09,333
Ugh!

1264
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:10,667
They got a good flick today.

1265
01:25:10,867 --> 01:25:13,266
The Care Bears Movie
and five color cartoons.

1266
01:25:13,466 --> 01:25:14,834
You seen them?

1267
01:25:15,834 --> 01:25:17,800
I screwed up.

1268
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,266
Matinees, you know.

1269
01:25:19,466 --> 01:25:20,634
Yeah, well,

1270
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:22,917
I don't have too much time,
you know, so...

1271
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:25,200
Oh, yeah. I guess
this isn't too cool out here.

1272
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,900
Okay. Come on.

1273
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,934
No.

1274
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:02,367
What are you doing?

1275
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,033
Nothing.

1276
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:07,533
Just looking at you.

1277
01:26:07,733 --> 01:26:09,233
It's nice to see you.

1278
01:26:09,433 --> 01:26:10,867
Why?

1279
01:26:12,266 --> 01:26:13,900
I don't know.

1280
01:26:15,266 --> 01:26:19,567
I'm alone all day, you're nice.
I don't know.

1281
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:26,767
Would you stop?
Would you staring at me?

1282
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:29,567
Oh, okay.
All right, I'm sorry.

1283
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,033
You're right.

1284
01:26:36,633 --> 01:26:38,167
I just kind of wanna talk
about something.

1285
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:40,667
Why'd you bring me to a movie?
You don't talk in the movie.

1286
01:26:40,867 --> 01:26:42,100
Okay, let's go someplace.

1287
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,533
I don't wanna go someplace.

1288
01:26:59,834 --> 01:27:02,033
What it is, is...
What? What it is is what?

1289
01:27:04,767 --> 01:27:06,300
Well...

1290
01:27:07,967 --> 01:27:09,933
What it is...

1291
01:27:10,133 --> 01:27:13,200
I'm trying to organize
my life.

1292
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,033
You know what I mean?
I am, and I know you are...

1293
01:27:16,233 --> 01:27:19,900
Yeah. So?
So, I mean...

1294
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,333
Why don't we try
and do it together?

1295
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,833
I mean, you know, honestly,

1296
01:27:29,033 --> 01:27:31,000
this is not about sex
or anything.

1297
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,967
It's not about cooking.
I don't know what it's about.

1298
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:38,900
Wait. What the...?

1299
01:27:40,567 --> 01:27:42,033
Charlie!
What?

1300
01:27:42,233 --> 01:27:45,100
What? What the fuck
do you want me to do?

1301
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,100
If I stay home, I get high.

1302
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,934
If I come here,
I get steamrolled by you!

1303
01:27:48,134 --> 01:27:49,834
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

1304
01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:51,933
I'm getting out of here.
Why?

1305
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:54,033
None of your goddamn
business!

1306
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:55,533
Hey!

1307
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:04,834
Fuck.

1308
01:28:09,834 --> 01:28:11,367
It's been damn near a week.

1309
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:12,600
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just getting

1310
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,466
everything I need to say
on paper.

1311
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:16,333
Like you suggested.
It takes time.

1312
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:17,333
Not a week.

1313
01:28:17,533 --> 01:28:19,416
Do you want me
to drive you?

1314
01:28:19,616 --> 01:28:21,358
No. No, I'll... I'll go.

1315
01:28:21,558 --> 01:28:23,300
I'm going right now.

1316
01:28:32,033 --> 01:28:33,700
Hey.

1317
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,933
What are you doing here?

1318
01:28:36,133 --> 01:28:38,033
Well, I came to apologize.

1319
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:40,133
Will you just
leave me alone?

1320
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,233
Here. Let me give you a hand
on some of this.

1321
01:28:44,433 --> 01:28:46,133
I got it, I got it.

1322
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,183
Look, if I get a little
out of hand sometimes,

1323
01:28:48,383 --> 01:28:50,124
it's because...
Yeah, because you don't think

1324
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:51,866
about anybody but yourself.
What am I to do?

1325
01:28:52,066 --> 01:28:55,066
Say, "Fuck you" to a guy
I've been with 10 years?

1326
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,566
Look, what I'm trying
to say is...

1327
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:00,033
I know what
you're trying to say.

1328
01:29:00,233 --> 01:29:01,934
Here. Let me get this.
I...

1329
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:03,300
Look, I admit it.

1330
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,133
You know, I'm not functioning
great these days. I'm sorry.

1331
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:10,500
Uh, I don't know what for,
but I'm sorry.

1332
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:14,400
I just wanna see you again.
That's all.

1333
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,833
Come see where I live,
all right?

1334
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:19,700
There's no hot TVs,
no spools of telephone wire.

1335
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,333
What do you say?

1336
01:29:22,767 --> 01:29:24,500
You work tonight?

1337
01:29:30,467 --> 01:29:33,000
No, I'm off.

1338
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,100
Let me cook you dinner.

1339
01:29:37,734 --> 01:29:41,500
Call me, all right?
I'm in the book!

1340
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,767
I brought some tequila.

1341
01:30:46,467 --> 01:30:48,400
Nice touch.

1342
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,600
Eighteen, huh?

1343
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,367
Eighteen.

1344
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,600
Married,
pregnant and happy.

1345
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,333
I was.

1346
01:31:02,533 --> 01:31:06,233
I mean, that's the way life's
supposed to go, right?

1347
01:31:06,433 --> 01:31:10,133
Grade school, junior high,
high school, married, baby.

1348
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,467
All right.
So, what happened?

1349
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:16,300
The bump died.

1350
01:31:18,266 --> 01:31:19,367
We called it the bump.

1351
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:23,300
I was seven months
pregnant.

1352
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,934
I got real sick
and the bump died.

1353
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,866
And then Charlie left.

1354
01:31:31,066 --> 01:31:32,549
Charlie and Charlie.

1355
01:31:32,749 --> 01:31:34,233
Charlie and Charlene.

1356
01:31:34,433 --> 01:31:35,233
Oh.

1357
01:31:36,767 --> 01:31:39,367
We were a hell
of a couple.

1358
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:41,100
But he left.

1359
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:42,834
And that's
when I moved to Darby.

1360
01:31:44,033 --> 01:31:47,000
My uncle got me a job
in the steel mill.

1361
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,066
Six dollars an hour to start,
and that was '72.

1362
01:31:51,467 --> 01:31:52,834
So here I am.

1363
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,767
Here you are.

1364
01:32:05,467 --> 01:32:07,533
You want some more coffee
or something?

1365
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:12,734
I think I better go.

1366
01:32:12,934 --> 01:32:13,866
Why?

1367
01:32:14,066 --> 01:32:16,000
I told Lenny I was working.
So?

1368
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,934
So, what if he calls,
I'm not there?

1369
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:20,567
Live with me.

1370
01:32:22,066 --> 01:32:25,000
I can't.
Why not?

1371
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,967
I can't leave Lenny.
Why not?

1372
01:32:28,967 --> 01:32:32,217
Because...
Because why?

1373
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:35,467
Because it's not that easy.

1374
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:37,583
It is.
All you gotta do is want it.

1375
01:32:37,783 --> 01:32:39,700
Well, I don't know
if I want it.

1376
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,800
Well, you know,

1377
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:48,367
you deserve somebody
who cares about you.

1378
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:49,866
You know,
maybe it's not me.

1379
01:32:50,066 --> 01:32:51,467
I mean,
it might be somebody else,

1380
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:52,834
but it sure ain't Lenny.

1381
01:32:57,867 --> 01:32:59,066
I can't.

1382
01:33:00,467 --> 01:33:03,500
Yes, you can.
All you gotta do is tell him.

1383
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:04,500
Fuck it, I'll tell him.

1384
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,400
No! Hey, no.

1385
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,667
Hey, I'll tell him!

1386
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:19,333
I can't tell him.

1387
01:33:19,533 --> 01:33:21,233
Why?
Because you're afraid?

1388
01:33:21,433 --> 01:33:23,167
Don't be afraid.
Don't you get it?

1389
01:33:23,367 --> 01:33:25,550
You never gonna have to see
this guy again. Ever.

1390
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,734
I'll go to the house.
I'll get your stuff out.

1391
01:33:27,934 --> 01:33:30,266
He won't have to deal with you,
he'll have to deal with me.

1392
01:33:30,466 --> 01:33:31,500
Just tell him.

1393
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:38,834
You know what?
I've been writing this script

1394
01:33:39,034 --> 01:33:40,100
for myself

1395
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,900
for this thing
I got at work.

1396
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,200
Here.

1397
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,100
Let's write one for you.

1398
01:33:48,567 --> 01:33:50,167
Jesus.

1399
01:33:50,367 --> 01:33:53,233
You really buy
into all this shit, don't you?

1400
01:33:53,433 --> 01:33:55,900
Look, let's just try it,
okay?

1401
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,567
I mean, Christ,
let's just try it.

1402
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,800
Okay, here.

1403
01:34:11,233 --> 01:34:13,283
That's you and that's Lenny.

1404
01:34:13,483 --> 01:34:15,333
"I love you
for what we had,

1405
01:34:15,533 --> 01:34:16,967
but now my life
is a lot different."

1406
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:18,300
Give me a fucking break.

1407
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,734
Hey, you wanna write it?
Go ahead, put it in your words,

1408
01:34:20,934 --> 01:34:22,900
I don't care.
What's that?

1409
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,767
That's his probable response,
okay?

1410
01:34:24,967 --> 01:34:26,967
But if you stick to that,
you can't get confused.

1411
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:28,233
Oh, man.

1412
01:34:28,433 --> 01:34:30,934
Here.
You wanna tell him tonight?

1413
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:35,149
Listen, I'm here, okay?

1414
01:34:35,349 --> 01:34:37,166
And I wanna help you.

1415
01:35:03,066 --> 01:35:05,200
Lenny, hi.

1416
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,300
Yeah, it's me.
I'm still at work.

1417
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,667
Um, listen...

1418
01:35:10,867 --> 01:35:14,433
Listen, I got something
I wanna say to you, okay.

1419
01:35:14,633 --> 01:35:15,734
Yeah, okay.

1420
01:35:15,934 --> 01:35:18,700
Well, will you just listen
just for a second. I got some...

1421
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,100
Okay, just listen to this.

1422
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:26,066
Lenny, I've had lot of time
to think lately

1423
01:35:26,266 --> 01:35:28,033
and sort out my feelings

1424
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:30,000
and make some hard choices.

1425
01:35:38,834 --> 01:35:41,133
"Where are you,
you fucking douche bag?"

1426
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:43,400
I don't see that there.

1427
01:35:45,066 --> 01:35:46,666
"Get your ass home now,
bitch."

1428
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:48,267
Tell him
you're not gonna go home.

1429
01:35:48,467 --> 01:35:50,417
Tell him you not gonna do
anything, anything,

1430
01:35:50,617 --> 01:35:52,567
until he listens
to what you have to say.

1431
01:35:55,066 --> 01:35:56,066
Do it.

1432
01:35:59,066 --> 01:36:00,667
Lenny.

1433
01:36:08,367 --> 01:36:09,934
Uh...

1434
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,867
Uh-huh.

1435
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:18,934
All right.

1436
01:36:31,467 --> 01:36:33,066
Fuck.

1437
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,333
Charlie!

1438
01:36:59,333 --> 01:37:01,400
Hey!

1439
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,066
Daryl. Hey, look at you.

1440
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:05,033
Yeah, look at me.

1441
01:37:05,233 --> 01:37:06,433
You're back, fella.
Yeah, I'm back.

1442
01:37:06,633 --> 01:37:08,767
I'm back, I'm smoking
like a fucking chimney.

1443
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:11,266
I had to go to the can
every 10 minutes but I'm back.

1444
01:37:11,466 --> 01:37:14,366
What's it like up there?
Good. It's good.

1445
01:37:14,566 --> 01:37:17,467
Yeah?
I told Kramer you were laid up.

1446
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:19,366
Yeah, thanks,
I appreciate it.

1447
01:37:19,566 --> 01:37:21,066
No, man. It's nothing.
Really.

1448
01:37:21,266 --> 01:37:23,934
Uh, you're gonna have
to talk to him, Daryl.

1449
01:37:24,134 --> 01:37:26,367
I know. I know that.

1450
01:37:26,567 --> 01:37:29,533
What should I say? I mean,
what's the thinking in there?

1451
01:37:31,934 --> 01:37:33,900
Come on, Martin,
my ass is on the line here.

1452
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,834
I know that. I know that.

1453
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,233
Kramer's not a bad guy,
Daryl.

1454
01:37:40,433 --> 01:37:43,533
You know,
it'll be okay.

1455
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,634
It'll be okay.

1456
01:37:46,834 --> 01:37:48,033
They figure
they gonna fool him

1457
01:37:48,233 --> 01:37:50,467
and bring in the lead pipes
and bought all kinds of stuff.

1458
01:37:50,667 --> 01:37:53,233
He guesses them all.
Then they bring in this hooker.

1459
01:37:54,633 --> 01:37:57,500
I'm sorry,
there's a meeting here.

1460
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,166
Yeah, I know that.

1461
01:38:00,366 --> 01:38:01,200
Uh...

1462
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:06,767
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I, uh...

1463
01:38:08,433 --> 01:38:10,583
I think, uh, I should
kind of clear up

1464
01:38:10,783 --> 01:38:12,734
the situation
of the escrow account

1465
01:38:12,934 --> 01:38:15,050
before it really gets blown
out of proportion.

1466
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:17,367
But, you know, I can come back
at another time

1467
01:38:17,567 --> 01:38:18,633
if it'll be more convenient.

1468
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,467
No, Daryl. Not at all.

1469
01:38:20,667 --> 01:38:22,033
This is as good a time
as any.

1470
01:38:24,867 --> 01:38:29,000
Well, uh, here it is.
I, uh...

1471
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,033
I was just in the hospital
for a while and, uh...

1472
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:39,467
The best that I can
put it together is...

1473
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:41,133
What happened was, um...

1474
01:38:42,867 --> 01:38:45,600
I had one of the girls
do a telephone transfer for me.

1475
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,967
I wanted to consolidate
the 92,000

1476
01:38:48,167 --> 01:38:49,534
with another account.

1477
01:38:49,734 --> 01:38:54,467
And, uh, by mistake,
it was a stupid thing.

1478
01:38:54,667 --> 01:38:56,534
I accidentally gave her

1479
01:38:56,734 --> 01:39:00,133
my own personal
checking account number.

1480
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:01,167
And, uh...

1481
01:39:01,367 --> 01:39:02,983
Like I said,
I was laid up in the hospital,

1482
01:39:03,183 --> 01:39:04,800
and I really didn't know
what had happened

1483
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,400
until just a little
while ago.

1484
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,000
So you've corrected
the problem?

1485
01:39:09,667 --> 01:39:12,266
Yeah. Almost.

1486
01:39:12,466 --> 01:39:13,467
Almost?

1487
01:39:13,667 --> 01:39:16,700
Well, I owe the IRS
a couple of hundred dollars

1488
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,000
and they've frozen
my account.

1489
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,467
But as soon as I get a check,
everything will be fine.

1490
01:39:21,667 --> 01:39:23,100
Honestly.

1491
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,200
Did you take the money, Daryl?

1492
01:39:31,934 --> 01:39:34,166
Did you spend it, Daryl?

1493
01:39:35,867 --> 01:39:38,500
Did you have
an emergency?

1494
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,900
I put most of it
in the stock market.

1495
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,867
Why, Daryl?

1496
01:40:18,166 --> 01:40:19,800
I had a drug problem.

1497
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,583
And I went into a program
at a clinic.

1498
01:40:28,783 --> 01:40:32,467
And now I'm back
on my feet again.

1499
01:40:32,667 --> 01:40:33,567
Well, that's fine.

1500
01:40:33,767 --> 01:40:36,233
But we're still talking
about embezzlement here.

1501
01:40:36,433 --> 01:40:37,867
People go to jail
for that sort of thing.

1502
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:40,583
Fuck! You people...
Go to jail?

1503
01:40:40,783 --> 01:40:42,791
Hey!
Hank, we could go to jail...

1504
01:40:42,991 --> 01:40:45,000
All of us could go to jail,
man.

1505
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,167
On a lot of stuff.

1506
01:40:46,367 --> 01:40:48,500
Did you ever look at one
of this guy's appraisals.

1507
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:49,333
They're not that bad.

1508
01:40:49,533 --> 01:40:51,200
Oh, fuck you!
"Not that bad," man.

1509
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:54,283
This guy, this Vietnam vet,
this All-State athlete,

1510
01:40:54,483 --> 01:40:57,367
he gets 90 percent financing
on a $300,000 building

1511
01:40:57,567 --> 01:40:58,467
that's only worth 2.

1512
01:40:58,667 --> 01:41:00,417
Right?
Then he takes the extra cash

1513
01:41:00,617 --> 01:41:02,167
and he buys
an apartment complex.

1514
01:41:02,367 --> 01:41:05,067
Sells it for double, gives
the bank back their money,

1515
01:41:05,267 --> 01:41:07,967
and then takes what's left,
he puts into a company boat.

1516
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:10,867
Get the fuck out of here,
company boat.

1517
01:41:11,067 --> 01:41:13,333
How's the fishing, Ron?
Hank, Bob?

1518
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:14,834
Better
than the stock market.

1519
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,367
Yeah? Maybe.

1520
01:41:18,567 --> 01:41:20,967
I think we see your point,
Daryl.

1521
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:22,266
Look...

1522
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,834
I fucked up.

1523
01:41:28,867 --> 01:41:30,567
But, you know...

1524
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,567
Hey, you know,
take a look at my sales record.

1525
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,133
And I promise you
I'll pay you back

1526
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:43,066
you know,
out of my commissions.

1527
01:41:45,533 --> 01:41:47,567
Well, why don't you give us
a few minutes?

1528
01:41:49,533 --> 01:41:51,066
All right.

1529
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:53,867
Okay.

1530
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,500
Thanks.

1531
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Thank you.

1532
01:42:21,367 --> 01:42:22,767
Right away.

1533
01:42:22,967 --> 01:42:24,967
He sees this naked woman
standing in a window

1534
01:42:25,167 --> 01:42:27,333
looking down
and driving a car at night.

1535
01:42:27,533 --> 01:42:29,133
I'll tell you later.

1536
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,133
We've gone over everything,
Daryl.

1537
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:41,967
And we've decided to give you
a break on the embezzlement.

1538
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:44,033
So long
as you make restitution.

1539
01:42:44,233 --> 01:42:45,866
Thank you.

1540
01:42:46,066 --> 01:42:48,266
Thank you. Thanks.

1541
01:42:48,466 --> 01:42:49,100
However,

1542
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,833
we have no alternative

1543
01:42:51,033 --> 01:42:52,966
but to terminate you
as of today.

1544
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:55,467
We'll decide whether to report
you to the licensing board.

1545
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:56,700
Wait a minute.

1546
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:57,734
That's all, Daryl.

1547
01:42:57,934 --> 01:43:01,200
Whoa! Wait a minute!
Whoa!

1548
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,100
You guys know how many
properties I sold last quarter?

1549
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:06,233
Twenty-three.
Twenty-three properties.

1550
01:43:06,433 --> 01:43:07,066
Please tell security...

1551
01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:10,934
Me! By myself. For you, man!

1552
01:43:19,133 --> 01:43:22,200
Charlie,
you got a phone call!

1553
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,100
I don't know what happened.

1554
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,433
I don't know what I'm doing,
you know.

1555
01:43:43,834 --> 01:43:46,166
I don't know
why I called you.

1556
01:43:49,066 --> 01:43:51,200
I don't know
what I'm doing.

1557
01:43:59,633 --> 01:44:02,000
Listen,
I'm gonna take you home.

1558
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,800
I'll drop you off around
the corner from your house.

1559
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,900
No, no.
No, don't take me home.

1560
01:44:12,767 --> 01:44:16,400
I don't wanna talk about it.
Just drive the car.

1561
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,800
Just...

1562
01:44:49,467 --> 01:44:51,100
Oh, man.

1563
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:53,200
"Oh, man," what?

1564
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,300
Just, oh, man.

1565
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,033
Daryl,
I've been through a lot.

1566
01:45:31,233 --> 01:45:32,733
Yeah, I know. So have I.

1567
01:45:32,933 --> 01:45:34,433
I mean, really a lot.

1568
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,500
Are you attracted to me?

1569
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,166
Yeah.

1570
01:45:45,266 --> 01:45:46,867
You haven't been
through nothing yet.

1571
01:46:10,333 --> 01:46:12,200
Hey.

1572
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,233
Here's a thought.

1573
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,667
Why don't you
call in sick today?

1574
01:46:17,867 --> 01:46:20,933
Ha! You're not worth it, babe.

1575
01:46:21,133 --> 01:46:23,700
Someday, when you have a job,
you'll understand.

1576
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:24,700
Very funny.

1577
01:46:25,867 --> 01:46:27,450
I want you
to know something.

1578
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:29,233
I've had hundreds of offers.

1579
01:46:29,433 --> 01:46:30,367
Hundreds of them.

1580
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,767
Well, thousands even,
actually.

1581
01:46:36,734 --> 01:46:40,367
It's really gonna boil down
to who's got the best parking

1582
01:46:40,567 --> 01:46:43,033
and the nicest cafeteria.

1583
01:46:58,433 --> 01:46:59,900
Is this what you do
with Lenny?

1584
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:03,300
Maybe that's why I'm here.

1585
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:07,533
Flush it down the toilet.

1586
01:47:38,867 --> 01:47:41,400
Gonna be some happy rats
in the sewers tonight.

1587
01:47:49,867 --> 01:47:50,934
You gonna stay?

1588
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,467
Do you wanna stay?

1589
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,167
I don't know.

1590
01:48:00,367 --> 01:48:04,000
This is pretty much of a dump
you got here.

1591
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,534
Why don't you get a job,
you bum?

1592
01:48:06,734 --> 01:48:09,250
Uh, Daryl. D-A-R-Y-L.
Poynter, P-O-Y...

1593
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:11,967
Yeah, that's Poynter.
P-O-Y-N-T-E-R.

1594
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,433
That's a Y, not an I.

1595
01:48:16,633 --> 01:48:17,933
Poynter.
What does that mean?

1596
01:48:18,133 --> 01:48:20,700
It means, uh...
It means hard worker.

1597
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:23,033
Uh, 34. I was born in 1954.

1598
01:48:23,233 --> 01:48:25,266
April 3rd, 1955.

1599
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:27,300
Twenty-seven.

1600
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,133
Twenty-seven last month
as a matter of fact.

1601
01:48:29,333 --> 01:48:32,867
Yeah, well, the thing is I was
up to 47,500 in my last job.

1602
01:48:33,067 --> 01:48:35,066
So I couldn't possibly
take anything less than that.

1603
01:48:35,266 --> 01:48:36,167
Low 40s.

1604
01:48:36,367 --> 01:48:37,967
You know, that ballpark.

1605
01:48:38,167 --> 01:48:39,767
I'm flexible, I guess.

1606
01:48:39,967 --> 01:48:42,534
Money? Salary?

1607
01:48:42,734 --> 01:48:45,266
I don't know. It isn't really
the main consideration for me.

I'm sorry.

1616
01:49:19,533 --> 01:49:23,133
If I did stuff
to make it hard for you

1617
01:49:25,533 --> 01:49:28,533
it's only because
I was having problems too.

1618
01:49:28,733 --> 01:49:30,700
You always have problems.

1619
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:32,233
I know.

1620
01:49:32,433 --> 01:49:35,149
I always have problems.

1621
01:49:35,349 --> 01:49:38,066
I do always have problems.

1622
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:46,133
But if you're not around,

1623
01:49:48,266 --> 01:49:50,633
I don't make it at all.

1624
01:50:04,867 --> 01:50:07,433
Somebody wanna to tell me
what's happening here?

1625
01:50:09,567 --> 01:50:11,500
Nothing.
Nothing's happening here.

1626
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:12,867
Really?

1627
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,633
I'd like him to leave.

1628
01:50:21,967 --> 01:50:23,133
Fuck you.

1629
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,400
Fuck me?

1630
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,833
Fuck me? No, no, fuck you!

1631
01:50:28,033 --> 01:50:29,967
You're in my house now,
asshole.

1632
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:31,400
So get the fuck out!

1633
01:51:19,266 --> 01:51:21,100
Where are you going?
You don't need me, Daryl.

1634
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:22,566
Whoa, whoa,
where do this come from?

1635
01:51:22,766 --> 01:51:24,033
Look around you.
Look at all you've got.

1636
01:51:24,233 --> 01:51:25,200
Your plates match.

1637
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:26,766
You don't drink
out of jelly jars.

1638
01:51:26,966 --> 01:51:28,199
Wanna say something,
you sit down

1639
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:29,633
and you figure out
how to say it.

1640
01:51:29,833 --> 01:51:30,800
You cut your goddamn grass!

1641
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,700
What the hell
do you need me for?

1642
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:35,567
What do you mean?
I do need you! And you need me!

1643
01:51:35,767 --> 01:51:37,100
Wait, didn't you see this
coming to you?

1644
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,033
He's gonna do this, come back
and work you like this again.

1645
01:51:40,233 --> 01:51:41,033
What are you gonna do now?

1646
01:51:41,233 --> 01:51:42,800
Go home and light
his fucking pipe for him,

1647
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,916
let him snort coke
off your tits?

1648
01:51:45,116 --> 01:51:47,033
What part of him
you gonna snort off?

1649
01:51:56,667 --> 01:51:58,066
Bye.

1650
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:26,233
Yeah?

1651
01:52:26,433 --> 01:52:28,667
Hi. Hey, listen,
I think I've got something.

1652
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:31,300
I mean, you know, it's gonna
take some negotiating.

1653
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:40,133
Daryl,
don't call me anymore.

1654
01:53:00,433 --> 01:53:02,367
Six, nineteen to go
in the half.

1655
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:03,500
WIT in Philadelphia

1656
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,834
as the Eagles
leave the Cowboys.

1657
01:53:12,133 --> 01:53:13,600
Hello?

1658
01:53:14,767 --> 01:53:17,900
No, she's not home
right now.

1659
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,600
Who's this?

1660
01:53:26,734 --> 01:53:28,033
Who was that?

1661
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:39,700
Where are you going?

1662
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:42,734
Cigarettes.
I need cigarettes.

1663
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,500
Hello?

1664
01:55:32,133 --> 01:55:34,233
I know what you're thinking,
Daryl.

1665
01:55:34,433 --> 01:55:38,533
You're thinking you could've
done something for her, right?

1666
01:55:38,733 --> 01:55:41,267
That it's your fault, right?

1667
01:55:41,467 --> 01:55:44,933
You can give up
on yourself now, right?

1668
01:55:45,133 --> 01:55:48,367
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it, Daryl?

1669
01:55:48,567 --> 01:55:50,767
But you've gotta understand.

1670
01:55:50,967 --> 01:55:54,167
That's absolutely conceited,
Daryl.

1671
01:55:54,367 --> 01:55:57,567
It's self-important
and conceited.

1672
01:55:59,233 --> 01:56:00,333
Are you getting this?

1673
01:56:00,533 --> 01:56:01,866
It's important.

1674
01:56:02,066 --> 01:56:03,767
Because a guy who thinks

1675
01:56:03,967 --> 01:56:06,516
he can control
somebody else's addiction

1676
01:56:06,716 --> 01:56:09,266
needs to know how overblown
his thinking is.

1677
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,633
Could anybody make you stop,
Daryl?

1678
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:16,133
No, sir.

1679
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:18,834
Nobody but you can.

1680
01:56:19,034 --> 01:56:20,400
Not me.

1681
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:21,967
Nobody.

1682
01:56:28,467 --> 01:56:30,367
Sorry.

1683
01:56:30,567 --> 01:56:32,600
Maybe we ought to go inside,
Daryl.

1684
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,700
We're in the line of fire.

1685
01:56:45,033 --> 01:56:47,266
About a month ago...

1686
01:56:48,767 --> 01:56:52,050
I had a few problems.

1687
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:55,333
And, um, I figured

1688
01:56:55,533 --> 01:56:58,266
the only way to deal
with these problems

1689
01:56:59,266 --> 01:57:01,400
was to, uh, disappear.

1690
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:07,266
One of the problems
was I didn't have any money.

1691
01:57:07,466 --> 01:57:09,567
So I asked myself,

1692
01:57:09,767 --> 01:57:14,900
where could a guy go
to be totally anonymous

1693
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:17,567
and get somebody else
to pay for it?

1694
01:57:19,367 --> 01:57:23,233
Well, the answer I came up with
was pretty brilliant.

1695
01:57:23,433 --> 01:57:27,100
I, uh...
I figured what I would do

1696
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:30,467
would be I check myself
into a drug clinic.

1697
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:37,634
And the only trick

1698
01:57:37,834 --> 01:57:40,734
was I had to convince
the people in the drug clinic

1699
01:57:40,934 --> 01:57:42,500
that I was an addict.

1700
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:53,066
So I sat in front of the place
in my car.

1701
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:58,467
And, uh,
I had a couple beers.

1702
01:58:02,967 --> 01:58:05,683
And I figured out
all the language

1703
01:58:05,883 --> 01:58:08,400
and all the gestures
and moves

1704
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:12,667
so I could give this really
convincing performance.

1705
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:19,166
And, uh, somehow, I did.

1706
01:58:22,166 --> 01:58:24,600
And you, fools, bought it.

1707
01:58:30,266 --> 01:58:36,600
And now it's 30 days later
and, um...

1708
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,400
I've been to a funeral,

1709
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:53,633
I've been throughout
nine million job interviews.

1710
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:58,233
I'm $52,000 in debt.

1711
01:59:02,367 --> 01:59:04,600
And I got this chip...

1712
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,300
I got this chip.

1713
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:18,533
And I got this
startling belief

1714
01:59:18,733 --> 01:59:19,967
that...

1715
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:23,200
Uh...

1716
01:59:24,734 --> 01:59:28,633
That I'm an alcoholic
and a drug addict.

1717
01:59:35,934 --> 01:59:39,117
God knows what we got going
next month.

1718
01:59:39,317 --> 01:59:42,500
But if it's anything like this
last one,

1719
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:44,200
Jesus Christ.

1720
01:59:49,066 --> 01:59:53,166
So here we go and thank you.

1721
01:59:53,366 --> 01:59:55,416
And thanks for my chip.

1722
01:59:55,616 --> 01:59:57,667
And thanks for not smoking.
