1
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,3day
IF OUR GODS AND OUR HOPES ARE
NOTHING BUT SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENA,

2
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,233
THEN LET US ADMIT IT MUST BE SAID
THAT OUR LOVE IS SCIENTIFIC AS WELL

3
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,443
- TOMORROW'S EVE, 1886

4
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,036
OBSERVATION

5
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,500
What's the situation?

6
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,086
52 minutes ago, in the flat
where the first offence took place,

7
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,630
the owner was killed
and the suspect fled.

8
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:55,093
At the second crime scene,
two policemen were killed.

9
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,345
All entrances and exits are blocked.

10
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,847
We're storming the place in two minutes.

11
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,770
Damned Section 9 cyborg.

12
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:10,233
No matter how many lives they take,
it's never enough.

13
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,319
The telecoms people want to intervene.

14
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,571
I requested a data link.

15
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,199
First the security services, then telecoms.

16
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,201
Muddying themselves one by one.

17
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,217
Help me.

18
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:09,175
There have been eight
gynoid murders this week.

19
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,928
They self-destructed after killing
the victim and initialized the computer.

20
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:19,185
The gynoids are all of type 2052
made by Rox.

21
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,523
They're all mass-produced
evaluation copies provided for free.

22
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,359
They have now all been recalled.

23
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:33,741
According to the latest reports received
the machines and software...

24
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,255
I suppose you heard.

25
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:53,344
A new type of gynoid attacked
their owners for no apparent reason.

26
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,930
The manufacturer panicked
and recalled them.

27
00:09:56,055 --> 00:10:00,267
Long civil suits will be brought
by the victims' families.

28
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:05,731
I understand that this is why
Section 9 was called in.

29
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,233
Do you understand?

30
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:12,530
Understanding is something we aspire to.

31
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,242
Section 9 has intervened
for two reasons.

32
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,912
First, not one lawsuit
has been brought by relatives.

33
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,875
Rox Sol has settled out of court in all cases.

34
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,879
Second, one victim is a politician,

35
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,424
one is a retired public safety official.

36
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,348
It's part of our job to assess
whether or not it was terrorism.

37
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,935
Ishikawa and Azuma
will follow the trails of the victims.

38
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,688
You guys, check the gynoids concerned.

39
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,650
Don't ask questions. Just go.

40
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,083
Let me tell you,
I didn't ask for this assignment.

41
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,005
I'm a rookie compared to the Major.

42
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,507
That's not the issue.

43
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:17,052
She's still considered
a missing person, I hear.

44
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:27,188
All she ever had
was her brain and her ghost.

45
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:30,441
That was her entire existence.

46
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,320
Her body and computer
were government parts.

47
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:39,575
Her memories, including classified
material, were government property.

48
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,037
The top brass
want to recover that memory.

49
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:47,041
They don't care whether she lives or dies.

50
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,587
Where shall we begin?

51
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,841
Rox is far to the north.
They're a northern manufacturer.

52
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,928
Let's be straightforward
and begin with the firm.

53
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,504
Why are you here?

54
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,507
It's about the gynoids destroyed yesterday.

55
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:39,468
Two of our young staff were also killed.

56
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,012
They didn't take the gynoids home.

57
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,641
That is included in our investigation.

58
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,773
It's on the 19th floor,
to the right at the end of the corridor.

59
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:57,444
- Shall I show you the way?
- No, I'm not here for a tour.

60
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:02,700
"Even a crow wouldn't touch fruit
if it's not ripe."

61
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,328
You only come when you need me.

62
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,973
When you were a detective,

63
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:32,104
were you hurt by some big guys?

64
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:36,567
That's why I don't like seeing my old self.

65
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,905
If your face is disfigured,
don't blame the mirror.

66
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:47,202
The mirror leads not to the land
of enlightenment but to confusion.

67
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:52,041
You don't have the face of somebody
who gets lost in a mirror.

68
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:37,961
Come as many time as you like.
I said I won't cooperate.

69
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:41,548
I'll have you locked up if you're too pushy.

70
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,343
I'm Togusa from Section 9.

71
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,053
Who's this scary character?

72
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,515
The guy who shot this girl to pieces.

73
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:55,979
Restoration would be easier if
he'd used a 50 caliber hollow point.

74
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,821
They killed three. Two of them were cops.

75
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:07,408
She tried to commit suicide
before she was shot.

76
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,929
What do you mean by suicide, Ms...?

77
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,849
- Haraway.
- Ms. Haraway.

78
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,226
How does a robot commit suicide?

79
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,858
Gynoids can break down and allow
themselves to attack humans.

80
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:46,864
As a logical conclusion, however,
Ethical Code 3 prohibits it.

81
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:51,743
Once they harm humans,
they lose the will to self-preservation.

82
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:55,581
I think the precise term for it
is self-destruction.

83
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,629
If you wish, you can consider the
human-machine distinction axiomatic.

84
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,049
Is suicide specific to that model?

85
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,552
Not exactly.

86
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:13,599
For years, robot making
has been done in a hurry.

87
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,310
It's terrible.

88
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,397
- What's the cause?
- Well...

89
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,108
E-brain failure due to viruses and microbes,

90
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:28,322
human error during the manufacturing
process, old parts.

91
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,200
- There are plenty of causes.
- But?

92
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:37,164
As I see it,
it's because humans discard robots.

93
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,417
They're constantly buying new models.

94
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,753
The scrapped ones become vagrants.

95
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:46,465
Left without maintenance they degenerate.

96
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,012
Robots want humans not to use them
and then dispose of them.

97
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,598
I don't believe it.

98
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,810
Humans and robots are different.

99
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:06,026
But the difference between the species
is not black and white.

100
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,659
Industrial robots are different.

101
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:19,998
But androids and gynoids exist for
utilitarian and pragmatic purposes.

102
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:28,340
Why are they made in human form
and with perfect human bodies?

103
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:34,846
Why do human beings want to make
them in their own image?

104
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,115
- Do you have children?
- One daughter.

105
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,868
Children always deviate from human norms.

106
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:03,333
If you define a human being
as an autonomous self acting out its will.

107
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:08,005
Where are children in the gradation
of human existence?

108
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,385
Their inner state of being obviously
differs, but they have human form.

109
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,850
When girls play with dolls,
it's not practice for actual motherhood.

110
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,937
They're not practicing childcare.

111
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:29,151
Games played with dolls and childcare
may, however, be similar.

112
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,695
What are you talking about?

113
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,490
Raising a child used to be
the only method of realizing

114
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:39,703
the ancient dream
of making an artificial human being.

115
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:45,125
- I'm just posing that question.
- Children are not puppets!

116
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,793
Human and machines.

117
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,505
If you don't distinguish between
the biological and non-biological.

118
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:55,135
I made a doll to look like my
daughter Francine, who died at five,

119
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,972
and we could meet.
That happened.

120
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,395
Isn't it time to talk about something real?

121
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,527
I'd like to hear your views on
Rox robot model 2052.

122
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,783
Well, it's well made.

123
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:22,746
Its body is fine workmanship,
but it's a prototype.

124
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,289
A prototype?

125
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,834
The finished types
have some unnecessary parts.

126
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,628
And that means?

127
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,132
Sexual functions.

128
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:38,470
It's not to my liking, but it's not illegal.

129
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,891
I see. That's why the bereaved
families withdrew from mourning.

130
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,520
The e-brain is initialized.

131
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:51,608
This is in order for the manufacturer
to protect their software.

132
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,653
- But...
- But what?

133
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:58,073
There's a file left in the buffer. I'll play it.

134
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,455
Help me. Help me.

135
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,417
Help me. Help me.

136
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:12,546
Help me. Help me. Help me.

137
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:18,635
Help me. Help me. Help me.

138
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,846
Help...

139
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,607
- Thanks for everything.
- Hey!

140
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,614
Sorry to ask you a personal question...

141
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,661
I've never given birth or raised children.

142
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:48,290
I haven't registered my eggs
for donation either.

143
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,751
Thank you, Miss...

144
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:54,129
Haraway. You don't need to call me
Miss or Mrs.

145
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,478
She didn't seem like a technologist.

146
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:13,315
The type who writes her thoughts
in reports. I've done that.

147
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,400
It's delayed our investigation.

148
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:19,446
The gynoids brain should
be checked in Section 9's lab.

149
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,823
So we won't see the old lady again.

150
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,283
Is she your type?

151
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,494
I like older women.

152
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,164
We'll follow the routine.

153
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,707
09 to 907.

154
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:37,756
Incident. The victim is an inspector...

155
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,091
901, got it.

156
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:46,264
- Well, well.
- Spring is short lived.

157
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,031
What's up? Are you here alone?

158
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:08,203
Kogawa and Tsuwa went to have dinner.

159
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,163
Lazy sods.

160
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,378
This is the situation 22 minutes ago.

161
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,097
Did they give this job to rookies?

162
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,724
It's all part of their training.

163
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,601
I'll check the situation.

164
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:38,567
The victim's e-brain is that
of Rox director Jack Walkson, 54.

165
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:43,238
He applied for leave a few days ago
and disappeared.

166
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:50,120
This place was rented on a three-week
contract three days ago.

167
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:54,165
We've checked local parking records.

168
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,254
We're checking connections
to organized crime.

169
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:07,220
Seven cards were found in what's
believed to be the victim's coat.

170
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,662
Look at that. A 38 caliber S&W.

171
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,625
Doesn't seem to have been used.

172
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,003
It may not have been much use anyway.

173
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:44,925
The assailant may have been
a professional.

174
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:50,180
We'll be arriving
at the crime scene... Don't touch...

175
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,515
I haven't touched anything.

176
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,478
We'll leave the rest to you.

177
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:00,482
907 to 90. Leave the site to 960.

178
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:09,824
- It's my daughter's birthday today.
- Her day of birth.

179
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,994
- I'll give you a lift there.
- I'm going the other way. lshikawa?

180
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,579
So am I.

181
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,582
His daughter's birthday is important.

182
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,668
This looks like good fun.

183
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,128
You're being uncharacteristically direct.

184
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,631
I've come to find the missing parts.

185
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,133
Take your time.

186
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,135
Why don't you let the local police handle it?

187
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,180
Because that guy's involved in it.

188
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,684
I found something
in containers in the fridge.

189
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,145
Heart, liver, kidneys, pancreas.

190
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,147
What a bastard.

191
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,542
Do you buy fresh dog food?
The dry stuff lasts for half a year.

192
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,752
Yeah, but it's inedible.

193
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:15,724
- You've become Togusa's partner, I hear.
- It's better than working with a rookie.

194
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,728
I have no complaints against him.

195
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:25,233
Only the Major was a good enough partner
for you, right?

196
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:33,575
- Eh?
- lshikawa, you talk too much lately.

197
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:04,064
- Well then, Batou...
- What is it?

198
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,733
You're right. I'll try dry dog food.

199
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:11,029
In terms of nutritional balance,
it's the wiser choice.

200
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,303
Death was caused by a blow
to the cervical vertebrae.

201
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:08,433
The kitchen implements were used for
dismemberment, not for the murder.

202
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,979
- Was he butchered after the murder?
- Yes.

203
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,066
The organs in the refrigerator
belonged to the victim.

204
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:22,030
He had gastritis and cirrhosis.
He was probably an alcoholic.

205
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,490
Why was he so meticulously cut up?

206
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,493
The perpetrator could be
psychologically abnormal.

207
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,997
Or a strong desire for revenge, perhaps.

208
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:34,542
In that case,
it wasn't a professional killer.

209
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,919
What about the twisted door handle?

210
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,671
The analysis results.

211
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:42,425
The artificial limb
is a Chinese-made MR26.

212
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,010
It's like crab pincers.

213
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:47,805
Isn't it a military model?
They're on the black market.

214
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,392
There are also images of
the shredded neck.

215
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,896
Any criminal records on the car?

216
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:59,859
- It's been difficult to find out...
- Just give me the conclusion.

217
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:04,280
According to the car park records,

218
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,867
the vehicle belongs to a criminal gang.

219
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:14,332
The bullet-proof chassis has been
involved in past criminal activities.

220
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,709
It's cyborgs who did it.

221
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:21,005
Criminals need to be cautious.
ls it a Yakuza gang?

222
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,800
What's the motive?
Who are this gang?

223
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:28,805
They come from an old Japanese gang.
Drugs, prostitution, tobacco.

224
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,765
They do everything that the Yakuza do.

225
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:37,438
Wakabayashi killed lnoue
three days ago and became leader.

226
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,648
Of course.

227
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:41,859
Eliminating your predecessor is
the absolute condition of control.

228
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,945
There's just one question.

229
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,076
If the victim expected to die,
why was he hiding from the gang?

230
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:54,539
The data in his e-brain is gone.
We can only conjecture.

231
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,583
In any case, this falls under our jurisdiction.

232
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,170
How about terrorist groups
using out of control robots?

233
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:05,007
At present no links
with political groups are known.

234
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,509
That line of investigation is weak.

235
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,307
Batou and Togusa
will conduct the operation.

236
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,935
The rest of you,
continue what you were working on.

237
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,395
Dismissed.

238
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,065
Togusa.

239
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,237
Come to my office before you go.

240
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:35,788
How is it going?

241
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,751
We have to find the link between
the gang and the Rox Corporation.

242
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,004
I'm talking about Batou.

243
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:48,050
Thorough psychological assessment
is part of the debriefing.

244
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:52,054
Yes, but I'm not a cyborg.
I don't have an e-brain.

245
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,184
You don't need to be Caesar
to understand Caesar.

246
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:00,938
You're a family man.
Do you feel happy at present?

247
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,398
Well, yes.

248
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:06,611
Most people are neither happy nor unhappy.

249
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:11,365
What's important is that they don't
lose hope and the will to live.

250
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,659
What do you mean?

251
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:18,956
When I see him lately, it reminds me
of the Major before she vanished.

252
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,586
Solitude breeds evil

253
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:26,756
It demands only little

254
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,592
Like an elephant in the woods

255
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,439
Director, why did you choose me?

256
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:47,735
The Major had you transferred.

257
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,034
What did he say?

258
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,497
Apparently, you don't need to be
Caesar to understand Caesar.

259
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:05,169
That's right. The world can't live
at the level of great men.

260
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,638
Are you planning to start a war?

261
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:20,351
You don't need to become a Yakuza
to visit them, but you need guns.

262
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:24,063
- I want to check something before we go.
- What?

263
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:27,984
- We're just going to talk, right?
- Don't you like Yakuza?

264
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,986
- I hate them.
- Me too.

265
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:34,824
- We're just going to talk to them?
- I told you. To go to the Yakuza...

266
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:38,953
...you don't need to become Yakuza.
But you said you needed guns.

267
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,123
- I have a family.
- I can go on my own.

268
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,542
I'll come with you. We're partners.

269
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,085
Promise me.

270
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:50,548
We're just going to talk.
We'll avoid shooting as far as possible.

271
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:53,217
- Fine.
- Let's go, then.

272
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,651
Who are you?

273
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:15,489
We want to talk to Wakabayashi.
Get him.

274
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,087
You said you'd avoid shooting.

275
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,507
I did, as far as it was possible.

276
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:36,052
Be ready. Reinforcements are coming.

277
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,871
Come on. ls he trying to trick us?

278
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,466
I hate these incomplete e-brains.

279
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:33,943
What's up?

280
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:37,071
It's dark and narrow.
How shall we advance?

281
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:41,325
- Do it quickly. I'll go first.
- I'll go.

282
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,870
You're too big to be in front.
I can't back you up.

283
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,492
Your little present
exploded above your head.

284
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,496
Even if you achieved maximum impact,

285
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:32,126
you can't kill a big cyborg in
body armor with just two grenades.

286
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,128
Scared?

287
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,262
I don't just want to know about the murders.

288
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:46,557
What are your links with Rox Sol?

289
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,321
Just what you'd expect.

290
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,166
Come on, crab boy, I'll fight you.

291
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,448
You're no match for me, you fool.

292
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:04,969
I'll tell you where the head of the section is.
Let's make peace.

293
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:10,140
I've just come back
from a three-year sentence.

294
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,894
I don't know what they were doing
with that company.

295
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:17,273
Are you alive, partner?

296
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:21,861
My mind is full of images
of my daughter's face.

297
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:28,242
It's neither your wife nor your daughter
you're seeing. It's death.

298
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,329
I ordered you to investigate.

299
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:36,041
I did not say abandon procedure
and step outside the law.

300
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:40,337
I don't remember ordering you
to attack a Yakuza office.

301
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:46,302
This is not the jungle, and you're
not special forces assassins.

302
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:52,474
- Still angry?
- I'm not angry.

303
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,896
But I'm reluctant to thank you
for saving my life.

304
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:05,112
Being your partner it's not enough
no matter how many lives you have.

305
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:10,492
We're an investigation team,
just the two of us.

306
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:15,789
If there's anything fishy about Rox,
we'll find it out.

307
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:17,666
So you did it on purpose?

308
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:22,963
If the boss is really angry,
we'd both have been fired by now.

309
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,506
Stop just there.

310
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:44,944
See you.

311
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:27,653
You've stepped into a killing zone.

312
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:41,120
Don't reset the right arm yourself.

313
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:45,457
The operating system upgrade
interferes with the control software

314
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:48,127
and there have been cases of malfunction.

315
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:50,629
I'll ask you to initialize me then.

316
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:54,049
By the way, where are my original parts?

317
00:43:54,174 --> 00:44:00,264
Don't worry about it.
That hand is adapted to your DNA.

318
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:04,560
Using it will make me my original self.

319
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,940
Ouch! Stop it!

320
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:21,535
- Why has he come with you?
- I went to your house.

321
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:28,167
I felt bad seeing him hungry
and waiting for his master.

322
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:30,627
I see you're kind to animals.

323
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,046
I had the dog for one night.

324
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:36,925
My daughter was overjoyed. My wife
got angry when he crapped on the carpet.

325
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,595
How long have you had me
under surveillance?

326
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,433
- It's nothing.
- No, it's not. Being manipulated.

327
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,810
You're to blame for not noticing.

328
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,729
If you're angry, be angry with the boss.

329
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:54,276
Is it a clone? Originals are expensive.

330
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:58,947
It's one of the original test tube-bred ones.

331
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:02,451
I can't imagine it having an e-brain.

332
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:05,954
It doesn't fall into the trap
because its life is stable.

333
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,123
I told you to get dry dog food.

334
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:13,128
He likes the stuff I buy,
and they only sell it in that shop.

335
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:18,592
You shocked everybody
and started a big fight.

336
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,929
You almost killed the shopkeeper.

337
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:26,850
He's not insane, and nobody
can hack into his systems.

338
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,145
Except for the Major.

339
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,233
Why didn't I blow my own head off?

340
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:38,820
The objective was not your death
but to cause a scandal.

341
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:43,951
You sent dozens of Yakuza
to heaven or hospital.

342
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:47,579
You ran amok on the same day
in a food shop.

343
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:52,834
Don't be surprised
if people think you've gone mad.

344
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,674
Hey, wait. The attack proves
that this was no accident.

345
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:03,762
Section 9's raison d'étre will disappear.
There's no doubt.

346
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,514
A message from the boss.

347
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:10,143
"Continue the investigation,
but if you find no evidence,

348
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:12,354
"you have no official backing."

349
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:15,691
We can only go directly to Rox.

350
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:18,026
Speed is of the essence.

351
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:21,238
- Go to the North straightaway.
- The North?

352
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:24,950
- Are two people not enough?
- But what about the dog?

353
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:30,122
A single man should not keep a dog.

354
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:34,251
Especially one that needs lots of care.

355
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,336
Do something about it!

356
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:40,359
It's the biggest information city
in the Far East.

357
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:43,320
The Etorofu Special Economic Zone.

358
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,616
It's become this giant tombstone,

359
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:54,539
a haven for corporate criminals.

360
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:59,753
It's become a lawless zone
beyond UN and ASEAN authority.

361
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:07,344
I'm thinking that what an individual
creates is genetically encoded.

362
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:10,931
You mean beaver dams
and spider's webs, don't you?

363
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:16,978
I'm thinking about coral reefs.
Well, it's not quite as beautiful.

364
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:22,651
The essence of existence is the
genetic transmission of information.

365
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:26,321
Society and culture are just
enormous memory storage systems.

366
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:29,408
Cities are huge external memory devices.

367
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:36,665
They're innumerable.
More than there are grains of sand.

368
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:41,169
Old Testament,
Book of Psalms, Psalm 139.

369
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:43,922
If you suddenly come out
with things like that,

370
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:48,176
your external memory is a little strange.

371
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,804
I don't want to hear that from you.

372
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:57,394
You'll be landing at Rox HQ shortly.

373
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,569
We've completed the approach.
We're commencing landing.

374
00:49:49,196 --> 00:49:51,823
He falls like autumn leaves

375
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:54,451
The chaos come to fruition bellows

376
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,578
ls it Milton now?

377
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,206
But we're not Satan.

378
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:53,440
Batou.

379
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:03,491
Who taught you
to address me by first name?

380
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:05,952
I haven't forgotten what you did for me.

381
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:09,330
The less you forget,
the more you remember.

382
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:11,583
Forgive me, Batou. Mr. Batou.

383
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:14,127
You're not entitled to call me Mr. Batou.

384
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:17,505
I beg your pardon. Please forgive me.

385
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,384
- Do you know a guy called Kim?
- I don't know the guy.

386
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:24,554
This city is full of people called Kim.

387
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:27,557
The Kim I'm looking for is unique.

388
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,893
Even in my trade, there is loyalty.

389
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:34,230
There are two kinds of loyalty.
Keeping secrets or integrity.

390
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:37,692
Where does your loyalty lie?

391
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,153
They also say that there is
no truth without secrets.

392
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:43,114
I'll ask you again.
Do you know that bastard Kim?

393
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,576
I don't know him!
I don't know anybody of that name.

394
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:51,998
People are like puppets

395
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:56,169
They perish in a flash

396
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,400
So?

397
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:03,236
He was a long-distance scout in the army.

398
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:07,073
He couldn't bear having people
above or below him.

399
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:13,538
He went from special forces
to electronic warfare.

400
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:17,709
He made a career for himself
as an arms dealer.

401
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:21,212
Eventually, he became a common hacker.

402
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:24,549
What a CV.

403
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:29,053
A donkey does not return
from his travels a horse.

404
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:33,725
He destroyed everything around him,
the fool.

405
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,852
Shall we go?

406
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:28,191
Batou, this is the study.

407
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:48,795
We were too late.

408
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,840
The brain must have been taken
to sell on the black market.

409
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:56,677
Whatever the case, he was not useful.

410
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:09,899
According to the testament,
there shall be no flowers at the funeral.

411
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:17,198
Hey!

412
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:19,367
Don't act like a corpse.

413
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:23,162
Master Confucius taught us
not to sleep like dead men.

414
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:27,667
I don't have time for your silly games.

415
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:51,732
It's a long time since we've met.

416
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:53,734
I'm here on business.

417
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,820
Something to do with Rox?

418
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:58,072
They began late as robot manufacturers.

419
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:01,701
They expanded rapidly
after concentrating on the development

420
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:04,078
and sale of high-specification gynoids.

421
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:09,292
Politicians, senior civil servants
and crime syndicates became involved.

422
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:15,339
Hearing rumors of State intervention,

423
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:21,179
production lines have been relocated
to an offshore factory ship.

424
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:25,850
The androids made there are very good.

425
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:30,146
So good that they kill people
and commit suicide?

426
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:33,691
If that's true, it's terrible.

427
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:52,168
I don't know if they want to make
puppets with human souls.

428
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:57,506
A beautiful puppet is just soulless flesh.

429
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:01,510
Confronted with physical decay,

430
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:04,138
a corpse can continue living in that way.

431
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,516
Degraded to a cripple with an e-brain.

432
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:09,018
Is that the reason?

433
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:16,651
Puppets cannot attain the beauty of
human shape, movement and existence.

434
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:22,156
Imperfect human cognition cannot
grasp its own incomplete nature.

435
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:27,245
The imperfection
can have no consciousness

436
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,497
or boundless consciousness.

437
01:02:29,622 --> 01:02:34,085
In other words, only robots or gods
can realize that cognition.

438
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:37,004
Shouldn't we talk business?

439
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:43,594
Only one other form of existence
comes close to gods or robots.

440
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,513
Animals?

441
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:47,640
The skylark has something...

442
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:52,895
creatures with strong
self-consciousness cannot perceive.

443
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:56,983
It lives happily in profound
lack of consciousness.

444
01:02:57,108 --> 01:03:00,903
To become like the birds,
who live on the fruit of the trees,

445
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:04,699
is even harder than attaining divinity.

446
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:10,288
Having no other method, you entered
a puppet and feigned death.

447
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:15,167
Confucius also says few people
know life and death.

448
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:21,132
Humans who understand death are rare.

449
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:34,353
Most people are not prepared.

450
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:37,148
They have to bear stupidity and habit.

451
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:41,777
People die because they
are not conscious of death.

452
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:46,824
The soulless puppet takes death
as a given and lives.

453
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:51,078
Kim chose to become completely artificial.
That's the reason.

454
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:52,413
And then?

455
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:56,792
He went from special forces
to electronic warfare.

456
01:03:56,917 --> 01:04:00,755
He went into the arms trade
and his career took off.

457
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,549
Eventually, he became a common hacker.

458
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,468
What a CV.

459
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:10,890
A donkey does not return
from his travels a horse.

460
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,852
All right? Let's go.

461
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:25,089
Batou.

462
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:53,242
I salute those who are to die today.

463
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:00,958
Hey!

464
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:19,268
I feel uncomfortable.

465
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,645
I understand that.

466
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:32,781
If it looks alive,

467
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:35,784
you wonder if it really is alive.

468
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:41,582
And you wonder if a lifeless thing is alive.

469
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:46,295
Where does the sensation of pain
come from?

470
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,923
Robots are made by human beings.

471
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:52,551
Their bodies were made by humans.

472
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:59,642
They fear being casually
turned off by humans.

473
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:03,062
In other words, they fear
that their human appearance

474
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:07,525
obscures the main question.

475
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,444
Shut up, let's talk business.

476
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,740
Science tried to reveal
the secrets of existence.

477
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:18,744
Science created the terror we feel.

478
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:23,082
Belief in evolution leads to
the conclusion that human parts

479
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:27,336
can be replaced by artificial ones.

480
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,798
The body has
a self-winding spring mechanism.

481
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:33,509
It's in perpetual motion.

482
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:40,391
18th century robotics introduced
the mind-body dualism.

483
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:44,979
When computers made memory storage
outside the body possible,

484
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:48,899
human biological evolutionary
potential broadened.

485
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:52,486
Humanity actively continued mechanizing.

486
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:56,031
They transcended Darwinian
natural selection.

487
01:07:56,156 --> 01:08:01,412
By their own power
they manifested their will.

488
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:05,499
They expressed a will to overcome nature.

489
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:14,466
The source of this evil is the totally
hardware-equipped illusion called life.

490
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:18,387
The gods work their eternal geometry.

491
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:27,980
Let's go!

492
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:45,748
Batou.

493
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:52,523
How do you feel?

494
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:54,108
What happened to me?

495
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:57,653
You were exposed.
Your e-brain was hacked into.

496
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:04,159
For fortune to reveal itself thrice,
misfortune will appear thrice.

497
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:07,871
See no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil.

498
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:09,873
Then boom - the end comes.

499
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:15,879
But in our world if you miss the first sign,
you're dead, let alone all three.

500
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:20,718
I told you before, I have no time
for your stupid bullshit!

501
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:22,636
When did you figure it out?

502
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:26,473
You know the old expression,
no one's easier to trick than a trickster.

503
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:29,810
You may be some kind of
electronic warfare specialist, Kim,

504
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:32,271
but you forget that
I am also an intelligence expert.

505
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:35,482
Besides, I have a guardian angel
looking over me.

506
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:40,612
Dig up the hall image
in your external memory database.

507
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:57,880
Jacob Grimm wrote "Aemaeth - Truth
Of God" on the clay man Salem's forehead.

508
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:02,676
But if you remove "ae" from the beginning,
it becomes "maeth" which means "death".

509
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:07,222
That word made Golem clay again.
That is how I knew what I saw wasn't true.

510
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:10,601
Someone broke through the firewalls
I devised?

511
01:11:10,726 --> 01:11:12,853
That's absurd! No one could do that!

512
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:17,024
You're wrong, someone did do it,
my guardian angel.

513
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:21,653
The game's over, Kim.
It's time you started talking.

514
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:34,208
It's just a doll. You know you're starting
to piss me off.

515
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,126
Knock it off!

516
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:41,089
Batou, are you sure this is not
an extension of false illusions

517
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:43,717
generated by virtual signals?

518
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:47,721
My ghost is whispering to me
if that's what you mean.

519
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:51,975
Humans are nothing but the thread
from which the dream of life is woven.

520
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,270
Dreams, consciousness, even ghosts

521
01:11:55,395 --> 01:12:00,901
are no more than rifts and warps
in the uniform weave of the matrix...

522
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:03,904
I'm just a worthless human being
just like you are, Kim.

523
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:06,281
But we walk very different paths.

524
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,575
For those who don't believe in ghosts,

525
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,663
there's conveniently always insanity
or schizophrenia.

526
01:12:12,788 --> 01:12:16,542
What's left of your original body
will not self-destruct immediately.

527
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:21,755
It will continue to function only physically
until the time death comes to take you.

528
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:44,736
Are you sure we're actually back
in physical reality?

529
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:48,448
Well, there's no way to distinguish
reminiscence from true memory.

530
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:56,331
And, whichever they are, they can only
be understood after the fact.

531
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:59,251
The passage of time can't be stored,
so it's difficult to say.

532
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:04,256
The real question is are the memories real,
or have they been put there?

533
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:08,760
Do your wife and daughter truly exist?

534
01:13:08,886 --> 01:13:15,392
Are you actually still living somewhere,
or just dreaming of having a family?

535
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:19,521
Wouldn't you want to verify
which is actually real?

536
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:21,565
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?

537
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:24,484
Because I wanted to ascertain his motives.

538
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,863
Kim set up his trap
knowing full well that I'd come,

539
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:32,159
inserting the virtual experiences
to turn us away.

540
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:35,454
When Kim surprised me
and made me blow off my own right arm,

541
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:38,290
he must have planted something
in my e-brain.

542
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:44,004
Like lshikawa told you, not many people
could pull something like that off on me.

543
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:46,924
I'm pretty sure that Locus Solus
felt the same way.

544
01:13:47,049 --> 01:13:49,509
So you anticipated all of this?

545
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:53,430
I planned to get in
by pretending to fall into his trap,

546
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:56,058
but Kim was pretty skilled.

547
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:58,727
Without the sign in the hallway,
I may not have figured it out.

548
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:02,064
What about the guardian angel
you were talking about?

549
01:14:02,189 --> 01:14:05,025
Well, it seems she's vanished again.

550
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:09,196
Somewhere beyond that
"rift in the uniform weave of the matrix."

551
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:15,994
Or somewhere on the vast Net,
merging with the entire domain.

552
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:21,959
There are as many paths to proving
your existence as there are ghosts.

553
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:24,086
You've got your daughter - your proof.

554
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:29,341
I'm sure Kim knew all about this
back when he was in the jungle.

555
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:32,177
Well, at least there's one thing
I've got figured out.

556
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:36,098
- What's that?
- I'm really not cut out to be your partner.

557
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:38,225
I thought we worked well together.

558
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:43,021
I don't want to whine, but I'd like to stay
alive long enough to see my daughter.

559
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,482
You have to work long enough
to earn your salary.

560
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,609
You wanna carry on?

561
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:51,488
Don't we have enough information
from Kim's e-brain to nail Locus Solus?

562
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:56,201
We can only prove he interfered with an
investigation. That, plus the ethics violation.

563
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:59,371
Besides, our investigation
is officially off the record.

564
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:04,001
So, if we are going to make any charges
stick in these gynoid murder cases,

565
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:05,961
we need some physical evidence.

566
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:08,255
Kim is a dead end now!

567
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:13,760
Not really. His e-brain's "ghost packed"
and still connected to Locus Solus.

568
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:18,473
We must catch 'em with their pants down
before they can clean everything out.

569
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:21,309
There is a good old saying,

570
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:25,272
"When there is no right or wrong,
it's time to attack."

571
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:28,066
When talking doesn't work,
it's time to use force!

572
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:33,155
Hey, this isn't going to be like barging
into that Yakuza office again, is it?

573
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,575
If I were you I'd bring more
than your Mateba!

574
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,119
"Birds see refuge high up in the heavens.

575
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:43,415
"Fish, on the other hand,
dive deep into the sea".

576
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:23,580
- I've made contact with the escort.
- Roger.

577
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:26,708
I can't believe a big guy like you
decided to dive.

578
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,420
It's so deep that if you sank,
we'd never be able to retrieve you.

579
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:34,174
I used to know this cyborg,
she used to love to go diving.

580
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:36,593
- So what?
- I never knew what she was thinking.

581
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:39,513
I'm only helping you
because you're a friend of Lin's.

582
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:44,392
No one's come back from that ship alive.

583
01:16:44,518 --> 01:16:48,146
- Wait for me. I'll be back.
- Hold on tight.

584
01:17:06,373 --> 01:17:09,334
In 12 seconds you'll trip their sensors.

585
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,962
I'll send you a couple of seconds
of camouflage signal.

586
01:17:12,087 --> 01:17:13,213
Roger.

587
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:18,426
This guy Kim has a direct connection
to the e-brain of the Chief of Security.

588
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:22,973
Initiating synchronization.

589
01:18:27,996 --> 01:18:30,832
I'm in. Send me the vessel data.

590
01:18:34,044 --> 01:18:36,504
Download completed.
You got my vision in your sights?

591
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:40,842
Of course, I wouldn't miss my mentor's
assault for anything! I'm recording.

592
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:44,387
You're a real smart ass, you know that?

593
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:26,513
Infiltrator detected.
Rebooting level two security system.

594
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:29,724
Review status of all on-board e-brains.

595
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:35,021
Scan for matches in memory usage
and virus size.

596
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,899
It may be a latent virus. Cross monitor.

597
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:40,527
Logical contact with Chief's e-brain denied.

598
01:19:40,652 --> 01:19:43,863
Re-formatting procedure engaged!

599
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,533
Rebooting of level two security
system complete.

600
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:50,495
Creating detour to divert infiltrator.
Rebuilding logic firewall.

601
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,206
Loading antibodies! Scanning viruses.

602
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:57,335
Response team,
prepare decoys for ambush.

603
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:02,173
Deploy all latent viruses along firewalls.
Security wall 014 breach.

604
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:05,635
Error type 280 in security wall 230.

605
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,765
Quarantine affected area.
Rebuilding level one external security wall.

606
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,685
Intruder detected.
Transmitting counter virus.

607
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:19,190
Pull out. It's too dangerous
beyond this point. They'll fry your brain!

608
01:20:19,316 --> 01:20:21,318
Not yet, I can go a little further.

609
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:24,738
Don't be an idiot! Pull out now!

610
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,150
LIFE AND DEATH COME AND GO,

611
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:03,693
LIKE MARIONETTES DANCING
ON A TABLE

612
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:11,868
ONCE THE STRING IS CUT,
THEY EASILY COLLAPSE

613
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:47,654
Illegal access at Hadaly gynoid
final production area.

614
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:50,115
Suspect unconfirmed latent virus attack.

615
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,617
Discharge all vaccines to thwart intruder.

616
01:21:52,742 --> 01:21:56,079
Too late, all systems activated.
Cannot establish logical contact.

617
01:21:56,204 --> 01:22:00,083
Currently loading combat robotics
control software.

01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:10,343
Security personnel, secure arms
and investigate immediately.

620
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:57,617
What took you so long?
It's been a long time, Major.

621
01:23:57,742 --> 01:24:00,161
How shall I address you now?

622
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:04,332
To be precise, it's just a fragment of me
downloaded via satellite.

623
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:07,418
This gynoids e-brain lacks capacity.

624
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:11,172
It can only handle
the combat robotics control system.

625
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:14,425
This is the best I can do
for facial and vocal expression.

626
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:20,306
There should be an emergency access
terminal 50 metres down this passage.

627
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:25,019
If you can infiltrate that,
we'll take over the whole system.

628
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:35,071
- You haven't changed a bit, Batou.
- You go on up ahead.

629
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:38,908
I'll cover the rear, just like the old days.

630
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:01,723
Who can gaze into the mirror
without becoming evil?

631
01:25:01,848 --> 01:25:04,684
A mirror does not reflect evil, but creates it.

632
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:08,980
Hey, no time to be philosophical now.
We're running low on ammo.

633
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:14,235
Therefore, one should have a glimpse
in a mirror, not stare into it.

634
01:25:58,196 --> 01:25:59,989
Hey, isn't that risky?

635
01:26:00,114 --> 01:26:03,117
It's only until I shut down
the operating system.

636
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:05,912
Plug into the auxiliary inputs into the floor.

637
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:12,043
I have to gain control of this system,
otherwise this gynoid's nonfunctional.

638
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:14,837
I'm counting on your 30-caliber arm, Batou.

639
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:19,467
My brain can control the firing,
but I've only got one clip left.

640
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:23,054
And I have my doubts about going
hand-to-hand with these gynoids.

641
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:27,016
Here we go!

642
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:31,896
Illegal on-board breach of main system.
Security breach. Security breach.

643
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:35,692
Isolate access point,
engage proactive firewall.

644
01:26:35,817 --> 01:26:40,238
Multiple camouflage signals identified.
No fluctuation in any terminal.

645
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:47,870
Outside access detected.
Terminate all external network links.

646
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:49,622
Disengage external inputs.

647
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:54,419
Emergency control system not responding.
Remote ignition impossible.

648
01:26:54,544 --> 01:26:57,422
Diffused viruses coalescing.
Breach in system area firewalls.

649
01:26:57,547 --> 01:26:59,966
Preparing system reset.
Isolating level one data.

650
01:27:00,091 --> 01:27:03,219
Multiple illegal accesses.
Countermeasures ineffective!

651
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:20,755
We're in control. All external links are
severed. The ship is now stand-alone.

652
01:28:25,218 --> 01:28:26,803
We're moving...?

653
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:33,059
Yes, we're heading south, leaving
international waters for sovereign territory.

654
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:37,772
This ship will give us the physical evidence
that proves Locus Solus' involvement.

655
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:39,106
They'll come after us.

656
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:43,653
We'll have a police vessel escort us before
they have a chance. I already called it in.

657
01:28:43,778 --> 01:28:49,200
But don't you want to see the Locus Solus
technique that infused the dolls with souls?

658
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:52,078
Don't you already know?

659
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:55,164
You've got a hunch about this too...

660
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:56,791
Right?

661
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:17,979
It's totally silent.
They must be blocking off all electric waves.

662
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:34,161
Ghost dubbing.

663
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:37,748
In animal experiments, they discovered
they could mass-replicate inferior copies.

664
01:29:37,874 --> 01:29:39,709
But the technology was banned

665
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:43,129
as they found out the brain
of the original being was destroyed.

666
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:47,133
Locus Solus brainwashed girls
supplied by the Kojin-kai mob,

667
01:29:47,258 --> 01:29:49,760
dubbing their ghosts onto gynoids.

668
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:55,224
It was the ghost that
made Locus Solus gynoids so desirable.

669
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:01,374
Are you here to rescue me?

670
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:07,171
Mr. Volkerson promised me that the police
were coming to rescue me very soon.

671
01:31:07,713 --> 01:31:12,885
I was stage four, but my friend Soana -
you see, she is already at stage five -

672
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:16,347
she can't hear anything
and never answers any more.

673
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:22,103
Volkerson, the murdered consignment
inspector, revised their ethics code.

674
01:31:22,228 --> 01:31:25,856
The Yakuza took him out
to avenge the death of their crime boss.

675
01:31:25,982 --> 01:31:28,234
That's probably what happened.

676
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:34,365
He told us that if the robots made trouble,
someone out there would notice.

677
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,368
Then someone would come
and save all of us.

678
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:41,956
Didn't they think that they were victims?

679
01:31:44,417 --> 01:31:47,003
I'm not just talking about the humans.

680
01:31:47,128 --> 01:31:52,049
What about the dolls out there right now
who are endowed with human souls?

681
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:03,310
But I never wanted to have to be a doll!

682
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,989
"We weep for the blood of a bird,
but not for the blood of a fish.

683
01:32:15,114 --> 01:32:17,825
"Blessed are those who have voice."

684
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:23,789
If the dolls could speak, they'd scream,
"I didn't want to become human!"

685
01:32:23,914 --> 01:32:25,958
Let me ask you a question.

686
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:28,878
Do you consider yourself really happy now?

687
01:32:29,003 --> 01:32:31,172
A nostalgic value, I suppose,

688
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:34,508
At least I am free of dilemma now,
and that's nice.

689
01:32:38,095 --> 01:32:44,268
"Let one walk alone, committing no sin,
with few wishes...

690
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:47,104
.like elephants in the forest."

691
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:53,986
Batou, always remember -
whenever you access the Net,

692
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:57,281
I will be there, by your side.

693
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:03,913
I'm going now.

694
01:33:45,162 --> 01:33:49,375
Your guardian angel showed up
on that ship, didn't she?

695
01:33:51,168 --> 01:33:52,670
You're not going to tell me?

696
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:54,713
Do you think I'll put it in my report?

697
01:33:54,839 --> 01:33:57,299
I'll pick you up at 8:20 tomorrow morning.

698
01:33:57,424 --> 01:34:00,594
I owe you for looking after my dog.

699
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:04,557
You could come in if you like.

700
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:09,019
Hanging out with other people's families
isn't my thing.

701
01:34:10,437 --> 01:34:11,480
Daddy!

702
01:34:12,982 --> 01:34:15,401
Did you remember to bring me something?

703
01:34:15,526 --> 01:34:18,529
- I didn't forget your present, see?
- Yeah!
