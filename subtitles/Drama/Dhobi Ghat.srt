1
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,292
New to Mumbai?

2
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,583
Been here five months,
but it still feels strange

3
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:54,583
- Where are you from?
- Malihabad, Uttar Pradesh

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,083
Malihabad is famous for mangoes.
l'm from U.P. too

5
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:04,250
- Jaunpur. Do you know it?
- Yes, l've been there

6
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,583
Come home soon

7
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:27,167
Look lmran, the famous Marine Drive
and up ahead is Chowpatty

8
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:33,250
People throng this place every day
to eat bhel puri, pav bhaji. . .

9
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,375
l think people come here
more for fresh air

10
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,667
which is in short supply

11
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,833
The sea air is so different

12
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:51,083
it smells of people's desires

13
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,417
Give me two rupees, l'm hungry,
please. . .

14
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,958
Are you shooting?

15
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,958
Take my picture! Please!

16
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,250
lt's exactly your kind of flat...

17
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,167
Yes, a gas connection,
24-hour security

18
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,250
Yes, there's water...
most of the time

19
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,417
Just take a look

20
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,958
Okay, 6 o'clock

21
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:42,458
Do you like it, Mr Arun?
lt'll be perfect after a coat of paint

22
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,875
You 're a painter,
you 'll know what l mean

23
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,958
Think about it.
The lease is unlimited

24
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:58,042
There's the view you wanted of
the old city. That's the Aga Khan Tower

25
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,250
The station is nearby...

26
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,167
and you get a private toilet,
rare for these buildings

27
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,958
Yes, the kitchen is small,
but you 're not exactly a chef

28
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,250
What an actor!

29
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,167
l want to meet him

30
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,875
Johny Lever? l'll introduce you

31
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:43,958
Shut up!

32
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,583
Ma, if l fail this time, it'll be their fault

33
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:54,083
He's right, Salim.
You illiterate!

34
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,375
Just you wait. . .

35
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,542
Karim will study and become
a top class gentleman

36
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,792
Right, Karim?

37
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,625
Off to work again?

38
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,833
Damn filthy job, that

39
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,958
Why do you do it?

40
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,375
At least l'm not a crook like you

41
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,958
My job is better... right, Aunt?

42
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,333
Don't... stop it!

43
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,458
ldiot

44
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,167
- Shit!
- Damn... missed!

45
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,917
What did he think he was doing?

46
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:47,250
Shai, don't be such the NRl.
You know what traffic here is like

47
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,958
l'm so late, man, Pes...

48
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,250
My mum left for the show an hour ago

49
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,000
Nothing important starts in Bombay
before 1 0, love

50
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:28,875
There's Arun... delightful that he could
make it to his own opening

51
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:32,250
l like the new work.
What do you think, Jatin?

52
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,083
l think it's hard to be apolitical when
you are referencing the working classes

53
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,792
Ladies and gentlemen...friends. . .

54
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,500
The artist has decided
to make an appearance...

55
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,208
Finally. . .

56
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,292
Thank you all so much for coming...

57
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:53,083
and l take great pleasure
in presenting 'Building', Arun's new work

58
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,500
And now the part
that Arun hates the most...

59
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,083
Arun, please say a few words. . .

60
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,458
Everybody, T. Arun. . .
Arun, be nice

61
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,958
Well, there's not much to say. . .

62
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,292
This is a tribute to the people of...

63
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,958
Rajasthan... U. P. . . .

64
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,250
Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh
and elsewhere

65
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,500
who built this city
in the hope that someday

66
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,083
they will find a rightful place in it

67
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,292
So, to Bombay. . .

68
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,417
my muse, my whore, my beloved

69
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,292
- To Bombay
- To Bombay

70
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,250
- Fantastic
- Thanks, thank you

71
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,542
- We really love your work
- Thank you

72
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,083
We'll have a huge painting of yours...

73
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,208
- You know the old style you used to. . .
- Sorry to intrude...

74
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,250
This is going to be
a really important show

75
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,417
and l am told your solos are much later

76
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,250
Arun, you have really
outdone yourself this time

77
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,875
Miraj Hussain, l need to talk to you

78
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,417
How long does it take
to return a phone call?

79
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:04,958
That bad?

80
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,625
Don't ask...

81
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,917
Thank God for Pesi

82
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
- Hi, l'm Arun
- Hi... Shai

83
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,083
Guess l thought you looked
a bit stricken there

84
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,417
Yeah

85
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,625
So are you an artist too?

86
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,333
No, l am an investment
banking consultant

87
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,292
What... something to do with money?

88
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,625
Yes, broadly speaking

89
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,625
Essentially, l study investment trends
in South Asian economies

90
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,500
What... here in Bombay?

91
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,875
No, in New York, but...

92
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,583
l've moved here for a bit

93
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:50,958
Why?

94
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,542
l guess l needed a break
from things, you know

95
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,625
... a new perspective,
some fresh air in my head

96
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,625
- You plan to get that here in Bombay?
- Yes. . .

97
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,583
Well, maybe just a change of scene then

98
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,958
Cool, l could do with a holiday too

99
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,250
Actually, l'm not on holiday.
l'm on a sabbatical

100
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,000
Really? What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,000
lt means l've received a research grant

102
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,958
to submit a project about small
and marginal businesses

103
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:32,333
and shifts in traditional occupations

104
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,917
Basically, l have to write a few papers

105
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,958
and spend time doing
what l love doing most...

106
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,750
taking photographs

107
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,917
Rat... rat... !

108
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,125
Oh... l'm so sorry

109
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,500
l just saw a rat...

110
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,542
l am serious

111
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,250
l'm so sorry

112
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, now my show is truly open

113
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,000
Cheers!

114
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,042
Cheers!

115
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:52,708
Early morning, and everyone's
racing against the clock

116
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,292
Look how quickly she cooks her curry

117
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,125
Like she's in a race

118
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,125
Who knows what it'll taste like!

119
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:17,458
We have a maid.
Out here they are called 'bai'

120
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:22,250
How quickly she does the dishes,
cleaning and laundry!

121
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,125
Won't stay an extra minute!

122
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,083
So unlike our Zubeida back home. . .

123
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:33,417
who'd insist on staying back,
to oil my hair, or a massage

124
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,542
Poor dear... how is she?

125
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,042
You 've been up long?

126
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:56,750
A couple of hours...

127
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,583
- Tea?
- l'd love some

128
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:10,500
Listen, l just helped myself to a shirt
that was lying on your chair

129
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,042
because mine was trashed
with that wine stain

130
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, that's fine

131
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,500
Milk and sugar?

132
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,417
Yes, please

133
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,333
l had a lovely time last night

134
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,250
So tell me... do you always live like this. . .
out of boxes?

135
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,042
Moving house. . .

136
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,542
Really? Why?

137
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,292
Lease has run out. . .

138
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,917
So you found a new place then,
have you ?

139
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,250
Yeah

140
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,917
You know, l found your opening last night

141
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,042
to be quite an experience

142
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:09,958
Are they all like that?

143
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:16,708
My mom loves these arty do's...
she's quite a collector

144
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,708
We have a lot of art at home

145
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,667
ln fact, we are running short of walls

146
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,417
Are you hung over?

147
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:39,958
No

148
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,542
Hey, is something wrong?

149
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,708
No, actually Shai, l'm really. . .

150
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,417
l'm really sorry about last night. . .

151
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,792
l mean, l was so drunk
and l had no idea. . .

152
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,708
Hey, what are you sorry about?
Don't be sorry

153
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,000
l had a really great time

154
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,750
No, l'm quite a loner and. . .

155
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,958
l keep to myself and. . .

156
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,250
and l don't usually do this you know

157
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,583
Hey, it's cool. . .

158
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,208
l'm glad you don't usually do this

159
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,083
l mean, hey, l don't either. . .

160
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,292
No, actually what l'm
trying to say, Shai is that. . .

161
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,417
l'm not the relationship kind at all

162
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,208

163
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,917
and l'm really sorry
if l led you into believing...

164
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,833
that this was something more...

165
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:37,875
something more...

166
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,500
more than just a shag

167
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,917
l'm sorry, Shai, l don't mean to. . .

168
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,000
Look Shai, what l'm trying to say is that. . .

169
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,708
Look, l have no idea what's going on
in your head right now. . .

170
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:55,292
and l'm not sure l want to know

171
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
Arun, you know what...

172
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,667
lt's cool. . .

This is the Gateway of lndia,
Bombay's most famous landmark

181
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:48,583
- Can we go?

184
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,875

Thanks

189
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,208
l guess you are right

190
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:13,417
l don't know, Pes...

191
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,958
l really thought he was special

192
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,250
You know... l mean...

193
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,750
we got along so well the night before

194
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,292
Well, it wasn't just the sex, Pes

195
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,208
Yeah. . .

196
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,625
Like he was really into me

197
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,417
and he was so intense. . .

198
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,500
and then, suddenly in the morning. . .

199
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,458
he was like a completely
different person...

200
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,167
hold on a sec...

201
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,292

204
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,583
Pes, l'll have to call you back

205
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,917
This dhobi guy just walked in
and l don't know where Agnes is

206
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,417
Okay, bye

207
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:59,875
There were 1 2 clothes,
please count them

208
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,500
This has turned blue!

209
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,250
lt had a big stain, so l tried to whiten it

210
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,458
l should've told Agnes
to put this is in the laundry

211
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,958
lt's completely ruined now

212
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,000
Give it to me, l'll correct it

213
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,917
No. . . who knows
what colour it'll become next. . .

214
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,250
Damn. . .

215
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:35,292
Madam, my mistake. l'll fix it

216
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,250

First Letter, Second Letter,
Third Letter

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,833
Rakesh, the people who lived here
have left some stuff behind

221
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,083
Some tapes, a ring...

222
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,042
...no, a silver ring

223
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,917
Can't you return it to the landlord?

224
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:31,250
What if they ever ask for it?

225
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:36,583
Cool, l'll throw it away,
but don't ask for it later

226
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay, bye

227
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,583

- Which college do you go to?

Who has time for college?
He works in the movies

230
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,583
Really? Which films were you in?

231
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:16,625
Hey...

232
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,375
Zohaib, right?

233
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,750
- Which film are you here to watch?
- Yuvraaj

234
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,417
So are we!

235
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,125
This will be my first-ever Bollywood film

236
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:36,958
See you ...

237
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:43,375
Zohaib... huh?

238
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:48,792
- She's a friend of mine... Shai
- Do l look like a fool?

239
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,292
Come on, let's get to the bottom of this

240
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,167
ls it switched on?

241
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,417
Bring it here

242
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:07,250
Look, when this red light flashes
it's recording

243
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,333
lt's recording now

244
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,625
This is great! So cool!

245
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,833
Say something,
l'm shooting your picture

246
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:25,000
- What should l say?
- Just smile

247
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,250
This is wonderful!

248
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,625
But tell me, how will lmran see this?

249
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:55,333
l wanted to send him photos of us.
Can he watch this on his TV?

250
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,958
Salaam Aleikum, lmran... all well?

251
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,250
l had promised l'd send you our photos.
But l didn't have a camera

252
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,375
So he got me this video one instead

253
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,958
l thought l'd send you this,
to watch on your TV

254
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,000
Show it to Mum and Dad as well

255
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,250
How am l looking?
Just the same, right?

256
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,292
Bombay hasn't changed me yet

257
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,375
l'm still the same Yasmin

258
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:54,125
Your exams are round the corner now

259
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,417
Study hard, do well,
and come here soon

260
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,458
You 've always wanted to visit Bombay

261
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,333
l'm here now, we'll have lots of fun

262
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,000
We'll go to Juhu beach. . .

263
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:18,125
Maybe l could give you a tour
of Bombay with this camera

264
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,958
Good idea, isn't it?

265
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,792
Goodbye for now

266
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,958
She stole my heart. . .

267
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,667
and slipped away. . .

268
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:56,292
The full-grown male
weighs about 3 tonnes

269
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:59,208
l'm into fashion designing...

270
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
What a rotten breakfast!
Have you lost your mind?

271
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:09,292
Don't you remember,
l like omelettes for breakfast?

272
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,375
Would you like some tea?

273
00:30:57,292 --> 00:31:00,250
- Agnes, 2 cups of tea, please

So you like The Doors?

277
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,167
Are you a photographer?

278
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:29,750
No, this is just a hobby

279
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:33,917
l work in a bank, in America

280
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,458
Why did you leave America?
lsn't life more advanced there?

281
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,917
Who told you that?

282
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,167
Yes, some ways it's more advanced
but. . .

283
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:53,208
- Are you from Mumbai?
- No from Bihar

284
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:55,292
Darbhanga district

285
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:59,583
- So why did you move here?
- To fill my belly, why else?

286
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,792
ls your family here?

287
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:08,000
No, l came alone, when l was eight.

288
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:12,375
- Ever go back home, to visit?
- No, never

289
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,292
Why?

290
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,083
Don't you miss family?

291
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,083
Were you unhappy at home?

292
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:25,917
lt was okay. . .

293
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,083
less to eat, that's all

294
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,667
We were always hungry

295
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:38,083
When l first came here,
l worked at a hotel

296
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:41,208
There l had my fill,
of food and thrashings!

297
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,792
Can you take a picture of me?

298
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah... sure

299
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:07,583
Not like this. . .
Can you take pictures for a portfolio?

300
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:11,500
Why? Want to be a model?

301
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,292
No... actor

302
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:20,875
Well, l can try... l mean. . .

303
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,833
never really done that
sort of thing before

304
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,792
What was that?

305
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,375
l mean, yes. . .

306
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,500
But you have to return the favour

307
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,917
You have to allow me
to take pictures of you at work

308
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,458
What work?

309
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,792
Your washerman's work, what else?

310
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:52,250
Munna, whose shirt is this?
Sir said it's not his

311
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:56,000
- lt's Mr. Arun's. . .
- lt's mine. . .

312
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,208
You know Arun, the painter?

313
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,375
Yes

314
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:04,000
Do you know where his new house is?

315
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:06,250
Yes

316
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,417
Could you show it to me?

317
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,167
l want to return this shirt

318
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:12,833
l can do that

319
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,750
No, l want to surprise him

320
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,250
So, is Munna your nickname?

321
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,667
Yes... you can call me that

322
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:33,833
The rain here is so different

323
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,792
unrelenting...

324
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,208
falls incessantly. . .

325
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:47,042
Like a lullaby at night. . .

326
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,625
its sound engulfs you . . .

327
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,792
drowning out the neighbours' TVs

328
00:34:56,333 --> 00:35:00,417
But l feel sorry for my maid, bai
whose house gets flooded

329
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:05,958
She says, she has to bail out
the water by hand

330
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,333
l must go, l think he's back

331
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,917
Need to heat the food

332
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:19,792
l've made lamb with beetroot today,
the way Mum taught me

333
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,917
l hope he likes it. . .

334
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:28,042
Then l'll watch some TV,
because he doesn't talk much

335
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,083
l hope there's a good film on

336
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,625
And anyway, why are we even here?

337
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:41,375
l thought you claimed
you are not into this guy

338
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,417
l don't know

339
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,250
There's something
we left unfinished, l think

340
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,542
Couple of positions
you haven't tried yet?

341
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,958
So go, ring his doorbell

342
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,875
l can't

343
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,583
l don't really know him and...

344
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,542
who knows, he might have somebody
up there with him right now

345
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,542
That's possible

346
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,583
These artist types,
they get a lot of action

347
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,958
Such a crummy neighbourhood

348
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:20,875
Hey, this is one of our buildings

349
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,917
This neighbourhood is getting posh then

350
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,958
Oh, wait. That's him, isn't it?

351
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,292
- What? What happened?
- Get down, he'll see us

352
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,917
He's not that cute, really

353
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,958
Pes, come let's go there

354
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,542
- To that South lndian joint?
- Yeah

355
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,958
Pure Veg? No, thanks

356
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:58,125
- Who is going for the food?
- l am

357
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,250
l can't spy on an empty stomach

358
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,458
- Come, l'll find you a nice Parsi boy
- Yeah, right

359
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,167
ls there a problem, Munna?

360
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:51,875
Actually, l was hoping
we'd shoot in a studio

361
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,042
No, studios are so artificial

362
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,417
l thought we'd get some natural shots

363
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,417
So you want to shoot on the streets?

364
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,292
Yes, natural, you know...

365
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,750
like you 're standing
or sitting somewhere

366
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:14,917
No, no, please shoot in a studio.
l'll pay for it!

367
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,458
lt isn't about the expense

368
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:24,167
lt'll be very different
from other portfolios. . .

369
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,375
totally fresh

370
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,250
l don't want anything ''fresh''!

371
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,792
Are you sure you know how to do this?

372
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,667
Smile

373
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,583
Nice

374
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:00,625
Something else?

375
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,708
Can you lose these glasses?

376
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:10,958
Hands down

377
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,083
Okay, Munna, don't smile

378
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,583
Hold it

379
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,750
Better

380
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,917
Do you have another T-shirt?
This one's too bright

381
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,250
No. . .

382
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,083
Shall l take it off?

383
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,583
... let's try

384
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,500
Really nice

385
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,583
Hold it

386
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,583
lmran, this lady is our neighbour

387
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,083
For some reason she never says a word

388
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,292
Nor does her expression ever change

389
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:16,042
Something must have happened with her

390
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,292
Poor thing

391
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,250
Hello... how are you ?

392
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:51,917
Yes, Vatsala

393
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,833
What do you mean... fourth floor, why?

394
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,125
Yes, why?

395
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,125
No, l was meant to but. . .

396
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,250
One second. . .

397
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,625
Yes, l meant to call him, but. . .

398
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,458
l was really busy, so. . .

399
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,750
l couldn't find the time and...

400
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,833
l'll probably call him some time today

401
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,250
So what have you been up to?

402
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,583
Should have known. . .
holed up at home, watching porn

403
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,625
- Mad or what?
- Really?

404
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,625
Then what's that?

405
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:36,958
Some stuff...

406
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:39,500
Stuff? What stuff?
Why are you so cagey?

407
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,417
First... letter...

408
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,792
Give that to me...

409
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,250
Yasmin Noor? Who is Yasmin Noor?

410
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,708
V, give it back. Stop it

411
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,125
Who is Yasmin Noor?

412
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,083
Come on, give it back

413
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,458
What? Not in the mood?

414
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,292
We didn't sell much...

415
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,000
l mean, the market's a bit slow,
but l was hoping we'd do better

416
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,583
You didn't really talk
to anyone at the show

417
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,750
Except for that girl with Pesi

418
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,792
Who was she?

419
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,375
Shai?

420
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,583
She's a banker or something

421
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:22,292
Shai... she's Perwin Edulji's daughter

422
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,792
Perwin bought more art last year
than anyone l know

423
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,583
l hope you charmed her

424
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,250
This is so much easier with paper

425
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,458
You haven't asked me why l came

426
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,625
Why did you come?

427
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,125
l've wangled a show for you

428
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,833
Ask me where

429
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,208
Where?

430
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:45,417
Sydney

431
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,125
l wanted to surprise you

432
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,500
You know, there's this gallery
l've been in touch with

433
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,500
about Medha's work and Gagan's work

434
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,958
l slipped in a catalogue
of your work

435
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,542
They seemed to really like it

436
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:59,708
ln fact, they want to
open their lndia section with you

437
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,917
This will launch you internationally,
l'm so excited

438
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,458
And of course, you 'll get to see Shiv

439
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,250
How old must he be by now?

440
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,750
Almost six

441
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,500
So, did you like my work?

442
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:35,875
What do l say...

443
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,708
l think it's great

444
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:41,750
Great, thank heavens

445
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,333
Tea?

446
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:47,417
You 're my first ''client'',
so l was nervous

447
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,833
No, your work is superb

448
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:55,250
But...

449
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:57,833
tell me...

450
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,083
What?

451
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,417
How do you like me?

452
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,417
ln the pictures...

453
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,917
l think you look great

454
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:21,083
Now you have to take me to Dhobi Ghat

455
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:01,083
- Show me the pink ones
- Here, madam

456
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,750
- How much?
- Rs 75 for a set

457
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,167
Did you hear that, lmran?

458
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,125
No, that's too much

459
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,542
Don't worry, l'll knock down the price

460
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,292
Hey, dad

461
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,833
Yeah, l am here

462
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,042
Yeah, it's great

463
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,792
Yeah...

464
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:08,417
What's his name...
your site manager... ?

465
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:12,583
l think it was Harish or something...
he set it up for me

466
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:17,458
Yeah, it's great...
thanks, dad

467
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,542
l'm getting some great shots

468
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,542
Okay, bye

469
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:14,458
- What are you shooting?
- l'm new to the city so...

470
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:19,292
So what? Don't you know
all this isn't allowed?

471
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:26,125
New to Mumbai?

472
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,875
See all you want, surely that's free!

473
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,750
What are you looking at?

474
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:27,583
What are you staring at?

475
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:28,958
At the camera

476
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:32,000
Look straight ahead!
Never seen a camera before?

477
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,083
lt's none of your business where l look

478
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:38,250
lt is! Look ahead!

479
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,583
Tell madam she wants to shoot me
returning the clothes

480
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:58,083
She wants to take pictures
of me working

481
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,542
Why? You come inside

482
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:05,458
Ma'am, actually l'm shooting him
at work from washing to delivering

483
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:08,417
So if you don't mind, can l shoot him
handing over the clothes?

484
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,792
Take the clothes

485
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,417
One salwar ...

486
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:25,750
One kurta...

487
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,708
Madam wants you inside

488
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:35,917
Tell her l'm in a hurry.
l'll come by another day

489
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:43,250
Did you see how she glared at me?

490
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:47,000
Forget about her

491
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,417
But she won't forget about you !

492
00:49:56,917 --> 00:49:58,583
Second Letter

493
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,208
Smile for me, bai

494
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,750
Oh dear...

495
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,167
Just a little

496
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,792
Where's your daughter?

497
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:12,250
- Over there
- Vanita, come here

498
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,292
Vanita, come here...

499
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:15,083
Come on...

500
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:18,750
Come, don't be shy

501
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,458
lmran, meet Lata bai
and her daughter Vanita

502
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,292
Say hello to my brother

503
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,667
But where is he?

504
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,083
Ma, she's recording our pictures
to send to her brother

505
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,167
She's a smart girl

506
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,667
Which class are you in?

507
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:39,250
Class 9, English Medium

508
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,500
Then say something in English for us

509
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,250
Go on, recite that poem

510
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,167
''The Brook'', by Alfred Lord Tennyson

511
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:55,917
l come from haunts of coot and hern,
l make a sudden sally

512
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:59,875
And sparkle out among the fern,
And bicker down the valley

513
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,917
By thirty hills l hurry down,
Or slip between the ridges

514
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:10,250
By twenty thorpes a little town,
And half a hundred bridges

515
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,667
... l've forgotten the rest

516
00:51:14,792 --> 00:51:15,958
Wow!

517
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,333
Bai, she's very smart

518
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,250
A bit too smart

519
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:24,208
Watches TV all day.
Dancing and singing with songs...

520
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:26,292
so her grades have dropped

521
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,375
Wow, then dance for us...

522
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,167
Go on

523
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:32,583
Some other time then...

524
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:34,417
- Should l get back to work?
- Yes

525
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:48,250
Can't say, sir,
my shifts keep changing

526
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,875
l don't know when
this lady lived in your flat

527
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:56,875
There was a maid called Lata bai
who worked here

528
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:58,417
Do you know her?

529
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,792
l've heard the name.
But l can't say for sure

530
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:08,292
Please ask around

531
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:12,667
She might still be working in this area

532
00:52:12,792 --> 00:52:14,875
- Please find out
- Okay, sir

533
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:45,375
How long have you known Arun?

534
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,375
Why?

535
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,583
Just... curious

536
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,750
Around four years

537
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,958
Has he always lived alone?

538
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:01,458
No, earlier he lived
with his wife and son

539
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,583
What? No way

540
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,042
Yes, why?

541
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,750
They split two years ago

542
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,083
Divorced

543
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,083
He was in a bad way then

544
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,458
Just wouldn't open the door

545
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:21,458
One day l shouted,
''Open the door, or l'll call the police!''

546
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:23,792
Then?

547
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:25,792
Finally, he opened the door

548
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:29,083
Thank God he was alive

549
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:33,167
l made some tea, we drank it,
and then l left

550
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:35,958
Then?

551
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,000
Then he got okay

552
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,208
What was his wife like?

553
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:45,708
Nice

554
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,958
Fair... tall...

555
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:51,083
Taller than Arun

556
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:04,750
Aren't you married?

557
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,583
Boyfriend?

558
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,750
ln the past

559
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,208
Not anymore

560
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:19,000
And you ?

561
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:22,750
Why not? You 're so handsome

562
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:27,750
What can l say?

563
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,208
l... haven't really liked anyone...

564
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:35,583
as yet

565
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:39,375
You 'll find someone

566
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:05,542
- Hello
- Hello, Shai Edulji

567
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,750
- When did you arrive?
- This evening, darling

568
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:10,125
- Where's mum?
- She's already gone off to bed

569
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:13,833
- So, having fun?
- Yes, it's been great

570
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,917
Like today,
l shot in the Dhobi Ghat

571
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,250
You know what your mum would
have to say about that, right?

572
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:23,333
She'd probably say l needed
a vaccination shot or something

573
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,417
That Raju is a real bastard!

574
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:35,750
He did me out of 50 grand

575
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,875
And here l was trying to help him

576
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,542
l gave him a good thrashing

577
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:47,292
And warned him
l'd complain to Kale Bhai

578
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:49,917
That's when he got scared

579
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:54,750
Just because he's Lambu 's brother
he throws his weight around

580
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:02,917
Munna, l need some cash

581
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:08,667
l've got to put down 1 0,000...

582
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:11,292
for that apartment in Jogeshwari

583
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:12,458
Look...

584
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:16,750
l've got 7,000. Give me three

585
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,375
l'll return it next month

586
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:21,917
You still owe me 4,000

587
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,500
l can't loan you any more

588
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:28,708
l swear l'll pay you back. Don't worry

589
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:32,250
Kale Bhai is giving me
a big job next month

590
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:35,583
And l'll get my share out of Raju

591
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:38,083
For sure. l promise

592
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:45,083
But Salim, don't mess with Lambu

593
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:46,708
Yes, mom!

594
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,542
What?

595
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:55,958
Why are you laughing?

596
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,208
Did your Ma'am take these?

597
00:58:58,292 --> 00:58:59,667
Just look at you !

598
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:05,292
l mean, you look great

599
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,458
But l don't know why l found it funny

600
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,958
You look handsome, buddy

601
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:13,292
What a body!

602
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:24,125
When will you introduce me
to that producer?

603
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,625
Do something for me, fatso!

604
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,417
You think l won't?

605
00:59:29,542 --> 00:59:32,000
l'll take you tomorrow. For sure

606
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,042
l have to say...

607
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:41,042
this Ma'am of yours seems really nice

608
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:42,792
Why don't you tell her?

609
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,625
What are you scared of now?

610
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,000
- She's already seen you half-naked!
- Shut up!

611
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,292
YASMlN NOOR

612
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:24,917
Nothing lasts here...

613
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,375
The sea claims everything

614
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:36,208
l can share everything with it,

615
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:38,667
tell it all my secrets,

616
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:43,458
and they'll sink softly
to its depths

617
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,750
The sea will keep them safe

618
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,500
Nice to see you again,
how are you doing?

619
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,833
l'm good, how are you ?

620
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,000
Good, very good

621
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,042
Moved house, working on a new project

622
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,417
l live right here, in fact.
On the fourth floor

623
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:19,875
- Really?
- Yeah

624
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:23,625
l was just going in here,
this building

625
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,167
Are you going to shoot something?

626
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:31,417
Yeah, just shooting
the construction work and all that...

627
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,750
it's one of my dad's sites

628
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,750
- So, you are...
- Well, l should...

629
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,750
- Sorry
- No, it's okay...

630
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,125
No, do you want to have
a coffee or something?

631
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,542
l mean... do you have the time?

632
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:49,042
Yes... l have time for a coffee

633
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:51,375
So, do you want to come to my house?

634
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,917
- Okay, yes
- Come

635
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,750
So how's the sabbatical been going?

636
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,750
lt's been pretty good, so far

637
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,750
Been seeing a lot of the city?

638
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,458
Yeah... kind of...

639
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:12,625
Have you been spending a lot of time
in this area? Mohammad Ali Road?

640
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,833
Well, not really

641
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:21,250
l guess one needs a guide
to see all the really local stuff

642
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:24,750
Yeah...one needs a guide...

643
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:29,333
And you ?
You 've been working?

644
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,542
Yeah, kind of...

645
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,125
There is this...

646
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,583
something that l am quite
excited about...

647
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:41,917
That's great...

648
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:44,625
You look a lot happier, l have to say

649
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,708
You know, Shai,
l really want to apologise

650
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,250
for being such an ass
the last time

651
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,375
Oh, no...not more apologies...

652
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,125
Just forget about it, okay, please

653
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,583
lt's really not a big deal. Really

654
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:07,708
Although l was really pissed off
with you , for a while

655
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:11,250
That's me at my best....
pissing people off

656
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:15,917
And when l get drunk,
l do these random things

657
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,708
lt gets so embarrassing

658
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,417
l know what you mean,
l'm hoping you don't remember

659
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:24,250
half of the things l did that night

660
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,333
Apart from the headstand, you mean...

661
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,167
Hey Munna, what's up?

662
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,917
Nothing today, come tomorrow

663
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,833
Hey, have you been
to the Elephanta caves?

664
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,042
That's another great place

665
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:51,458
No...

666
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,750
Listen, l have to go...

667
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,667
Oh, okay...

668
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:01,750
l just remembered
l have to meet someone

669
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,083
Thanks for the coffee...

670
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,833
Sure...

671
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:09,083
- Show me your photos sometime
- Definitely

672
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:19,250
- Where are you going?
- l have work

673
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:20,375
What work?

674
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,833
You said you 'd take me
to Nagpada today

675
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,250
And we'd see a film

676
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:31,125
That ''Hello'' or whatever

677
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,333
Come on, Munna, you promised

678
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,083
l've even bought tickets

679
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,333
Please

680
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:57,083
My ancestors came to Bombay
and set up shop in 1 905

681
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,833
We are the 5th generation,
and we're still here

682
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:06,625
But now it's the machine age

683
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:10,083
Young people prefer bottled perfumes

684
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:54,958
Why are you doing all this?

685
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,625
l want to understand...

686
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,625
to see...

687
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,917
See what? These filthy places?

688
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:07,750
American streets too clean for you ?

689
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:40,083
Look... there... the King of Lalbaug

690
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,750
Where? Which one, Vanita?

691
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:26,708
- How much was that?
- 40 Rupees

692
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:29,458
No, please let me get this

693
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,083
You 're my guest, it's on me

694
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:37,417
Hello, Salim...

695
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,500
Not today, l'm a little busy

696
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,417
Hi, mom

697
01:12:57,417 --> 01:12:59,458
Good, good, and you ?

698
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,542
Yeah, still doing my mad shooting

699
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:10,125
Well, l am done

700
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:14,667
l'm done with dhobis,
and ear cleaners, and the circus

701
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:21,125
and l'm soon going to be
doing the night rat-killers

702
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,875
No, no kidding

703
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:29,250
Of course, l'll be fine mom

704
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,417
And when do you come next?

705
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,875
Good, so l'll see you soon then?

706
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:40,875
Okay, bye

707
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:47,958
Shai baby, you stay away
from this dhobi guy

708
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:50,042
- Why?
- He's not a good boy

709
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:56,125
He's just extra smart,
got no education, totally worthless

710
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,917
Third Letter

711
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,292
Bakri Eid is ten days away

712
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:24,208
You know how much it frightens me

713
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,917
l always feel terrible, that we sacrifice...

714
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:33,375
those who we raise with so much love

715
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,833
Remember, how l used to hide at home?

716
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,667
He's out of town,

717
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:49,250
but his aunt has invited me for the ritual

718
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:51,750
l've already thought up an excuse...

719
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:55,167
Diarrhoea!

720
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,667
Remember when we were kids...

721
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,625
how we'd find excuses
to skip Koran class?

722
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,250
lt's the same thing with this aunt

723
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:13,667
That's it for now

724
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:16,417
lt's taking me ages to finish these tapes

725
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,083
All the news will be stale

726
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:24,417
Anyway, better late than never, right?

727
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:35,083
She was like, ''Mrs. Fonseca,
l want to be a nun.''

728
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,542
We were like, ''What?!''

729
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,458
Listen, l know,
let's go to my place in Khandala

730
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:43,542
- Now?
- Yes, totally, it's gorgeous in the rain

731
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,500
Actually, it's not a bad idea

732
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,083
Anyway, l can't. l promised
Munna l'd go with him

733
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:49,083
to that Dongri place tomorrow

734
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,458
- lt's Munna time
- What is with this Munna fixation?

735
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:54,083
l mean, how much can you
hang out with your Dhobi?

736
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:56,083
Yes. So?

737
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,125
So, it's just slightly weird... slightly?

738
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,125
l know you guys have things
in common and all but

739
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,958
after a point, it's like

740
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:04,375
''How many clothes did you wash today?''

741
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,542
Stop it

742
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,667
- Just kidding
- Sorry, sorry...

743
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:10,875
Listen, listen.
Forget all this nonsense

744
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:13,083
- Let's have some real fun now
- Okay

745
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:18,667
You 've changed, you know

746
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,250
You 're in love

747
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,792
Lay off

748
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:25,750
Have you told her?

749
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:31,250
But her parents will never agree

750
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:34,167
You 'll have to elope

751
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:37,000
Are you nuts?

752
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,833
Sorry, first you have to propose

753
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,792
Hello, sir!
lt's been ages...

754
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:47,250
Sure l have some

755
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:49,583
'A' grade stuff

756
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,750
Where should l come?

757
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,458
Now make a right

758
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,083
l'm over here

759
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,750
Forgotten me, sir?

760
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,625
- How much?
- Seven

761
01:17:07,792 --> 01:17:10,417
When l bought from that Raju ...

762
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,917
- Come on, sir...
- l got better stuff at five

763
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,375
Raju 's a cheat!

764
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,292
Six is what l buy it for.
Nothing less than six

765
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:24,875
Nothing less, my ass

766
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,583
Here's two more

767
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,167
Special rate just for you , sir

768
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,417
And please don't go to Raju again

769
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:08,792
Look at me

770
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:23,417
Don't come if you don't want to.
l've never forced you

771
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,583
l don't know
what's come over you suddenly

772
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:30,000
Something's up
between you and that girl

773
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:31,208
That's not true

774
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:34,458
You 're in love with her, that's what

775
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,875
ldiot!

776
01:18:39,292 --> 01:18:41,875
The truth is never pleasant, is it?

777
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:45,042
That American girl plays you ,
and you go crazy

778
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:49,250
Munna, don't forget your status!

779
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,458
Now get out of here

780
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:55,625
And don't come back
when she dumps you

781
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,083
Get me a Coke with ice

782
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:07,833
And Munna won't be coming anymore

783
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,292
Tell the watchman and find a new dhobi

784
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,750
Why do people make
so much of marriage?

785
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:32,375
l should never have got married

786
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:36,083
But no one listened to me

787
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:40,708
l used to be so happy

788
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:50,875
Shall l tell you something?

789
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,083
He has another woman

790
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:02,958
l wanted to ask him something
so l called his mobile phone

791
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:06,708
A woman answers and asks,
''Who's this?''

792
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,500
l said, ''His wife.''

793
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:12,708
She started laughing

794
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:18,417
She gave him the phone saying,
''She's so nave...''

795
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,958
Where did you find her?

796
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,000
Well... forget all that

797
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:37,292
That day when you called,
l was so excited l forgot to ask...

798
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,458
How did you do in the exams?

799
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:43,167
And how's our kid sister?

800
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:49,208
Back home, it must be
mango season now

801
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:53,958
l really miss that taste

802
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:07,708
Yes, V. Tell me

803
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:11,917
Yes, it's going well

804
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:14,458
l'm not sure

805
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,750
l'm not sure means
l'm not sure, l don't know

806
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,500
Look V, l can't work
with deadlines anymore

807
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:24,667
When l'm done, l'll tell you .
Until then, quit hassling me

808
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,333
- Please take off your T-shirt!
- Cut it out

809
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:37,750
Yes?

810
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:40,083

813
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:50,500
Now? lt's almost midnight

814

You finish your filthy job,

819
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,333
Madam, this is a large area

820
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,917
Two men cover it

821
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:33,792
There's one of the workers

822
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:23,042
This is my last letter

823
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:27,208
l don't know whether it will reach you

824
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:34,375
May Allah keep you
in health and happiness

825
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,417
This is my last letter

826
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,875
l don't know whether
it will reach you

827
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,417
May Allah keep you
in health and happiness

828
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,792
Don't be angry with me

829
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,583
l've tried my best

830
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:20,667
Explain to Mum and Dad as well

831
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,583
Brother

832
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:08,917
Move...

833
01:25:20,667 --> 01:25:22,875
You have to be strong for your mother

834
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:29,417
Don't worry son, we are here for you

835
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:10,708
We are here to see the apartment

836
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:13,125
- May we look around?
- Yes

837
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,042
Hello Aunty, l was wondering
if l could leave this packet

838
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,208
for your neighbour, Mr. Arun

839
01:29:50,292 --> 01:29:51,958
How did it happen?

840
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:55,750
A fight between the two gangs

841
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:58,625
Salim became the scapegoat

842
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,875
- Did you go to the cops?
- You kidding?

843
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:03,208
They buried Salim within hours,

844
01:30:03,292 --> 01:30:06,708
and moved us to
this apartment in Jogeshwari

845
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:08,917
What would the cops do anyway?

846
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:11,208
They'd harass us, not them

847
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,792
Brother, help me out

848
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:18,750
Any bit role

849
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,042
The family is my responsibility now

850
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:22,833
Can't you see!

851
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:40,167
Are you angry with me?

852
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:45,083
You 've been avoiding my calls.
Have you changed your number?

853
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,708
Salim is dead

854
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:01,583
They say he was
knocked down by a train

855
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:06,708
Bastards. Killed the brother l had

856
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:27,542
All this happened and you didn't tell me?

857
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:32,333
Aren't we friends?

858
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:37,208
Of course! We are friends!

859
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:49,958
And now l can't find Arun either

860
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,750
Bloody painter

861
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:58,292
You fancy him, don't you ?

862
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,750
He must have gone to Australia
to his ex-wife

863
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:10,500
Who knows?
They might get back together.

864
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:12,708
They have a son too

865
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:18,875
So. . .

866
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:20,625
Call me sometime

867
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:23,542
Keep in touch...
