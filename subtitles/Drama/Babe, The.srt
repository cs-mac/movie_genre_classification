[ Narrator ] This is a tale about
an unprejudiced heart...

and how it changed our valley
forever.

There was a time
not so long ago...

5
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:44,112
when pigs were afforded no respect
except by other pigs.

They lived their whole lives
in a cruel and sunless world.

7
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:08,321
In those days, pigs believed that
the sooner they grew large and fat,

the sooner they'd be taken
into pig paradise.

What's got into you? I just finished
tellin' what a nice young pig you be.

467
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:36,854
Maa, I was just trying
to be a sheepdog.

Hah! Enough wolves
in the world already...

You haven't got it in ya,

You and I are descended
from the great sheepdogs.

as all that was betrayed.

- All the greater the insult.

I'm sorry I bit you.
Are you all right?

477
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,494
I wouldn't call that a bite, myself. You
got teeth in that floppy mouth or just gums?

Ahh. Heart of gold.

No need for all this

All right,
how did you do it?

487
00:44:19,813 --> 00:44:22,563
I asked them, and they did it.
I asked them nicely.

We don't ask sheep, dear.
We tell them what to do.

00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:28,225
I did, Mom.
They were really friendly.

490
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:32,691
Maybe Rex might be a little more
friendly if I had a talk with him.

No, no, no.
You better leave that to me.

I know it was hard
for you today...

watching all that happening.

But surely it's not worth
all this misery.

[ Narrator ] A dark cloud
had descended on the valley.

And the pig felt that
the troubles were all his fault.

But he was certain that he knew
how to put things right again.

- I don't see that myself.

513
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:39,797
[ Mrs. Hoggett ]
No. So what should we do?

514
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:44,343
You can keep him locked up
or... snip, snip. I can do it Tuesday.

No.

00:46:46,761 --> 00:46:48,221
Or Wednesday.

517
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:52,099
Hoggett doesn't want the dog
operated on. He's a breeding dog.

I can sedate him,
of course,

519

but he'll be useless
as a working dog.

With Rex out of action and Fly injured from
the fight, Farmer Hoggett had no choice.

Maa! Maa! The boss has
to give you some medicine.

Oh, dear, I thought so!
It's horrible stuff, that.

- I know, but it's for the best.
- Young'un, if you say so.

[ Narrator ]
When the thought first came to him,

533
00:48:21,044 --> 00:48:24,255
Farmer Hoggett dismissed it
as mere whimsy.

534

But, like most of his harebrained

- [ Fly ] It's a sheepdog trial.

[ Babe ] So it's like
a competition for sheepdogs?

537
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:43,479
[ Fly ] And their bosses.
It's like an obstacle course.

538
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:45,605
How do they decide
who wins?

539
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:49,984
It's time and mistakes.
You get points for how quick you are.

540
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:52,319
And they take points off
for every mistake.

541
00:48:52,444 --> 00:48:56,114
Every time a sheep goes the wrong way,
that's a mistake and you lose points.

542
00:48:56,197 --> 00:49:01,159
- Looks like fun!
- For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.

543
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:04,579
- Rex and I used to--
- Hmm?

544
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:07,331
Never mind.

545
00:49:07,456 --> 00:49:10,292
Oh.

546
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:13,544
[ Babe ]
Was Rex a champion?

547
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:18,798
[ Fly ] He had the makings of the greatest
champion there ever was, but it wasn't to be.

548
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:23,594
- [ Babe ] What happened?
- [ Fly ] A while back when Rex was in his prime,

549
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:27,347
the winter rains brought
a great flood to the valley.

550
00:49:27,472 --> 00:49:30,766
Rex and the boss got most of
the flock onto the high ground.

551
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,894
Then Rex went back
to look for the strays.

552
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:37,647
He found them. They'd been
stranded by the rising water.

553
00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:43,651
He tried to herd them across
to safety, but they wouldn't budge.

554
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:47,696
Too afraid and too stupid
to save their own skins.

555
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:51,366
It was freezing cold
and the water kept rising.

556
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:55,703
Rex stayed with them
right through the night.

557
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:59,080
By morning,
the sheep were drowned.

558
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:04,168
- And when they found Rex, he was barely alive.
- [ Babe ] Oh, Mom!

559
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,629
[ Fly ] Two weeks rest in front of
the fire saw him back on his feet.

560
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:10,631
But his hearing
was never the same again.

561
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:15,760
He'd never want anyone to know,
but he's almost totally deaf.

562
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:20,514
- Is that why he's so, you know, angry?
- That's not the half of it.

563
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:24,392
[ Fly ] All this was barely a month
before the Grand National Challenge.

564
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:28,812
He tried his best, but he couldn't hear
the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.

565
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:32,523
The cold truth is that,
but for the stupidity of sheep,

566
00:50:32,649 --> 00:50:36,402
Rex would've been
the champion of champions.

567
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,406

Here we go. All right.

Now, through here like this.

And then, big hook to the left.
Big hook.

00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:24,565
Big hook.
Through this gate here.

00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:29,527
[ Narrator ] It was at that time that Mrs.

- Sorry to disturb you.

589

that took the life of a sheep

But Fly could never believe
that Babe was a sheep killer,

so she remained in the field to do something
she'd never done before: talk to the sheep.

something in the crook of one arm.

[ Narrator ] The pig had a vague
memory that shiny tubes produced food,

Fly decided to speak very slowly,

The sheep spoke very slowly...

that his animal was a pig deter him.

He had been worried,
for he was a truthful man,

that the heading might say
"Name of dog."

He's a lively sort of fellow
by the looks of things.

[ Commentator ]
Good heavens!

It's Babe!

- It, uh--
- Hmm.

Oh, beautifully done! I can't
tell you how grateful I am to y'all.

Now, for one last favor.

01:23:54,235 --> 01:23:57,446
If the three ladies with collars
would kindly walk out of the ring,

I'd be very much obliged.

in all the celebration,

929
01:25:50,369 --> 01:25:53,204
in all the hubbub
of noise and excitement,

there were two figures
who stood silent and still...

Yippee! Yippee!

[ Narrator ] And though every single human
in the stands or in the commentary boxes...

936
01:26:13,929 --> 01:26:17,515
was at a complete loss
for words,

937
01:26:17,599 --> 01:26:21,393
the man, who in his life had uttered
fewer words than any of them...

knew exactly what to say.

That'll do, Pig.
