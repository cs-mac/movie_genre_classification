1
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,485
- Name?
- Karen Silkwood.

2
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,659
- Drew Stephens.
- Dolly Pelliker.

3
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:02,607
Hi, Ham.

4
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,280
- Good-bye.
- All right.

5
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,025
All right, see you.

6
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:55,152
So then the woman got up...

7
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:57,971
and she was dressed
in a long white dress...

8
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,411
just like an angel.

9
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,380
And she called for the people
to come on up...

10
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:06,764
and this kid came up
with an arm...

11
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:09,675
that was almost pitch black
from blood poisoning.

12
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:12,238
But that woman held that arm...

13
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:14,165
and she prayed over it...

14
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:17,329
and it turned pink
right in front of your eyes.

15
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:20,268
And then it fell right off.

16
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,350
I was there, Wesley.

17
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,333
I was sitting right there.

18
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:27,669
When I was in the service,
I saw this gook...

19
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,710
drink a glass of milk
through his pecker.

20
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,823
What? Then what happened?

21
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,903
Didn't follow him home
to find out.

22
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:40,016
This is dry processing...

23
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:41,778
the heart of
the production process.

24
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:43,091
Come on in, trainees.

25
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,535
This brown powder
you see here...

26
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:50,423
is mixed plutonium
and uranium oxide.

27
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:52,278
And these trained technicians...

28
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:55,160
are fabricating it
into fuel pellets.

29
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,305
Karen, could you explain...

30
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:58,002
the procedures
in this glove box?

31
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:02,098
Yeah. What we're doing is
we're blending and mixing...

32
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:05,715
the plutonium and uranium oxide
into correct ratios.

33
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:08,120
And then we sift it
for impurities.

34
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:11,000
And then it's fed
into the slugging press...

35
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,920
which makes the pellets.

36
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,960
This is the slugging press...

37
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,719
where the powder
is turned into pellets.

38
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:21,583
What about radiation effects
from all this material?

39
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,698
We've all seen a poor guy...

40
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,396
suffering
the effects of sunburn.

41
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,441
Radiation is like that.

42
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:29,238
It's the kind of thing
that can't hurt you...

43
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:31,183
unless you're careless with it.

44
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:38,002
Hey, Wesley?

45
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:41,458
Come here. I need the help
of a trained technician here.

46
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:44,976
Come here.

47
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:49,267
Put it back in!

48
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:55,511
Hey, Georgie. You know
that ol' girl Jeane Dixon...

49
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,205
the one with the stars
on her palms?

50
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:59,349
She was on Johnny Carson
one night...

51
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,493
and she's telling
how her niece phoned her up.

52
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:04,980
Niece goes, "I got to catch
this airplane to Houston."

53
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,482
And Jeane Dixon goes...

54
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:08,182
"Now, don't you get on
that airplane."

55
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,075
And by golly,
that airplane crashed.

56
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,286
What do you make of that?

57
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,234
She's got the gift, all right.

58
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:15,218
Or maybe she just
tells everybody she knows...

59
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,202
not to get on planes,
and then one day...

60
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:19,187
one crashes
and that's her lucky day.

61
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:20,886
Drew says he's got
to work an hour overtime...

62
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,169
so he can't leave till 7:00.

63
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,507
OK. Shit!
I forgot to get permission.

64
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,541
I don't know.
I believe in that stuff.

65
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,523
Sometimes it happens
where I know things.

66
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:31,900
Can you tell if
I'm getting this weekend off?

67
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,421
- Go see my kids?
- It don't work like that.

68
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:38,488
I can't sit here
and find out just anything.

69
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:41,909
I have to wait for it
to smack into me.

70
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,372
- Lunch!
- I got to find Hurley.

71
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:46,748
Karen,
you never monitor yourself.

72
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:47,992
Come back here
and do it like the rest of us.

73
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,557
"Karen,
you never monitor yourself."

74
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:50,907
I'll get you, girl.

75
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:53,812
Know what happens to girls
that don't monitor themselves?

76
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,709
Your nipples turn green.

77
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,362
There's nothing they can do.

78
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,254
Where they going to park
a contaminated truck?

79
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:10,175
It'll stay that way
twenty-five thousand years.

80
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,793
They can put it in space.
Hell, put it in orbit.

81
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,134
- Yeah, in orbit.
- Put it on the moon.

82
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,272
- What's going on?
- They cooked a truck.

83
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,621
There was a leak
in one of the barrels.

84
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:19,801
Dolly tell you
I have to work late?

85
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,393
Yeah.
The whole weekend's screwed up.

86
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:25,848
I forgot to get permission.
Now I can't find Hurley.

87
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,066
You better find him.

88
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:29,439
Heard those guys on the truck
didn't monitor themselves.

89
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,966
That's a surprise.

90
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:36,060
- New guy in X-ray.
- See y'all later.

91
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:38,202
- What's his name?
- OK. Take care.

92
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:42,103
Winston something.
Do you like him?

93
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:45,112
As a matter of fact,
he's the type I hate.

94
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:47,520
Curtis, what is that?

95
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:49,855
Gilda's got some recipe
from a magazine...

96
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,824
about putting pineapple
in everything.

97
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:54,720
She puts pineapple in pineapple.

98
00:06:58,562 --> 00:06:59,708
What you got?

99
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,171
What do you want?

100
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,049
- Mystery meat.
- It's no mystery.

101
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,356
What's that?
Peanut butter again?

102
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,304
Lay off my sandwich.

103
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,985
I don't want that.

104
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,513
- Hey, Thelma.
- Hi, honey.

105
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:25,757
How's your daughter doing?

106
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,643
She's had
one of them remissions.

107
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:31,043
If you believe in them.

108
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,377
Thank the Lord I got six others.

109
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:39,971
Mr. Hurley?

110
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:41,531
I hear you want the weekend off.

111
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:43,645
- I know it's late.
- We can't give it to you.

112
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,540
This plant's operating
24 hours a day on a deadline.

113
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,460
- You know that.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:49,859
How about if I get somebody
to switch with me?

115
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:52,032
Most people are working
a double shift now.

116
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,852
So, anyway...

117
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:03,168
don't everybody
volunteer at once.

118
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:07,483
We have a revival, Karen.

119
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:12,742
And you?

120
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:15,873
Jimmy and me are going
to Oklahoma City for a concert.

121
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,738
Curtis would have a fit.

122
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:28,096
Promised my kid
I'd take him to Gar Creek.

123
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:36,863
How about you, Carl?

124
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:38,659
I got to work myself.

125
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,578
- What the hell was that?
- It's a test.

126
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:45,990
How do you know?

127
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:50,501
This is a test.
This is only a test.

128
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:52,031
You always say that.

129
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,942
You know some poor son
of a bitch got his ass fried.

130
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:56,807
What I don't get is
how we have all these tests...

131
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:58,368
but never go through the drill.

132
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,100
If this was a real
airborne contamination...

133
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:01,828
we're supposed
to get out of here.

134
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,653
We can't do the drill.

135
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,787
It might stop production
for ten minutes.

136
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:09,159
If it had been the real thing,
they'd shut down the plant...

137
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:11,527
and I could have had
the whole weekend.

138
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:20,680
Karen, I've been thinking.

139
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:23,496
If you'll work
the next shift back-to-back...

140
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,702
I'll switch with you.

141
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,471
Don't tell Curtis, hear?

142
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:31,205
You mean Curtis
still doesn't like me?

143
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:33,250
No, but you know how he is.

144
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,556
What are they doing
to that truck?

145
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,182
Move on out, OK?

146
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:26,188
You coming, or aren't you?

147
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:36,618
What's there to do down there?

148
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:39,854
Nothing. There's nothing
to do down there.

149
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,799
All right. I'll come.

150
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,782
She's coming!

151
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:49,841
It's not going to be a party,
so don't blame me.

152
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:34,287
It stinks around here.

153
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:38,154
That's home. That's what I left.

154
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:50,538
They'll be back
in a little while.

155
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,654
Just went to get some beer.

156
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:04,235
This is great, Linda.

157
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,387
Come on. Come on in.

158
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:20,147
Oh, boy.

159
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:23,412
You look so big.

160
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:25,814
Go on. Say hi to your mama.

161
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,848
Donny, come here.

162
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:31,157
Denise, Donny,
come sit over here.

163
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,493
Donny? Donny, come.

164
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:34,772
It's OK, son. Go ahead.

165
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:38,197
That's such a pretty dress.

166
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:40,371
I know. Linda made it for me.

167
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:44,592
Did you get that baseball
I sent you?

168
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:46,388
You all remember Drew?

169
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:53,560
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Where were you, Mama?

170
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:54,803
I was up near Oklahoma City.
I told you that.

171
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:57,688
- Are you Mama?
- I'm Mama. That's right.

172
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,957
Mama's going to take you
to the beach for the weekend.

173
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:01,400
Am I going?

174
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:04,117
You're going,
and we'll stay in a motel...

175
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:06,357
and get those little pieces
of soap all wrapped up...

176
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:07,888
You should have talked to me.

177
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:11,443
I got the weekend off.
I'm taking them out to Daddy's.

178
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,803
I talked to Linda.

179
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:16,751
You should have talked to me.

180
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:25,944
You can take them out
for a while if you want to.

181
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,142
Scoot through.

182
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:35,959
What am I supposed to eat here?

183
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,167
- French fries.
- Shit.

184
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:40,756
Don't say that, Dolly.

185
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:47,284
Donny,
you're not eating anything.

186
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:50,707
- I've got to use the bathroom.
- Go ahead.

187
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:52,242
Mom, can I buy a coke?

188
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,138
OK. Here you go.

189
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:03,962
Drew, you help Tammy.
Nobody'll see her up there.

190
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,583
- I couldn't go.
- You couldn't go.

191
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:21,785
Do you still sleep with Mama?

192
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:24,989
Shit!

193
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,931
Don't say that, Mama.

194
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:28,884
Don't drip it in my fries!

195
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,791
Old McDonald had a farm

196
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:39,002
E- l-E-l-O

197
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,468
Yeah, here we are.

198
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:42,966
All right, Tammy,
don't forget your moose.

199
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:48,822
Drew, help me get her out
of the back seat, will you?

200
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:52,159
One, two, three!

201
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,621
Good girl!

202
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,668
What you got?

203
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Kiss your mama. That a girl.

204
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,280
I don't want to!

205
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,320
I'll see you next month.

206
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:08,702
Take them in.

207
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,932
Pete, did you give her
our new address?

208
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,325
All I know is Midland, Texas,
care of the company.

209
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,368
- Midland?
- Yeah.

210
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:23,776
Big strike near
the New Mexico border.

211
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:43,386
I just can't picture it.

212
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:45,947
What?

213
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,819
How long were you
married to him?

214
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:53,505
You want to hear
something funny?

215
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,262
How about some for the back?

216
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:02,146
We ran off to get married.

217
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:06,206
We heard you could get a license
in Louisiana under-age.

218
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:08,480
But we couldn't,
so we came home...

219
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:11,385
we told everybody
we got married.

220
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:14,494
And we never did.

221
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,320
I thought you were divorced.

222
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:22,622
We're divorced, all right.

223
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,337
How come you got divorced
if you never got married?

224
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:28,315
Common law.

225
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:34,239
Goddamn government
fucks you coming and going.

226
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,155
Amazing grace

227
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:54,460
How sweet the sound

228
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:57,349
That saved

229
00:17:57,382 --> 00:18:05,118
A wretch like me

230
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:09,948
I once was lost

231
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:15,621
But now I'm found

232
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:18,339
Was bound

233
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:28,163
But now I'm free

234
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,079
I had them in the car.

235
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,804
I could have just headed
straight for Oklahoma.

236
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:46,437
What would you
have done with them?

237
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:54,754
I don't know.

238
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,674
Joe... from the concert.

239
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,931
Hi. What you doing?

240
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:33,544
We did a job out here
the other night, buried a truck.

241
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,106
Sure you did.

242
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:36,838
Yeah. We had a hot truck.

243
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,763
We chopped it up, put it
in these little baggies...

244
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:39,941
and they sent it off
to be buried.

245
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Friday night?
Yeah, I saw that.

246
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,282
Some bozo was here
barking at everybody.

247
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:47,526
See you.

248
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:49,862
What did he want?

249
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,809
He's a friend of Wesley's.

250
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,176
My windshield wipers broke.

251
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:02,759
You think you could ask Drew
to take a look at it?

252
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:07,205
He's got two cars ahead of you,
but I'll ask him.

253
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,929
Thelma,
your hair looks different.

254
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:13,282
I gave my daughter my good wig.
Her hair is falling out.

255
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:15,235
They give her them treatments.

256
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:21,446
Do you know they're making
my daughter die...

257
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,907
next to a colored person?

258
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:28,871
Come here. Go like that.

259
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,621
There.

260
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,670
I like your hair
that color, Thelma.

261
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,580
But this here is my bad wig.

262
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,663
It ain't human hair or nothing.

263
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:44,484
You and Drew
ought to settle down.

264
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:47,561
Stop people talking about us.

265
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,534
I don't care about that stuff.

266
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:53,129
- What stuff?
- The pot.

267
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,917
Yeah. The pot.

268
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:58,440
And the kind of sex.

269
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:03,914
The kind of sex.

270
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:11,558
Oh, God.

271
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,007
Gilda, how did it go?

272
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:19,436
We had to go to my
mother-in-law's after church.

273
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:21,448
She served up this casserole...

274
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,977
that she'd been
slow cooking for three days.

275
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,249
We've both been
up sick all night.

276
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:30,096
You were supposed
to work my shift yesterday!

277
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,058
Karen, they shut down.

278
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:36,848
Say what?

279
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:39,086
There was a contamination
in our section.

280
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:41,995
When?

281
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,944
Right after you left.

282
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:49,617
Karen, I'm not saying this
to upset you...

283
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,717
but you ought to know
they're saying that you did it.

284
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:55,854
I did it?

285
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:57,866
They knew you wanted
the weekend off.

286
00:21:57,907 --> 00:21:59,762
Gilda, that is so dumb.

287
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,705
I know.

288
00:22:39,573 --> 00:22:42,126
I hope you enjoyed
your weekend, Karen.

289
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,037
Shit!

290
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:55,665
Monitor yourself on the way out.

291
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:19,598
Did you hear about this thing?

292
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:22,988
Why don't we talk
about it at lunch?

293
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:25,585
I hate people
talking about me that way.

294
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:28,788
Then quit and
live on your savings.

295
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,607
Somebody contaminated
your section.

296
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,877
Why would anybody
think I did it?

297
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,433
Whoever did,
it wasn't funny.

298
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:38,196
I brung your plastic, Drew.

299
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,542
Thanks, Zachary.

300
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:42,359
You could have done it
a lot easier than I could've.

301
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:44,597
Anybody could have done it.

302
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,160
Well, it wasn't me!

303
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:48,657
Here's Quincy.
Here's the head of the union.

304
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,966
Talk to him. The union
will get you out of this.

305
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:52,376
Yeah, sure, OK.

306
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,101
The company has
got to blame somebody...

307
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:55,447
otherwise, it's their fault.

308
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,116
What are you looking at,
Zachary?

309
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,760
Get lost, OK?

310
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,917
Karen, you ever thought
of going into politics?

311
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,714
I am really not interested.

312
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:49,302
Come on. Try Karen.

313
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:52,435
Asshole.

314
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:01,975
No! I'm scared!

315
00:25:02,013 --> 00:25:04,828
I'm scared!
I don't want to die. No!

316
00:25:04,861 --> 00:25:07,829
Just stay calm. Come on.

317
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:20,730
Thelma's cooked.

318
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:23,548
I said Thelma is cooked.

319
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,176
Shit.

320
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:29,400
Did they take her
down to decon yet?

321
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,584
I think so.

322
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:42,459
- You can't go in there.
- Come on, Earl!

323
00:25:42,495 --> 00:25:44,732
Karen! Get on out of there!

324
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,556
She wants me here.

325
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:50,111
Oh, God!

326
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:52,511
This is just to take off
the contamination.

327
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:55,097
I was doing a transfer...

328
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,111
and they must have had
a leak in them!

329
00:25:57,152 --> 00:26:01,244
When I went through
the check, I was hot!

330
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,568
The exposure that you got...

331
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,267
is under
the acceptable body burden.

332
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:09,207
I'm going to get cancer.
I'm going to die.

333
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:11,289
Now, Thelma.

334
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,639
I know something about this.

335
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:14,561
So does Earl know something.

336
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:17,376
What would he know?
He's a vet.

337
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,133
That's what he was trained at!

338
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,195
Thelma, you're OK. There is
no internal contamination.

339
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,209
There's just a little
external contamination...

340
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,137
and we've taken care
of the problem.

341
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:33,313
Oh, my skin.

342
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:35,135
My skin hurts.

343
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:39,327
Honey, try not to cry.
Salt's going to make it worse.

344
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,700
Hell, you can make money
on any kind of place...

345
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,779
as long as it wasn't
too far from town.

346
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,503
There aren't that many mechanics
who know sports cars.

347
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,263
Where you gonna get the money?

348
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,504
Guess I'll have to sell my body.

349
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,427
I'll give you
five bucks for it...

350
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,111
but I'll think of it
as a charitable contribution.

351
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:07,675
That's beautiful.

352
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,505
What are you going to
call your place?

353
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,544
Drew's.

354
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,490
That's original.

355
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,420
What's your idea?

356
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:18,340
Lillian's.

357
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:21,635
Drew's Car Repair
and Live Bait Dealership.

358
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,572
Thought I'd keep a few worms
for a sideline.

359
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:27,101
Drew's Car Repair
and Live Bait Dealership.

360
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,051
Rolls right off your tongue.

361
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:37,727
What is this?

362
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,859
Spaghetti.

363
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:44,895
Yeah, I can see that.

364
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:48,513
You wrap this stuff
up in aluminum foil.

365
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,078
You don't even know what it is.

366
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,574
It sits in the refrigerator
and grows cooties.

367
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:54,273
One third of
the refrigerator is mine.

368
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:55,970
I can grow cooties
if I want to.

369
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,112
When you do, one third
of the cooties is mine.

370
00:27:58,151 --> 00:27:59,526
Dolly, look at the floor.

371
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,348
It's just seeds, Karen.

372
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:03,522
I don't care what it is!
I just cleaned up!

373
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,377
See you around the track.

374
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,202
Thelma says
she's going to get cancer.

375
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,735
If anybody's going to get
cancer around here...

376
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:28,126
it's going to be me,
Dolly Trashbags.

377
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:30,057
Everything isn't about you.

378
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:36,063
If anybody around here
is going to get cancer...

379
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:38,658
we're all going to get cancer.

380
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:30,625
How long have I been
at Kerr McGee?

381
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,330
Two years in October.

382
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:45,863
Thelma only got 24 DPMs.

383
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:49,930
Is that bad?

384
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:52,300
It's not super bad.

385
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,381
Are you just waking up to this?

386
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,269
You think we're working
with puffed wheat?

387
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:02,723
I'm just asking a question.

388
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:05,700
If you're really worried
about it, stop smoking.

389
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,042
Come on. Let's go to bed.

390
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,076
Let's go to bed.

391
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:24,903
You getting bored with it?

392
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:43,401
Come on.

393
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:19,153
Didn't you go to bed yet?

394
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,470
I'm sorry I yelled at you
last night.

395
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:44,242
I love you, Karen.

396
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:48,335
I love you, too.

397
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:52,083
I don't mean "I love you, too."

398
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:59,310
I know that's not what you mean.

399
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:02,701
That's what I mean.

400
00:32:03,892 --> 00:32:05,201
We'd better go.

401
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:16,018
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

402
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:25,039
I saw Thelma this morning.

403
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:26,605
Thelma hasn't had
her mind on her work...

404
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:28,555
since her daughter took sick.

405
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:31,598
It's terrible what they do
when they scrub a person.

406
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:35,184
I've been through it.
It ain't so bad.

407
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:38,518
Did she have just external,
or was it internal?

408
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,682
- Just external.
- They give her a nasal smear?

409
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,694
That's how they tell
about the internal.

410
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:45,557
No, I don't think so.

411
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:48,722
Shoot, I knew that!
Why didn't I think of that?

412
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,614
They should've given her
a nasal smear.

413
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:52,305
You can't think of everything.

414
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:54,645
Boy, they didn't even
give her a nasal smear!

415
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,527
- Why are you so interested?
- Huh?

416
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,342
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

417
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:05,744
Karen, I got one for you.

418
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:10,519
For as long as
anyone could remember...

419
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:12,374
this Indian chief
was in charge...

420
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,994
of naming all the children
that were born in the tribe.

421
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:18,829
One day, this brave
comes up to him and says...

422
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,458
"Chief, can I ask you something?

423
00:33:21,496 --> 00:33:23,384
"How do you name these children?

424
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,067
"How do you
think of their names?"

425
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:29,040
And the chief says,
"It's very simple.

426
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:30,804
"When a child is born...

427
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:33,175
"and I see
snow gently falling...

428
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,717
"I say, you shall be called
Snow Gently Falling.

429
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:41,977
"And when a child is born
and I see a hawk flying over...

430
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,068
"I say, you shall be named
Hawk Flying Over.

431
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:49,619
"But tell me, Two Dogs Fucking,
why are you so interested?"

432
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:02,389
That's terrible.

433
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:07,541
Thelma, did they give you
a nasal smear?

434
00:34:08,828 --> 00:34:10,802
You make them
give you a nasal smear.

435
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:13,910
They're supposed to.
Make Hurley give you one.

436
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:16,217
And make him tell you the count!

437
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,140
And make sure
he's telling you the truth...

438
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:20,725
because there's
a lot of liars around here.

439
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:26,779
Nice going.

440
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:36,601
Happy birthday to you

441
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:38,579
That's beautiful!

442
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:41,556
It's got my name on it.
Look at that.

443
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:44,019
- Wait a minute.
- Finally, you're twenty-one.

444
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:46,003
There's your happy birthday hat.

445
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:48,893
A happy birthday to you.

446
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,616
A present, too?
This is too much.

447
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:52,509
Look at the way
they decorated this.

448
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,550
Open it up.

449
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,964
Be careful, Gilda. It's hot.

450
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:58,038
- Hot?
- I didn't see this.

451
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:01,307
- Oh, look!
- Look at that!

452
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:03,895
Check this out, Georgie.

453
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,145
- Take it off.
- Oh, my Lord.

454
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:09,306
- Panties, too, ma'am.
- Put it on, Gilda.

455
00:35:09,343 --> 00:35:11,677
Oh, my Lord, Curtis'd kill me.

456
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:14,613
I want to know what's under
them little bows.

457
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:17,525
Here's your piece.
Goddamn, this cake is just...

458
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:23,710
It's Gilda's birthday,
Mr. Hurley.

459
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:25,566
Would you like a piece of cake?

460
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,509
Who brought the cake in?

461
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:33,081
We are three months late
on this contract.

462
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,324
The day we deliver
the last fuel rod to Hanford...

463
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,044
we'll only be
one million dollars in the hole.

464
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,509
The contract
isn't going to be renewed...

465
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:43,197
and none of us will have a job.
Even this is taking time.

466
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,469
Clean those crumbs up
after your shift.

467
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,068
I get to clean up after you
for a change.

468
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:06,172
Have a good time!

469
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,414
It's like staying after school.
I don't know.

470
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,865
- Karen was a bad girl.
- Oh, God.

471
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:22,627
You bring one of these
in every week...

472
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:25,958
and leave it on the shelf
just outside the locker room.

473
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,227
We'll monitor them
for radiation.

474
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:31,653
I'm supposed
to pee in it at home.

475
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:33,213
That's right.

476
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:06,116
My hair feels awful.

477
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:14,919
I wish I had some of
that conditioner around.

478
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:21,216
I'm going to call my mama,
tell her to send some up.

479
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,527
She called me the other day.

480
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,743
She said...

481
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:38,823
"Karen Gay, I been thinking
about your nails."

482
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:41,887
"How are your nails?"

483
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:46,336
"You taking care of them?
You been biting them?"

484
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:54,247
I said, "Oh, boy, I'm taking
good care of them, Mama."

485
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:59,621
"Don't cut the cuticles, now,
you hear?"

486
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:03,237
I wish I could
take care of you better.

487
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:15,717
I remember...

488
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:18,025
in high school
her saying to me...

489
00:39:18,061 --> 00:39:20,265
"Now, what'd you want
to go and sign up...

490
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,122
"for that science class for?

491
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:25,637
"There's no girls
in that science class.

492
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,717
"Why don't you take Home Ec?

493
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:30,146
"That's the way to meet
the nice boys."

494
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:37,803
I said, "Mama,
there ain't no boys in Home Ec.

495
00:39:37,837 --> 00:39:41,220
"Boys are in the science class."

496
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,815
She hated it
when I said "ain't."

497
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:48,523
Yakety, yakety, yak.

498
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:49,703
At least he doesn't talk...

499
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:52,198
when he doesn't have
something to say.

500
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:00,750
Who?

501
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,565
My daddy.

502
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:33,066
Does that hurt?

503
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:45,418
I can't stay away from you.

504
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:49,991
You know that.

505
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:58,124
You can be the biggest bitch
God ever made...

506
00:40:58,162 --> 00:40:59,788
and then you
turn around on me...

507
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:02,281
and you're like this,
and I want to die.

508
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,514
And the next thing I know...

509
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:10,092
you decide about me
not having socks on...

510
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:13,709
the day before,
and you throw a fit.

511
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:16,872
It's not that, Drew.

512
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:21,138
- You know.
- I know.

513
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:27,052
I know what it is.

514
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,009
I know all about you.

515
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:42,922
You do, don't you?

516
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,761
Poor old Drew.

517
00:43:24,442 --> 00:43:25,969
Haul ass, you guys.

518
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,880
I gotta take my own car.
I'm working a double shift.

519
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,552
This says...

520
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:41,850
This says all that stuff
about acceptable levels...

521
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:44,022
it's all bullshit.

522
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:45,466
What is?

523
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,730
Well, it says here...

524
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:51,446
"Plutonium gives you cancer."

525
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:53,851
Says it flat out.

526
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:56,469
Where'd you get that?

527
00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:59,606
It came in all that union stuff
from Washington.

528
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:01,138
You got one.
Everybody got one.

529
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,424
Hurley works there.

530
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,282
Think he'd work there
if he was going to get cancer?

531
00:44:04,316 --> 00:44:09,074
Listen to this...
"genetic damage."

532
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:10,426
Meaning what?

533
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,460
Meaning it goes on down
into your kids.

534
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:15,289
It says here...

535
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:20,214
"Gross physical
and mental defects."

536
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:22,162
I already got them.

537
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:32,051
Boy, I missed you.

538
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:37,084
How many more nights
you gotta work?

539
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:38,394
A couple.

540
00:44:40,414 --> 00:44:42,781
You got transferred.

541
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:43,894
I what?

542
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:47,001
Posted it this morning
as I was leaving.

543
00:44:47,038 --> 00:44:48,948
You're in metallography.

544
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:51,773
What?

545
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:54,458
- Metallography?
- That's what it said.

546
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:59,067
That'll take me three months
to requalify for overtime!

547
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:02,551
Shit! I love that!

548
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,795
Hurley throws a fit how
we're late on the contracts...

549
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:06,326
then he transfers me out?

550
00:45:06,368 --> 00:45:07,677
The union going
to help me out now?

551
00:45:07,712 --> 00:45:11,389
I'm one of
the best people he's got.

552
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:14,326
I got transferred
to metallography.

553
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:17,401
Metallography, with Winston?

554
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:21,851
Now...

555
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:24,992
them little gray pellets
you've been making...

556
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:27,708
are put into
those long fuel rods...

557
00:45:27,745 --> 00:45:31,094
and the long fuel rods
are packed into bundles...

558
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:35,479
over at
your friend Drew's section.

559
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:39,995
And after the weld is made,
they take a slice out of it...

560
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:42,553
and they make a cross section.

561
00:45:42,594 --> 00:45:44,449
So, what your job is...

562
00:45:44,481 --> 00:45:47,678
is to mount
that cross section over here.

563
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,774
And then you grind it,
and you polish it.

564
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:59,356
And here's where
you take a picture of it.

565
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:01,980
And then you develop it
in the darkroom.

566
00:46:02,018 --> 00:46:05,401
Then I inspect the negative for
any imperfections in the weld...

567
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:08,061
and if it's OK,
we pass on that lot...

568
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,133
and they get shipped out.

569
00:46:15,683 --> 00:46:18,367
You're familiar
with developing procedure?

570
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:22,908
Yeah. I am.

571
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:27,771
I got some pictures in here.

572
00:46:27,812 --> 00:46:30,114
They're all backed up, so...

573
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:31,392
why don't you
get to work on them...

574
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:34,275
and then tomorrow
I'll be glad...

575
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:36,643
to go over the polishing
procedure with you.

576
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:40,219
Great.

577
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:05,279
What are you doing?

578
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:10,973
I'm looking at you.

579
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:13,862
What are you doing
to the negative?

580
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:15,902
Sometimes when
you take a picture...

581
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:17,830
you get these
white spots in there...

582
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:19,772
so we make them go away.

583
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:25,347
Doesn't somebody have to look
at them to make sure they're OK?

584
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:28,548
Me.

585
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,274
Yeah, but I mean...

586
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:35,494
- You mean what?
- How do you...

587
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:40,798
How do you know if
they're just spots?

588
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:42,749
They could be defects
in the weld.

589
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:47,102
No, no, no.
I've already checked the weld.

590
00:47:47,145 --> 00:47:49,828
I'm just putting
beauty marks on them.

591
00:47:49,865 --> 00:47:52,734
Winston,
get away with that thing.

592
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,133
Thank you.

593
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:04,806
I just want to bring y'all
up to date.

594
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,816
Some of you
weren't here last time...

595
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:09,346
and some of you
who were here last time...

596
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,775
aren't here this time,
that's for damn sure.

597
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:17,991
Now, three weeks ago...

598
00:48:18,026 --> 00:48:21,158
the company got enough names
on this petition...

599
00:48:21,194 --> 00:48:24,773
to hold
a decertification election.

600
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,876
I know you all
are confused about this.

601
00:48:27,915 --> 00:48:29,191
What this means is...

602
00:48:29,227 --> 00:48:34,857
that the National
Labor Relations Board...

603
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:36,866
will come in here
and hold an election...

604
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:42,788
where everybody votes whether
to certify or decertify...

605
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:45,217
the union's staying on
in this plant.

606
00:48:46,956 --> 00:48:48,778
Morgan, did I do that right?

607
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,387
What this means...

608
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,940
is that we are in deep shit.

609
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:02,824
What this means is,
if we lose this election...

610
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,177
there ain't going to be
any union at this plant.

611
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:10,083
Nobody standing up for us
against Kerr McGee...

612
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:12,645
which I read
in the newspapers...

613
00:49:12,685 --> 00:49:16,809
is gonna take in
$1.5 billion this year.

614
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:20,109
And which, as you all know...

615
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:22,530
takes about as much time
thinking about our problems...

616
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:24,581
as grease takes
to go through a goose.

617
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:29,699
We gotta do
a lot of work...

618
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:32,327
between now and
the election in October.

619
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:33,773
We lost a lot of members...

620
00:49:33,806 --> 00:49:35,629
since the strike
didn't work out last year.

621
00:49:35,662 --> 00:49:39,208
So now I want to know...

622
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:41,319
who can help me?

623
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,973
They said if you're really
worried about it...

624
00:49:49,007 --> 00:49:51,527
you're welcome to get involved.

625
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:54,055
You could be on the committee.

626
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:56,462
What committee?

627
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,252
Negotiating committee.

628
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,864
- You?
- Yeah.

629
00:50:01,904 --> 00:50:03,911
On the union
negotiating committee.

630
00:50:07,536 --> 00:50:09,608
Karen, let me give you a hint.

631
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:12,495
Don't flash 'em.

632
00:50:12,528 --> 00:50:13,989
It turns you on.

633
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,887
Yeah, but I'm not management.

634
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,768
- I'm as smart as Hurley is.
- Just as tactful.

635
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,419
You sound like my mother.

636
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:24,140
You don't just stand
toe to toe with someone...

637
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:27,047
call him a motherfucker,
and get anywhere.

638
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,247
I'll keep it in mind.

639
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,181
Do you...

640
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:06,671
Do you feel different
about me...

641
00:51:07,796 --> 00:51:09,868
since I got cooked?

642
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:19,055
What do you mean?

643
00:51:19,092 --> 00:51:20,521
You know.

644
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:27,665
Well...

645
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:32,018
I still want to fuck you.

646
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:34,803
I sure as hell don't want
to fuck Thelma anymore.

647
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:39,505
Oh, Jesus.

648
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,332
I'll give you something.

649
00:51:54,102 --> 00:51:56,916
- Where are they?
- They're next door.

650
00:52:08,983 --> 00:52:10,641
Oh, God.

651
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,406
Think you made
enough noise there, Dolly?

652
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:58,071
You two ain't exactly
a silent movie yourself.

653
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,941
This here is Angela.
She's a beautician.

654
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,107
Well, hi there.

655
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:44,848
Personally, I don't see
anything wrong with it.

656
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,802
No. Neither do I.

657
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,085
Guess it figures, doesn't it?

658
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:55,669
I can handle it.

659
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:57,051
Me, too.

660
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,271
So why are we talking about it?

661
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,454
What if we wrote them?

662
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,096
What if we wrote
the national union...

663
00:54:35,134 --> 00:54:36,509
told them
what's going on down here?

664
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:38,430
Maybe they'd help us.

665
00:54:38,462 --> 00:54:41,332
We're not going to win
the election by ourselves.

666
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:44,888
We gotta do something,
I think.

667
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,935
Management is putting up
these memos now...

668
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:48,764
saying no union business
on our breaks.

669
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,622
That's our own time, Quincy.

670
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:55,576
Yeah. They think they can
get away with anything.

671
00:54:55,616 --> 00:54:57,623
I'll see you in the morning.

672
00:55:01,248 --> 00:55:03,518
Sounds like they're trying
to get rid of you.

673
00:55:03,552 --> 00:55:06,618
They're going to get
a big fight if they try.

674
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:10,329
Karen, you ever been downtown?

675
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:11,929
There are two big streets.

676
00:55:11,968 --> 00:55:15,035
One's called Kerr,
and one's called McGee.

677
00:55:15,073 --> 00:55:16,862
And that's how I see it.

678
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,075
They own the state...

679
00:55:18,113 --> 00:55:20,088
they own everybody
in this state...

680
00:55:20,129 --> 00:55:23,872
and they own practically
everybody I work on.

681
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,471
What do you think?

682
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,465
What kind of
make-up base do you use?

683
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:39,579
The kind I always use.

684
00:55:43,522 --> 00:55:48,160
I don't mind somebody taking
my beers if they replace it.

685
00:55:48,194 --> 00:55:50,366
You're making a big deal
out of everything lately.

686
00:55:50,403 --> 00:55:52,410
Everything's going to hell
around here.

687
00:55:52,451 --> 00:55:53,628
Meaning you're out of beer?

688
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:56,056
Meaning you're on
the goddamn phone night and day.

689
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,360
Heavy.

690
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:04,317
What did you do to your face?

691
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:06,298
Doesn't she look great?

692
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:08,827
Looks like a fucking corpse.

693
00:56:09,988 --> 00:56:12,224
That's not very nice.

694
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,293
It's not very nice to make fun
of what a person does.

695
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:20,220
If that's what a beautician
does, I'll take mine rare.

696
00:56:20,261 --> 00:56:24,636
Drew, Angela works at Thayer's.

697
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:28,290
Funeral home?

698
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,748
Hell, why didn't you say so?

699
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:41,185
Drew, I can always tell...

700
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:44,418
when a dead person I beautify
worked for Kerr McGee...

701
00:56:44,454 --> 00:56:48,610
because they all look like
they died before they died.

702
00:56:57,511 --> 00:57:00,260
Why don't you lay off her?

703
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:02,564
Jesus Christ.

704
00:57:05,991 --> 00:57:09,766
I bet there's something to that.

705
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:11,522
To what?

706
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,837
About people looking like
they died before they died.

707
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:17,821
You know, plutonium and all.

708
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:52,707
Drew, what's your opinion?

709
00:57:53,961 --> 00:57:57,223
It's fine.
The other one was fine, too.

710
00:57:57,258 --> 00:57:59,145
They're all fine.

711
00:57:59,178 --> 00:58:00,771
Honey, this is really important.

712
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,533
This is a meeting
with the national union...

713
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,359
and the Atomic Energy
Commission.

714
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:05,769
The national union is paying...

715
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:07,907
for our plane tickets
and our hotel room.

716
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:09,540
He's just jealous.

717
00:58:09,578 --> 00:58:11,334
Is this meeting
in Washington state...

718
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:12,897
or Washington, D. C?

719
00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:14,084
D.C.

720
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:16,227
The one you got on
is much better.

721
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:19,682
OK. I will wear this
to the AEC.

722
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:21,895
And what shall I wear
on the plane?

723
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,786
Something that won't wrinkle.

724
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:27,136
Like a shroud, maybe.

725
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:30,376
I get so tired of your jokes.

726
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:38,273
Sir, would you mind
putting your tray down, please?

727
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,867
Thank you.

728
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:43,273
Thank you.

729
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,587
Thank you.

730
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:50,924
Miss, how much is this?

731
00:58:50,956 --> 00:58:52,331
It comes with your ticket.

732
00:59:04,846 --> 00:59:07,267
We're going to
union headquarters first...

733
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,626
and you'll meet Max Richter,
who runs our Washington office.

734
00:59:10,669 --> 00:59:13,604
Then we'll go over what
you're telling the AEC tomorrow.

735
00:59:13,645 --> 00:59:15,751
Is the company going to
find out about this?

736
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,092
It's highly unlikely.

737
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:21,705
Whenever the AEC Inspector
comes to the plant...

738
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:24,644
anybody says anything to him,
the company finds out.

739
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:28,232
Yeah, right.
Maybe you could bring that up.

740
00:59:28,271 --> 00:59:29,962
Could we stop over there?

741
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:33,774
Excuse me.
Could we stop? Please?

742
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:36,938
Yeah. Sure. OK.

743
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,353
Look this way. Straight ahead.

744
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:43,846
Yeah, that's good. Perfect.

745
00:59:45,264 --> 00:59:48,046
Bobby Beckwith
tore a hole in his glove.

746
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,309
Let me see
if I can read this here.

747
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:53,253
I think it says July the 23rd.

748
00:59:53,296 --> 00:59:55,980
Isn't that about right, Morgan?

749
00:59:56,016 --> 00:59:59,945
Yeah. That was right before
Karen came back...

750
00:59:59,984 --> 01:00:03,280
and they tried to pin
the contamination on her.

751
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:10,602
The plutonium soaked through
his coveralls to his arm.

752
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,746
What the hell
is going on out there?

753
01:00:12,785 --> 01:00:17,968
It's National "Something" Day.

754
01:00:20,274 --> 01:00:22,892
Can't breathe.

755
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:26,159
- What?
- Can't breathe.

756
01:00:26,194 --> 01:00:30,951
There's a lot of stuff here
about the respirators.

757
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,969
We get these contaminations...

758
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:36,556
and sometimes
we got to wear these masks...

759
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:39,726
for a week, 10 days,
sometimes 12 hours a day.

760
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,257
Are you working 12 hours?

761
01:00:41,299 --> 01:00:44,714
They're late on the contract.
Running double shifts.

762
01:00:44,755 --> 01:00:47,602
And they got us working
in these respirators...

763
01:00:47,635 --> 01:00:50,930
and I want to tell you,
it gets real hot.

764
01:00:50,963 --> 01:00:52,905
And they don't fit.

765
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:54,955
I mean, mine doesn't fit.

766
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:58,029
What you people have
brought in today is wonderful.

767
01:00:58,068 --> 01:01:03,949
Excuse me.
I just wanted to say one thing.

768
01:01:03,988 --> 01:01:06,355
That was the thing
about the showers.

769
01:01:06,388 --> 01:01:11,058
There are only two showers
for 75 workers per shift.

770
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:17,257
And it's not really clean.

771
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,912
Everybody wanted me
to say something about that.

772
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:25,204
Right. It's probably best
if we stick to the stuff...

773
01:01:25,237 --> 01:01:26,764
that's really connected
with the radiation.

774
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,657
What about
that contaminated truck?

775
01:01:32,694 --> 01:01:35,345
They cut up this hot truck
and buried it.

776
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,007
Right.
That was in your letter.

777
01:01:37,045 --> 01:01:39,729
I've got to catch my plane.
Paul will take care of you.

778
01:01:39,766 --> 01:01:41,589
The only way
we can get enough votes...

779
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:43,444
to keep the union
in your plant...

780
01:01:43,478 --> 01:01:45,867
is on the health
and safety issue.

781
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,107
So we'll get a couple of
hotshot doctors in to speak.

782
01:01:49,142 --> 01:01:51,248
You keep telling
Paul all this stuff.

783
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,654
And try to get
everything clear...

784
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:56,207
for the AEC tomorrow,
all right?

785
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:59,378
I'll be back in a second.

786
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:00,844
Max?

787
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:06,285
I'm going to go find
a restroom.

788
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:16,258
Excuse me.
There's one more thing.

789
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:18,846
I work in metallography.
In X-rays.

790
01:02:18,886 --> 01:02:22,748
And sometimes we...

791
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:26,084
Quite frankly,
we have negatives altered.

792
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:31,803
The negatives of the welds
in the fuel rods.

793
01:02:31,845 --> 01:02:36,101
They take a weld
and cross section it.

794
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:39,231
Then they photograph it,
and there's a defect.

795
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:42,946
Then they just touch it up.

796
01:02:42,981 --> 01:02:44,868
Touch it up?

797
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,178
With a Pentel pen.
Right on the negatives.

798
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,562
They fill in the white spots.

799
01:02:50,596 --> 01:02:52,800
You're talking about
X- rays of fuel rods?

800
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:55,585
The fuel rods
they're sending up to that...

801
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,817
We're sending up to
that breeder reactor...

802
01:02:58,852 --> 01:03:01,438
they're testing in Hanford.

803
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:04,323
Do you know what that means?

804
01:03:04,355 --> 01:03:06,657
I know they shouldn't do it.

805
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:08,633
Excuse us.

806
01:03:08,675 --> 01:03:11,545
Why don't we go in there?

807
01:03:14,595 --> 01:03:16,253
In an ordinary nuclear plant...

808
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,560
you can have meltdowns,
poisonous gas, and dead people.

809
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:22,391
That's nothing compared to what
can go wrong with a breeder.

810
01:03:22,434 --> 01:03:26,297
You put defective fuel rods
in a breeder reactor...

811
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:30,201
for all we know, the whole
state could be wiped out.

812
01:03:30,242 --> 01:03:32,413
Can you get
documentation of that?

813
01:03:35,586 --> 01:03:37,113
I guess so.

814
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:40,666
If you could get documentation,
that would be very important.

815
01:03:40,705 --> 01:03:43,705
We'll set you up with a reporter
from the "New York Times"...

816
01:03:43,745 --> 01:03:46,614
get the company up against
the wall on negotiations.

817
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,079
But you'd have to have
documentation.

818
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:51,838
I don't know about putting
names in the newspaper.

819
01:03:51,873 --> 01:03:53,083
Names aren't the point.

820
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,455
The point is
that if you're right...

821
01:03:55,489 --> 01:03:57,179
they could kill off
two million people.

822
01:03:57,216 --> 01:04:01,723
There's a moral imperative
involved here.

823
01:04:06,049 --> 01:04:09,496
Think about it.
Talk to Paul.

824
01:04:09,536 --> 01:04:11,511
You look like a standup girl.

825
01:04:11,552 --> 01:04:13,178
I'll be right there.

826
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:32,187
I've never seen
so many bands in my life.

827
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:52,059
All right,
we're going to go over...

828
01:04:52,093 --> 01:04:53,654
your statements
for the AEC meeting.

829
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:56,825
And later, you and I
will go through yours.

830
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:04,726
There was 23 people there,
including us.

831
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:05,877
Of course, I couldn't
take any pictures...

832
01:05:05,918 --> 01:05:07,706
while the meeting
was going on.

833
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:10,108
Just imagine
all these old geezers...

834
01:05:10,141 --> 01:05:12,029
sitting there,
pitchers of water...

835
01:05:12,062 --> 01:05:13,686
and they all looked so bored.

836
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:16,278
It's like they had
heard it all before.

837
01:05:16,317 --> 01:05:20,114
I think the union's
really going to help us now.

838
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:22,970
That doesn't
belong in here at all.

839
01:05:23,004 --> 01:05:27,445
That's one of them slides
you can buy.

840
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:30,300
Oh, hell. May, did you
put them in this order?

841
01:05:30,332 --> 01:05:33,299
I didn't touch them, Quincy.

842
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,115
There's the Lincoln Memorial,
of course.

843
01:05:37,148 --> 01:05:38,903
That's where we stayed.

844
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:40,979
I couldn't get it
all in the picture.

845
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:45,618
You could get dinner
in your room if you wanted...

846
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,147
but we didn't.

847
01:05:50,555 --> 01:05:52,922
I had one of the waiters
take this one.

848
01:05:52,955 --> 01:05:55,476
Who's that guy?

849
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:58,035
That's Paul Stone.
He works for the union.

850
01:05:59,675 --> 01:06:03,253
This is on the way
to the airport.

851
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:05,145
And that's the White House.

852
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:07,154
I wanted to take a picture
of ol' Gerry Ford...

853
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:10,675
cooking his English muffin,
but they wouldn't let us in.

854
01:06:21,913 --> 01:06:24,214
How many people know about
you going to Washington?

855
01:06:24,249 --> 01:06:27,565
Only the people in that room.

856
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:30,326
Quincy and Morgan
know about your spying?

857
01:06:32,633 --> 01:06:33,909
No.

858
01:06:38,073 --> 01:06:40,342
People are going
to lose jobs, Karen.

859
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:43,312
Some of them ought to.

860
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:45,686
There's a moral imperative here.

861
01:06:49,785 --> 01:06:52,784
You going to put
some big story in the papers?

862
01:06:52,824 --> 01:06:53,906
In the "New York Times."

863
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,040
In the "New York Times."

864
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:03,029
Guess that about ties
the package up with a bow.

865
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,284
What's the matter with him?

866
01:07:44,854 --> 01:07:47,820
Some guy in Washington
I should have told him about.

867
01:07:47,861 --> 01:07:51,690
- Is that all?
- No.

868
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,590
What you doing?

869
01:08:14,421 --> 01:08:15,849
Thinking.

870
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:28,657
Thinking. Drinking.

871
01:08:33,139 --> 01:08:34,382
I was just thinking...

872
01:08:34,419 --> 01:08:36,906
if you'd ever quit
and come away with me.

873
01:08:42,194 --> 01:08:45,194
Well, I can't quit now.

874
01:08:45,235 --> 01:08:48,550
That's what I was thinking.

875
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:01,677
It's cold out here.

876
01:09:01,714 --> 01:09:04,365
Come on inside.

877
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:05,863
I quit.

878
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,720
You what?

879
01:09:12,753 --> 01:09:15,120
This afternoon.
Gave my notice.

880
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:17,542
- You quit?
- That's what I said.

881
01:09:21,873 --> 01:09:23,782
This afternoon?

882
01:09:26,673 --> 01:09:28,745
Why didn't you tell me?

883
01:09:31,951 --> 01:09:34,123
I don't know.
I just didn't tell you.

884
01:09:40,048 --> 01:09:42,436
Why'd you quit?

885
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:48,676
I just don't give a shit.

886
01:09:58,287 --> 01:10:00,708
You don't give a shit
if everybody in the plant...

887
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,855
is being poisoned?

888
01:10:24,878 --> 01:10:28,074
Don't give me a problem
I can't solve.

889
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:14,282
Did you take
the Waylon Jennings tapes?

890
01:11:14,314 --> 01:11:16,203
I left them for you.

891
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:18,885
They're yours.
You can take them.

892
01:11:20,554 --> 01:11:22,922
You can keep them, Karen.

893
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:30,820
Take it easy, Dolly.

894
01:12:01,256 --> 01:12:03,973
Drew, come on. Stay.

895
01:12:05,769 --> 01:12:09,029
Sweetheart, it's like
you're two people.

896
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:10,853
I'm in love
with one of them...

897
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:12,578
but the other one's...

898
01:12:12,615 --> 01:12:15,876
Just a general pain in the ass.

899
01:12:54,342 --> 01:12:56,446
I loved it, baby.

900
01:14:05,922 --> 01:14:07,351
What are you doing in there?

901
01:14:15,457 --> 01:14:18,905
What are you doing in my desk?

902
01:14:18,945 --> 01:14:22,392
If I tell you, you'll promise
not to tell anybody?

903
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:28,567
I keep my pills in there,
in that drawer...

904
01:14:28,608 --> 01:14:31,325
because I have an allergy...

905
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:34,459
and they don't let you bring
medication into the plant...

906
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:36,602
so I hid them in there.

907
01:14:38,336 --> 01:14:40,572
I don't believe you.

908
01:14:42,081 --> 01:14:46,422
I think you should take
a person's word for something.

909
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,174
These don't look like
antihistamines to me.

910
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:23,094
Winston,
you know what these are?

911
01:15:23,134 --> 01:15:27,607
These are little
tiny time capsules...

912
01:15:27,646 --> 01:15:31,540
like the ones you see on TV.

913
01:15:31,581 --> 01:15:33,654
They clear up
your nasal passages...

914
01:15:33,693 --> 01:15:37,010
for up to 12 hours straight.

915
01:15:43,645 --> 01:15:46,546
- Excuse me.
- God bless you.

916
01:15:48,478 --> 01:15:50,932
In the coal mines years ago...

917
01:15:50,972 --> 01:15:54,715
they used to put canaries
in the tunnels.

918
01:15:54,749 --> 01:15:56,952
If the canaries dropped dead...

919
01:15:56,988 --> 01:15:58,963
they knew there was a gas leak.

920
01:16:01,052 --> 01:16:03,867
But it's a brand-new industry...

921
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,583
so you're the canaries.

922
01:16:06,621 --> 01:16:09,654
The trouble is, you're not going
to drop dead right away.

923
01:16:09,692 --> 01:16:12,593
It might take ten years.
Twenty. We don't know.

924
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:19,705
Here's what we know...
plutonium causes cancer.

925
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:21,146
Anybody tells you
we don't know...

926
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:24,080
how much plutonium
causes cancer, they're lying.

927
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:25,912
What we don't know...

928
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:30,223
is how little plutonium
causes cancer.

929
01:16:30,266 --> 01:16:31,794
The government says...

930
01:16:31,835 --> 01:16:34,452
that the maximum
permissible body burden...

931
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:37,240
for your lifetime
is 40 nanocuries.

932
01:16:37,274 --> 01:16:39,031
Let me tell you
how much that is.

933
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:44,303
That is a tiny dot
on a piece of paper.

934
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:49,300
We say that's too much.

935
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:55,382
We say that it takes
less than that to kill you.

936
01:16:55,418 --> 01:16:58,036
We don't say
it's twice too much...

937
01:16:58,073 --> 01:16:59,960
or three times too much.

938
01:16:59,993 --> 01:17:06,637
We think that that is
115,000 times too much.

939
01:17:07,993 --> 01:17:11,921
A pollen-sized
grain of plutonium...

940
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,256
injected in mice
causes cancer.

941
01:17:15,288 --> 01:17:20,242
When you inhale it,
and it lodges in your lungs...

942
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:23,696
you're married to cancer.

943
01:17:23,736 --> 01:17:26,486
We've been through
all the training literature...

944
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,519
Kerr McGee hands out
to new employees...

945
01:17:29,559 --> 01:17:32,876
and there's nothing
about cancer.

946
01:17:32,919 --> 01:17:39,312
Did management give you
any literature about cancer?

947
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:42,384
Then you get contaminated,
and they tell you...

948
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:44,245
you've had an acceptable level
of contamination.

949
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,475
I say there's no such thing.

950
01:17:49,558 --> 01:17:51,533
There must be some questions.

951
01:17:57,366 --> 01:18:01,522
Is there any way to get
the plutonium out of you...

952
01:18:01,558 --> 01:18:05,649
if it's inside your lungs?

953
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:10,421
You can take the lung out,
but that's a little extreme.

954
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:22,196
You want to get
something to eat?

955
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:24,235
Very nice meeting you.

956
01:18:24,277 --> 01:18:26,099
Have a good night.

957
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:28,173
That was great.

958
01:18:28,213 --> 01:18:30,546
The union is really in solid.

959
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,468
We don't have to worry about...

960
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,184
How come why didn't we hear
any of this before?

961
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,910
And we didn't see
any of you guys...

962
01:18:36,947 --> 01:18:42,382
until they decided
to vote the union out or not?

963
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,532
If you're
so worried about us...

964
01:18:43,572 --> 01:18:44,816
where the hell were you
in the beginning?

965
01:18:44,852 --> 01:18:47,121
What we're saying
is you need someone...

966
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:48,781
Iooking out for
your health and safety.

967
01:18:48,819 --> 01:18:50,543
The company says
they're taking care of you.

968
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,724
Do you believe that?

969
01:18:51,763 --> 01:18:53,771
- Yeah. I believe that.
- You do?

970
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:55,752
You're the only guy
in that room that still does.

971
01:18:55,794 --> 01:18:57,650
Let me tell you something else.

972
01:18:57,684 --> 01:19:00,017
Doesn't matter if you work
on plutonium or dog food...

973
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:01,611
because
they won't give you a thing.

974
01:19:01,651 --> 01:19:04,750
There's nowhere left to go.
You start causing problems...

975
01:19:04,787 --> 01:19:08,562
and Kerr McGee shuts
that plant down, then what?

976
01:19:08,595 --> 01:19:11,628
You're up in Washington, D.C.

977
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:15,049
We're down here out of work.

978
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,992
Your cancer is a maybe.
That's all it is.

979
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:28,359
- He's just scared.
- Yeah.

980
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:29,995
The meeting was really good.

981
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:34,768
Yeah, look...
I got an early plane, Karen.

982
01:19:34,802 --> 01:19:36,808
Meaning what?

983
01:19:36,849 --> 01:19:40,941
I don't think this is smart,
us getting involved.

984
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:43,497
We already got involved.

985
01:20:11,024 --> 01:20:13,576
Hi. This is Paul Stone.

986
01:20:13,615 --> 01:20:14,728
I'm out right now...

987
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:17,102
but if you leave
a message after the beep...

988
01:20:17,135 --> 01:20:19,884
I'll get back to you.

989
01:20:19,918 --> 01:20:22,341
Hi, this is Karen.

990
01:20:25,102 --> 01:20:27,688
I just wanted
to let you know...

991
01:20:27,727 --> 01:20:31,818
that we won
the union election 80 to 61...

992
01:20:31,854 --> 01:20:34,888
and I'm real happy.

993
01:20:38,349 --> 01:20:40,260
It's real hard
to keep calling you...

994
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:42,026
from a pay phone
if you're never there...

995
01:20:42,062 --> 01:20:46,437
so that's why
I'm calling you from here.

996
01:20:48,045 --> 01:20:51,340
I have some things that...

997
01:20:51,374 --> 01:20:52,803
I really need
to talk to you about...

998
01:20:52,845 --> 01:20:55,495
and I just wish
that I could talk to you.

999
01:20:55,532 --> 01:20:59,908
Been under a lot
of pressure here, boy.

1000
01:20:59,949 --> 01:21:02,370
It's great
we won and everything...

1001
01:21:02,412 --> 01:21:05,675
but just...

1002
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:09,353
Been under really
a lot of pressure, and...

1003
01:21:09,389 --> 01:21:11,658
I don't know.
I feel like I'm...

1004
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:19,145
All alone.

1005
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:26,059
Guess you didn't hear
that last part.

1006
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:43,746
Come on!

1007
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,803
Do you want coffee?

1008
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:10,819
I went to make popcorn
last night...

1009
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:12,450
and there's no Wesson oil.

1010
01:22:12,489 --> 01:22:14,594
So, go get some.

1011
01:22:14,634 --> 01:22:16,160
I'm not in charge
of the Wesson oil...

1012
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:17,795
I'm not in charge
of the shopping.

1013
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,872
I can't do it every time.

1014
01:22:19,913 --> 01:22:23,142
I can't do it this afternoon.
I got a union meeting.

1015
01:22:23,176 --> 01:22:24,605
If you're
talking like that...

1016
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,306
to impress that
outside agitator of yours...

1017
01:22:26,344 --> 01:22:27,773
he ain't here,
so cut the shit.

1018
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:30,751
We can't do the shopping
unless you give us your key.

1019
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,742
What happened to your key?

1020
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:38,118
If we knew that,
we wouldn't need yours.

1021
01:22:38,152 --> 01:22:42,014
- I lost it.
- You lost it.

1022
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:46,016
Leave it under the step.

1023
01:22:46,056 --> 01:22:48,870
What if somebody rapes me
because you lost your key?

1024
01:22:48,903 --> 01:22:51,837
Who's going to rape you
that you ain't already fucked?

1025
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,233
- Hiya, Thelma.
- Hi, honey.

1026
01:23:10,021 --> 01:23:12,324
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

1027
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:14,911
I was trying to get
blood for my daughter...

1028
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:18,365
and Hurley said asking
people at the plant...

1029
01:23:18,406 --> 01:23:20,641
is against union rules.

1030
01:23:20,677 --> 01:23:23,613
Oh, yeah? He said that?

1031
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:32,447
The workers in this plant...

1032
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:35,387
have certified us
as their representatives...

1033
01:23:35,429 --> 01:23:39,203
so we should get started
on some real negotiations.

1034
01:23:39,236 --> 01:23:41,179
I talked to the lawyer
last week downtown.

1035
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:44,603
He said he'd get back
to me on Monday.

1036
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,237
You said that last week.

1037
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:49,986
He hasn't gotten back to me yet.

1038
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,126
Excuse me.

1039
01:23:52,164 --> 01:23:57,728
Mr. Hurley, did you tell
an employee in wet processing...

1040
01:23:57,763 --> 01:24:01,276
that it was against
union rules to give blood?

1041
01:24:03,108 --> 01:24:04,896
I don't recall saying that, no.

1042
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:08,509
Good. Because I just called
the bloodmobile...

1043
01:24:08,547 --> 01:24:10,751
and they can come over
on Tuesday.

1044
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:19,582
No, don't wake them up.

1045
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:21,179
Just...

1046
01:24:23,074 --> 01:24:25,977
Tell them I called again.

1047
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,578
And...

1048
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:31,355
Tell them Mama's OK...

1049
01:24:31,395 --> 01:24:35,104
and I love them...

1050
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,284
and I miss them...

1051
01:24:36,323 --> 01:24:39,420
and I'll come see them
as soon as I can.

1052
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:42,011
Yeah, I know.
I'm not always here...

1053
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:44,319
but we're
working double shifts.

1054
01:24:44,353 --> 01:24:49,110
But Dolly can always
take a message.

1055
01:24:49,153 --> 01:24:51,519
OK.

1056
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,495
Thank you.

1057
01:25:02,912 --> 01:25:04,985
What's the matter?

1058
01:25:05,024 --> 01:25:06,748
Nothing.

1059
01:25:10,976 --> 01:25:12,700
I miss Drew.

1060
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,836
Call him up.

1061
01:25:20,161 --> 01:25:22,232
Angela went back to her husband.

1062
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,250
Gee, Dolly, I'm sorry.

1063
01:25:30,656 --> 01:25:32,062
You OK?

1064
01:25:32,095 --> 01:25:33,950
You could have thought
of that this morning...

1065
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:36,372
before your nineteenth
nervous breakdown.

1066
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:41,847
Don't you lay this off on me.

1067
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:44,756
Anybody else would have
thrown Angela out day one.

1068
01:25:44,799 --> 01:25:47,449
When Drew was here,
you weren't like this.

1069
01:25:47,486 --> 01:25:50,902
You think Angela left
on account of me?

1070
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:53,908
Let me tell you something, girl.

1071
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,594
Drew left on account
of you and Angela.

1072
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:00,477
If you believe that,
you're crazier than people say.

1073
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:02,746
You took about as
good care of Drew...

1074
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:05,018
as you took of your kids.

1075
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:26,518
I know that you took
good care of your kids.

1076
01:26:38,812 --> 01:26:40,721
You know...

1077
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:45,968
the only thing everybody
says I'm crazy about...

1078
01:26:46,011 --> 01:26:48,399
is to live with you.

1079
01:26:53,467 --> 01:26:55,856
You mean with a dyke?

1080
01:26:57,947 --> 01:26:59,834
I mean with a person
who thinks she's in love...

1081
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:04,689
with a person who puts
lipstick on stiffs...

1082
01:27:04,731 --> 01:27:07,633
and smells like formaldehyde.

1083
01:27:07,675 --> 01:27:10,457
She didn't smell
like formaldehyde.

1084
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:13,807
She did so.

1085
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:16,719
And I'm so tired of her jokes.

1086
01:27:30,105 --> 01:27:32,975
You know, maybe...

1087
01:27:33,946 --> 01:27:35,767
maybe Drew is right.

1088
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,505
Maybe we should just quit...

1089
01:27:43,544 --> 01:27:45,912
get out of here.

1090
01:27:45,945 --> 01:27:48,017
Move someplace where it's clean.

1091
01:27:51,704 --> 01:27:53,394
You and me?

1092
01:27:59,384 --> 01:28:01,750
Jesus, Dolly.

1093
01:28:01,783 --> 01:28:03,540
Well...

1094
01:28:41,077 --> 01:28:43,925
Hush-a-bye

1095
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:45,867
Don't you cry

1096
01:28:48,276 --> 01:28:52,368
Go to sleep, you little baby

1097
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:58,036
When you wake

1098
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:01,866
You shall have

1099
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:07,822
All the pretty little horses

1100
01:29:27,156 --> 01:29:30,254
- I don't want it.
- Eat something, Karen.

1101
01:29:33,684 --> 01:29:35,406
I'm not hungry.

1102
01:29:37,682 --> 01:29:40,584
That's just like Curtis.
When he works late...

1103
01:29:40,627 --> 01:29:42,960
he don't get enough sleep
and loses his appetite.

1104
01:29:42,994 --> 01:29:45,678
I've been blending up
these shakes...

1105
01:29:45,715 --> 01:29:47,852
with bananas
and chocolate syrup...

1106
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:50,507
and making him drink them
on the way to work.

1107
01:29:50,546 --> 01:29:52,783
Curtis is out working late?

1108
01:29:52,819 --> 01:29:57,291
- Out partying at the Red Dog.
- Come on, Wesley.

1109
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:00,745
He's been up four nights
in a row flushing out pipes.

1110
01:30:00,785 --> 01:30:02,694
They come up short again.

1111
01:30:02,738 --> 01:30:05,258
They come up short
on plutonium?

1112
01:30:05,297 --> 01:30:07,053
He's telling you
he's working late...

1113
01:30:07,089 --> 01:30:09,740
but he's seeing a hot
little number from Edmond.

1114
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:12,745
Don't forget the banana...

1115
01:30:12,785 --> 01:30:16,615
and you can put in an egg
if you want to.

1116
01:30:16,657 --> 01:30:18,512
They say they were missing
more than a kilo?

1117
01:30:26,032 --> 01:30:27,275
I'll see you later.

1118
01:30:27,312 --> 01:30:30,410
Why are you writing it down?

1119
01:30:30,448 --> 01:30:33,547
The union is supposed
to keep track of these things.

1120
01:30:33,584 --> 01:30:36,618
Am I right? OK. So?

1121
01:30:39,952 --> 01:30:42,472
You won your election.

1122
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:46,984
We are still negotiating
a contract here.

1123
01:30:48,847 --> 01:30:50,822
Well...

1124
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:53,711
Why don't you concentrate
on upping our wages...

1125
01:30:53,743 --> 01:30:56,077
and skip over
what is none of our business?

1126
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:58,250
This is our business, honey.

1127
01:31:08,942 --> 01:31:11,528
Karen, I like my job!

1128
01:31:25,261 --> 01:31:27,749
And I found out
that this 18-year-old kid...

1129
01:31:27,789 --> 01:31:30,691
had been underneath
uncapping the drain...

1130
01:31:30,733 --> 01:31:34,792
and a cup of the solution
dumped right down on him.

1131
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:36,422
Right on his head.

1132
01:31:36,461 --> 01:31:37,988
So they shaved his head...

1133
01:31:38,028 --> 01:31:40,298
and now the stubble
is growing in hot.

1134
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,820
Jesus, that's terrible.

1135
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:44,551
Are you getting
the stuff together?

1136
01:31:44,589 --> 01:31:49,803
Maintenance people are exposed
to more hot stuff than anybody.

1137
01:31:49,836 --> 01:31:53,829
Look, Karen, the X-rays
are really important.

1138
01:31:53,868 --> 01:31:55,591
We're going into
the contract negotiations...

1139
01:31:55,628 --> 01:31:57,187
and we want to get the guy
from the "Times" down there...

1140
01:31:57,226 --> 01:31:59,431
in mid-November.
That's three weeks.

1141
01:31:59,468 --> 01:32:03,264
I know, I know.
I'm getting the stuff.

1142
01:32:03,307 --> 01:32:06,656
It's just not that easy.

1143
01:32:55,178 --> 01:32:56,638
Morgan!

1144
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:02,752
- You scared me.
- Meant to.

1145
01:33:02,792 --> 01:33:04,767
I'm doing something good.

1146
01:33:04,808 --> 01:33:06,532
I know what you're doing...

1147
01:33:06,568 --> 01:33:08,641
and you're the wrong person
to be doing it.

1148
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,477
And it's dangerous.
That's all I'm saying.

1149
01:34:12,165 --> 01:34:14,020
Thank you, Curtis.
It's good to know.

1150
01:34:15,588 --> 01:34:17,629
Gilda says Karen
is going to get...

1151
01:34:17,669 --> 01:34:19,359
one of those
Sherlock Holmes hats.

1152
01:34:19,397 --> 01:34:23,138
Then she'll find everything
that's missing in the plant.

1153
01:34:30,852 --> 01:34:34,015
Winston, seen my clipboard?

1154
01:34:44,579 --> 01:34:45,724
Why don't you speak
to the union...

1155
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:47,324
about how you're late
for work all the time?

1156
01:34:47,363 --> 01:34:48,737
Late from your break.

1157
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:50,080
Supposed to be in here
ten minutes ago...

1158
01:34:50,116 --> 01:34:52,024
instead of wherever you were.

1159
01:34:54,467 --> 01:34:56,800
Tell them that next time
you go to Washington.

1160
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:26,464
Stopped in to say hi to y'all.

1161
01:35:26,497 --> 01:35:29,812
God, I don't know
hardly any of you people.

1162
01:35:35,073 --> 01:35:37,495
Gilda, you have any time?

1163
01:35:37,537 --> 01:35:41,464
Maybe I could talk to you
on your break?

1164
01:35:41,504 --> 01:35:43,413
I can't, Karen.

1165
01:35:45,729 --> 01:35:48,827
Just for a couple minutes?

1166
01:35:50,143 --> 01:35:52,445
Maybe next week.

1167
01:35:55,968 --> 01:35:57,593
You monitoring yourself, Karen?

1168
01:35:57,631 --> 01:35:58,809
Yes, Georgie!

1169
01:35:58,847 --> 01:36:00,374
I hope you write it down...

1170
01:36:00,415 --> 01:36:02,903
in your little notebook
every time you don't!

1171
01:36:02,943 --> 01:36:05,790
Along with the stuff
about the rest of us!

1172
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:10,741
Oh, no! No! Damn it!

1173
01:36:23,422 --> 01:36:25,692
They haven't found
a hole in the glove...

1174
01:36:25,727 --> 01:36:27,187
but they're still checking.

1175
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:30,098
It's a very slight
external contamination.

1176
01:36:30,141 --> 01:36:31,866
An acceptable level.

1177
01:36:31,902 --> 01:36:35,218
And you're clean now.

1178
01:36:35,261 --> 01:36:37,203
Been bringing your samples in?

1179
01:36:37,245 --> 01:36:38,772
Every week.

1180
01:36:38,813 --> 01:36:40,885
Start bringing them in
on a daily basis.

1181
01:36:40,924 --> 01:36:44,754
You can pick up your kits
on the way out of the plant.

1182
01:36:44,797 --> 01:36:50,297
Boy, I'll be happy the day
I don't have to pee in a jar.

1183
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:42,707
Are you all right?

1184
01:37:45,275 --> 01:37:47,729
Yeah. I'm all right.

1185
01:37:47,769 --> 01:37:50,104
Would you call somebody for me?

1186
01:37:50,137 --> 01:37:51,828
Yeah, sure.

1187
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:00,340
Lookit! Drew!
My God, you're back!

1188
01:39:00,374 --> 01:39:03,057
I missed you so much!
Look at your little face!

1189
01:39:03,094 --> 01:39:05,003
Dolly, stop!

1190
01:39:05,046 --> 01:39:07,217
Jesus, I'm late.

1191
01:39:07,253 --> 01:39:09,937
Look at your little body!

1192
01:39:12,982 --> 01:39:14,771
Is she OK?

1193
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,971
Shit!

1194
01:39:23,317 --> 01:39:26,513
I spilled my urine sample.

1195
01:39:30,805 --> 01:39:33,871
Her and that union monkey
got nothing going anymore.

1196
01:39:33,909 --> 01:39:36,876
It's strictly business.
Are you moving back in?

1197
01:39:36,916 --> 01:39:38,826
I got a place of my own, Dolly.

1198
01:39:38,868 --> 01:39:41,170
You two can come stay with me
anytime you want.

1199
01:39:45,621 --> 01:39:47,475
Bologna and cheese.

1200
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,220
Jesus!

1201
01:40:02,387 --> 01:40:04,243
If you're back,
I'm really glad you're back.

1202
01:40:44,785 --> 01:40:46,476
Good morning.

1203
01:40:46,514 --> 01:40:48,400
Hi, Karen. How you doing?

1204
01:40:48,433 --> 01:40:50,440
I'm in the pink.

1205
01:40:56,528 --> 01:40:58,416
Oh, God!

1206
01:41:04,464 --> 01:41:05,708
Don't!

1207
01:41:10,704 --> 01:41:14,249
No! Stop it!

1208
01:41:14,287 --> 01:41:16,557
Stop it! Stop it!

1209
01:41:20,048 --> 01:41:21,257
Earl, what's going on?

1210
01:41:21,294 --> 01:41:22,408
Dolly,
this won't take long...

1211
01:41:22,447 --> 01:41:23,876
but I don't want you
getting in our way.

1212
01:41:23,919 --> 01:41:27,628
Who the hell are these people?

1213
01:41:27,663 --> 01:41:31,917
This is my house!
Tell me what's going...

1214
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,784
One package of S.O.S.

1215
01:42:23,821 --> 01:42:26,122
One box of S.O.S.

1216
01:42:26,156 --> 01:42:28,328
One bottle of Spray 'n Wipe.

1217
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:30,085
One bottle of Spray 'n Wipe.

1218
01:42:30,124 --> 01:42:33,636
One pack of Rice-a-roni.

1219
01:42:33,674 --> 01:42:35,912
One package Rice-a-roni.

1220
01:42:35,948 --> 01:42:39,363
Three framed photographs.

1221
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:42,916
Don't take those!

1222
01:42:42,955 --> 01:42:45,802
These are my kids' pictures.

1223
01:42:45,835 --> 01:42:48,682
Earl, don't let them take
my babies' pictures.

1224
01:42:48,715 --> 01:42:51,562
If you're going to watch,
you have to stand back now.

1225
01:42:51,595 --> 01:42:53,962
Mr. Hurley,
they're taking everything.

1226
01:42:53,995 --> 01:42:56,165
Listen to me.

1227
01:42:56,202 --> 01:42:58,985
We're getting readings from
the sink, the toilet seat...

1228
01:42:59,018 --> 01:43:00,393
from the make-up you touched...

1229
01:43:00,426 --> 01:43:02,401
from the bologna and cheese
in the refrigerator...

1230
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:04,100
from your samples...

1231
01:43:04,138 --> 01:43:06,375
and we're getting next to
nothing on Drew and Dolly...

1232
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:07,620
and your car
is absolutely clean.

1233
01:43:07,658 --> 01:43:10,723
How do you explain that?

1234
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,315
- I don't know.
- Think about it, Karen.

1235
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:14,760
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

1236
01:43:14,793 --> 01:43:16,866
- I have to go with him.
- No!

1237
01:43:16,905 --> 01:43:18,531
I'll be OK.
I have it under control.

1238
01:43:18,569 --> 01:43:20,990
- Don't go anywhere with him.
- It's all right.

1239
01:43:21,032 --> 01:43:23,968
I'm coming!
Keep your goddamn hands off!

1240
01:43:24,009 --> 01:43:25,503
It's all right.

1241
01:43:29,609 --> 01:43:31,431
Come on, Karen. Concentrate.

1242
01:43:31,465 --> 01:43:33,636
How did that plutonium
get in my house?

1243
01:43:33,672 --> 01:43:35,527
Did you put it there?

1244
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:39,553
Did I what? Are you crazy?

1245
01:43:39,592 --> 01:43:41,381
You think I put...

1246
01:43:41,417 --> 01:43:44,198
You think
I'd contaminate myself?

1247
01:43:44,232 --> 01:43:47,330
I think you'd do anything
to hurt this company.

1248
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:52,317
- Then I spilled it.
- What?

1249
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,563
I spilled
my urine sample container.

1250
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:57,632
Somebody must have put
plutonium in my container.

1251
01:43:57,671 --> 01:44:00,487
And then I spilled it
on my bathroom floor.

1252
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:04,926
I cleaned it all up
and my hands must have got hot.

1253
01:44:04,967 --> 01:44:07,335
And then what did I touch?

1254
01:44:07,367 --> 01:44:09,254
OK, I touched my sink...

1255
01:44:09,286 --> 01:44:12,603
I touched my make-up...

1256
01:44:12,647 --> 01:44:16,443
and I forget what stuff
in the refrigerator.

1257
01:44:16,486 --> 01:44:20,283
That's it. See?

1258
01:44:20,326 --> 01:44:22,214
Somebody spiked
my urine sample container.

1259
01:44:22,247 --> 01:44:24,035
- Who?
- Boy!

1260
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:26,655
How do I know who?
Anybody could have done it.

1261
01:44:26,694 --> 01:44:29,989
You leave it sitting there by
the punch-in at the plant!

1262
01:44:30,022 --> 01:44:34,276
Anybody could've dropped
a little plutonium in there.

1263
01:44:34,309 --> 01:44:37,506
There's a lot of people
at the plant hate me.

1264
01:44:37,541 --> 01:44:40,443
The whole house is hot.
How did it get hot?

1265
01:44:40,486 --> 01:44:42,373
I spilled it!
I told you, man!

1266
01:44:42,406 --> 01:44:43,813
That doesn't explain
the readings...

1267
01:44:43,845 --> 01:44:45,917
we're getting
on your nasal smear.

1268
01:44:45,956 --> 01:44:48,128
45,000 DPM.

1269
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:52,067
What?

1270
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:54,010
45,000 DPM.

1271
01:44:54,981 --> 01:44:56,541
Oh, my Jesus.

1272
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:02,780
I'm internally contaminated.
That's what you mean.

1273
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:04,064
We don't know what it means.

1274
01:45:04,099 --> 01:45:06,587
- That's what you mean!
- Karen, calm down.

1275
01:45:11,299 --> 01:45:13,340
Karen, listen.

1276
01:45:13,381 --> 01:45:15,518
Get out of my way!

1277
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:23,772
Oh, Jesus!
Where am I going to go now?

1278
01:45:23,811 --> 01:45:26,145
I don't have anyplace to go now.

1279
01:45:26,179 --> 01:45:29,440
We're getting a room for Dolly.
We want to help you.

1280
01:45:29,474 --> 01:45:31,417
We can help you
with a place to stay.

1281
01:45:31,459 --> 01:45:33,052
We can help you with money.

1282
01:45:44,834 --> 01:45:48,763
But first I have
to sign something, right?

1283
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:53,340
You want me to sign a statement
saying I did all this.

1284
01:45:53,378 --> 01:45:56,345
Just in your own words
what happened.

1285
01:46:02,753 --> 01:46:04,508
OK.

1286
01:46:12,191 --> 01:46:14,778
In my own words?

1287
01:46:16,832 --> 01:46:18,742
I'm contaminated.

1288
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,389
I'm dying.

1289
01:49:06,647 --> 01:49:08,721
What are you doing here?

1290
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:12,884
I'm just looking around,
like you.

1291
01:50:17,364 --> 01:50:19,306
You're here.

1292
01:50:19,348 --> 01:50:22,578
Jesus Christ.
I didn't know where you were.

1293
01:50:24,532 --> 01:50:26,538
What the hell happened?

1294
01:50:31,603 --> 01:50:33,425
They're killing me.

1295
01:50:33,459 --> 01:50:34,768
They're trying to kill me.

1296
01:50:34,804 --> 01:50:37,672
They want me
to stop what I'm doing.

1297
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:41,260
They contaminated me,
you know that?

1298
01:50:41,299 --> 01:50:43,819
I'm internally contaminated now.

1299
01:50:45,586 --> 01:50:47,692
Now, you listen to me.

1300
01:50:47,731 --> 01:50:50,600
We're going to go
to Los Alamos on Thursday...

1301
01:50:50,642 --> 01:50:52,529
and we'll get a full body count
from some doctors...

1302
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:54,220
who know what they're doing.
All three of us.

1303
01:50:54,259 --> 01:50:57,837
Oh, God! I'm so scared now.

1304
01:51:19,409 --> 01:51:22,126
It says here that
there's plutonium missing...

1305
01:51:22,161 --> 01:51:25,455
from just about every
nuclear plant in this country.

1306
01:51:25,488 --> 01:51:28,619
- Who's got it?
- Any asshole that wants it.

1307
01:51:28,657 --> 01:51:30,729
Man.

1308
01:51:30,769 --> 01:51:34,663
That's the guy, Drew.

1309
01:51:34,705 --> 01:51:36,427
The guy
Paul is bringing to see me.

1310
01:51:36,464 --> 01:51:37,893
Who?

1311
01:51:37,936 --> 01:51:40,238
The guy that wrote it,
from the "New York Times."

1312
01:51:40,272 --> 01:51:41,865
If you're going to be
in the newspaper...

1313
01:51:41,905 --> 01:51:44,108
I want to be in there, too.

1314
01:51:50,991 --> 01:51:54,340
Dolly, did you...

1315
01:51:54,383 --> 01:51:58,639
Did you tell the company
about the "New York Times"?

1316
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:00,744
No. I don't think
I remembered that part.

1317
01:52:08,142 --> 01:52:10,598
Did you tell them
about the X-rays?

1318
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:16,616
- Dolly?
- No.

1319
01:52:16,654 --> 01:52:18,694
Are you sure?

1320
01:52:18,735 --> 01:52:22,083
Karen, they know
everything about us.

1321
01:52:30,637 --> 01:52:33,223
They don't know
about the X-rays, do they?

1322
01:53:10,251 --> 01:53:12,969
OK. That's it.

1323
01:53:40,201 --> 01:53:43,616
All right, Mr. Stephens
and Miss Pelliker...

1324
01:53:43,658 --> 01:53:47,619
you both check out well below
permissible body limits.

1325
01:53:47,658 --> 01:53:50,210
You were exposed to
Miss Silkwood and the house...

1326
01:53:50,249 --> 01:53:53,991
but you show minimum
detectable activity now.

1327
01:53:56,265 --> 01:53:58,501
Miss Silkwood.

1328
01:54:02,153 --> 01:54:06,179
We have detected
americium in both lungs...

1329
01:54:06,217 --> 01:54:07,940
and both sides of your chest.

1330
01:54:07,976 --> 01:54:11,237
Americium is produced
when plutonium disintegrates.

1331
01:54:11,272 --> 01:54:13,792
And extrapolating from
your americium level...

1332
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:16,614
we estimate you have
an internal contamination...

1333
01:54:16,648 --> 01:54:19,964
of six nanocuries of plutonium.

1334
01:54:20,007 --> 01:54:22,211
The maximum permissible
body burden...

1335
01:54:22,248 --> 01:54:25,696
for occupational exposure
is 40 nanocuries.

1336
01:54:25,736 --> 01:54:28,932
As you can see,
you are well under that level.

1337
01:54:28,967 --> 01:54:33,723
- I'm under it.
- As well as we can determine.

1338
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:36,866
These are very sophisticated
instruments...

1339
01:54:36,904 --> 01:54:39,488
but their accuracy may be off...

1340
01:54:39,527 --> 01:54:42,658
by plus or minus 300%
at this level.

1341
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:46,108
Plus or minus 300%?

1342
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:47,645
That's correct.

1343
01:54:47,686 --> 01:54:49,890
Then what you're saying is...

1344
01:54:49,926 --> 01:54:51,933
that the amount
of plutonium inside me...

1345
01:54:51,974 --> 01:54:55,074
could be three times less
than you even think?

1346
01:54:55,111 --> 01:54:57,761
Or three times greater.

1347
01:54:59,525 --> 01:55:04,195
But even that would be under
the maximum body burden.

1348
01:55:16,517 --> 01:55:20,063
I think you should come on
down to Oklahoma City...

1349
01:55:20,101 --> 01:55:22,522
and bring that reporter
from the "New York Times."

1350
01:55:22,564 --> 01:55:25,499
Are you ready to see him?

1351
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:26,947
I'm ready.

1352
01:55:26,981 --> 01:55:28,922
You got the documents?

1353
01:55:30,661 --> 01:55:32,034
Come on down.

1354
01:55:36,451 --> 01:55:41,023
Man, I love it here.
I love this country.

1355
01:55:41,059 --> 01:55:43,580
Wouldn't you like
to stay here forever?

1356
01:55:46,563 --> 01:55:49,051
Doctors are all goddamn liars.

1357
01:55:52,163 --> 01:55:55,294
Land's cheap there.

1358
01:55:55,332 --> 01:55:57,698
I read about this.

1359
01:55:57,730 --> 01:55:59,770
You can build yourself
a pueblo house.

1360
01:56:00,835 --> 01:56:04,218
Make it out of adobe brick,
like the Indians.

1361
01:56:04,259 --> 01:56:09,179
Mud, straw...
comes right out of the ground.

1362
01:56:09,218 --> 01:56:12,120
Got to build a well,
but that's not too bad.

1363
01:56:12,161 --> 01:56:14,617
You get a bunch of guys
to do you a favor.

1364
01:56:14,658 --> 01:56:15,967
You do them a favor.

1365
01:56:16,001 --> 01:56:18,489
It's all barter system
out there.

1366
01:56:18,529 --> 01:56:20,318
You can make the rooms
any shape.

1367
01:56:20,353 --> 01:56:21,760
You can make 'em round.

1368
01:56:21,794 --> 01:56:23,582
It's not a right-angle
kind of life.

1369
01:56:23,617 --> 01:56:24,992
Yeah.

1370
01:56:26,913 --> 01:56:29,302
Have room for your kids.

1371
01:56:31,873 --> 01:56:33,302
Yeah.

1372
01:56:36,512 --> 01:56:38,651
Hell, we could have
kids of our own.

1373
01:56:41,568 --> 01:56:43,478
We love each other.

1374
01:56:49,952 --> 01:56:51,708
Why not?

1375
01:56:56,832 --> 01:56:59,035
They wouldn't...

1376
01:56:59,071 --> 01:57:01,439
They wouldn't come out right.

1377
01:57:01,472 --> 01:57:03,838
Hell, I didn't come out right.

1378
01:57:03,871 --> 01:57:05,781
You came out OK.

1379
01:57:18,206 --> 01:57:20,116
What is it?

1380
01:57:21,567 --> 01:57:23,476
Come on.

1381
01:57:24,447 --> 01:57:27,960
Come on. I don't care.

1382
01:57:29,406 --> 01:57:30,835
I know.

1383
01:57:33,694 --> 01:57:35,353
You aren't going
to contaminate me...

1384
01:57:35,389 --> 01:57:38,074
any more than
I've already been.

1385
01:57:56,797 --> 01:57:59,546
I'm sorry.
I forgot to turn off the alarm.

1386
01:58:02,365 --> 01:58:04,665
I thought you weren't going in.

1387
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:08,278
Well... I have to.

1388
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:12,347
Call in sick.

1389
01:58:12,379 --> 01:58:14,268
No, I really do.

1390
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:17,333
I really mean
you ought to call in sick.

1391
01:58:17,371 --> 01:58:19,476
Think they'll let you work?

1392
01:58:19,515 --> 01:58:20,978
There's something I got to get.

1393
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:23,866
At the plant?
Are you wearing my shirt?

1394
01:58:23,899 --> 01:58:25,460
- Huh?
- My shirt!

1395
01:58:25,499 --> 01:58:28,848
You don't have to get up now.

1396
01:58:28,891 --> 01:58:32,022
Sweetheart, don't go try get
anything out of the plant.

1397
01:58:32,059 --> 01:58:33,783
If I get hung up
at the union meeting...

1398
01:58:33,819 --> 01:58:35,510
will you pick up
Paul Stone and the guy...

1399
01:58:35,546 --> 01:58:37,139
from the "New York Times"
at the airport?

1400
01:58:37,179 --> 01:58:38,739
Fuck no.

1401
01:58:38,779 --> 01:58:40,186
Come on, darling.

1402
01:58:40,219 --> 01:58:41,625
I don't know how late
this meeting will go tonight.

1403
01:58:41,659 --> 01:58:42,968
I don't want you doing that.

1404
01:58:43,002 --> 01:58:46,264
Well... I'm doing it.

1405
01:58:46,299 --> 01:58:48,665
You don't owe
the union anything.

1406
01:58:48,697 --> 01:58:50,520
Let's not fight.

1407
01:58:50,554 --> 01:58:53,041
You don't owe
the "New York Times" anything.

1408
01:58:53,081 --> 01:58:55,830
Let's not have a fight now.

1409
01:59:04,057 --> 01:59:05,967
We always can have a fight later.

1410
01:59:33,976 --> 01:59:39,759
Amazing grace

1411
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:45,681
How sweet the sound

1412
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:50,388
That saved a wretch...

1413
01:59:50,422 --> 01:59:54,219
- Give me your notes.
- OK.

1414
01:59:54,262 --> 01:59:56,237
Listen, you sure you're OK?

1415
01:59:56,279 --> 01:59:57,556
I'm OK.

1416
01:59:57,591 --> 01:59:58,900
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

1417
01:59:58,935 --> 02:00:02,098
Once was lost

1418
02:00:02,134 --> 02:00:07,699
But now I'm found

1419
02:00:07,734 --> 02:00:10,549
Was blind

1420
02:00:10,582 --> 02:00:18,034
But now I see

1421
02:00:19,541 --> 02:00:24,909
'Twas grace that taught

1422
02:00:24,949 --> 02:00:30,099
My heart to fear

1423
02:00:30,133 --> 02:00:39,921
And grace my fears released

1424
02:00:39,957 --> 02:00:50,321
How precious
did that grace appear

1425
02:00:50,356 --> 02:01:00,426
The hour I first believed

1426
02:01:00,467 --> 02:01:10,025
Through many dangers,
toils, and snares

1427
02:01:10,067 --> 02:01:20,269
We have already come

1428
02:01:20,306 --> 02:01:30,671
'Twas grace that brought us
safe thus far

1429
02:01:30,707 --> 02:01:39,718
And grace will lead us home

1430
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:49,614
When we've been there
ten thousand years

1431
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:59,622
Bright-shining as the sun

1432
02:01:59,664 --> 02:02:04,999
We've no less days

1433
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:10,222
To sing God's praise

1434
02:02:10,256 --> 02:02:20,108
As when we first begun

1435
02:02:20,143 --> 02:02:24,900
Amazing grace

1436
02:02:24,943 --> 02:02:30,310
How sweet the sound

1437
02:02:30,351 --> 02:02:40,171
That saved a wretch like me

1438
02:02:40,206 --> 02:02:44,810
I once was lost

1439
02:02:44,845 --> 02:02:49,931
But now I'm found

1440
02:02:49,966 --> 02:02:56,643
Was bound, but now I'm free
