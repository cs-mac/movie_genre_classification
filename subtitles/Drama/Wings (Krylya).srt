<i>How about some sound?
What's she saying?</i>

Quick! Please, let us through!

30
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,343
Please let us in.
That's our headmistress up there.

31
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,045
Just let us stand in back.

32
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,918
We'll be quiet.

33
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,286
Dina.

34
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,383
It's all on television right here.

35
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,185
Where's Nadezhda?

36
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,059
You missed her. She's already left.

37
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,222
Damn.

38
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,993
Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,658
I know what this is.

40
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,101
- Sure. They know everything.
- They're all grown up.

41
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,033
It's your fault, Lena.
"Comb my hair. Comb my hair."

42
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,541
There, next to the lamp.

43
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,907
- They're showing Nadezhda again.
- We've already seen her.

44
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,003
- Damn. Can't get it to work.
- You greenhorn.

45
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,674
- Take a look at those girls.
- Not bad.

46
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,753
- Nothing special.
- You're nothing special yourself.

47
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,451
How about this one?
- Nope.

48
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,416
What do you like -
blondes or brunettes?

49
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,788
- I haven't decided yet.
- That's a shame.

50
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,158
Here's Nadezhda again.

51
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,027
Look at her perm rolls.

52
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,800
That diploma is for us.

53
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,199
Let's go to the cafeteria.

54
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,105
Good work. Well organized.

55
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,906
We do our best, Ivan Petrovich.

56
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,172
Vladimir Danilovich,

57
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,910
why don't you ask me to dance?

58
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,576
<i>You know I have a bad back.</i>

59
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,620
- Excuse us!
- Watch where you're going.

60
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,220
- What are we having?
- Girls, why are you cutting in?

61
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,814
We were already in line.
Weren't we?

62
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,019
Shame on you, young lady.

63
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,591
Let's see. Two bottles of beer.

64
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,131
Beer makes you fat.

65
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,561
- And a pack of cigarettes?
- And a pack of cigarettes.

66
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,069
Vostriakov.

67
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,935
What kind of girls do you like -
smart ones or silly ones?

68
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,804
Idiots, like you.

69
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,275
<i>Nadezhda, have you
gotten used to the new job?</i>

70
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,471
Something's always going on.

71
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,515
Here's my deputy -
Boris Grigorievich.

72
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,440
Nice to meet you.

73
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,882
Thank Ivan Petrovich for this.

74
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:50,217
He suggested you for the job,
and I backed him up.

75
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,656
Next year, I'll send you my kid.
He's always getting in trouble.

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,921
We're not a penitentiary,
Ivan Petrovich.

77
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,623
- I'll send him here anyway.
- All right.

78
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:02,724
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
may I ask you to dance?

79
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,234
Are you kidding? It was just a joke.

80
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,937
- Give it back!
- Try and take it from me.

81
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,977
- Easy there.
- Crazy girl.

82
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,312
They should be thrown out of here.

83
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,851
She has a crush on him.

84
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,647
Give it to me as a present.

85
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,916
Stupid!

86
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,597
What's going on?

87
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,432
What is Vostriakov doing here?

88
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,333
Did you sneak in the back door?

89
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,496
I used the front door.

90
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,232
Get out of here, all of you.

91
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,277
Vostriakov, you stay here.

92
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,811
I have something to say to you.

93
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,071
No shame at all.

94
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,642
- How could you sink so low as to hit a girl?
- She started it.

95
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,586
You be quiet.
I'm talking to Vostriakov.

96
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,157
How'd I sink so low?
Lower and lower - and then this.

97
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,618
Be quiet. Stand up properly.

98
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:08,193
Here, take a look, Vladimir Danilovich.
Quite a rare specimen.

99
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,363
You chase him out one door,
and he crawls in through another.

100
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,995
- I didn't crawl in -
- Quiet.

101
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,403
Be quiet!

102
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,307
What a disgrace!

103
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,572
You've shamed all of us -
disgraced the school.

104
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,147
I'm ashamed
to hold this diploma in my hands!

105
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,374
So don't!

106
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,514
Give it back to them.

107
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,946
All right.

108
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,516
Yermolaeva.

109
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,594
Apologize to her.
Right now, in front of everybody.

110
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,305
And if I don't?

111
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,636
If you don't, I'll expel you from school.

112
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,207
So what?

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,914
Boris Grigorievich.

114
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,147
Yes?

115
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,950
Please escort Vostriakov out right away.

116
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,927
He's free to go wherever he wants.

117
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,890
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:20,162
<i>"I am leaving, stunned -

121
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:33,083
<i>I stood next to him

Pasha, can you get me a samovar?

125
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,935
Do they bring you samovars
at the museum?

126
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,514
No. They only bring bones.

127
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,277
"Look," they say. "Perhaps
they belong to a woolly mammoth."

128
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,181
But they're only horse bones.

129
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,018
Tired? I'll get going.

130
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,690
Today I expelled a kid from the school.

131
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,694
What kid?

132
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,593
Maybe it's Tanya.

133
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,828
Sit down.

134
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,666
Why would she show up?

135
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,071
<i>Hello. Is Tanya here?</i>

136
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,609
<i>No, she's gone.</i>

137
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,144
<i>When is she coming back?</i>

138
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,477
<i>Ask her mother. She got married.</i>

139
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,911
<i>Come on in. Don't just stand there.</i>

140
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,952
<i>No, that's all right. I'll go.</i>

141
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,454
By the way, Tanya called.
She asked me to say hello to you for her.

142
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,685
Thanks.

143
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,791
- It's just that you're never home.
- Right.

144
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,737
- I should go.
- All right.

145
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,363
- Good night.
- Good night.

146
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,439
By the way,
when Tanya calls you again,

147
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,437
give her my regards.

148
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,514
Take care.

149
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,949
Good night.

150
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,426
Can I call you tomorrow?

151
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,585
Of course.

152
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,309
Pasha.

153
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,086
Did you call me?

154
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,167
Good night.

155
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,936
Good night.

156

157
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,386
It isn't going to fall.

158
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,755
It's doing it on purpose.
It's a barrel roll.

159
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,492
Look. Look up!

160
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,235
Auntie Nadya, is the sky far away?

161
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,168
Are we gonna go for another swim?

162
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,674
I don't want to swim.
I'm hungry.

163
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,723
Do you want to go to the airfield?

- Hello there.</i>

165
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,710
I've come to see you.

166
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,511
Hello, Nadya.
I'll be right with you.

167
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,416
- Hello.
- Hello, Nadezhda Stepanovna.

168
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,191
Going to the tournament?

169
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,197
Yes, We're going to Moscow soon.

170
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,132
- But not everyone is going, right?
- Only if you passed the tests.

171
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,226
- Only if you have enough jumps.
- Everyone took the tests.

172
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,827
Excellent.

173
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,365
- So, you want to be a pilot?
- Yes.

174
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,773
Me too.

175
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,538
Whose kids are these?

176
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,708
The neighbors'.
I took them to the river for a swim.

177
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,884
Baryshev,
now it's going to be your turn.

178
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,454
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
you look great.

179
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,024
Why shouldn't I?

180
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,262
What's this fellow doing there?

181
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,000
He didn't pass the physical.
Now he's upset.

182
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,593
Do you remember Pasha?

183
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,968
He waited and waited before the war,
and how did it end?

184
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,304
Yeah. But now mustering boards
are much stricter.

185
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,641
But you're still holding up.

186
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,875
- Are you jealous?
- No. I've got used to it.

187
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,211
Do you fly a lot?

188
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,913
Well, I fly. I instruct.

189
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,683
- How come you never drop by?
- I will.

190
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,625
Listen, why don't we all get together?

191
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,033
Children, repeat after me.

192
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:53,435
<i>Where the infantry won't get through</i>

193
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,771
<i>Where an armored train won't pass</i>

194
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:02,041
<i>Where a heavy tank
won't crawl through</i>

195
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,585
<i>There the steel bird will fly</i>

196
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,887
<i>Nadya, did my kids give you
any trouble at the river?</i>

197
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,132
<i>No, we were good.
Right, Auntie Nadya?</i>

198
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,362
Look at it.

199
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,104
A duckling.

200
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,234
I'm not going to cut it up.

201
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,412
The question is -

202
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:20,081
why should anyone
be peeling potatoes on a Sunday?

203
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,687
What are restaurants for?

204
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,993
Yeah, like you're going
to go to a restaurant.

205
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,657
I am going.

206
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,793
From now on,
I'm going to restaurants every day.

207
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,971
RESTAURANT

208
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,374
- Are you from out of town?
- No, why?

209
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,037
No service after 6:00.
Only women with escorts.

210
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,637
Who thought that up?
Call the manager.

211
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,740
Can't do it.

212
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,350
Hello.

213
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,992
All right.

214
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,098
Welcome. Please join us.

215
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,328
Do you recognize me?

216
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,133
But of course.
Morozov, Igor Mikhailovich.

217
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,003
Exactly. Meet my friends.

218
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,441
Petrukhina, Nadezhda Stepanovna.

219
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,509
Do you remember Nadezhda Stepanovna?

220
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,417
We served together on a people's jury
for a whole year.

221
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,783
For you, Shura will fix something up.
You won't have to wait.

222
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,449
I'd like something to eat.

223
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,890
Sure, right away.

224
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,097
Hello.

225
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,034
Please.

226
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,571
To your health.
- Hey! I'll throw you out.

227
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,109
Hello, Nadezhda Stepanovna.

228
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,683
Nadezhda Stepanovna.

229
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,775
Home-smoked fish.

230
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,254
Please, help yourself.
- Thank you, no.

231
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,983
I'll bring some crayfish.

232
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,721
I'll be right back.

233
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,732
Take you, for example -
a simple Soviet woman.

234
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,771
- What do you want?
- Get lost.

235
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,533
I just wanted to talk.

236
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,904
What, can't we have a conversation?

237
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,285
<i>Mom!</i>

238
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,957
What a scary bulldog.

239
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,961
This isn't a bulldog. It's a boxer.

240
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,054
What a huge beast.
Does he guard your home?

241
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,931
There's nothing to guard there.

242
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,534
He's so ugly.

243
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,970
Don't insult him.
He understands everything.

244
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,499
I've come to get acquainted.

245
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,242
But you've met Igor.

246
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,644
I've spoken with Igor on the phone.

247
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,579
I haven't properly met him
as your husband.

248
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,514
Forgive me.

249
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,745
Here's our building.

250
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,718
It's just that we have a crowd over.

251
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,653
Listen. Tanya?

252
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,219
Aren't you embarrassed?

253
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,331
After all, you could be his daughter.

254
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,828
No, I couldn't. Let's go.

255
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,498
Tanya, wait.
Let me look at you.

256
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,672
Why have you waited so long?

257
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:06,375
They built a splendid wedding palace,
and you don't even want to use it.

258
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,477
All day Sunday, I greeted newlyweds
on behalf of the city council.

259
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,149
It was so beautiful. You know?

260
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,889
Champagne, music, flowers.

261
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,055
But I don't want any strangers
congratulating me.

262
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,030
We won't let strangers in.

263
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,726
I'll welcome you myself.

264
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,094
We'll use the occasion to celebrate.

265
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,639
So, is it a deal?

266
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,005
- We'll see, Mom.
- What's there to think about?

267
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,382
Come on in.

268
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,953
<i>Misha, tell us the story
about the two actors.</i>

269
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,386
<i>About what?</i>

270
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,355
<i>The two actors.</i>

271
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,392
<i>- I've told it already.
- Victor hasn't heard it.</i>

272
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,961
Wallpaper.

273
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,264
So, two actors get together.

274
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,527
One's in the theater,
and the other's in cabaret.

275
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,830
"Hey, Kolya, how you doing?

276
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,666
I haven't seen you in 10 years."

277
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,865
Which one's Igor?

278
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,370
Don't tell me. I'll figure it out.

279
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,009
Don't even try. You're not going to guess.

280
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,344
Not bad, not bad.

281
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,975
I've moved up in the world.

282
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,380
I decided to work alone, solo.

283
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,891
You walk out on the stage,
and everybody's looking at you.

284
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,259
It's all on your shoulders.
You make all the choices.

285
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,963
You read Pushkin.

286
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,865
<i>You read Captain's Daughter by Pushkin.</i>

287
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,562
It's 800 pages. Right?

288
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,170
It's not like Chekhov.
You could choke on it.

289
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,143
So I get on stage -
Only I didn't learn my lines.

290
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,735
Three years ago,
there was that competition.

291
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,782
You know, Pushkin's memorial -
Alexander Sergeevich himself.

292
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,750
So, I didn't learn my lines.
So it goes.

293
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:52,552
It happens sometimes.
Creative work, you know.

294
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,489
"Is this from Pushkin?"
Well, of course.

295
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:07,270
And here you are, walking out on stage.
You're all alone.

296
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,904
It's high art.

297
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,341
It's not like reciting
some clichéd poem -

298
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,209
"Oh, wait for me, and I shall return."

299
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,875
That's what hacks do.

300
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,551
And then I wasn't ready
for the Gogol Festival.

301
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,634
So they let me go.

302
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,800
So where does one go, right?

303
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,906
And you know why they let me go?

304
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:56,784
The guy wearing the big glasses says,
"Because of your poor enunciation."

305
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,691
Timothy, get back.

306
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,186
Everyone, this is my mom.

307
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,792
Well, finally.

308
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,091
Very nice to meet you.

309
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,103
Mom, this is Igor.

310
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,666
Petrukhina.

311
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,866
Igor.

312
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,033
I can't hear you.

313
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,132
Igor.

314
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,347
Nice to meet you.

315
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,379
You don't smoke.

316
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,956
Forgive us, Nadezhda Stepanovna,
that it turned out this way.

317
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,397
It's all right.

318
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,101
The apartment's nice.
Except the ceilings are low.

319
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,503
Yeah.

320
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,879
Well, young people, why so solemn?
Cheer up, everybody.

321
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,013
Play your boogie-woogie.

322
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,382
Are there any wine glasses in this house?
- They're in the kitchen. Come on.

323
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,289
Or only books?
What's this, a reading room?

324
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,225
- We have wine glasses.
- Let's go have a drink.

325
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,766
Tanya, step outside.

326
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,270
Close the door.

327
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,109
Sit down.

328
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,015
I've been asking Tanya
to introduce us for a long time.

329
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,919
She kept putting it off.

330
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,092
How old are you?

331
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,156
Thirty-seven.

332
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,166
Sit down.

333
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,605
- Have you been married before?
- Yes, I have.

334
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,677
- Did you get divorced?
- A long time ago.

335
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,507
How long?

336
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,080
About five years.

337
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,206
- Any kids?
- No.

338
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,377
You've been on your own for five years?

339
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,119
Yes, I have.

340
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,725
Do you teach?

341
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,587
Yes.

342
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,529
Do you intend to just keep teaching?

343
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,631
It's likely.

344
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,604
- Give me a knife.
- Pardon?

345
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,401
Give me a knife.

346
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:39,044
When did you meet Tatyana?

347
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,880
At the entrance examinations.

348
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,423
Love at first sight?

349
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,928
Oh, well.

350
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,027
Call everybody in.

351
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,376
- Andrei, you forgot your pen.
- Thank you.

352
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,377
- Guys, where are you going?
- Home.

353
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,207
- Come back later.
- Mom won't stay long.

354
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,750
Why are you leaving?

355
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,487
Everybody, come here.

356
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,554
Everyone's invited.

357
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,522
Are you afraid of me?

358
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,058
Come on, guys. Don't be shy.

359
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,288
All right. Five minutes.

360
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,302
- Where's Misha?
- By himself.

361
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,465
Tanya.

362
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,868
Just a second.

363
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,277
Misha. Are you coming?

364
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,713
No.

365
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,785
Then turn the volume up.

366
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,187
Igor. Don't keep us waiting.

367
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,483
Let's see.

368
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,991
That's.75 liters, and we've got -

369
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,426
One, two, three, four, five - 10.

370
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,090
- Don't count Misha.
- Then nine.

371
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,862
That's 83.3 grams each.

372
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,361
You ignoramus.

373
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,065
It's a periodic fraction - 83.33.

374
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,903
You calculate so well.

375
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,840
Thank you. It's my job.

376
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,538
- Misha, get over here.
- Tanya.

377
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,546
Leave him alone. He's thinking.

378
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,051
May the outstretched hand
be filled with riches for you.

379
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,246
Andrei, it's time for a toast.

380
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,483
- Well, to the newlyweds.
- Yes, to the newlyweds.

381
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,922
- No, no.
- Then what?

382
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,187
I propose a toast
to Nadezhda Stepanovna.

383
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,490
Igor is incredibly lucky
with his mother-in-law.

384
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,622
He doesn't deserve such luck.

385
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,633
We are very glad to meet you.

386
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,330
- Thank you.
- Well, friends, to Nadezhda Stepanovna.

387
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,332
You've made me blush.

388
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,739
Let's drink.

389
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,109
To your health.

390
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,646
This is good wine.

391
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,977
Misha, would you like some cake?

392
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,146
Let him be.
He's wrapped up in his thoughts.

393
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,724
He was great today.

394
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,123
- Is he an actor?
- He's an attorney.

395
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,991
- But that doesn't matter.
- So he's an amateur?

396
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,361
Did you know
that I chair the panel of judges?

397
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,990
Mom, why don't you have some cake?

398
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,261
I forgot.

399
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,463
Why'd you put on that sad music?

400
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,938
Let's drink!

401
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,339
To the newlyweds. To -

402
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,774
As a poet once said,

403
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,974
"Cherish your love.

404
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,746
Over the years,
cherish it even more."

405
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:34,314
<i>"Love is not about sighs on a park bench,
nor a stroll in the moonlight. "</i>

406
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,859
Misha, use the white one.

407
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,595
I bought movie tickets.
They went to waste.

408
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,133
You think they asked me over?

409
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,341
I had to go over on my own to meet him.

410
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:00,779
If she'd been my natural daughter,
I'd have disowned her for this kind of thing.

411
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:08,321
All my life I lived in fear,
dreading that one day

412
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,724
someone would let it out
that she's not my own child.

413
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,899
I ran home thinking that she'd found out.

414
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,004
It hasn't come to that yet.

415
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,171
I wish she had at least
come to me for advice.

416
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,939
We're not strangers.

417
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,512
Oh, well.

418
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:42,250
When she was going out
with that Igor fellow,

419
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,225
I never said a word.

420
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,796
Right. Not a word.

421
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,165
Well, as a joke perhaps. Big deal.

422
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,963
You shouldn't joke around about this.

423
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,202
They have their joke, and you have yours.

424
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,902
Do you remember how you told me
that I should adopt a boy?

425
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:05,048
I thought that a girl
would be closer to me -

426
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,583
to her mother.

427
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,413
Oh, well.

428
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,926
You know, eventually,
children have to go off on their own.

429
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,395
What would happen otherwise?

430
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,725
Philosopher.

431
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,561
It's easy for you to talk.
She's not yours.

432
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,608
Good night.

433
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,241
<i>Kravchenko!</i>

434
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,319
<i>Watch it. Close the door.</i>

435
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,818
<i>What a mess. You promised
to finish the remodeling by today.</i>

436
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,292
<i>Where is everybody?
- Probably at the movies.</i>

437
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,828
It's Monday,
so there's a new picture.

438
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,227
Besides, there's nine people
missing for exams.

439
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,265
Then there's one fellow
that didn't spend the night at school.

440
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,266
- Who's that?
- Vostriakov.

441
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,858
Did the costumes get sent out
to the competition?

442
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,164
They should have been.

443
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,670
<i>They should have been,
or they have been?</i>

444
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,105
<i>They have been.</i>

445
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,610
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
I'd like to leave early tonight.

446
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,509
My daughter's birthday.

447
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,775
- Do you have a daughter?
- Four kids.

448
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,382
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

449
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,716
Kravchenko!

450
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,311
Kravchenko!

451
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,316
Damn.

452
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,692
That's for me.

453
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,594
The so-called workers.

454
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,196
Why didn't you go to the movies?

455
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,468
- We're working.
- We've already seen that movie.

456
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,834
Where's Vostriakov?

457
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,246
Well, who knows where Vostriakov is?

458
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,977
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

459
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,284
- Where's his stuff? You clear it out?
- No, it's here.

460
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,488
- Who are his friends?
- Me.

461
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,449
Everyone was friends with him.

462
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,926
Are his parents in town?

463
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,724
- Yes.
- I see.

464
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,460
By the way,
I saw him in a pretty seedy place.

465
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,626
Well, I'm off.

466
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,705
Are the grade lists off to the district?

467
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,068
They should be.

468
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,142
<i>They should be, or they are?</i>

469
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,541
I don't know.

470
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,683
Listen, Boris Grigorievich,
do you ever know anything?

471
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,287
All right. Make sure that remodeling
is done by tonight.

472
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,254
Otherwise, we're going
to have a serious talk.

473
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,154
Is that clear?
- Perfectly.

474
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,952
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
I'm waiting for you.

475
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,150
Later.

476
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,853
It's my kids' turn.
I'm going to check on them.

477
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,265
Why aren't you all ready?

478
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,735
Do you want
to spoil the whole performance?

479
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,774
Girls, don't just stand there.
Boys, go back to the hall.

480
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,538
Yermolaeva doesn't want to go on.

481
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,771
Yermolaeva?

482
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,548
What's the matter?

483
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,215
Yermolaeva, I'm talking to you.

484
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,513
- Vostriakov's disappeared.
- What?

485
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,953
- Yermolaeva went to look for him.
- Isn't it true, Zina?

486
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,048
Be ready for your turn!

487
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,653
No time to talk.
Yermolaeva, get dressed.

488
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,129
Boys, get back.
Girls, line up.

489
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,041
Yermolaeva.

490
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,775
Construction School, on stage!

491
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,755
Get out of here, everybody.

492
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,787
Your Vostriakov hasn't disappeared.

493
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,864
Yes, he has!
You don't know him at all.

494
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,456
He's innocent.
You expelled him for nothing.

495
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,967
It was my own fault.
You don't know him.

496
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,561
You don't know anything.

497
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,907
Maybe he drowned himself!

498
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,072
You don't know him. He's so proud.
He'll never come back.

499
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,170
Damn your dances!

500
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,175
That's it.

501
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,220
All the costumes - for nothing.

502
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,285
Not at all.

503
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,086
Hurry up.

504
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,195
Scarf.

505
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,890
Hands.

506
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,159
Closer.

507
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,027
Sit down.

508
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,273
Get ready. Let's go.

509
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,589
Very nice. Look at the costumes.

510
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,964
Petrukhina gave it her best.

511
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,246
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
it came out just great!

512
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,144
Everything's okay.

513
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,178
Hodzhaev, make sure
all the costumes are returned.

514
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,253
Yes, ma'am.

515
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,460
Here you are. I found you.

516
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,928
All right. Let's do it quickly.

517
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,191
Outside.

518
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,368
- No, dear, I don't like it.
- But why?

519
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,674
I didn't say that.

520
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,646
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

521
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,915
You did.

522
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,751
Well, I don't recall.

523
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,683
And what about this?
This is, excuse me, pure flattery.

524
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,285
- How? What flattery?
- It's just flattery.

525
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,457
It isn't flattery.
This is an important topic.

526
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,232
And everyone's waiting.

527
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,429
- What?
- Everyone's waiting.

528
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,298
All right.

529
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,046
But what about this?
This is just embarrassing.

530
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,983
"I am greeted by a tired,
modestly dressed woman..."

531
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:26,819
"with lines around her young eyes."

532
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,789
But it's true.

533
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,362
Well. Where did you go to school?

534
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,692
The university.

535
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,331
My daughter's at the university too.

536
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:40,967
It's hot.

537
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,539
There may be a storm coming.

538
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,502
It's humid.

539
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,408
My daughter majors in math.

540
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,640
The humanities would have been better.

541
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,239
Of course. Nadezhda Stepanovna -

542
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,785
- Can I try these on?
- Of course.

543
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,813
They suit you.

544
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,551
- Convenient.
- Yes, they are.

545
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,059
Here. Did I get it right?

546
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,424
Not at all, my dear.

547
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,432
<i>Not "for comprehensive work teams."
But "only for compressive work teams.</i>

548
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,229
We train teams of young workers" -

549
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,429
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.

550
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,699
I understand.

551
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,604
Here. "The trailblazing initiative."

552
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,971
What about it?

553
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,977
Can we use a different word for it?

554
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,979
"Initiative." "Initiative."

555
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,423
It's a puzzle.

556
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,493
"Initiative" isn't a bad word.

557
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,526
Perhaps we should say "beginning."

558
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,426
No. That's not it either.

559
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,731
Initiative. Initiative.

560
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,868
What about another word
that means the same thing,

561
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,499
but the word itself is different?

562
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,744
- A synonym?
- Exactly. A synonym.

563
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,609
We need a synonym.

564
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,022
Initiative. Initiative.

565
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,685
Maybe -

566
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,459
No.

567
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,760
Comrade Petrukhina!
Someone's asking for you!

568
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,265
I'm coming.

569
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,700
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
please sign here in the corner.

570
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,669
- Nadya.
- Coming.

571
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,640
"Initiative." "Beginning."
What's the difference?

572
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,585
Thank you. Thank you.

573
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,264
WHAT IS A SYNONYM
FOR THE WORD "INITIATIVE"?

574
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,461
BEGINNING.

575
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,484
- Ivan Petrovich.
- Yes?

576
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,493
I have to leave, Ivan Petrovich.

577
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,895
I have some unfinished business.

578
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,490
There's not going to be a discussion
tonight anyway. Is that all right?

579
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,002
- Sure, go ahead.
- Thank you.

580
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,130
Good-bye. Good-bye.

581
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,934
- Nadezhda Stepanovna.
- Yes?

582
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,876
- Your purse.
- Thank you.

583
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,004
Good-bye.

584
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,915
<i>Now a ballet composition -
"A Little Birch Tree."</i>

585
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,755
Nadezhda Stepanovna.
Do you need the key to your office?

586
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,227
- Is it all locked up?
- Yes, it's pretty late.

587
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,694
- No, that's all right.
- All right.

588
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,282
HONOR BOARD

589
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,561
Nadezhda Stepanovna.
Have they found that fellow?

590
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,605
<i>Nadezhda Stepanovna?</i>

591
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,379
What's that?

592
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,281
What's his name - Vostriakov?

593
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,580
I don't know.

594
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,386
Boris Grigorievich.

595
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:34,746
What are you doing here?

596
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,657
Painting. It will all be done tonight.

597
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,989
And where are your students?

598
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,121
They're on a smoke break.

599
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,494
And what about you?

600
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,625
- I don't smoke.
- That's not what I mean.

601
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,501
Stop it right away and go home.
It's your daughter's birthday.

602
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:49,903
I've got time.

603
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,140
<i>- Who do you wanna see?
- Does the Vostriakov family live here?</i>

604
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,247
They're not home.
They're all at the factory.

605
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,979
What about their son?

606
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,715
The son's doing time.

607
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,490
What do you mean doing time?

608
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,187
He's a gangster.

609
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,198
So he's doing time... in jail.

610
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,902
He's got two more years left yet.

611
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,033
Grandma, you're wrong.

612
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,538
I mean Serezha Vostriakov.

613
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,108
Oh, the younger one.

614
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,904
The younger one is on the run.

615
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,172
What do you mean on the run?

616
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,475
He ran away.

617
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:35,416
His father kept beating him,
so he ran away.

618
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,920
- And he hasn't turned up?
- No, sweetheart, he hasn't turned up.

619
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,426
Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

620
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,461
Hold on a minute.

621
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,562
Try a little roll. It's still warm.

622
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,639
I baked it myself.

623
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,071
Thank you. Bye-bye.

624
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,405
Listen, my dear. Don't go.

625
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,247
Stay. Talk to me.

626
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,949
I have to go.

627
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:18,788
Grandma, why didn't you open the door?

628
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,363
Are you afraid?

629
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,597
It's the chain. See?

630
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:28,604
I can't open the door.
The chain won't let me.

631
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,741
Take care of yourself.

632
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,519
Hello.

633
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,188
Police?

634
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,095
Let me speak to Comrade Kalinka.

635
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,167
Yes.

636
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,202
Hello. This is Petrukhina.

637
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,666
Listen, one of my boys is missing.
He ran away from the dorm.

638
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,172
Yes. He didn't show up at home.

639
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,511
Luggage? No, he didn't take any.

640
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,181
He wouldn't have any money.

641
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,581
He's 16 years old.

642
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,489
Yes. Vostriakov, Sergei Fedorovich.

643
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,429
Sergei Fedorovich.

644
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,395
Yes. His brother.

645
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,532
I have guests.

646
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:36,936
What happened, Mom?

647
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,201
Someone's run away.

648
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,013
First, you ran off.

649
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,173
I got married.

650
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,215
- Are you in a hurry?
- Yes.

651
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,448
I was looking through these tapes.
I found the one Nina sent you.

652
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,852
Do you want to listen to it?

653
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,034
Tanya.

654
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,405
Maybe you can stay?

655
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,949
You don't love him, do you?

656
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,747
Mom, I don't want to discuss this
with anybody, least of all with you.

657
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,587
Well, thanks.

658
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,707
Mom, don't.

659
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,308
I'll come to visit.

660
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,153
All right.

661
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:05,893
You need a vacation.
You should go to Nina's. Take the boat.

662
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,290
Buy yourself a new robe.

663
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,866
Let's go buy it now.

664
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,600
Later.

665
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,536
Let me.

666
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,312
Mom, you're young.

667
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,249
You're still good-looking.

668
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,045
Why are you laughing? It's the truth.

669
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,716
Other women your age get married.

670
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,656
So they do. I will too.

671
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,853
Do it. Why don't you?

672
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,429
Well, maybe I will.

673
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,060
Do it. Start a new life.

674
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,104
You've been in charge of this, that
and the other all this time.

675
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:49,638
You're run down.

676
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,834
You've got to let go of all that.

677
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,071
Let someone else worry about those brats.

678
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,570
- Let someone else do it?
- Yeah.

679
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,548
Let someone else do it?

680
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,586
You don't really like your mother.

681
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,249
Of course.

682
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,125
I'm provincial, unsophisticated.

683
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,095
I embarrass you.

684
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,598
I'm a gruff old soldier.

685
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,167
Mom, it's not that.

686
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,670
"Let someone else do it."

687
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,812
This is how you think?

688
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:36,514
I never even knew such words as these.

689
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,087
"Let someone else do it."

690
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:44,358
All my life, I worked
for myself and for other people -

691
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:48,122
wherever I was needed,
no picking and choosing.

692
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:51,463
For myself and for other people.

693
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,230
And I never regretted it.

694
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,635
Are you listening?

695
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,435
I understand.

696
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,409
Mom, do you want me to stay?

697
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,391
You pity me.

698
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,161
Don't pity me.

699
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,128
Instead, you should envy me.

700
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,794
Yes, you should envy me.

701
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,403
You don't have to stay.

702
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,134
Go on.

703
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,270
Tanya.

704
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,909
<i>Nadya, we waited for you!
We've got lots of news!</i>

705
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:22,651
<i>Nina's defended her thesis.
And Klasha works at the UN.</i>

706
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,725
<i>Wait! Petruha, what a pig you are.</i>

707
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,560
<i>You didn't even show up for Victory Day.</i>

708
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,793
<i>We waited for you at the Bolshoi Theater
for half a day.</i>

709
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,268
<i>Maybe you think you're too good now
for your old comrades?</i>

710
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:38,398
<i>Well, if you don't show up in three days,
then we're on the way to you!</i>

711
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,341
<i>We're gonna put you on KP!</i>

712
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:44,812
<i>- Nadya. Maybe you're sick?
- What are you saying? Stop it.</i>

713
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,940
<i>Listen, girls, let's sing a song for Nadya.</i>

714
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,419
<i>Where the infantry won't get through</i>

715
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:56,049
<i>Where an armored train won't pass</i>

716
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,061
<i>Where a somber tank
won't crawl through</i>

717
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,395
<i>There the steel bird will fly</i>

718
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,528
<i>Where a somber tank
won't crawl through</i>

719
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,472
<i>There the steel bird will fly</i>

720
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,977
Nadezhda Stepanovna.
That runaway's been found.

721
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,143
That Vostriakov fellow.
He's in the mess hall.

722
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,882
He hasn't eaten in two days.
He's starving, all skinny.

723
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,656
You've made me very happy.

724
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,193
Nadezhda Stepanovna.

725
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,196
Wait here, boys.

726
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,604
There's a lot of work for you.

727
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,937
I love your jacket.

728
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,706
Come on in.

729
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,778
- Wait, Boris Grigorievich.
- Wait a minute.

730
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,578
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
Vostriakov is back.

731
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,120
Should I bring him in?
- I know. Yes, go ahead.

732
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,225
Come in.

733
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,258
Well?

734
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,289
What have you got to say to us?

735
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:52,505
Forgive me, Nadezhda Stepanovna,
for my terrible behavior at the club.

736
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,043
I've realized my mistakes.
It won't happen again.

737
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,080
I'll never disgrace the honor
of the school ever again.

738
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,725
Yermolaeva, forgive me for...

739
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,559
shoving you.

740
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,366
It won't happen again.

741
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,383
May they leave?

742
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:47,295
Yes. Everyone except Vostriakov.

743
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,979
Once more.

744
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,683
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
please forgive my terrible behavior.

745
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,781
I'll never disgrace the school again.
I've realized -

746
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,519
All right, stop it.

747
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:18,958
Enough with the apology.

748
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,665
I don't believe it.

749
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,939
Listen, Vostriakov.

750
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,003
Where were you planning to go?

751
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,738
Did you want to become a dockworker?
A street sweeper?

752
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,015
Do you want to follow your brother
down the same road?

753
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,849
Vostriakov.

754
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,696
Why are you so arrogant?

755
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,431
I despise you.

756
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,220
Is everything all right?
See? I told you.

757
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:55,621
I have the birthday greetings,
straight from the printer's.

758
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:59,058
It just needs your signature,
and then it's all done.

759
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,105
<i>Passengers without tickets
are prohibited.</i>

760
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:47,199
<i>Give up your seats for elderly passengers.</i>

761
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,086
<i>Mom, look, a dog.</i>

762
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,574
Nadya!

763
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,185
- How are you?
- Fine.

764
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,451
- What are you up to?
- Nothing special.

765
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,790
Are you going to the airfield?

766
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,024
We're off to the tournament tomorrow.

767
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,964
I'm working my guys pretty hard.

768
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,036
- Well, good luck.
- I'll need it.

769
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,876
We should all get together.
- Yeah.

770
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,383
Stop!

771
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,122
Do it again!

772
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,357
Faster!

773
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:03,465
Are you open?

774
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:05,200
Come on in, Nadezhda Stepanovna.

775
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:06,969
- Hello.
- Hello.

776
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,566
I'm just taking a delivery.

777
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,607
Would you like a beer?
- I'm just hungry.

778
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,045
How about a drink?
- We don't sell liquor.

779
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,212
How about a beer?
- I guess beer will do.

780
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,722
Good. I'll have one
to keep you company.

781
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,557
<i>- Alexandra Ivanovna, the beer's here!
- Coming.</i>

782
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,152
I'll bring you some beer.

783
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:35,968
- Let me help you.
- No. It's all right.

784
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,505
- Come on.
- No, stop.

785
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,268
- It's easier together.
- I'm used to it.

786
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,003
- You're Alexandra Ivanovna.
- Call me Shura.

787
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,147
"Alexandra Ivanovna" is for the guys
when they're around. It's more formal.

788
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,084
I've noticed you for a while.
You pass by, morning and evening.

789
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,246
And you're always alone.
- Yeah.

790
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,517
Always alone.

791
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,553
Done.

792
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,092
What about you?
Aren't you hungry?

793
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,794
I had dinner at home.

794
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,531
Pots and pans everywhere.
It's a mess.

795
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,535
Enjoy.

796
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,509
- It's like homemade.
- It's from the market.

797
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:22,616
- Do you have a big family?
- I've got two kids.

798
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,414
You've got a daughter.
I know that.

799
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,462
Do you have a husband?

800
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,895
Husband?

801
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,601
Yeah, I've got a husband.

802
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,259
But he's with somebody else.

803
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,201
Now he's good to her.

804
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,868
It happens, right?
- It happens.

805
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,444
Good beer.

806
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,982
Before the war, I lived in Moscow.

807
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:02,455
But after the evacuation,
I found myself here.

808
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,384
So it goes.
- I have friends in Moscow.

809
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:10,732
I haven't seen them in about five years.

810
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,031
It'd be great to see Moscow.

811
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,403
Funny thing is,

812
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,442
sometimes I sit down
to write them a letter

813
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,773
and nothing comes of it.

814
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,246
There's nothing interesting
to write about.

815
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,014
I feel I should make something up.

816
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:37,252
Nothing interesting in your life?
I would never have thought.

817
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:42,696
Seems like I'm always running around,
but it's all for nothing.

818
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,191
There's no pleasure in it for me
or for anyone else.

819
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,129
That's the way it goes.

820
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,506
I don't know.

821
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,009
I enjoy life.

822
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:58,609
It's just a shame
that time goes by so fast.

823
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,684
Seems like I just got out of school.

824
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:06,585
School number 225.

825
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:12,017
You know, I was considered artistic
when I was in school.

826
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:13,425
You're kidding.

827
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,523
I used to sing -

828
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,861
<i>The evening bell</i>

829
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:18,956
You join in.

830
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,502
<i>The evening bell</i>

831
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:28,269
<i>How many thoughts</i>

832
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,107
<i>It stirs in me</i>

833
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,614
I didn't have any talent.

834
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:43,419
I took dance,
but then they kicked me out.

835
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,426
I was taller than all the boys.

836
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:50,996
I would come home from school,
lock myself in my room

837
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,658
and dance the waltz.

838
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,043
<i>Remember, Nadezhda Stepanovna,
how they danced in The Great Waltz?</i>

839
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,467
- There's no wrapping paper.
- I only want half a pound.

840
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,163
<i>Mitya.</i>

841
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,274
<i>Mitya!</i>

842
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,480
<i>- Let's go back.
- Wait.</i>

843
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,023
<i>- Do you know the way back?
- No.</i>

844
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,491
Let's sit here a while.

845
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,791
<i>It's time to get back.</i>

846
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:11,958
<i>The whole hospital
must be looking for us.</i>

847
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,792
It's so quiet here.

848
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:18,699
Imagine.

849
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,674
It's always quiet here.

850
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:26,176
<i>This is a cart path. Right?</i>

851
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,614
<i>Right. It's made of stone.</i>

852
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,777
<i>Everything's made of stone here.</i>

853
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,116
<i>It's damp here.</i>

854
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:34,883
<i>You don't like it here?</i>

855
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,449
<i>A lieutenant brought me here.
He told an interesting story.</i>

856
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,554
<i>There used to be
an entire race of people here.</i>

857
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,359
<i>They carved a city out of the rock.</i>

858
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,525
<i>Can you imagine
how much work it took?</i>

859
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:49,468
<i>They worked miracles in stone,
and they became famous for it.</i>

860
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,904
<i>And then, all of a sudden,
they all disappeared.</i>

861
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:56,443
<i>Mitya, where do we go from here?</i>

862
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,672
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>

863
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,215
If you go left, you'll lose your horse.

864
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,209
If you go right, you'll lose yourself.

865
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,779
What would the heroes of old
do in this situation?

866
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,857
I can't remember.

867
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:12,189
<i>- Heroes always forged straight ahead.
- They were foolish.</i>

868
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,124
This is the road they must have taken.

869
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,600
<i>Did they come under attack?</i>

870
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,396
No. Somebody must have told them
that life is easier somewhere else.

871
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,273
<i>And they believed it?</i>

872
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,575
See for yourself.

873
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,274
And they paid for it.

874
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,876
Their art died wherever they ended up.
The stone was left behind.

875
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,351
<i>- It's a shame.
- Yeah.</i>

876
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,223
<i>Mitya, are you going to write to me?</i>

877
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,624
Petrukhina, report to your plane!

878
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,065
<i>Do you remember?</i>

879
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,270
Of course I do.

880
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,302
You were such a chicken.

881
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,610
<i>You're lying.</i>

882
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,841
<i>You used to tell me yourself
that I was the best pilot among the girls.</i>

883
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:16,656
<i>If I hadn't been wounded,</i>

884
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,091
<i>you wouldn't have learned
that I was at the front.</i>

885
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,660
<i>Did you ever think of me?</i>

886
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:36,304
Do you want me to transfer
to your unit?

887
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,809
They might transfer me.

888
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:44,044
<i>Mitya.</i>

889
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,688
<i>Do you love me?</i>

890
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:50,483
<i>Mitya, we have to go.</i>

891
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,117
Are you afraid?

892
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,719
<i>They must be looking for us.</i>

893
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,492
<i>Are you really brave,
or are you just letting on?</i>

894
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,963
I guess I'm just pretending.

895
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,602
<i>Are you tired of walking?</i>

896
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,509
No. Not me.

897
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,102
Are you?

898
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:14,080
<i>No, I can go on a lot longer.</i>

899
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:21,852
<i>This is the office where
Peter Alexevich lived and worked.</i>

900
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:25,951
Here is the table -

901
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,427
- Bless you!
- Thank you.

902
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,461
The table at which he sat.

903
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:35,936
Here's his microscope, his inkwell,
his scissors and his snuffbox -

904
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,233
Nadezhda Stepanovna,
excuse me, please.

905
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,001
You're sitting on an exhibit.

906
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,100
Could you please sit here?

907
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,769
I apologize for that.

908
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,472
Would you like me to call
Pavel Gavrilovich?

909
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,017
He might be a while.
- I'll wait. Thank you.

910
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,888
Don't touch the exhibits.

911
01:09:56,825 --> 01:10:02,661
We're standing in front of a display
devoted to the Great Patriotic War.

912
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,122
Nadezhda Stepanovna.

913
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:08,931
By any chance, do you happen to know when
the public bathhouse will be completed?

914
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,097
They started it some time ago.

915
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,368
As a people's deputy,
perhaps you know something about it.

916
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,338
- I don't know anything.
- Excuse me.

917
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,979
...a hero of the Soviet Union,

918
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:21,947
he was a brave officer.

919
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,042
Alexei Sedykh.

920
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:27,987
It was created
by one of our local artists

921
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,422
and donated to our museum.

922
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,359
- Did he die?
- No. Alexei Sedykh is alive.

923
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,459
Hey. Where are you going?

924
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,364
I made a bet.

925
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,959
Over here.

926
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,698
Proceed to the next exhibit.

927
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:48,940
Aren't you interested?

928
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,477
Why? I made a bet.

929
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:54,140
This is a photograph of the pilot
Dmitry Grachev.

930
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,946
He shot down 17 enemy planes

931
01:10:57,052 --> 01:11:00,681
and became a Hero of the Soviet Union
posthumously.

932
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,758
Here are two of his apprentices,
pilots in a women's air regiment -

933
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,918
Xenia Ovsiannikova
and Nadezhda Petrukhina.

934
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,086
Did they get killed?

935
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:10,222
Xenia Ovsiannikova was killed in 1945.

936
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:15,668
Nadezhda Petrukhina is alive and works
as a people's deputy in our city council.

937
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,398
Proceed to the next room.

938
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,064
Don't touch the exhibits.

939
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,056
<i>I see him!
I'm going in to attack!</i>

940
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:03,710
Mitya.

941
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,181
Mitya, what happened?

942
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,881
<i>Mitya!</i>

943
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,424
<i>Mitya!</i>

944
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,855
PETRUKHINA

945
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,090
<i>Nadya.</i>

946
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,135
Have you been waiting for me long?
- A while.

947
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,007
What are you doing
all burrowed in down here?

948
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,307
Did they bring you another mammoth?

949
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:42,178
No. Mammoths are pretty tough
to come by in our area.

950
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,887
Let's go to my office.

951
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:51,281
By the way, they did find
a real mammoth up north.

952
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,991
Think about it. After centuries
of lying in the permafrost...

953
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,998
the mammoth's flesh turned out
to be completely edible.

954
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:03,660
Scientists cooked his meat and tasted it.
It was all right actually.

955
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:07,006
A little tough though.
Kind of like bear meat.

956
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,379
Imagine - a real steak
made of mammoth's meat.

957
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,072
With onions.

958
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,150
Sounds good, huh?
Or, for example -

959
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,376
Pasha.

960
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,056
Marry me.

961
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,160
You don't want to.

962
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,968
Can't you see it?

963
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:38,904
The museum director
marries one of his exhibits.

964
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,307
I'm one of your exhibits.

965
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,012
Nadya, what happened?

966
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,606
<i>- Pavel Gavrilovich. Can I see you?
- I'm busy now.</i>

967
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,249
You know,

968
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,724
today a little girl asked about me -

969
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:02,661
"Did she get killed?"

970
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,958
So what do you think?

971
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,470
Was she killed?

972
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,284
Look. A chicken.

973
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:30,156
The only stuffed chicken in the world.

974
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,970
I've got some news.

975
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:47,639
You know, I've quit my job
at the school - for good.

976
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,004
I'm beginning a new life.

977
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,339
Imagine, Pasha.

978
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,178
Just like after the prom.

979
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:59,721
All roads are good.
Pick the one you like.

980
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:02,386
- May I?
- Come in, come in.

981
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:03,685
Nadya.

982
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:07,228
- Pasha, you've got to work.
- Look what we've found.

983
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,160
I am not letting you leave.

984
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,256
Pasha, I have to go home.
I'm tired.

985
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,198
Come over tonight.
We'll have some tea.

986
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:15,770
Take care.

987
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:40,958
Come on. A little more.

988
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,554
- Hello, Nadezhda Stepanovna.
- Hello.

989
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,736
Don't forget the screwdriver.

990
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,537
A little to the left.

991
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,910
This is good.

992
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,344
Watch out!

993
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,850
Out of the way!

994
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,355
Citizen, can I help you?

995
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:45,290
- Nadezhda Stepanovna. Hello.
- Hello.

996
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,362
Are you looking
for Konstantin Mikhailovich?

997
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,230
Has anyone seen Shuvalov?

998
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,425
- He's at the control tower.
- The control tower.

999
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:54,365
We're off to the tournament tomorrow.

1000
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,994
- Well, good-bye then.
- Good-bye. Come visit us again.

1001
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,064
- It won't start.
- We'll just push it.

1002
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,405
Malyshev, don't fool around.

1003
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,035
Come on. Help us out here.

1004
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,113
- Hello, Nadezhda Stepanovna.
- Hello, guys.

1005
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:11,049
Have you seen Konstantin Mikhailovich?
- He's left already.

1006
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,178
No, his jacket's right here.
He should be back shortly.

1007
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,597
SPEED

1008
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:30,157
Nadya. How are you?

1009
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:32,055
Fine.

1010
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,493
I'm just checking out your planes.
These are nice planes.

1011
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,428
You should have come earlier.
I would have given you a ride.

1012
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:41,766
Yeah, right. You know I wouldn't go.
That's the only reason you say that.

1013
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,830
Stay there, Nadezhda Stepanovna!
We'll push you!

1014
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,670
Come on, let's go!

1015
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,808
Feel the wind in your face!

1016
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:54,473
Yes! I will! And you will, too, soon!

1017
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,379
Good luck!

1018
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:57,178
Enjoy the fresh air!

1019
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:58,809
Have a nice flight!

1020
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:43,922
<i>Still higher, higher and higher</i>

1021
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,246
It's the last stretch.

1022
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:13,584
Wait, guys! Start slowing down!

1023
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:09,632
THE END
