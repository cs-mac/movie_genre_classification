1
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,085
Ferdinand Choupard is a minor
character in our story.

2
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,891
Nonetheless, he is where this
adventure begins,

3
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,028
as he wandered home

4
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,891
after an evening spent
playing cards

5
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,069
and sipping a marvellous
12-year-old malt whisky.

6
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,999
It was November 4th, 1911,

7
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,804
at 1 o'clock in the morning.

8
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,876
The streets were empty with
a chilly nip in the air.

9
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,037
Yet, at the same time,
exactly 953 metres from there,

10
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:46,084
the city was jumping.

11
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,055
On stage, Nicole Gambert,

12
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:52,090
or Nini-les-Gambettes,
kicked up a storm.

13
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,897
The enthusiastic audience
revelled in the show.

14
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:00,022
I love you.

15
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:13,870
Wonderful.

16
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,005
Great.

17
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,816
Every evening was a triumph.

18
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,046
From the gent over there.

19
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:22,819
And every evening for nearly a month,

20
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:25,822
Raymond Pointrenaud,
a former Prefect,

21
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:31,090
celebrated his promotion to Paris as
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

22
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:36,026
Meanwhile, Ferdinand had barely
travelled the 280 metres

23
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:41,031
that separate La Concorde
from Place des Pyramides.

24
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,884
Don't be shy!
You've seen others!

25
00:03:57,894 --> 00:04:01,921
Oh my God!

26
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:06,992
Ferdinand's visions were
in fact an optical illusion.

27
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:12,838
The frenzied lights came from the home
of Professor Marie-Joseph Esperandieu.

28
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:16,979
This eminent scientist and
expert on Ancient Egypt

29
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,073
had obtained a degree
in physics aged only 16.

30
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:23,854
His research culminated
35 years later

31
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,890
in a book with the evocative title,
Is There A Life After Death?

32
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:32,896
At the same moment,across the Seine,

33
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,033
the question seemed
to have been settled long ago.

34
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,045
Yet, on the first floor,

35
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,071
a life form that contravened
the laws of science

36
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,080
was about to give
the scientist his answer.

37
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,019
As the century's most
amazing experiment

38
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,055
took place before our eyes,

39
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,026
Inspector Albert Caponi
had his tightly shut.

40
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:11,964
Of course, had he seen the
pterodactyl fly by his window,

41
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,068
our story would have been
drastically different,

42
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:17,869
but for now no one could blame

43
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,940
the inspector for his somnolence.

44
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:23,004
His stoutness and perseverance
had previously earned him

45
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:25,911
a god many distinctions,

46
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:28,846
including the Medal of Merit
for solving

47
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:32,920
the mystery of the missing
persons of Dreux asylum.

48
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:35,022
He was decorated

49
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,854
on August 28th, 1907,

50
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,926
by the Prefect Raymond
Pointrenaud in person.

51
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:43,031
Raymond! What are you doing?

52
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,933
Let my little bird
land on your branches.

53
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:49,801
You devil! Nothing arouses
me more than poetry.

54
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,903
Really?

55
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:52,839
Yes!

56
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:57,114
As the night recedes,

57
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,982
the dew in the branch
prepares to fall

58
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,849
And the bird in the
nest to open its eyes...

59
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,089
Drive normally, can't you?

60
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,029
Godness me! Get out! Get out!

61
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:29,014
Hello!

62
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,921
Caponi speaking.

63
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,116
In the Seine?

64
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,084
In the Seine?

65
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,969
Oh my God!

66
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:50,867
Oh my God!

67
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,902
Oh my God!

68
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:56,065
Oh my God! Help me find the words.

69
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,946
This young man's a scientist too,

70
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:03,949
but a humble assistant,
working at the Botanical Gardens.

71
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,953
His name's Zborowsky and he's 23.

72
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,917
Science isn't his only passion.

73
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,027
He has another,
more voracious one.

74
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:17,089
Dear... Miss Adele...

75
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,023
What if she's married?

76
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,093
Or even worse, widowed?

77
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:27,034
Yes, his second passion is unconditional
love for Miss Adele Blanc-Sec.

78
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,874
A passion she provoked
with these few words...

79
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:33,913
Who's it for?

80
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:39,020
For Zbo... bo...
bobo rowsky.

81
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,078
First name, perhaps?

82
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,015
Yes.

83
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:43,855
Which is?

84
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,962
Andrej, with a J, as in jaguar.

85
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:49,999
Oh, I'd love this one.

86
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:53,996
A jaguar.

87
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,867
Oh.

88
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,852
Thank you!

89
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,088
Andrej Zborowsky was
definitively lost to science.

90
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:23,033
As for Adele Blanc-Sec
and her sense of humour,

91
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,837
they had set off on a new adventure,
much less monstrous and much more exotic,

92
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,007
since her publisher
had sent her to Peru

93
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:36,105
to unravel the mystery
of the last Incas.

94
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,882
Something you should
know about Adele,

95
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,045
to really understand her...

96
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:46,882
She listens to her instincts,
not her publisher.

97
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,020
Aziz, how many hours'
ride to the rendezvous?

98
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:52,058
In this heat,
at least six, Miss Adele.

99
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:55,866
Very well. Let' s move out.

100
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,938
What's "move" in Arabic?

101
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:01,939
Yalla, Miss Adele.

102
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:03,875
Yalla

103
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:08,883
And "Move, you ass,
or you're dead"?

104
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:05,940
Stop!

105
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:31,831
Is this it?

106
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,040
I think so.

107
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:34,005
Very well.

108
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,077
You need to drink

109
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,874
a lot of water in this heat.

110
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:50,147
These are the two men
I told you about.

111
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:55,994
A cup of tea before the drop?

112
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:57,098
I look like I drink tea?

113
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:28,089
Is this the tomb room?

114
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:29,099
Not yet.

115
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,936
It's the embalming room,
where the mummies were prepared.

116
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:39,002
The bodies were gutted on the altar
and the entrails thrown in these pots.

117
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:44,912
Then, after a quick wash, they were
powdered, made up and dressed.

118
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,852
What was this for?

119
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:53,080
Made-to-measure suits.

120
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,125
The body goes here
and the machine

121
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:56,894
wraps it in 200
layers of bandages.

122
00:13:58,164 --> 00:13:59,893
Not to mention the oil,
squirted between each layer.

123
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,866
What kind of oil is it?

124
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,867
No idea, but it worked a treat.

125
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,063
Found it!

126
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:16,015
Yes, this is it. Gents,
let's see your treasure.

127
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,014
Death...

128
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:34,001
is the only path...
that leads... to birth.

129
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,863
Your journey ends here,
darling.

130
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:07,933
To thank you for
your coperation,

131
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:10,904
we'll spare your life.
Get lost!

132
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:13,904
Fine Egyptian hospitality!

133
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,978
Yes, but he's not Egyptian.

134
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:17,881
Great...

135
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,883
A peculiarly inflammable
mix of oil and petroleum.

136
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:27,152
Enter with even a tiny match
and there'll be fireworks.

137
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,928
Let me know when your gentlemen's
club is open to women.

138
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,133
Excuse me.

139
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,977
Just as I thought.

140
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,901
Miss! After careful consideration,

141
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,094
we accept your application.

142
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:13,065
Allow me to save my
emotion for later.

143
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,906
That' s that bit done.

144
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:54,947
Hold on a sec...
Where'd you learn all this?

145
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:57,920
There are only two ways.
Be Egyptian or learn to read.

146
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:06,893
Amazing!

147
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:13,903
Allah is great!

148
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:32,146
I make a fortune.
I make a fortune.

149
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:34,993
Here he is...

150
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:37,992
C'mon, they're down there!

151
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,924
Even without the stone, it's very
heavy. How will we ever get it out?

152
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,892
In tombs like this,
there's a way in and a way out.

153
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:11,997
Find it.

154
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,901
Yes, Miss Adele.

155
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:18,969
Open it.

156
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Hey, wait.

157
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:24,945
Opening a pharaoh's tomb is sacrilege.
You can hang for that.

158
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,914
What punishment for
taking his gold?

159
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:27,937
None.

160
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:46,999
Beware, you witch!

161
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,039
I won't leave without my gold.

162
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:51,965
I fear you're right.

163
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,913
Money can't buy happiness,
Aziz. Open it!

164
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,860
That' s your pharaoh?

165
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,122
No, a doctor.

166
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:15,990
Don't move.

167
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:18,868
If it's for a consultation, miss,

168
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,904
you may be a bit late.

169
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,900
However, I know a specialist
institute in Cairo,

170
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:29,980
where the doctors would be
delighted to examine you.

171
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:35,849
I'm fine, thank you. Except for the nausea
I feel in your presence, Prof. Dieuleveult.

172
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:40,949
Still the same caustic sense of humour,
my dear Adele. You'll need it.

173
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:42,891
Meanwhile,

174
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:47,899
tell me why a great reporter
like you is here looting tombs.

175
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:48,899
Not looting, borrowing.

176
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:52,870
Of course! You're taking him for
a walk to get some fresh air.

177
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,975
Patmosis is a professor of medicine,

178
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:57,076
Ramses II's personal doctor.

179
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:59,840
The greatest medical
expert in Ancient Egypt.

180
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:03,948
Fortunately, because...
I need his expertise.

181
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:06,885
Would that be to cure humankind?

182
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,082
No, just my sister. She's ill.

183
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,893
How very thoughtful and touching!

184
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:18,032
But has it crossed your mind that
your professor is... dead?

185
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,963
I'd noticed, thank you.

186
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:22,068
How will you resuscitate him?

187
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,942
May I?

188
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,912
Is There A Life After Death?
That old fool, Esperandieu?

189
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,918
He's barely able to
spin a chair round.

190
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,986
He'll be dead before he
revives this old mummy!

191
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,920
Mind your language!

192
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,927
Mummies hear everything we say

193
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:44,928
and detest disrespect.

194
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:49,930
You're scaring me!
After the Ice Monster,

195
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:51,935
here comes the Sand Zombie!

196
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,024
Watch out, he's a real grouch!

197
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:55,972
My dear Adele,

198
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,941
I confess I'm one of
your most avid readers,

199
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:04,071
but this is by far the silliest
story you've ever told.

200
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:07,914
Take her away!

201
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:08,953
Yes, sir!

202
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:10,977
Come along. Hurry!

203
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,923
The way out?

204
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:16,928
I checked
every wall. Nothing.

205
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:17,928
It must be in the middle.

206
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,997
The tomb's in the middle.

207
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:20,122
See? You found it.

208
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,178
Hurry up. Let' s go!

209
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:46,022
Damn rainwater!

210
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:56,034
You know the punishment
for tomb raiders?

211
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:57,127
Hanging.

212
00:21:57,905 --> 00:21:58,894
For locals only.

213
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,908
Foreigners are given more
consideration

214
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:02,040
and a swift death.

215
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:04,969
More protocol,
but much less pain.

216
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,017
Miss! Miss!

217
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:13,950
A last wish perhaps?

218
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:17,924
It's not very god
for my health,

219
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,891
but I'd appreciate a cigarette.

220
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:25,899
Why not? One won't kill you!

221
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:28,899
Thank you.

222
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,100
It's magnificent.

223
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:35,906
Yes.

224
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:36,877
May I?

225
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,148
Yes.

226
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,020
A gift, I suppose?

227
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:46,946
A memento, actually.

228
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:50,926
My father. On his death.

229
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,128
Oh

230
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,862
It's better this way. Whenever
I use it, I think of him.

231
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,126
Oh

232
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,067
I'd like to give you a souvenir.

233
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,143
Really?

234
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,910
Whenever you use it,
think of me.

235
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:31,968
Into my arms!

236
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:14,973
Forgive me the sudden intimacy.

237
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,918
Excuse me, my god man!

238
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:22,056
Cairo?

239
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:26,894
Thanks.

240
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,942
Put him on the table.

241
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,917
Calm down. Careful!
We'll take care of you.

242
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,052
Scissor.

243
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,014
Calm down, Professor. Oxygen!

244
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:55,958
We're nearly there.

245
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,997
I'll kill that woman!
Oxygen!

246
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,061
I'll kill her!
Oxygen!

247
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,097
I'll kill her! Breathe in!

248
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,174
I'll kill her! Breathe in!

249
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,100
Blow out! Blow out!

250
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:22,922
Fifty!

251
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:24,948
Mr. Choupard,

252
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:28,891
how can I believe a man with
50% alcohol on his breath?

253
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,896
I swear it's true,
Commissioner.

254
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:31,931
Inspector.

255
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:34,999
Inspector, yes. The bird swooped
onto the car

256
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,094
and pecked it to pieces!

257
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,940
And Prefo Pectoral...was aboard.

258
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:41,942
Ex-Prefect.

259
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:46,106
And he had a scantily
clad woman next to him.

260
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:49,005
A scantily clad woman?

261
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:53,986
With Pointrenaud, founder of
Christian Aid? Nonsense!

262
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:55,923
I know, but I saw her!

263
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:58,926
Like you saw Joan of
Arc ablaze once more.

264
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,955
Sir...

265
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,896
We've identified the dead.

266
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:08,000
There were three passengers
in the vehicle.

267
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:12,170
Pointrenaud, his driver, and...

268
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:16,913
god Lord!

269
00:26:17,147 --> 00:26:18,045
What did I tell you?

270
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:20,912
To the drunk tank!

271
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm innocent!
It's the big bird that did it!

272
00:26:24,988 --> 00:26:26,923
I was just going home.

273
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:30,922
Gentlemen, until we find out
more about this tragedy,

274
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:36,099
I'm relying on you to keep
this case confidential.

275
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:38,925
of course, sir.

276
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,934
not a word to the press.
no, sir.

277
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:46,101
The Prefect and the Showgirl!

278
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:50,037
Their Dance with Death!

279
00:26:50,082 --> 00:26:53,176
Giant Bird Preys
on the Capital!

280
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,149
Get The Little Parisian today!

281
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:58,924
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!

282
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,926
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!

283
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:02,985
Monster Kills Prefect!

284
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:04,163
Police Clueless!

285
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:06,158
Read all about it!

286
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:09,100
There you are, sir.

287
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:12,969
Monster Kills Prefect!
Police Clueless!

288
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:17,201
A pterodactyl? How grotesque!

289
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:19,970
They'll do anything
to sell their rag.

290
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:21,910
Even Le Gaulois has run it.

291
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,074
They'll panic people, that' s all.

292
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:27,079
Probably. It's the talk of the town.

293
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:31,955
Send poor Pointrenaud's widow
our condolences.

294
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,027
Yes, Mr. President.

295
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:41,901
A Prefect with a showgirl, perhaps.
But a pterodactyl?In the 20th century!

296
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:47,998
you sent for me, sir?

297
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:52,977
Yes. Call the Interior.

298
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,882
god morning, sir.

299
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:02,184
This pterodactyl business sounds
serious. It could be anarchists

300
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,125
up to their tricks.

301
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,987
Look into it and
keep me informed.

302
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,156
Leave it to me, sir.

303
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,167
Call the Prefect.

304
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:16,972
Hello!
En...

305
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:17,941
Minister.

306
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,906
This pterodactyl
business is dragging on.

307
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,137
The President wants
results this week.

308
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:24,078
I'll take care of it, sir.

309
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:28,118
Call Police Headquarters.

310
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:31,987
Yes? Dugommier?

311
00:28:32,056 --> 00:28:34,081
Who's on the pterodactyl case?

312
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:36,056
Captain Poissard.

313
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:38,095
Hardly surprising
it's going nowhere!

314
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:40,154
We need more energy.
A sleuth!

315
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:43,126
Give him 72 hours to
obtain results.

316
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:45,160
I'm on the job, sir.

317
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,098
Get me Cheval!

318
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:49,071
Hello!

319
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:53,134
We have to solve this fast.
you have 48 hours.

320
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:55,113
Consider it done, sir.

321
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,081
What a mess!

322
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,069
Caponi speaking.

323
00:29:17,171 --> 00:29:19,002
Cheval here.

324
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:20,971
god morning, Commissioner.

325
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,100
I've put you on the
pterodactyl case.

326
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:26,038
Don't let me down.
Our reputation's at stake.

327
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:27,877
I'll do my best, sir.

328
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,074
you have 24 hours.

329
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:31,082
Thank you, sir.

330
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,892
Where'd an animal
like that come from?

331
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,120
Look...

332
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:47,932
It wasn't like that.

333
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,061
of course not, Andrej.

334
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,132
This egg's always
been in my care.

335
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:52,932
What happened?

336
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:55,110
Yesterday, an attendant
noticed broken glass.

337
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,941
He blamed it on
a careless visitor

338
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,948
and simply replaced the glass.

339
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,913
People are so clumsy!

340
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:03,178
It's more complicated
than that.

341
00:30:04,088 --> 00:30:06,022
Look at the remains
of the shell.

342
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:09,983
Most are still connected to
the amniotic membrane,

343
00:30:10,094 --> 00:30:11,061
as if the force that
cracked the egg

344
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:14,062
came from...

345
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,100
The inside?

346
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:17,134
Exactly.

347
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:20,037
But that would mean the egg...

348
00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:22,070
Hatched, Zborowsky.

349
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:27,043
After 1 35 million
years' gestation,

350
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:31,013
it emerged from
its shell and flew away.

351
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,086
Through there!

352
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:36,179
In that case,

353
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:40,016
could it be related to
the pterodactyl in the press?

354
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:43,961
you'd have made an
excellent policeman.

355
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:44,961
Professor Menard?

356
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:46,031
Yes?

357
00:30:46,198 --> 00:30:47,062
Inspector Caponi.

358
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:50,933
What can I do for you?

359
00:30:51,004 --> 00:30:53,939
I'm in charge of
the petrodactyl case.

360
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,907
Pterodactyl.

361
00:30:55,976 --> 00:30:58,001
That' s what I said.

362
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:00,909
Seeing the bone collection
in your museum,

363
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,981
I thought maybe you could help.

364
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:05,951
I'm strictly a Cretaceous man.

365
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:10,090
I'd suggest you see a
specialist in the Jurassic.

366
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,923
Look, I have 24 hours
to solve this.

367
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:15,996
I can't go visiting Jura.

368
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:22,968
Let me find you a specialist
in Paris in that case.

369
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:23,969
Most kind of you.

370
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,009
Say...

371
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,081
That egg... It'd make
a heck of an omelette.

372
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:40,053
Please follow me.

373
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,922
Yes, of course.

374
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,024
I'll keep you informed
of developments.

375
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,168
Please do.

376
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:55,069
godbye.

377
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:18,028
Come on...
Don't be scared. come on.

378
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,892
Look what I've got for you.

379
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:32,001
Smells god.

380
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:36,181
come on...

381
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,027
This is it, sir. Up there.

382
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:52,961
Excellent!
Fetch me a black coffee

383
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:54,125
and something to nibble on.

384
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,926
I can't think on an empty stomach.

385
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,001
you want more? Eat, my baby, eat!

386
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:09,914
That' s god, my baby.

387
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:21,123
Yes? What do you want?

388
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:23,090
Inspector Caponi.

389
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:25,100
I have some questions for you
about the ferodactyl.

390
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:27,168
Pterodactyl, sir.

391
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:30,936
I was told you're
a specialist.

392
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:38,070
Yes, that' s right. But this isn't a...
I was about to eat.

393
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:40,045
Perfect, that's our speciality.

394
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:45,148
Well, please come in then.

395
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:00,103
godness, it's dark in here.

396
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,031
I'm very sensitive to light.

397
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,143
Please, take a seat.

398
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,068
En.

399
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,088
Thanks, Jeannot. May I? I haven't
eaten in 2 days. Go ahead.

400
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:23,992
so, how can I be of help?

401
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,997
Tell me about the animal.

402
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,033
What it eats, where it sleeps..

403
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:30,101
We know very little
about its habits.

404
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:32,171
We do know it's a carnivore.

405
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,107
Quite right!

406
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,143
Nothing beats a
rare rib of beef!

407
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,204
What's that?

408
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:44,979
It's the toucan.

409
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,113
Please go on, Professor.

410
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,187
It has a wingspan of
about... six metres,

411
00:34:57,198 --> 00:35:00,190
and can fly for hours on end,
looking for food...

412
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:03,036
to take back to the nest.

413
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:06,073
There's a nest of them?

414
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:09,042
no, I mean... There's only one.

415
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:10,077
En

416
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:14,080
But at the time,
when they had a mate,

417
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:16,948
finding food and
building a nest

418
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,146
were their main activities.

419
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:22,953
Mating took place once a year

420
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,958
and for reasons as yet unknown,

421
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:30,160
they only laid
one egg at a time.

422
00:35:31,134 --> 00:35:35,935
Which explains their aggressive
nature, especially...

423
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:42,138
when it came to defending their
one...and only offspring.

424
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:44,913
Amazing!

425
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:49,983
Sir, the toucan's...

426
00:35:56,194 --> 00:36:00,928
Help! Help! Jesus!

427
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:23,046
It's because of the egg.
It was too much for him.

428
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,920
The man's deranged!
Take him away!

429
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,149
sorry.

430
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:52,112
Need a porter?

431
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,118
I wouldn't say no.

432
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:56,155
Adele

433
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:01,019
Mr Xavier? How kind.

434
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:03,097
My only hope of seeing you,
my dear,

435
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:05,157
as you travel far and near,

436
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:08,101
is if lie in wait
for you here.

437
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:09,101
Very god!

438
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:14,973
Gently! It's fragile.

439
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:16,238
Yes, ma' am.

440
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:23,043
no 28, Rue du Four, please.

441
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:27,123
so? Peru?

442
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,126
Far! Very far.

443
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:32,028
And very high.

444
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:33,930
Indeed.

445
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,189
You made it up Machu Picchu?

446
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,059
Every morning.

447
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:41,070
very morning!
Is it indiscreet to ask

448
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:45,006
what treasure you bring us
in that fine box?

449
00:37:46,177 --> 00:37:49,146
A pipe. An Andean pipe.

450
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:50,945
A pipe?

451
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:51,946
The large model.
A sacred pipe

452
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,075
I wrenched from the tomb
of the last Inca king.

453
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:55,151
No!

454
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:57,154
Yes! Fatal for the
uninitiated player,

455
00:37:57,189 --> 00:37:59,054
so don't touch.

456
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,092
Definitely not.

457
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:05,028
Tell me, my god man,
is this a cab or a B&B?

458
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:07,132
I'd love to get
moving, lady,

459
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:10,032
but these damn nags
are blocking the road.

460
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:13,105
When will they
ban horses from Paris?

461
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:15,003
This is the 200th century!

462
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,040
Move! you moron,

463
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:20,036
or you are dad!

464
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:21,970
Oh, what happened?

465
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:27,244
Where we were just now?

466
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:39,996
What hocus-pocus
have you brought back now?

467
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,966
Miranda, mind your language
and help with the bags.

468
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,004
I just cleaned your room.

469
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:51,168
you bring back these old dirty
relics again.

470
00:38:55,183 --> 00:39:00,986
I'll take care of this one personally.
What's all this mail?

471
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:04,149
The young man from
the Botanical Gardens.

472
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:08,053
A letter a day,

473
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:10,223
and two Monday to
make up for Sunday.

474
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:16,096
Reminds me of my youth in
Andalusia, in my mother's family.

475
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,040
There was a young picador,
strong as his bulls...

476
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,177
How is Agathe?

477
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:25,039
Fine. She's been very god.

478
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:26,978
But she eats less and less.

479
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:28,985
soon she'll be skin and bone.

480
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:30,111
We'll take god care of her.

481
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,951
Thank you, Miranda,

482
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,050
for your patience,
your time and your advice!

483
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:30,017
so, you
refuse to eat?

484
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,987
now you look so unhealthy.
You need some blusher.

485
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:01,007
you're as pretty as ever.

486
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,046
I hope Miranda didn't
bore you with Andalusia.

487
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:08,953
I was in Egypt.

488
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:10,015
I have a surprise for you.

489
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:13,096
Look!

490
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:15,029
Meet Patmosis,

491
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:18,067
personal physician of Ramses II,
the great pharaoh.

492
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:22,071
Medically, they
were so advanced.

493
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,164
Their preservation
techniques prove it.

494
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:26,107
Nobody's ever done better.

495
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:30,947
I'm sure with all his secrets,

496
00:41:31,049 --> 00:41:32,073
he'll son have you
on your feet.

497
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:39,081
As son as I find the
man who can revive him.

498
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,128
Sir?

499
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:58,010
I'm very sorry,
Miss Blanc-Sec.

500
00:41:58,212 --> 00:42:01,010
I was about to
slip you a note.

501
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:02,982
I'd no idea you were back.

502
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:03,983
I was about to go out.

503
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:06,018
I won't keep you.

504
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:07,085
I hope not.

505
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:08,955
Here...

506
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:12,182
Number them, so I
know where to begin.

507
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:15,062
forget the others. I mean,

508
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:18,223
you can read them later.
That one's the most important.

509
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,968
Ok,I will read them in bath.

510
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:22,134
In bath?

511
00:42:23,004 --> 00:42:24,972
I always do.

512
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:25,973
Um.

513
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:35,048
Beautiful.

514
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:36,183
What?

515
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:38,948
I mean, your room is beautifully
decorated.

516
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:40,055
What's this pterodactyl?

517
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:43,020
Exactly. That' s what my...

518
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:45,016
Which prison has a death row?

519
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:47,028
La Sante.

520
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,173
Can I do something to help?

521
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,037
Drink to my health!

522
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,027
Esperandieu,
your lawyer to see you.

523
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,067
your client, sir.

524
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,008
Miss Blanc-Sec?

525
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:42,243
What are you doing here?

526
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:45,116
Professor, I found Patmosis' mummy.

527
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:46,216
That' s impossible.

528
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:49,023
True, but I did.
And don't ask me how.

529
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:50,154
Where is it now?

530
00:43:50,229 --> 00:43:51,992
At home.

531
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:53,023
Waiting for you.

532
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,098
Oh.

533
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,137
But Adele...

534
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,071
I fear it will have
to wait some more.

535
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:02,073
I don't see how I
can get out of here.

536
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:06,077
Anyway, my mind is to busy
controlling the bird.

537
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,045
The pterodactyl?

538
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,149
Yes. I wanted to refine
my technique

539
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:12,186
while you were in Egypt.

540
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:18,024
I brought to life an egg
over 135 million years old.

541
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,993
Perfect! A 4,000000-year-old
mummy will be child's play.

542
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,055
Perhaps,

543
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:27,229
but the bird exhausts me.

544
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:30,234
Whenever I doze off, its killer
instinct takes over. I must stop it

545
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,201
My sister first,
then your giant insect.

546
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:37,036
That's fine by me,
but how will you get me out?

547
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:39,008
Trust your lawyer.

548
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:41,184
Sir?

549
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,981
I'm here to see my
client, Esperandieu.

550
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,070
Mr. Saint Hubert,
can we have a comment?

551
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:05,108
Don't crowd.

552
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,070
Hold back the reporters!

553
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:15,954
Gentlemen, calm down!
Let him speak!

554
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:18,248
I cut short my African trip

555
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,157
at the government' s behest.

556
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:25,162
They have invited me as an
expert to assist Mr Caponi

557
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,198
to dispatch this pterodactyl.

558
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:31,067
It's a great honour to put my talent
at the service of the nation.

559
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:33,230
Mr. Saint Hubert,
what approach will you use?

560
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:35,975
First, we'll track it down,

561
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:38,973
to study its
behaviour and habits.

562
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:40,070
How will you find it?

563
00:45:41,014 --> 00:45:43,983
Quite simply,
by raising our sights.

564
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:00,032
Anything god today?

565
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:00,965
Pigeon.

566
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,109
You've saved my life.

567
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:17,150
Don't mention it.

568
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:19,084
Come out, wherever you are.

569
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:28,095
It's right here, Caponi.
I can sense it.

570
00:46:28,131 --> 00:46:28,995
Wonderful.

571
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:51,046
it's pter...ptero...pterodactyl...

572
00:46:58,129 --> 00:46:59,153
What is it exactly?

573
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:01,966
Mutton! That' s what it is.

574
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,064
Really?

575
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:04,964
Categorically. Trust me,

576
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:06,103
I know my droppings.

577
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:09,071
It's the best
way to track an animal.

578
00:47:09,175 --> 00:47:11,973
We're making progress,
Caponi. Progress!

579
00:47:13,212 --> 00:47:14,270
Wonderful.

580
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:37,236
In the bowl,
there's a badge.

581
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,966
you're Armand
Petit-Blanchard, head cook.

582
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:41,971
Armand what?

583
00:47:42,043 --> 00:47:43,237
Petit-Blanchard, I said!

584
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:47,071
someone stole my badge
from my locker.

585
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,013
Hands off me!

586
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:52,143
Get out! That's enough now!

587
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,149
Right... I need a better plan.

588
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:04,062
sorry, no more pate.

589
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,997
Not to worry.

590
00:48:07,035 --> 00:48:08,195
Hey! Caponi!

591
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,202
Yes?

592
00:48:10,038 --> 00:48:13,201
Unless I'm mistaken,
it could find sheep in 3 places.

593
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:17,007
Montmartre in the north, the
colonial exhibition in the east,

594
00:48:17,046 --> 00:48:19,071
or the Botanical Gardens.

595
00:48:22,252 --> 00:48:23,116
That' s right.

596
00:48:23,286 --> 00:48:26,050
Let' s go!
By the grace of god!

597
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:30,118
Thank you, my son.

598
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:46,073
Wow! Sister is coming.

599
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:51,046
Don't touch!
Hurry up, let' s go!

600
00:48:59,157 --> 00:49:02,058
As Daddy would say,

601
00:49:02,127 --> 00:49:04,028
a battle that seems lost
is the most exciting.

602
00:49:05,097 --> 00:49:05,961
Up and at 'em!

603
00:49:10,102 --> 00:49:12,161
Bang! Bang!

604
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,041
Bang!

605
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:25,218
The farmer's counted the
herd twice. None missing.

606
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:26,975
Fine! Let' s go!

607
00:49:29,156 --> 00:49:30,054
My sheep!

608
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:33,059
I'm so sorry. It just went off.

609
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:37,026
Bertrand? Get a vet.

610
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:42,999
Cell 28. It's for his jab.

611
00:49:53,983 --> 00:49:54,972
Ouch!

612
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:56,149
Sorry.

613
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,060
Professor? Wake up!

614
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:10,032
It's time to go.

615
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:15,096
Would you be so kind as
to come back later?

616
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:17,072
I really am very tired.

617
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:21,010
That takes the biscuit!

618
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:32,984
Six Poitou goats,

619
00:50:33,024 --> 00:50:34,082
four Vanoise chamois,

620
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:35,988
fifteen Larzac ewes and...

621
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:39,096
nine, ten, twelve
mountain sheep from Jura.

622
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:40,061
Jura?

623
00:50:40,231 --> 00:50:42,097
All present and correct!

624
00:50:42,234 --> 00:50:44,134
god. On to the Botanical Gardens.

625
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:46,032
Get ready, Caponi!

626
00:50:46,138 --> 00:50:47,105
We'll launch our assault

627
00:50:47,272 --> 00:50:49,103
at first light.

628
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:50,206
Thank you!

629
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:01,982
You're relieved!

630
00:51:03,156 --> 00:51:04,123
Fine by me.

631
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:10,254
god luck!

632
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:30,017
I hope you had a god sleep.
We have to go now.

633
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:32,084
What are you doing here?

634
00:51:32,187 --> 00:51:33,984
It's not by choice.

635
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,054
Where's the Professor?

636
00:51:36,224 --> 00:51:40,092
They transferred him last night.
Always do before the execution.

637
00:51:41,062 --> 00:51:42,029
Execution?

638
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:44,165
The guillotine,
tomorrow at dawn.

639
00:51:44,265 --> 00:51:45,232
It can't be...

640
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:50,062
Unfortunately, it can, unless...
he gets a pardon.

641
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:51,104
Pardon?

642
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:52,171
Yes.

643
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:56,239
Here... I pardon you.

644
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:14,094
go on, fetch! good boy, Nelson!

645
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,066
Mr. President,
Miss Blanc-Sec's here.

646
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,001
She has nothing on her.

647
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,037
What? nothing on her?

648
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,073
We searched her.
She's unarmed.

649
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,048
go on!

650
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,211
Come on, Nelson! god boy!

651
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,023
My dear Miss Blanc-Sec!

652
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:44,187
Mr. President.

653
00:52:45,063 --> 00:52:46,087
You know I have a fond

654
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:47,155
memory of that interview...

655
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,124
When was it?

656
00:52:49,134 --> 00:52:50,226
January 18th, 1906.

657
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:52,193
The day after you
were elected.

658
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,128
It was my first interview.

659
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:58,076
And the last time I
laughed so much.

660
00:52:59,112 --> 00:53:00,170
Yes, I was appalling.

661
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:03,239
You were charming.

662
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,208
so, what can I do for you?

663
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:10,116
Well... As President, you often
criticise the death penalty.

664
00:53:10,224 --> 00:53:14,160
I've pardoned 17 condemned
men in my first term.

665
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:18,061
Precisely.
Please, pardon one more.

666
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:20,088
Professor Esperandieu.

667
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,098
Due for execution tomorrow.

668
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:23,099
He's innocent.

669
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:25,196
I know his case.
We have 3 dead bodies,

670
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,208
including a Prefect.

671
00:53:27,275 --> 00:53:30,142
He didn't kill them.
It was a prehistoric beast!

672
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:32,104
Only the Professor
can control it.

673
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:34,206
Without him,

674
00:53:34,216 --> 00:53:35,240
how many bodies
will there be?

675
00:53:36,117 --> 00:53:37,084
Miss,

676
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,210
we have put our
finest men on the case.

677
00:53:39,254 --> 00:53:43,191
We even called in a big game
hunter from Africa

678
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:45,021
to dispatch the animal.

679
00:53:46,195 --> 00:53:49,187
Nelson! Fetch your ball!

680
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:53,192
Esperandieu is a fine scholar.

681
00:53:54,103 --> 00:53:56,128
His research keeps
science going forward.

682
00:53:59,076 --> 00:54:03,069
By taking his life, you
condemn so many others.

683
00:54:04,248 --> 00:54:08,082
I promise I'll think it over.

684
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:10,153
Thank you, sir.

685
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:12,121
What's wrong?
your ball's over there!

686
00:54:12,256 --> 00:54:14,157
Fetch it, Nelson!

687
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,226
Come on! Look!

688
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:21,031
What's up? Seen a ghost?

689
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:25,262
See? your ball's over here.

690
00:54:26,237 --> 00:54:30,197
come and fetch it!
Be a god boy! Hurry!

691
00:54:30,242 --> 00:54:38,206
come! Nelson! come!

692
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:42,215
Oh,no! Mr. President!

693
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:47,990
god boy! Into my arms!

694
00:54:48,194 --> 00:54:49,161
Get down!

695
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,063
President assaulted!
Sorry!

696
00:54:55,135 --> 00:54:56,033
Don't move!

697
00:54:56,136 --> 00:54:57,194
Get off him!

698
00:54:58,071 --> 00:55:00,266
Take your paws
off me! Let me go!

699
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,167
Are you hurt, sir?

700
00:55:02,209 --> 00:55:03,176
I am fine, go away!

701
00:55:03,277 --> 00:55:05,211
I'm warning you,
I do jiu-jitsu.

702
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:08,272
Nelson!Nelson!
Let me go or I'll press charges!

703
00:55:09,216 --> 00:55:10,114
Nelson!

704
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:13,210
Nelson!

705
00:55:15,222 --> 00:55:17,053
Find Nelson!

706
00:55:42,051 --> 00:55:43,018
Eyes open, Caponi!

707
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:44,175
Both are wide open, honestly.

708
00:55:45,054 --> 00:55:47,079
Vigilance and patience are the
hunter's watchwords.

709
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:54,255
Tell me, Saint Hubert,could
I nip off for a minute

710
00:55:55,165 --> 00:55:56,132
for some food?

711
00:55:57,134 --> 00:56:00,001
Out of the question!
We are at war, my friend.

712
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:06,003
one day I hunted a tiger lying
low in a Bengali temple.

713
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:09,007
We went three days
without food.

714
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:11,207
Three days!

715
00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:15,117
Yes.

716
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,133
Incredible!
How did you do it?

717
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:41,976
I started by consulting all
the books in the library,

718
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:44,039
which confirmed the animal's

719
00:56:44,284 --> 00:56:46,047
sedentary nature.

720
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:47,242
so I got the idea to collect

721
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,123
the fragments of its egg

722
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:52,088
and put them in a quiet place.

723
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:54,193
Then I left out some

724
00:56:55,028 --> 00:56:56,290
choice cuts of beef,

725
00:56:56,296 --> 00:56:57,264
to keep them from hunger,

726
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:01,000
so it wouldn't decimate
our herd of Corsican sheep.

727
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:04,237
Zborowsky... You're a genius!

728
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:08,140
It's nothing really.
Just a little intuition.

729
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,041
With intuition like that,

730
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:14,047
you must sweep the ladies off
their feet, my young friend!

731
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,209
That depends on the lady.

732
00:57:20,322 --> 00:57:23,155
Are there two L's in Addle?

733
00:57:23,225 --> 00:57:25,056
no, two E's.

734
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:27,025
Two E's?

735
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:31,156
Adele. A-D-E-L-E. Blanc-Sec.
Like the wine. Dry white, you know.

736
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:34,193
Yes, I know dry whites.

737
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,237
Marvellous!

738
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:38,240
Go ahead.
From the beginning.

739
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:40,037
To cure my sister,

740
00:57:40,143 --> 00:57:41,269
I went to Egypt, not Peru,

741
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:43,074
to find a doctor, Patmosis,

742
00:57:43,279 --> 00:57:46,044
a charming but
mummified fellow.

743
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:48,051
Prof. Esperandieu
was supposed to wake him,

744
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:49,278
not the damn pterodactyl
he should've left alone,

745
00:57:49,286 --> 00:57:53,120
given its attack on
the President and his pet.

746
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:56,193
The petero...

747
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,227
no, the pet's the dog.

748
00:57:58,262 --> 00:58:02,222
I summoned up all my courage
and threw myself on the President.

749
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,201
A heroic but calculated gesture,

750
00:58:05,303 --> 00:58:06,292
intended to secure a pardon for

751
00:58:07,072 --> 00:58:08,039
the Professor to save my sister

752
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,071
I was arrested for
attacking him.

753
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:13,101
Do I look like a terrorist?

754
00:58:15,113 --> 00:58:16,080
no.

755
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:17,207
so the bird dunked on Nelson.

756
00:58:18,283 --> 00:58:20,275
Dunked?

757
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:22,276
Clear? Can I go home now?

758
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:28,152
Yes. However...
one tiny detail escapes me.

759
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:29,228
Which is?

760
00:58:30,296 --> 00:58:36,099
Who is... Whose is...
Whose is the dog?

761
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:42,200
Right... do you have
to speak in Morse,

762
00:58:42,276 --> 00:58:43,300
or we'll be all night?

763
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:50,174
I save the President and
that' s the thanks I get?

764
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,051
you louts!

765
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,042
Things didn't quite
go to plan, little sis.

766
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,027
I need a bath to
gather my wits.

767
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:52,077
sorry for bothering
you for nothing.

768
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:19,072
Truly. But aren't you happier here
eyeing the girls than in your tomb?

769
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,244
My god!

770
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:13,065
Yes?

771
01:02:13,135 --> 01:02:14,102
Into my arms!

772
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,159
I read your letter.

773
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,028
Which one?

774
01:02:18,107 --> 01:02:20,041
about the pterodactyl.
you're a genius, Andrej.

775
01:02:22,311 --> 01:02:25,179
Let' s go. The taxi's
waiting downstairs.

776
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:27,273
Right away.

777
01:02:29,085 --> 01:02:30,052
This way.

778
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,128
See? I wasn't telling you lies.

779
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:43,131
Incredible!

780
01:02:49,206 --> 01:02:50,264
Be careful, Miss Adele.

781
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,168
Don't worry, I've
cracked tougher nuts.

782
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:01,183
Birdy, birdy...

783
01:03:01,253 --> 01:03:05,121
It prefers meat.

784
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,088
Really?

785
01:03:09,294 --> 01:03:11,228
Silly me.

786
01:03:16,235 --> 01:03:18,135
Where are you from, my beauty?

787
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:21,262
I don't mean you!

788
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:28,237
In any case, you
have beautiful plumage.

789
01:03:29,216 --> 01:03:34,051
In truth, if your voice is the
equal of your coat...

790
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:42,023
Fine. Clearly no ancestor
of the nightingale.

791
01:03:42,296 --> 01:03:45,266
Watch out, it might
think you're a goat.

792
01:03:48,303 --> 01:03:50,168
you smooth-talker.

793
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
no, I meant...

794
01:03:52,106 --> 01:03:54,040
I'm usually called bird names.

795
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:55,109
Really?

796
01:03:56,311 --> 01:04:01,078
My dove... My chickadee...

797
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:05,153
My feathery thing!

798
01:04:10,259 --> 01:04:12,124
Actually...

799
01:04:13,095 --> 01:04:15,086
You want my
feathers, don't you?

800
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:32,113
My feathery thing...
Feathers of little birdies...

801
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:33,115
Incredible!

802
01:04:35,086 --> 01:04:39,216
There you go, that' s
god. Now we're friends,

803
01:04:39,257 --> 01:04:41,225
I have a favour
to ask of you.

804
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:43,293
Surely you're not going to...

805
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:45,059
It'd be rude not to.

806
01:04:58,076 --> 01:05:01,068
It's madness!

807
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:04,248
It can't be more
complicated than a camel.

808
01:05:05,217 --> 01:05:06,241
It can.

809
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,231
Watch out! The tree!

810
01:05:32,313 --> 01:05:33,245
Stop!

811
01:05:35,282 --> 01:05:36,146
There we are.

812
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:38,285
you're unbelievable,
Miss Blanc-Sec.

813
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:43,319
now we've mastered the unbelievable,
let' s perform the impossible.

814
01:06:06,182 --> 01:06:07,206
Here we are!

815
01:06:19,296 --> 01:06:20,263
This way, my friends.

816
01:06:21,098 --> 01:06:22,224
This is so exciting!

817
01:06:22,332 --> 01:06:24,300
you haven't seen anything yet.

818
01:06:25,102 --> 01:06:27,263
And don't blink,
or you'll miss it.

819
01:06:43,287 --> 01:06:46,018
I prepared some snacks for you.

820
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,116
god thinking.
This is for you.

821
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,127
Thank you.

822
01:06:49,128 --> 01:06:51,153
Champagne? I'll be tipsy again.
Which way?

823
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,128
At the window.

824
01:06:52,164 --> 01:06:53,062
Thank you.

825
01:06:56,235 --> 01:06:58,260
Look at the crowd.
We're just in time.

826
01:07:09,315 --> 01:07:12,216
There he is!
An ugly little head he has.

827
01:07:13,253 --> 01:07:14,242
I see why they'd chop it off.

828
01:07:15,288 --> 01:07:16,152
Charlotte!

829
01:07:18,192 --> 01:07:25,121
It was because of the egg.
It was too much for him.

830
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,136
They've put a bag on his head.

831
01:07:46,088 --> 01:07:50,115
I don't understand. Why'd the executioner
fly off with a bag on his head?

832
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:02,133
There! There it is!

833
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:03,069
There! I'm here!

834
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:06,336
It's snatched a man. Fetch an ambulance.
Leave the rest to me.

835
01:08:07,077 --> 01:08:10,308
I'll go right away.

836
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:41,245
you keep it, buster.
you've earned it.

837
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:50,113
Anyone there! Where are we?
Is this hell?

838
01:08:51,056 --> 01:08:52,023
Here I am!

839
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:53,180
Adele?

840
01:08:54,193 --> 01:08:55,160
Hello.

841
01:08:55,294 --> 01:08:57,126
How can this be?

842
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:02,131
He saved your life. You brought
him to life, so it's only fair.

843
01:09:02,169 --> 01:09:03,101
Yes.

844
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:06,205
What's going on? Who are these...

845
01:09:07,307 --> 01:09:08,296
Esperandieu?

846
01:09:08,341 --> 01:09:10,104
Menard!

847
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:12,246
By the saints! A miracle!

848
01:09:12,246 --> 01:09:14,180
Menard, you old blackguard!

849
01:09:14,182 --> 01:09:16,173
Esperandieu, well I never!

850
01:09:22,223 --> 01:09:23,212
How on earth did
you get here?

851
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:26,054
That' s a very long story.

852
01:09:26,093 --> 01:09:27,253
you can tell it later.
This winter,

853
01:09:27,361 --> 01:09:29,296
over a hot chocolate.

854
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,157
We have a mummy to
wake and sister to save.

855
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,124
Just joking!

856
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,203
Yes, she's just joking.

857
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,032
Well, I'm not joking.

858
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,103
Tired after your trip?

859
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,200
Indeed I am. Very tired.

860
01:09:41,276 --> 01:09:43,107
Want to go home?

861
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,113
Yes. I should be going home.

862
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,246
I'll take you.

863
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,045
Yes, take us home.

864
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:53,053
Sure, take him home.
godbye, ducky!

865
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:55,249
What's that...

866
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:12,073
Saint Hubert?

867
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:16,303
Esperandieu!

868
01:10:18,183 --> 01:10:19,241
not now!

869
01:10:19,284 --> 01:10:20,216
What's wrong?

870
01:10:25,323 --> 01:10:26,290
Saint Hubert.

871
01:10:30,161 --> 01:10:31,219
Get out!

872
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:34,233
Stupid hound!

873
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:38,098
you worthless nincompoop, who
allowed you to shoot at science?

874
01:10:39,272 --> 01:10:44,073
I am Justin de Saint Hubert,
big game hunter...

875
01:10:44,176 --> 01:10:45,165
Big game hunter?

876
01:10:46,212 --> 01:10:47,270
I'm a hunter, too,

877
01:10:47,346 --> 01:10:49,211
but I only shoot black sheep.

878
01:10:49,282 --> 01:10:51,274
You seem a fine specimen.

879
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:53,047
Stop that! you've no right!

880
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,178
one!
no!

881
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:55,278
Two!
no!

882
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:57,119
Three!
no!

883
01:10:57,157 --> 01:10:59,284
Four! Five!
no! no! no!

884
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:03,058
Don't die now, please!

885
01:11:03,196 --> 01:11:04,254
I'll do my best.

886
01:11:04,298 --> 01:11:06,061
Let me help.

887
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,202
If you want to help,
look after the pterodactyl.

888
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:10,237
But the Professor's bleeding.

889
01:11:10,305 --> 01:11:14,071
They're connected!
Don't ask how or why.

890
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,270
If we lose one, we lose both.
Don't let it happen.

891
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:20,303
Yes, of course!
Leave it to me.

892
01:11:24,153 --> 01:11:25,142
Twenty-eight, Rue du Four.

893
01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:33,218
What do I do now?

894
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:36,230
Place antique objects
in a circle around me.

895
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:45,102
The older the better.

896
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,255
Yes, that one.

897
01:12:16,308 --> 01:12:21,143
I'm going to need to...
put this bandage on you.

898
01:12:24,316 --> 01:12:26,284
I'll be right back.

899
01:12:31,224 --> 01:12:32,282
There! What now?

900
01:12:34,293 --> 01:12:38,320
now... I'll try to establish
contact with the mummy

901
01:12:39,298 --> 01:12:42,324
to see if it agrees to
entrust the keys to me.

902
01:12:43,369 --> 01:12:44,267
Excellent!

903
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,298
What keys?

904
01:12:48,275 --> 01:12:52,041
After death, the
whole body shrinks

905
01:12:52,312 --> 01:12:56,271
and locks itself in the mind
which never die.

906
01:12:56,350 --> 01:13:02,347
I discovered the key to
communicate with the mind.

907
01:13:03,124 --> 01:13:04,113
Wonderful!

908
01:13:44,301 --> 01:13:45,290
It's going to work.

909
01:14:05,256 --> 01:14:15,098
Maybe... some procoagulants...
in a nub... of butter?

910
01:14:25,345 --> 01:14:30,305
Professor!

911
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:36,322
Please, stay with me. Please,
just a little longer!

912
01:15:44,262 --> 01:15:45,354
Bless you.

913
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:50,299
Thanks.

914
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:01,279
sorry about the glass.

915
01:16:02,114 --> 01:16:05,106
forget it. I have
to tidy up anyway.

916
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:18,092
What a shame he's gone. I'd have
liked to get to know him.

917
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:29,172
What have we here? I detect
a certain likeness.

918
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:31,134
She's my sister.

919
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:35,113
She doesn't look well.

920
01:16:35,349 --> 01:16:36,213
Yes...

921
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,087
But...

922
01:16:41,288 --> 01:16:42,118
Actually...

923
01:16:42,356 --> 01:16:46,190
With the knowledge you possess,
perhaps you could try

924
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,287
to bring her back to life?

925
01:16:50,332 --> 01:16:52,095
I have some modest talents,

926
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:54,065
but not that one.

927
01:16:55,237 --> 01:16:57,296
What? You're not a doctor?

928
01:16:58,306 --> 01:17:01,275
Absolutely not.
I'm a nuclear physicist.

929
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:06,047
I deal in figures, signs and
equations. nothing very extraordinary.

930
01:17:06,315 --> 01:17:09,148
doctors don't leave
the pharaoh's side,

931
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:13,221
and are buried next to them,
right next door.

932
01:17:16,225 --> 01:17:18,125
May I make some tea?

933
01:17:18,194 --> 01:17:19,183
Be my guest.

934
01:17:19,262 --> 01:17:22,288
Very kind of you.

935
01:17:22,332 --> 01:17:24,300
Kindness is a highly prized
quality in our dynasty.

936
01:17:28,172 --> 01:17:30,265
I admit that throughout
this adventure,

937
01:17:30,374 --> 01:17:35,311
you have been very hospitable towards
me, and I'd like to thank you.

938
01:17:36,213 --> 01:17:37,202
you could hear?

939
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,248
Everything.

940
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:41,113
And see? Like when I...

941
01:17:43,354 --> 01:17:44,286
Everything.

942
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:51,221
Don't blush. With this body,you
appreciate that of others more.

943
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:52,353
Thanks.

944
01:17:55,134 --> 01:17:58,297
I suppose you want a doctor
to cure this poor child.

945
01:18:00,306 --> 01:18:03,332
Yes. not only is
she my sister,

946
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:07,373
but also my friend,
my angel... My twin.

947
01:18:12,219 --> 01:18:14,187
What happened to her?

948
01:18:15,322 --> 01:18:17,187
A freak accident.

949
01:18:18,225 --> 01:18:19,192
A camel?

950
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:22,318
Tennis.

951
01:18:30,171 --> 01:18:31,331
Lend me your hatpin.
no way!

952
01:18:32,106 --> 01:18:33,073
Thanks.
for nothing.

953
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:34,172
How do I look?

954
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:35,209
Like skewered kidneys.

955
01:18:35,309 --> 01:18:38,335
Which I take to mean...
"Gracious!

956
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:43,072
Why did my parents give her beauty and
leave me only bitterness and jealousy?"

957
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:49,256
one game all. New balls.

958
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,362
We'd just turned twenty.

959
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,388
Agathe was so beautiful.

960
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,164
We'd discovered a new sport
and played whenever we could.

961
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:05,107
In order too avoid
any sense of rivalry,

962
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:07,200
we never had an actual match.

963
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:09,303
Our games were
strictly friendlies.

964
01:19:50,389 --> 01:19:54,120
Then, in a moment of euphoria,
a moment of shared happiness,

965
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:56,128
tragedy struck.

966
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:17,111
Agathe!

967
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:20,216
Miss, are you okay?

968
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,085
Miss, wake up!

969
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:29,230
Move! Please!
Agathe! Move!

970
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:32,356
No, not that!

971
01:20:33,134 --> 01:20:36,365
Sorry! Stay with me!
Go and fetch a doctor!

972
01:20:37,272 --> 01:20:44,111
Agathe!Agathe!
Agathe!Agathe!Agathe!

973
01:21:06,269 --> 01:21:09,204
She was born a
few minutes after me

974
01:21:10,373 --> 01:21:16,210
but she departed well before me.It's
the only race I'd have loved to lose.

975
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:25,188
Indeed, a most
regrettable accident.

976
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:29,160
Believe me, I'm very
sorry I can't help you.

977
01:21:30,195 --> 01:21:33,187
The Professor did a remarkable
job. His mental power

978
01:21:33,231 --> 01:21:35,358
must have woken the
dead in a radius of 2 km.

979
01:21:36,268 --> 01:21:38,202
But I'm not the right person.

980
01:21:41,206 --> 01:21:44,267
Hold on a sec... 2 kilometres?

981
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:46,202
Yes, probably.

982
01:21:47,213 --> 01:21:50,307
The waves ripple out like when
you throw a stone into water.

983
01:21:51,217 --> 01:21:53,208
And Ramses' doctors
never left his side?

984
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,180
They never left the room, even when he
was mating. The Mummies of Ramses II.

985
01:22:08,202 --> 01:22:10,261
Patmosis, you're a genius.

986
01:22:11,372 --> 01:22:12,339
Let's go!

987
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:30,283
Excuse me, I'm looking for
the Ramses exhibition.

988
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:32,257
Yes, quite!

989
01:22:38,134 --> 01:22:40,398
Stop importuning people.
You'll get us noticed.

990
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:45,103
After 5,000 years in a tomb,
can't I have some fun?

991
01:22:45,174 --> 01:22:47,142
I couldn't resist.
It was rather amusing.

992
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:49,168
First things first.
Then you can die.

993
01:22:49,346 --> 01:22:50,335
of laughing, if you wish.

994
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:05,361
Can you open it?

995
01:23:06,264 --> 01:23:08,255
I'm no better
locksmith than doctor.

996
01:23:08,366 --> 01:23:12,200
Perhaps you could serve some kind of
purpose, or I'll float you down the Seine.

997
01:23:12,236 --> 01:23:14,170
The Nile, it ain't!

998
01:23:14,172 --> 01:23:17,141
Don't get upset. Humour soothes
the savage breast.

999
01:23:17,241 --> 01:23:19,175
That' s not humour!

1000
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:22,280
Maybe it made
the pharaohs laugh,

1001
01:23:22,314 --> 01:23:24,077
but this is the 200th century!

1002
01:23:36,195 --> 01:23:37,162
That' s better.

1003
01:23:53,413 --> 01:23:55,143
This way, Mistress.

1004
01:24:07,294 --> 01:24:08,226
Patmosis!

1005
01:24:08,329 --> 01:24:10,297
Yes, Mistress.

1006
01:24:19,207 --> 01:24:20,299
Coming, Mistress!
This way, Mistress.

1007
01:24:20,408 --> 01:24:22,137
Cut it out!

1008
01:24:22,177 --> 01:24:24,270
you're very tense. Relax.

1009
01:24:24,412 --> 01:24:26,243
I'll give you a massage later.

1010
01:24:26,314 --> 01:24:27,282
you're a chiropractor now?

1011
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:30,319
no, but I studied
molecular energy.

1012
01:24:30,353 --> 01:24:32,184
for now, stick
to opening dors.

1013
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:42,358
Beautiful, eh? Reminds me
of when we painted.

1014
01:24:45,269 --> 01:24:46,258
All clear?

1015
01:24:48,138 --> 01:24:49,196
Look, what's that?

1016
01:24:49,273 --> 01:24:50,137
what?

1017
01:24:50,407 --> 01:24:52,102
Patmosis!

1018
01:24:52,309 --> 01:24:53,298
Leave it to me, Mistress.

1019
01:24:54,278 --> 01:24:56,212
Miss!

1020
01:25:03,388 --> 01:25:06,357
Waking people, no, but knocking
them out, no problem.

1021
01:25:07,325 --> 01:25:08,314
Thank you, Mistress.

1022
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:15,189
Oh my god!

1023
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,132
They're all jumbled up.

1024
01:25:17,203 --> 01:25:19,137
If Ramses saw this...

1025
01:25:19,171 --> 01:25:20,331
Wake him, so he can
rearrange them.

1026
01:25:21,173 --> 01:25:24,233
The faithful first, so they're
there when the Pharaoh wakes.

1027
01:25:26,278 --> 01:25:28,303
Poor dear, don't want
him feeling homesick.

1028
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:33,209
And definitely not insulted, so
I suggest we respect protocol.

1029
01:25:35,155 --> 01:25:36,213
I'm in favour of protocol.

1030
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,124
sorry to bother you,
are you a doctor?

1031
01:25:47,234 --> 01:25:49,203
Are you a surgeon?

1032
01:25:53,241 --> 01:25:54,333
I'm looking for a doctor.

1033
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:59,143
no, you're not a doctor!

1034
01:26:08,156 --> 01:26:10,124
doctor anyone?

1035
01:26:31,347 --> 01:26:39,153
Great nap. What is that
ridiculous attire?

1036
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:42,158
Native costume,
your Highness.

1037
01:26:42,259 --> 01:26:44,386
Allow me to introduce
Miss Adele Blanc-Sec, a scribe.

1038
01:26:46,263 --> 01:26:47,195
Hi.

1039
01:26:48,232 --> 01:26:51,167
The natives employ women
to write their texts?

1040
01:26:51,402 --> 01:26:54,235
Their civilization is
still rough and ready,

1041
01:26:54,372 --> 01:26:56,169
but she is very amicable

1042
01:26:56,274 --> 01:26:58,265
and waking us was
her god idea.

1043
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:02,312
god idea? I feel I've
woken up a little early.

1044
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:07,283
Sorry to wake you, your Highness, I had no
choice. It's a matter of life or death.

1045
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:12,154
Life or death?
It comes and it goes.

1046
01:27:12,258 --> 01:27:13,384
I'd like my
sister's to come back.

1047
01:27:14,327 --> 01:27:19,128
Miss Adele woke me up in the
belief that I was a doctor.

1048
01:27:19,365 --> 01:27:21,230
you? A doctor?

1049
01:27:22,234 --> 01:27:24,293
I wouldn't let you
clip my nails.

1050
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:26,396
She's looking for a doctor
to treat her sister,

1051
01:27:27,274 --> 01:27:29,139
and we thought that

1052
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:30,301
in your great kindness,

1053
01:27:30,377 --> 01:27:34,313
you might let your personal
physician take a look at the child.

1054
01:27:37,184 --> 01:27:39,379
you woke me up for
such a trivial affair?

1055
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:48,355
Hold on, Rammy! Five thousand years,
you've been snoring away.

1056
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:53,164
I've had 5 years of grieving,

1057
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:54,326
of suffering with my
sister who can't see me.

1058
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:59,136
I'm a poor earth-dweller
with no divine protection.

1059
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:06,111
I live everyday with the pain
and guilt that never goes away.

1060
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:10,341
Because it was all my fault!
It was my hatpin!

1061
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,381
What's this about a hat?

1062
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,184
nothing, I'll tell you later.

1063
01:28:24,234 --> 01:28:29,331
nosibis, my faithful doctor...

1064
01:28:31,274 --> 01:28:33,334
See if you can give the
girl a little life back,

1065
01:28:34,311 --> 01:28:37,178
so she can enjoy
all this love for her.

1066
01:28:38,282 --> 01:28:39,214
Thank you...

1067
01:28:40,418 --> 01:28:42,147
your Highness.

1068
01:28:45,222 --> 01:28:46,246
Serene Majesty?

1069
01:29:04,309 --> 01:29:07,336
The doctors said if we took
it out,she'd most likely die.

1070
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:14,251
you're insane!
I asked you to cure her,

1071
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,288
not kill her,
you bag of bones!

1072
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:18,323
Calm down, Adele.
Don't interfere.

1073
01:30:05,407 --> 01:30:07,102
What's that?

1074
01:30:07,376 --> 01:30:08,343
The Pharaoh's entrails.

1075
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:10,336
Charming.

1076
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:06,360
Is the kiss necessary?

1077
01:31:07,307 --> 01:31:09,172
not really,
more of a tradition.

1078
01:31:09,242 --> 01:31:12,405
It's better to do it now,
before she wakes up.

1079
01:31:13,146 --> 01:31:14,238
no kidding.

1080
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:20,286
Well... Let' s go out
and see the sights.

1081
01:31:30,297 --> 01:31:31,161
Agathe!

1082
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,367
Agathe!

1083
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:38,372
Agathe!

1084
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:45,404
Are you mad, hitting
the ball like that?

1085
01:31:49,285 --> 01:31:52,152
And I love you more
than the whole world.

1086
01:31:57,193 --> 01:31:59,388
It was a privilege
meeting you, Miss Adele.

1087
01:32:00,296 --> 01:32:01,263
Same here, Patmosis.

1088
01:32:02,298 --> 01:32:03,390
Apologize to your Pharaoh for me,
for being so rude.

1089
01:32:03,432 --> 01:32:09,167
And thank him for me.

1090
01:32:09,206 --> 01:32:10,298
I will... Mistress.

1091
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:15,344
Who are you talking to?

1092
01:32:16,446 --> 01:32:22,386
Nobody, darling. Don't move. Everything
will be fine now, I promise.

1093
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:34,193
This way, your Majesty.

1094
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,368
What was that?

1095
01:32:57,257 --> 01:32:59,384
Sorry to importune you again.

1096
01:33:00,193 --> 01:33:01,160
Go ahead.

1097
01:33:01,261 --> 01:33:03,354
Which way to the Nile, please?

1098
01:33:03,396 --> 01:33:05,159
Why, of course!

1099
01:33:09,269 --> 01:33:13,206
They are very curious people.
Cruelly lacking in manners.

1100
01:33:13,307 --> 01:33:15,241
I agree, Your Highness.

1101
01:33:15,376 --> 01:33:19,176
But they have highly developed
artistic talents.

1102
01:33:21,415 --> 01:33:25,351
This courtyard, for example,
is magnificent.

1103
01:33:25,386 --> 01:33:26,375
Quite magnificent!

1104
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:29,219
We should build
a pyramid here.

1105
01:33:29,357 --> 01:33:31,416
I'm sure it would be
a fine addition.

1106
01:33:32,394 --> 01:33:35,363
Meanwhile, Sire, perhaps
we should rejoin the others?

1107
01:33:36,364 --> 01:33:38,355
you are right,
Patmosis. Let' s go!

1108
01:33:57,153 --> 01:33:59,384
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!

1109
01:33:59,423 --> 01:34:03,257
Read all about it! Mummies
Vanish from the Louvre!

1110
01:34:04,161 --> 01:34:05,150
There you go, sir!

1111
01:34:05,362 --> 01:34:09,162
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!

1112
01:34:13,437 --> 01:34:15,200
What's this now
about mummies?

1113
01:34:16,374 --> 01:34:21,175
It's another anarchist plot.
Call the Interior.

1114
01:34:27,352 --> 01:34:29,411
Tuck in, my little Caponi!

1115
01:35:05,426 --> 01:35:06,393
Who's it for?

1116
01:35:08,362 --> 01:35:09,420
It was for Miss Adele.

1117
01:35:10,198 --> 01:35:12,189
She's taken a
few weeks' vacation.

1118
01:35:12,433 --> 01:35:13,331
Well.

1119
01:35:14,302 --> 01:35:15,428
Give them to someone else.

1120
01:35:23,278 --> 01:35:29,148
For me? That's so kind!
What's your name?

1121
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:35,151
Zborowsky.

1122
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:36,214
First name perhaps?

1123
01:35:36,358 --> 01:35:39,385
Yes. Andrej,
with a J, as in...

1124
01:35:39,429 --> 01:35:45,197
As in jaguar.
Cup of tea?

1125
01:35:45,268 --> 01:35:46,235
Yes.

1126
01:35:56,413 --> 01:35:57,380
Enjoy the trip.

1127
01:35:57,414 --> 01:35:58,312
Thank you.

1128
01:36:03,454 --> 01:36:05,319
Hurry, miss,
we're about to leave.

1129
01:36:05,456 --> 01:36:07,287
All right,
keep your hair on.

1130
01:36:08,259 --> 01:36:09,351
Blanc-Sec, Adele.

1131
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:13,329
Thank you.

1132
01:36:24,442 --> 01:36:30,348
The woman in the green hat?
Leave it to us.

1133
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:41,349
Hurry up!
It is Miss Blanc-Sec's luggage.

1134
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:45,197
Welcome on board.
Welcome on board.

1135
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:46,290
Hurry. Move fast
for the luggage!

1136
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:54,264
Welcome on board.
Hurry up!

1137
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:57,274
How are you? Welcome!

1138
01:37:00,415 --> 01:37:02,406
Take this.
Miss Blanc-Sec...

1139
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,314
Yes?

1140
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:04,318
These are yours?

1141
01:37:04,352 --> 01:37:06,149
Take god care of them.

1142
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:11,314
Sorry!

1143
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:12,324
god start to the holiday.

1144
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,388
Sorry, it was an accident.

1145
01:37:16,165 --> 01:37:17,393
That's my bag!
Take god care of it.

1146
01:37:29,445 --> 01:37:32,244
Have a god trip, Miss Blanc-Sec.

1147
01:39:23,365 --> 01:39:24,354
Saint Hubert!

1148
01:39:26,203 --> 01:39:30,333
Caponi! Caponi!

1149
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,404
A fine zebra!

1150
01:39:46,424 --> 01:39:50,224
I've lost Saint Hubert!
I just lost him! Go and find him!

1151
01:40:11,316 --> 01:40:13,375
You put up a god fight.

1152
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:16,254
Please, I'm begging you.

1153
01:40:17,423 --> 01:40:18,355
no!

1154
01:40:19,192 --> 01:40:19,453
Smile!

1155
01:40:20,193 --> 01:40:21,353
No!

1156
01:40:25,165 --> 01:40:25,426
Nobody move!

1157
01:40:26,199 --> 01:40:28,167
I'm out of ammunition.

1158
01:40:29,402 --> 01:40:31,165
Take him away!

1159
01:40:32,339 --> 01:40:34,204
You look like a
fine specimen, too.

1160
01:40:47,354 --> 01:40:52,292
Sit tight.
I'll get reinforcements.

1161
01:40:52,427 --> 01:40:53,394
Fine, take your time.

1162
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:13,270
Oh, no!
