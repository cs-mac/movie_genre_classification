1
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:19,214
<i>This is the valley of Ling...

2
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:23,260
<i>... as it was in the early summer of 1937.

3
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:26,489
<i>The people who lived here were farmers.

4
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:31,126
<i>They'd heard there was a world beyond</i>
<i>the hills that bounded their little valley...

5
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:35,206
<i>... but as yet, no one had climbed</i>
<i>those hills to see for himself.

6
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,368
<i>Perhaps it is because</i>
<i>they were more fortunate than most.

7
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:43,312
<i>The land was rich,</i>
<i>and their bellies were full.

8
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:46,611
<i>On this farm, lived Ling Tan</i>
<i>and his family.

9
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:49,152
<i>And they were among the most fortunate.

10
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:52,018
<i>They were neither too wealthy,</i>
<i>nor too poor.

11
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:56,561
<i>And they were greatly respected</i>
<i>in the nearby village.

12
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:00,261
<i>They owned a strong house...

13
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:04,096
<i>... and tilled the soil</i>
<i>that belonged to their ancestors.

14
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,138
<i>They were both good and bad,</i>
<i>both wise and foolish...

15
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:11,300
<i>... and sometimes all these things</i>
<i>at the same moment.

16
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:16,540
<i>And therefore, they were very much</i>
<i>like such families in any other land.

17
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:24,980
<i>It was time for the rice seedlings</i>
<i>to be planted...

18
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:28,150
<i>... and Ling Tan was eager</i>
<i>for but one thing:

19
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:30,592
<i>To finish as much of the work</i>
<i>as could be done...

20
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:34,199
<i>... before the sun was gone from the sky.

21
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,962
<i>But Ling's first and second sons</i>
<i>were eager for many other things as well.

22
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:40,469
<i>For they were young.

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,301
Hey!

24
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,875
- Is that your mother?
- Yes, my father.

25
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:47,376
Come, old man. I want to speak to you.

26
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,947
Time enough to speak with women
when the sun is gone.

27
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:53,313
I know you hear me, you old turnip.

28
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,750
You two do not stop for anything
until the field is done.

29
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:00,449
Ease your heart about that, Father.

30
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,767
What is it, old woman? What is it?

31
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,604
You grow deaf?
Must I bawl like an ox to make you hear?

32
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,939
There is work
and you call me from the fields.

33
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:23,139
Come. Come.

34
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:26,376
You work too hard and too long.
You have sons to labor for you.

35
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,577
What nonsense is this?
I'm not yet so feeble.

36
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:30,882
You're no longer young
and you must not strain.

37
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,719
I do not strain myself.
I'm as much a man as I ever was.

38
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:36,555
Come now. Wash your legs.

39
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,565
The very weight of the mud
can tire a man of your great age.

40
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:45,466
Well, perhaps a younger wife with a softer
will might be added to a man's household.

41
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,663
Bring her on, old man.

42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,274
I shall have someone
to help me with my work.

43
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,741
And you shall be in your grave
before your time.

44
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:55,346
I think I would survive.
I may try it to see.

45
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:58,575
What of those teeth marks
behind your right ear, old turnip?

46
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,517
A hill tiger bit me.
It was a long time ago.

47
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,919
I was the hill tiger.

48
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,958
You made the mistake of treating me
like a tame house cat.

49
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,719
It could happen again.

50
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:13,093
Not so long as the scars remain
to remind me.

51
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,168
Is it not good with me here?

52
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:20,670
Yes, it is, but a man with his juices
still in him should not so indulge himself.

53
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,401
- I should go back to the fields.
- The field will be finished without you.

54
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:28,712
Here. If you must be useful,
help me prepare these ducks for market.

55
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:32,078
Ducks. That is woman's work.

56
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:35,914
If heaven sends a woman too much work,
heaven will also send help to do it.

57
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,253
How is it, old woman, that heaven's will
and yours are always the same?

58
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:55,199
The grass is good in the hills
and the ox grows fat.

59
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:58,602
Which is the ox and which is our brother?

60
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:10,650
Is our brother dreaming?

61
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,087
No, that vacant look
is his usual expression.

62
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,693
You are very dirty.
Have you been playing in the mud?

63
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,854
We have. It was very pleasant.
Why do you not join us tomorrow?

64
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,259
Oh, you ask too much.

65
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,993
Where you find hard work,
you will not find our brother.

66
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,105
There is work for all. For those with strong
backs and for those with strong minds.

67
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,366
If the mind is strong,
the back need not bend.

68
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,806
Nor need the feet get muddy.

69
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,283
He has no mind, only a temper.

70
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,054
Brother, your mind is absent these days.
Why is this?

71
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:49,091
I think, and my thoughts trouble me.

72
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,822
What is a brother for
if not to share your troubles?

73
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:55,297
Well, then, here is one of the things:

74
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,459
Women are not the same as we are.

75
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,798
Married four months
and you just found this out?

76
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:02,532
But here is another thing:
Women do not think as men do.

77
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,869
Women should not think.
They're not equal to it.

78
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:06,705
My wife Jade is equal to it.

79
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,870
You worry too much
about that one of yours.

80
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:11,346
When she has a son,
a son will be more important.

81
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:14,782
A son. I have not yet a wife...
As I would have her.

82
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:17,787
She is like a western wind.
When I reach for her, she's gone.

83
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:19,925
Even western wind
can be caught and tamed.

84
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:22,560
I do not want her tame.
Only, I do not understand her.

85
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,696
She is mine and yet she is not mine.

86
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:29,392
When I touch her, it is as if her spirit goes
and only her body is left.

87
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,800
She is beautiful and sweet-smelling.
Is that not enough?

88
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,769
It is your fault. I've watched you.

89
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,409
When the men sit and smoke,
you're the first to leave.

90
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:40,842
Can I help it
if the desire for sleep overcomes me?

91
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:44,471
Do you not know that with a woman,
eagerness passes for weakness?

92
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,279
- Sit with the old men until the last as I do.
- That is easy for you.

93
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:50,445
I've not found Jade
in the same place twice.

94
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,682
And never waiting for me.

95
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,350
- Do you think that is the answer?
- Yes.

96
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:59,362
Then I will not go to her until dawn.
And perhaps not even then.

97
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:03,628
Jade, Orchid.
The men of the house are at home.

98
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:07,330
Now, where are the women
my sons married?

99
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:10,635
Jade, Orchid. Oh, there you are.

100
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,643
- Your husband comes. Attend him.
- I go, Mother.

101
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,678
Take this clean towel I have made ready.

102
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,043
Mother, I must tell you
about my youngest child.

103
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:19,980
My grandchild? What about her?

104
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:25,021
She was lying there and all at once,
she opened her mouth and I thought...

105
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,749
I thought she was going to speak.

106
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,624
You are surely one of those
who has given birth...

107
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,820
...and remains in a daze
at what you've done.

108
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,260
- Your husband waits.
- Yes.

109
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:34,831
Jade.

110
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,491
Jade.

111
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:49,541
- Take care.
- You take care.

112
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:03,584
I wish you would take
that squealing thing from him.

113
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:07,255
You should get him a wife. It's time
he brought grandsons into this house.

114
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,867
- In time. In time.
- If you told him to marry...

115
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,697
...you're not sure he would obey.

116
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:15,739
- So you spare yourself dealing with him.
- There is no need to deal with him.

117
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:19,503
- Shall I tell you a secret thing in your heart?
- No.

118
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:22,876
Our third son is the son you love best,
but most uneasily.

119
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,279
He's different from the others.
You fear that.

120
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,749
That's why you go on the far side
of an argument.

121
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,252
Our sons wait for their towels.

122
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:34,189
Jade. Jade, where is my towel? Jade?

123
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,588
Thank you, Jade.

124
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:38,628
I've not seen her since the sun
was in the middle of the sky.

125
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,356
The matchmaker cheated us.

126
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,229
- What? My wife is not in the house?
- I could not find her.

127
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:47,099
This comes of women having their feet free.
Nowadays they run around like goats.

128
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,434
- May I help you, Mother?
- Have you ever done so?

129
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,099
Or has your worthless one?

130
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:53,768
All that is done in this house, I do.

131
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:57,438
- At least my wife stays at home.
- Jade has a reason to go to the village.

132
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:00,745
When a woman knows a man wants her,
she will ever display herself.

133
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,185
That is true. Have you not seen
our fourth cousin look at Jade?

134
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,291
He resembles a sick cat:

135
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,121
I would beat her until she was
not so good to look upon.

136
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:12,423
If more of that were done,
there will be less trouble with wives.

137
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:14,759
Only men should make sure first
they are able.

138
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,198
These new-fashioned women
are not easily beaten.

139
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,306
I will dress and go find her.
Then we will see who is able.

140
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:26,105
Eat first, my son, and your arm
will be stronger for all this beating.

141
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,402
Who tries to see within our house
without himself being seen?

142
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:02,206
Are you eating, wife of my third cousin?

143
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:07,375
Our rice is poor and scanty.
And we have no pork at all.

144
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:11,250
- But will you share it with us?
- Thank you. But I cannot.

145
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,552
Are you alone, then?
Is my fourth cousin not here?

146
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,854
My son is not home yet.

147
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,090
But your third cousin,
my honored husband, is here.

148
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,703
How are you, sir? What new thing
have you found in your book?

149
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,101
Nothing his family can chew, swallow
and grow fat on, I can tell you.

150
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,666
My fourth cousin is in the city perhaps?

151
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:34,006
I do not know. My son
has been gone since the noon meal.

152
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:39,846
Well, I must get on.
I have business in the village.

153
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,450
He lies.

154
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,681
He has no business in the village
at this hour.

155
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,726
He looks for his wife, Jade.

156
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:51,522
And if he finds her with our son,
as he well may...

157
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:56,259
Jade is married to Lao Er.
The thing my son felt for her has ended.

158
00:10:56,435 --> 00:11:00,166
It will never be ended
until one of them is dead.

159
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,207
You old book fool, it is your fault.
It is your fault we starve.

160
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:07,368
It is your fault we did not get Jade
for our son.

161
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:11,846
- Can I control a woman's choice?
- A woman's choice?

162
00:11:12,017 --> 00:11:14,611
Did not your cousin Ling Tan
give you 30 silver dollars?

163
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:17,187
Did you not tell our son
he could not have the girl?

164
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:19,187
Quiet, woman. I read.

165
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:23,260
Out of all this,
something terrible will happen.

166
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:25,829
We are students
who have come from the university...

167
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:29,126
...to travel through the country
and tell you and others like you...

168
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:31,496
...news of the war in the North.

169
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,230
The Japanese march toward us.

170
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:37,204
These are two pictures
of what the Japanese are doing.

171
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:38,968
They are doing it now.

172
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,114
While you sit here and watch,
these very things are happening.

173
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,010
Shen, have you seen my fourth cousin?

174
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,879
These are your people
they are murdering and mine.

175
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,486
This is our country they are looting.

176
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:52,590
The enemy is ruthless.
He regards us only as slaves.

177
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:55,522
We cannot deal with him.
We must resist him.

178
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:58,219
- I'm sorry.
- Seeking someone perhaps?

179
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:01,423
- Not the one who would sit near you.
- If she were my wife...

180
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,431
It is with pleasure that I leave you.

181
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:05,502
When the Japanese reach your village...

182
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:09,300
...they will come with lies in their mouths
and death in their hands.

183
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,774
And you must resist them,
even to your own deaths.

184
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,606
And beyond.

185
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,509
Are you able to do this?

186
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:20,308
Tell me you are.
All of you rise and tell me you are able.

187
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:22,420
We are able.

188
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,383
See? There is one who speaks.

189
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:31,394
Are there not others? Tell me. Come.

190
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,532
Yes. Come.

191
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,624
You come. I'm hungry.

192
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,266
The woman should have food ready
when her man is hungry.

193
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,339
My wife is at home where she should be.

194
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:51,148
Am I speaking into the wind?

195
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:54,548
Have you not understood
what you have seen and heard?

196
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,019
I know you have. Tell me you will
resist the enemy when he comes.

197
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:02,818
- How then can we resist?
- Can we fight machines with our hands?

198
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:25,108
Why do you shame me
by showing yourself off to everybody?

199
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:27,616
I come home, my belly roaring
like a hungry lion.

200
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:29,617
Why did you not eat and silence it?

201
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:33,189
How can I when you're not in your place?
I'm ashamed before my parents.

202
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:35,520
- I wish you'd not go in the street alone.
- Why?

203
00:13:35,694 --> 00:13:37,559
- Other men will see you.
- I do not look.

204
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,994
I do not want them to look at you.
You're my wife.

205
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,794
But I cannot stay always in the courtyard.
These are not ancient times.

206
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:46,369
I wish it were those times.
I'd like to lock you up.

207
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:48,665
If you lock me up,
I wouldn't eat and then die.

208
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,069
I would not let you.

209
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:53,405
But these are the new times,
and I will come and go as I please.

210
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,809
- I should beat you.
- I have done nothing.

211
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:59,212
But you are not
where a woman should be at...

212
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:05,221
At home, waiting for her husband.

213
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:23,873
And there is this thing.

214
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:26,841
Before we were wed,
when the choice was put to you...

215
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:29,913
...why did you not choose me
above my fourth cousin?

216
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,843
If you could choose now,
which would it be?

217
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:38,922
You both have two arms and legs,
and all your fingers and toes.

218
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,423
Neither of you are
scabby-headed, nor cross-eyed.

219
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:44,653
- What, then, is the difference between you?
- You used me very ill.

220
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:50,427
You look so pale and so thin.
You are so to be pitied, you big turnip.

221
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:52,467
I wish I were a man of learning.

222
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:57,166
I wish I knew the words to ease myself
so I could tell you what I feel.

223
00:14:58,077 --> 00:14:59,772
What do you feel?

224
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:01,742
I know, but...

225
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:04,578
I do not have the words.

226
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,980
I too am not very learned.

227
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:11,520
Is that why
you do not often speak to me?

228
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,215
Two must speak for understanding.

229
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:19,262
If I tell you everything that is in me,
will you tell me all that is in you?

230
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:25,796
- Yes.
- Then tonight we will speak together?

231
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,666
Yes.

232
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,692
Fetch me my food.
I will eat here in the courtyard.

233
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:53,559
- Yes, my husband.
- And since you did not cook the meal...

234
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:56,667
...you may clean up after it.
- Yes, my husband.

235
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,631
He must have beaten her.

236
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:05,643
I do not take too much credit to myself...

237
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,712
...that I'm the only man in these parts
who can read and write.

238
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:12,442
But how would I find time for my books
if you did not send me rice...

239
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:15,416
...and a new coat now and then,
and sometimes even meat?

240
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:17,452
You are a scholar and my honored cousin.

241
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:20,319
It is only proper
that your needs and comforts be supplied.

242
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:22,426
My land yields enough for all.

243
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:25,085
Orchid, it is time my grandson
was in his bed.

244
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:28,358
- Yes, my mother.
- But, cousin, have you ever thought of this:

245
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,002
When your time comes
to go into the earth yourself...

246
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,730
...shall you divide your land
between your sons?

247
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,466
Yes, I have thought of that.

248
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:39,577
You have made a good beginning.
Do not spoil it.

249
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:43,137
Will there still be enough for all?

250
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:45,977
Or will they quarrel
because their bellies are not full?

251
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:48,585
As my eldest son,
you must answer our cousin.

252
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:52,281
Can this land feed three men and
their wives and children after I am gone?

253
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:56,895
It can. For I will eat less meat, if my
brothers will, and leave in peace with them.

254
00:16:57,062 --> 00:17:00,623
If I have taught my sons
that peace is good, I am content.

255
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:06,402
If you had been with me today, you would
not speak so easily of peace, my father.

256
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:11,574
If it were proper for a man
to speak to his daughter-in-law...

257
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:14,439
...l'd ask her why should not
peaceful men speak of peace.

258
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,447
Forgive my wife, Father, for speaking
so boldly, but today at the teahouse...

259
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:21,347
...students came and showed
the magic pictures and talked.

260
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,045
They told of the war in the North
and how the dwarfs...

261
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,215
...from the East Ocean islands
burn cities and kill our people.

262
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:29,053
I wonder if my daughter remembers...

263
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,719
...when other students
brought the pictures of flies.

264
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:34,559
I remember.
Flies as large as water buffalo.

265
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,964
Yes, and they told us
they were more dangerous than tigers.

266
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,798
And everyone knows that our flies...

267
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:42,304
...are as small as a grain of rice
and as harmless.

268
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,942
And so does it not follow
that today also perhaps...

269
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,944
...both words and pictures were made
too large to be either truth or life?

270
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,843
Does that not quiet
the woman's fear of my daughter?

271
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:58,012
Of course it does.
And it is time she was in her bed.

272
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:03,018
But we who are men know that
there is killing and suffering in the North.

273
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,493
And do you not believe
it will come here, Father?

274
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:07,825
I believe something else.

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,468
If a man lives his life in decency
and as he should...

276
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:14,003
...and then evil comes to him,
it cannot harm him.

277
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:17,700
And he can conquer and overcome it.
This, I live by.

278
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:21,004
And so I think do all the kinsmen
in our village.

279
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,081
- We are men of peace.
- True, true, true.

280
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:29,778
Also, the North is a long way from here.
And so is my bed, and I must get to it.

281
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:37,485
She still is not cured.
Wait 500 heartbeats. Then go to her.

282
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,324
I will have my shadow
to walk home with.

283
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:45,834
Yes, the moon is round tonight
and the color of a ripe peach.

284
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:47,995
I have read that the Earth, too, is round.

285
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:50,505
You have told me that
but one thing troubles me.

286
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:55,136
How is it then if the world is round
that men on the bottom side can walk?

287
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,077
Everything is opposite there.

288
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:00,548
Children are born
with white hair and blue eyes.

289
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:03,552
Scholars begin to the write
from the wrong side of the page...

290
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:06,350
...and youth is admired instead of age.

291
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:10,154
So why can we not believe they walk
with their heads hanging down?

292
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,729
And enjoy it too.

293
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:17,731
Old woman, have you ever thought
that somewhere very far below...

294
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,463
...the spot where we stand,
our land goes on and on...

295
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,800
...until at last a stranger stands on it?

296
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:26,536
And plants seed and takes his harvest
from it as though it were his own?

297
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:29,909
But it is not. It is ours.
And our sons' after us.

298
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:33,279
Yes, the land is ours
as deep as it goes beneath our feet.

299
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:37,445
And the stars above our heads belong to us,
and whatever there is beyond them.

300
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:39,853
But I'm troubled
about that stranger on our land.

301
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,255
Somewhere he reaps his grain
without telling you.

302
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,554
- You should ask him for rent.
- That I would do.

303
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,791
I would have the law on him
if I knew how to tell him so.

304
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:53,765
Do not be troubled, my son.
It is often good to beat a woman.

305
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,736
Oh, yes. Yes, my mother.

306
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:09,319
Old man, there is something here and now
that troubles me.

307
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,149
It is Jade.

308
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,883
Orchid is stupid
but she does what I tell her to do.

309
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,493
While Jade...
I do not think I like her.

310
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:19,688
Do you know why? Because
she is the same as you are yourself.

311
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:23,426
No man can tell what will come out of her.
And here is another thing:

312
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:28,835
Our second son will never tire of her
as I have never tired of you.

313
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:52,726
This is the first time
I found you waiting for me.

314
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,802
Who will speak first, then?

315
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,710
You. Ask me what you will.

316
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:08,607
Well, then...

317
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,814
What are you thinking all day?

318
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,918
I think 20 and 30 things at a time.

319
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:18,022
My thoughts are like a chain,
and one is fast to the other.

320
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,354
- But what are they?
- I think of the bird and how it flies.

321
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:25,394
And why is it I cannot lift myself
above the earth.

322
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:28,965
But now, what are you thinking now?

323
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:31,825
Now?

324
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:34,564
I think nothing.

325
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:38,506
Well, then...

326
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:42,547
...what did you think of me
the first time you saw me?

327
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:47,774
- I cannot remember.
- No, I mean... I mean...

328
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,780
...after we were married.

329
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:56,093
I was glad you were taller than I.
For a woman, I am too tall.

330
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:59,424
No, you are not.
Then what did you think?

331
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:04,198
And then I wondered
what you thought of me.

332
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:06,735
But you knew that I wanted you.

333
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,840
- And then I wondered...
- Yes?

334
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:13,341
I wondered if you would give me
the thing I would have.

335
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,704
Tell me. I will buy it for you.

336
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,075
Buy?

337
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:22,777
Perhaps all the things I want
cannot be bought.

338
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:26,788
All women like presents.
Tell me what it is.

339
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,721
I want...

340
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:32,229
Earrings.

341
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:35,059
Yes, that is it. A pair of earrings.

342
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,827
I will buy them for you tomorrow.

343
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:43,435
- Now have I made you happy?
- Yes.

344
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:48,375
No. You have not made me happy.
I do not want earrings.

345
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:52,039
But there is something that can be bought
that I would have.

346
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:55,243
- Buy me a book.
- A book?

347
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:57,915
- But you cannot read.
- I can read.

348
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,421
- Women like you never read.
- I learned.

349
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:03,789
A word or two at a time. My brother
could read and I learned from him.

350
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:06,192
A little every day.

351
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:07,956
But I have no book of my own.

352
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:12,560
I never thought to see a woman read
in this house.

353
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:16,298
There must be changes even in a household
if there is to be life and growth.

354
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,706
I do not know that.
My mother and my father have done well.

355
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:24,440
- But they are of the old. We are of the new.
- Oh, I am not sure if I am of the new.

356
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,644
I will buy you the book.

357
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:32,779
- You are angry?
- There is no room in my mind for anger.

358
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,516
It is...

359
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,961
It is just that I do not understand.

360
00:24:10,762 --> 00:24:13,788
- Ten thousand greetings, Mr. Chow.
- Thank you.

361
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:15,956
- You are well, young sir?
- Yes.

362
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:22,039
- I would see my brother-in-law, Wu Lien.
- He is within. He takes his morning rest.

363
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,245
Are all asleep in this house?

364
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:39,949
I greet you, my brother-in-law.
And your honored mother.

365
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,889
Welcome, welcome. Sit down.

366
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,325
Here's your second brother,
mother of my children.

367
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:47,294
- Sit down, sit down.
- Thanks.

368
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:50,457
Well, then, you're a farmer
and one who looks it.

369
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:53,832
The dirt is still beneath your fingernails.

370
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:57,441
My brother, how are the old ones
and all of the others?

371
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:58,906
- Well, thank you.
- Tell me...

372
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:02,103
...is my sister-in-law, Jade,
with child yet?

373
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:05,015
Can it be you take no interest?

374
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:07,845
It would seem
you take interest enough for both.

375
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:10,544
- My interest will never make him a father.
- No.

376
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:13,122
But you are hungry. I can tell.

377
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:16,988
In each generation,
a city man should do as I have done.

378
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:19,096
Take for a wife
a woman from the country.

379
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:24,167
Thus the line...
Thus the line is kept strong and hard.

380
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:27,966
And here is the proof of your wisdom.

381
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:32,473
Brother-in-law?

382
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:35,242
Will you dip into your wisdom
and tell me a thing?

383
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:37,142
- Yeah?
- I know you're a man who reads.

384
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:39,180
Yes. Yes, I read.

385
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:42,912
Often in the winter to warm my blood.
Sometimes in the summer to cool it.

386
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:46,080
If you were to buy a book,
what book would it be?

387
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:49,920
Well, there are books for every need.

388
00:25:52,063 --> 00:25:56,193
If a man wishes to read secretly
for his own private pleasure...

389
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:57,995
...there are books for that.

390
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:00,467
No? Well then,
for what is your book wanted?

391
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:04,200
I married my woman thinking her
like any other one and...

392
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:07,971
Now I find out she can read
and wants a book.

393
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:09,773
So.

394
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:12,109
You're only a woman,
mother of my children...

395
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:15,013
...but if you could read,
what would you like to read?

396
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:17,279
- I never thought...
- I have thought of the one.

397
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:21,186
It has everything in it. The good prosper
and the wicked are punished.

398
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,523
The name of the book
is <i>All Men Are Brothers</i>.

399
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:28,165
- Thank you. I will remember what you...
- Sir.

400
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,858
Sir. Sir, there is something.

401
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,903
- As before?
- Worse than before. Much louder, sir.

402
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:38,338
They said they have warned you many times
and their patience is at an end.

403
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,535
These students cause trouble.

404
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:44,705
An honest merchant
cannot live in peace these times.

405
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,378
Well, what is this?

406
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:49,042
We ask you once more,
do not deal with the Japanese.

407
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,020
We're at war. You cannot buy and sell
Japanese goods and call yourself a patriot.

408
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:55,523
Do you ask me
to stop breathing in and out?

409
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:57,855
There's a call for these,
and a profit in them.

410
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:59,997
Save your breath for arguments
you can win.

411
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:03,157
Then we must speak to you
in words you can hear.

412
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,237
- Leave nothing.
- Stop. You are vandals. Stop.

413
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,402
Destroy all Japanese goods.

414
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,344
We must make him understand
what he has done.

415
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:23,453
Bandits. Thieves.
You'll pay for this. Thieves.

416
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,555
This is the only way to make him see.

417
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:40,602
What's happens here will happen
to every shop that sells Japanese goods.

418
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,603
No. No.

419
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:45,641
Wu Lien walks hand in hand
with those who deal in your blood.

420
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,870
I'm only a merchant.
Why do you destroy my goods?

421
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:52,642
He pays for Japanese goods in money
that'll come back to us in pain and death.

422
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:56,878
No, no, I deal only in innocent things
that harm no one.

423
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:59,615
This man, Wu Lien,
loves his cash box above his country.

424
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,759
That is not true. That's not true.

425
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:04,861
Turn away from this traitor
as you would turn from the Japanese.

426
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,257
Come.

427
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,693
How can you say that?

428
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:13,568
Can it be that the thing
I have done all my life...

429
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:16,605
...is now held against me as a crime?

430
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,003
Did you see...?

431
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,945
Did you see those merchants
turn away from me as from a bad odor?

432
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:28,711
- They are of my own kind.
- Be of stout heart, my brother. It will pass.

433
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:32,050
No, no, I do not think it will
and I'm not a stupid man.

434
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:36,319
I must turn this thing over in my mind.
Decide what to do in the days I see ahead.

435
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:39,827
I must think and weigh what comes out.

436
00:28:39,998 --> 00:28:41,329
And think again.

437
00:28:57,348 --> 00:29:01,808
And then this strange young man
jumped down, ran away and was gone.

438
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:05,012
- Was he a bandit, then?
- No, it was said he was a student.

439
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,159
First you encounter this trouble
and then you buy a book.

440
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:11,420
This book that Jade now has, what is it?

441
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,121
- Books have names.
- So has this one.

442
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:18,235
- It is called <i>All Men Are Brothers</i>.
<i>- All Men Are Brothers?

443
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:21,463
What of the stranger who lives
on the other side of the earth...

444
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:24,802
...and reaps his grain on my land?
Is he my brother? I think not.

445
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:27,904
Today I pulled a turnip.
They grow small this year.

446
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,242
Can it be this strange brother is
pulling at the roots to plague us?

447
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:34,078
It's good to have him to blame.

448
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,712
A book. And Jade can read in it.

449
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:42,217
You see? An idea spreads. A book.

450
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:45,988
I have said and say again it is wrong
to give a woman such a dangerous thing.

451
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:48,359
It is unnatural
and mine will never have one.

452
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:52,230
What if a child comes? What will your
woman do if she has not finished the book?

453
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:54,963
Will she read on
and let the child be born anyhow?

454
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:57,039
She will manage.

455
00:29:57,675 --> 00:30:00,075
The day has been full.

456
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:01,678
There's work tomorrow.

457
00:30:01,846 --> 00:30:04,872
Yes, my son.
Your eyes are heavy with weariness.

458
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:07,745
Your wife waits for you, brother,
with a book in her hands.

459
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,410
Even a book can be closed
and put away.

460
00:30:20,064 --> 00:30:23,363
It is but a book,
and yet it keeps your eyes from me.

461
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:26,468
Come sit beside me.

462
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:31,664
I will tell you what I have read.

463
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:33,869
How shall I know if you read truly?

464
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:37,014
You will know I could not make up
such things.

465
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:42,479
In this place, it tells what happens
when men know only greed.

466
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:46,590
It tells how peace is then lost,
and what men may do to each other.

467
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:48,055
It is magic.

468
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:52,663
Your eyes pick up those bird tracks
and your eyes give them to your voice...

469
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,196
...and your voice gives them to my ears.

470
00:30:55,366 --> 00:31:00,633
And here,
it tells how then there is killing...

471
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:02,670
...and fighting and even torture.

472
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,274
Oh, it is wrong to torture.

473
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:10,779
- That is what it says.
- It is magic.

474
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:15,044
You do not listen.

475
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,178
I try.

476
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,721
You must try harder.

477
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:24,424
Money was spent for this book.
We must not waste it.

478
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:27,325
We must waste nothing
that is given to us.

479
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:31,628
Neither money,
nor the hours we have together.

480
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,205
I cannot read
when you keep watching me.

481
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,969
Since I cannot look at the book
and know what it means...

482
00:31:40,144 --> 00:31:41,702
...I must look at you...

483
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:45,679
...so the money will not be wasted,
and nothing else.

484
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,478
Then I will teach you to read.

485
00:31:57,195 --> 00:32:02,155
There is word here...

486
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:07,828
...of how men must rise up and resist
the things that make them weak.

487
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,133
That is advice I cannot take.

488
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:11,969
Can you?

489
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:16,236
Well, you will not listen.

490
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:19,311
And now you place the book
where my hand cannot reach it.

491
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:22,783
- Shall I put it back within your grasp?
- Yes.

492
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:30,951
No.

493
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:39,570
I will rest my eyes now.

494
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:47,108
I will teach you to read another time.

495
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,975
I will remind you
when I'm ready for reading.

496
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:54,747
Let the gods forgive me for saying this
but I am wicked.

497
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,547
I love you more than I love my father
and my mother.

498
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:00,953
I am more wicked than you.
I want to hear you tell me this.

499
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,593
If there were food enough
only for them or for you...

500
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:06,559
...I would give it to you
and let them starve.

501
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:12,334
You turn to me of your own will,
and it is the first time this has been so.

502
00:33:12,503 --> 00:33:17,236
Yes, for this night, you have told me
the thing my heart needed to hear.

503
00:33:17,408 --> 00:33:21,071
Now I know that you'll care
what I think and feel, and what I am.

504
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:24,408
Not only that I give you children
and make your food.

505
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:27,050
I know that I'm not only to belong
to your house...

506
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:29,083
...but I am to be yours.

507
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:31,813
And I am content.

508
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:27,273
You're late.
Did you once more have trouble...

509
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:28,935
...escaping my mother's eyes?

510
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:31,946
From this day on,
I will come to you openly.

511
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:33,640
She will say nothing.

512
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:36,082
I cannot believe my mother
will change that much.

513
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:38,688
No. But I have changed.

514
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:40,756
Do you not see it?

515
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:43,083
Your eyes are as soft.

516
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:45,593
Your hair as pleasant to my touch.

517
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:48,527
No, I cannot see this change...

518
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,826
...and I do not wish a change.

519
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:53,232
It is within me.

520
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:57,339
But it is so great
I thought it must show on my face.

521
00:34:57,508 --> 00:35:01,569
What is the cause of this great difference?
And when did it begin?

522
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:06,149
On the night we first opened our hearts
to each other, my husband.

523
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:10,083
Even if it is only a girl,
I shall be very happy.

524
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,384
We shall be ancestors?

525
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,550
- Oh, it will be a son.
- I shall ask the gods for one.

526
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:19,127
But if it is only a girl,
she still will be welcome?

527
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:21,231
If you're her mother,
she will be welcome.

528
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:23,765
And she will be taught to read...

529
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:27,632
...even if her father is always too busy
with lesser things.

530
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:29,705
Where would this upstart daughter be...

531
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:33,105
...if I did not busy myself
with those lesser things?

532
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:38,782
Oh, this is a good moment.

533
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,646
The best in my life so far.

534
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:14,077
- Something falls.
- It shines like silver.

535
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:23,816
Look at the earth. It's a black fountain.

536
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:43,043
A hole big enough to bury 50 men.

537
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:45,409
And smokes still comes from it.

538
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,912
If one of us had stood near here,
he would no longer live.

539
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:52,988
I've wanted to dig a pond on my land
for 10 years, and here it is.

540
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:56,183
It would be better if the barbarians
did use the sky ships...

541
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,793
...to dig ponds and wells.

542
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:01,159
- Maybe it is an idea.
- Look. Look, rolling smoke.

543
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:05,100
It was the same in the magic pictures.

544
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,271
There are many fires over the city wall
and small ones outside.

545
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,170
- Flying ships come out of the smoke.
- What shall we do?

546
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:14,811
Someone of us should go to the city.

547
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:18,774
My... My wife thinks of our elder sister
and what happens to her.

548
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:20,678
We should all think of that. I'll go.

549
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:24,252
I would not be hasty, cousin.
If it is good news, it will not spoil.

550
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,617
The more slowly one hears bad news,
the better.

551
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,692
My woman wouldn't let me rest
if I didn't go, nor could I rest.

552
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,385
- Let me go in your place.
- All right, go quickly.

553
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:35,555
Do what you can. The rest of us
should go back to our work.

554
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:52,574
Can it be our son at last?
I'm afraid to believe it is.

555
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,910
We're all but dead. We're all but dead.

556
00:37:57,088 --> 00:38:00,251
We might have been killed
had we been 10 feet nearer to street.

557
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:04,087
There was such noise.
There was such noise.

558
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:06,229
The shop half gone.

559
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:09,025
We have nothing
but our bare lives in our hands.

560
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,930
We're lost. All is lost. All.

561
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:14,003
All day the flying ships came.

562
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:17,732
And everywhere the silver eggs dropped,
they burst the buildings into dust.

563
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:20,741
And the shops
and all the goods within are waste.

564
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:22,640
- But what of the people?
- The people...

565
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,747
Into pieces,
as if they were made of clay.

566
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:27,884
- Here an arm, there a head, there a piece...
- But why? Why?

567
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:31,078
How can men do this to other men?
The sky is over us all.

568
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:33,348
Our own servants
and the clerks are dead.

569
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:36,891
And one such an honest young man.
Where shall we find one like him again?

570
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:40,758
What is the use, even of an honest man,
if there's no shop to put him in?

571
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:43,327
Our shops, our goods, gone, all gone.

572
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,366
I'm a man who can prosper only in peace.

573
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:48,437
Can it be those students who cried out
spoke the truth?

574
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:50,574
The truth? Now, what is the truth?

575
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:52,834
Each men sees it differently.

576
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,672
The truth I see
is that the East Ocean people will come...

577
00:38:55,846 --> 00:38:58,440
...and enter the city, and the city will fall.

578
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:01,141
- Yes, and so will the nation.
- Can that be?

579
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:03,752
The nation is only the people,
and we are the people.

580
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:06,981
- And while we remain, so does the nation.
- We're not strong enough.

581
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:10,594
Why are we not strong enough?
Why do we not have things to kill with too?

582
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:13,821
They have no use to people like us
who love only to live.

583
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:15,659
Then we will die.

584
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:20,795
Death is each men's natural end,
and that I know. But not this kind.

585
00:39:20,971 --> 00:39:25,465
This is beyond the mind of man
unless he sees it for himself.

586
00:39:26,043 --> 00:39:28,273
That I must do.

587
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:05,039
Hurry. It is my husband.

588
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:08,379
He's here beneath this rubbish.

589
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:15,549
It is his hand! I would know it anywhere.

590
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:19,293
Oh, my God!

591
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:23,700
It is too much to bear,
and I do not blame you.

592
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:26,564
We must see what can be done here.
Come.

593
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:55,565
Our village has become an island
in a river of fleeing people.

594
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:59,897
But they cannot run fast enough
to forget the horror behind them.

595
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:03,696
My grandfather will speak to you now.

596
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:19,047
I know that you are looking to me
to save you from this great trouble.

597
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:21,555
I've been trying to find a way
but I cannot.

598
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:23,659
I cannot save myself.

599
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:27,729
I know that what today was
will be again tomorrow.

600
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:31,629
You, my three sons, are men.
And you, Wu Lien, are older than they.

601
00:41:31,802 --> 00:41:35,260
- If you have anything to say, then say it.
- I...

602
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:38,704
I have not yet thought of any way
to save any of us.

603
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:42,044
There are two things which can be done.

604
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:45,375
One is to escape the evil
by running away.

605
00:41:45,549 --> 00:41:48,814
And the other is to let it come down
and bear it.

606
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:52,319
In this, my father,
I ask, what will you do yourself?

607
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:54,753
Stay here where I was born
and where I have lived.

608
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:57,325
Then I say I will do what you do.

609
00:41:57,494 --> 00:41:59,553
I, too, will stay.

610
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:02,031
But I, my father, will escape it.

611
00:42:06,136 --> 00:42:07,865
I will say nothing to any who do go.

612
00:42:08,038 --> 00:42:11,474
Let those who will stay with me,
and those who would go, let them go.

613
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:15,736
You blame me, my father?

614
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:18,071
No, no. I do not blame you, my son.

615
00:42:18,248 --> 00:42:20,614
Then do as I will do. Leave this place.

616
00:42:20,784 --> 00:42:23,617
If I could roll up my land like a cloth
and take it with me...

617
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:26,347
...but that is impossible. No.

618
00:42:26,523 --> 00:42:28,923
No. I stay, my son. You are free to go.

619
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:34,095
I do not run away because I'm afraid.

620
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,430
I only fear for my coming child.

621
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:42,095
A grandchild?

622
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:44,397
That is good news, my son.

623
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,372
And I think it well that you go.

624
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:48,272
When will you leave us, brother?

625
00:42:48,445 --> 00:42:51,005
We have yet time.

626
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:53,513
We will wait until we find those
we would go with.

627
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:57,887
I do not like this talk. I do not see
why Jade should be taken away.

628
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:02,286
It is only that I may finish
what I was made to do, my mother.

629
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,859
But who will look after you
when your time comes?

630
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:08,157
Why should our grandson be born
somewhere in a field like an animal?

631
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:10,197
It may be better that they go.

632
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:14,235
We do not know what lies ahead.
Strange feet may enter our gate.

633
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:17,841
If my son wants to go, he will go.
But let Jade stay.

634
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:21,173
- Her duty to you comes first.
- I think it does not.

635
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:23,404
A woman should go with her man.

636
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:52,633
There are so many who flee
these past weeks.

637
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,745
The whole face of the earth
must be changing.

638
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:07,123
Cousin, what comes now?

639
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,124
These carry different burdens.

640
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:13,758
Move along!

641
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:18,361
Move along!

642
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:35,947
Keep to the road!

643
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:44,719
What foolishness is this?

644
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:47,830
Only a city man would break his back
under the weight of iron...

645
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:50,296
...when he might carry a bag of rice.

646
00:44:50,467 --> 00:44:53,561
Why did you not take two wheels
and make a cart and ride?

647
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:57,440
Look at those fools.
They will eat iron if they eat at all.

648
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:02,602
This is not iron, my wise country friend.
This is a factory we carry on our backs.

649
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,442
And you may as well
get used to seeing such things...

650
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,346
...for a whole city follows behind us.

651
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,683
These are not as the others were.
They seem to have a plan.

652
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,719
- Halt!
- Halt!

653
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:21,057
- We will rest now for a little while.
- Halt!

654
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:24,462
- Rest!
- Rest!

655
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:25,966
I've never been so tired.

656
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:31,970
Why do you not sleep here in our land?

657
00:45:32,142 --> 00:45:34,667
There is water, and we will share
what we can with you.

658
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:38,303
You are good to us as all have been,
or we could not have come this far.

659
00:45:39,149 --> 00:45:43,051
We will rest here tonight with these,
our friends.

660
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:18,879
These are the people we will join,
my father.

661
00:46:21,391 --> 00:46:24,554
Yes. They are the ones
we have waited for.

662
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:26,719
They are strong and full of courage.

663
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:35,397
I would ask you, my friend,
where do you go?

664
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:38,234
Our eyes are on the mountains,
a thousand miles from here.

665
00:46:38,408 --> 00:46:39,705
What will you do there, sir?

666
00:46:39,877 --> 00:46:42,937
We'll set up these machines we carry,
and they will be a factory.

667
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:45,206
Then we'll make bullets and guns
for the army.

668
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,179
Where is our brave army now?

669
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:49,950
They fight between you
and the Japanese.

670
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,954
Many thousands of them have already died
to delay the evil dwarfs from coming here.

671
00:46:54,124 --> 00:46:57,116
My son would join you in your journey
if he is welcome.

672
00:46:57,294 --> 00:46:59,956
We would be happy
to take something of yours with us.

673
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,030
And what is a man without his wife?

674
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:05,099
I, too, am strong and can be of help.

675
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,033
You are welcome also.

676
00:47:10,173 --> 00:47:12,698
The wind has brought rain.
It is good for our land...

677
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:16,869
...but is it not bad for travelers?
- If it helps you, then it must help us.

678
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,064
Now that we are to go,
I wonder if it's too far.

679
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:38,098
I will be on my feet when others drop.

680
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:42,034
- I wish I could carry the child for you.
- One of these days you shall.

681
00:47:42,205 --> 00:47:44,799
I never thought a child of mine
would be born anywhere...

682
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:46,636
...except here on this land.

683
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,505
He will find a place of his own.

684
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,409
It is very meaningful to a man
where he is born.

685
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:53,276
We must mark the place.

686
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,112
A man begins his life before he is born.

687
00:47:56,286 --> 00:47:59,778
So, what better place to mark for him
than our tree.

688
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:11,728
There. Now it will be his also.

689
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:16,998
All right, take your places!

690
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:20,735
- Take you places.
- Take your places!

691
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:24,540
We must cross those hills
before the midday rest.

692
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:28,048
Take your places!

693
00:48:28,218 --> 00:48:30,686
I've looked everywhere
but I cannot find our mother...

694
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:32,253
...to say goodbye.

695
00:48:32,422 --> 00:48:34,913
Tell her it is our sorrow
that we could not find her.

696
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:39,620
I will tell her.
You must not keep your friends waiting.

697
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:57,377
Send me word somehow
when the child is born.

698
00:48:57,547 --> 00:49:00,175
If it is a boy,
send a red cord in the envelope.

699
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:03,012
If it is a girl, let it be a blue one.

700
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,078
Remember, my child...

701
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:07,815
...that the woman is a root,
and the man the tree.

702
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:10,983
The tree grows only as high
as the root is strong.

703
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:13,561
I will remember, my father.

704
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,220
Go.

705
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:21,033
This place is yours.

706
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:25,571
- March!
- March!

707
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,081
So this is where you have been.

708
00:50:51,094 --> 00:50:52,721
They looked for you.

709
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:55,729
I would not come to see him go.

710
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:59,665
Pulling, straining like an ox
and bawling like one.

711
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:03,736
- You have been weeping.
- I have not.

712
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:06,432
Splashed water on my face.

713
00:51:07,377 --> 00:51:10,175
He looked so small beside the others.

714
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:14,807
He did not.
He was the largest by far.

715
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:19,648
You are the best mother in the province.
Where is there one better beyond the seas?

716
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:21,620
I'm a fool.

717
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:24,851
I miss them already. Even Jade.

718
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:29,397
Yes, yes, some sort of strength
has left the house with their going.

719
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:32,433
I would not say I want them back.

720
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:36,294
They want to go, they go.

721
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:40,637
I would not have you a cool, thin soul.
I like you hot-tempered and gusty.

722
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,971
You old turnip.

723
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:50,116
Come here, old man.
Let me see that spot on your neck.

724
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:53,882
- See if you have boil after all these years...
- It's where a mosquito bit me.

725
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:56,651
Do not tell me what it is.
I can see for myself.

726
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:02,097
Well, can you not
catch a mosquito anymore?

727
00:52:02,265 --> 00:52:04,790
Must you be bitten like a child?

728
00:52:04,968 --> 00:52:06,492
You're clumsy.

729
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,503
I like your quick tongue
even when it is turned on me.

730
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:11,231
Old woman, I tell you this.

731
00:52:11,408 --> 00:52:14,673
If you should die before I die,
even then I would not marry another.

732
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:18,712
For after you, any would be
like a carrot dried without salt.

733
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:28,649
<i>The guns of the enemy came ever closer.

734
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:31,589
<i>And still the people fled before them.

735
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:34,730
<i>Some of the kinsmen of Ling Tan</i>
<i>fled also.

736
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:38,891
<i>But most of them stayed</i>
<i>and went into the fields to reap the grain.

737
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:41,128
<i>And each man helped his neighbor...

738
00:52:41,304 --> 00:52:45,206
<i>... for the harvest was at hand,</i>
<i>and they were farmers.

739
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:49,675
<i>And war or no war, they knew</i>
<i>they must bring their food from the earth...

740
00:52:49,846 --> 00:52:53,782
<i>... so that whatever came,</i>
<i>they could feed their families.

741
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:02,220
<i>Day after day, the flying ships came...

742
00:53:02,392 --> 00:53:05,122
<i>... and then flew on and bombed the city.

743
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:08,423
<i>The people of the valley of Ling</i>
<i>were afraid.

744
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:12,193
<i>But they stopped only to look up</i>
<i>and then turn back to their work...

745
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:15,133
<i>... for they'd heard</i>
<i>that the Japanese had taken the land...

746
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:17,398
<i>... a hundred miles deep from the sea...

747
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:21,299
<i>... and were even now</i>
<i>approaching the nearby city.

748
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:23,844
<i>Time, too, had become their enemy.

749
00:53:24,881 --> 00:53:28,078
<i>It seemed nature itself was against them.

750
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:30,242
<i>The rains were early that year.

751
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,618
<i>And the farmers fought the wind</i>
<i>and the water as they always had.

752
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:38,818
<i>Here was a thing they understood</i>
<i>and, understanding, could defeat.

753
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:42,328
<i>But they could not defeat the fear</i>
<i>that was in them.

754
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:46,833
<i>For always in their ears was the sound</i>
<i>of the bombardment.

755
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:49,301
<i>A sound that was louder now...

756
00:53:49,472 --> 00:53:54,273
<i>... and they knew that the enemy</i>
<i>was storming the gates of the city.

757
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,011
<i>Then the day came.

758
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:09,955
<i>The day that Ling Tan dreaded</i>
<i>above all others.

759
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:12,618
<i>The guns were silent...

760
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:16,755
<i>... and the flying ships</i>
<i>were gone from the air.

761
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:21,466
I fear this quiet more
than the noise of battle.

762
00:54:21,638 --> 00:54:23,697
It does not mean peace.

763
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:27,309
It means but one thing,
and we must face it.

764
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,911
The defenders of our city
have been overcome.

765
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,447
And even now as I speak to you,
the enemy is at our gates.

766
00:54:33,616 --> 00:54:35,982
- Within hours, they will be upon us.
- That is true.

767
00:54:36,152 --> 00:54:38,245
The enemy moves swiftly,
and we have no arms.

768
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:41,390
How can we resist him?
Are we to fight him with our hands?

769
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:44,686
I speak for myself
but you are welcome to listen.

770
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:46,488
We cannot stop the Japanese, no.

771
00:54:46,663 --> 00:54:48,927
But as soon as they have
occupied a city...

772
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:51,329
...I believe we shall be able
to deal with them.

773
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:52,729
How can you say this?

774
00:54:52,902 --> 00:54:55,928
I bought and sold their goods
as did my father before me...

775
00:54:56,106 --> 00:54:59,439
...and I have found no great evil
in the face they turned to me.

776
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:02,237
I did find evil in my own people,
in green boys...

777
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:05,210
...who burned my goods without reason.

778
00:55:05,382 --> 00:55:08,613
Wu Lien, if when they come, you are right,
I will say you are.

779
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:12,551
But even if you are not, what can we do
but take their rule for ours also?

780
00:55:12,722 --> 00:55:15,190
All we want is peace
and to be left alone to live.

781
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,158
- Our time is short. What is the plan?
- How shall we meet them?

782
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:21,388
How can we show them
what is in our hearts?

783
00:55:21,564 --> 00:55:24,465
What ways do we know but our own?
Let us do what we would do...

784
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:28,627
...for any new ruler coming to our village,
but let us keep our pride.

785
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:10,036
But they are machines.

786
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:13,478
How can you talk to machines
when they're belching smoke?

787
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:23,119
- Speak, here is the enemy.
- Do not use that word.

788
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:24,860
Sirs...

789
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:28,429
Sirs, I am come...

790
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:31,726
We are come, sirs...

791
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,266
Sir, we are only farmers...

792
00:56:33,436 --> 00:56:36,166
...a small merchant or two,
and my cousin here the scholar.

793
00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:39,172
- We are men of peace and reason...
- Where is your inn, farmer?

794
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:41,173
- Lead us there.
- But...

795
00:56:55,992 --> 00:56:58,460
Waiter. Waiter. Service for my soldiers.

796
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:01,188
You there, line up against the wall.

797
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:06,630
- Steady, now. Give us no trouble.
- Let's get out of here.

798
00:57:08,137 --> 00:57:09,934
Get him over here, right now.

799
00:57:13,476 --> 00:57:16,240
- You are ill, my father.
- No, no, no. It's nothing.

800
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,845
- Wine with it.
- Wine, wine.

801
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:22,212
Over here.

802
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,017
- Wine.
- Bring the wine or we'll shoot you.

803
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:29,314
Tea. We want wine, not tea.

804
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:32,256
- Wine?
- Yes, wine.

805
00:57:33,129 --> 00:57:35,324
We... We have no wine.

806
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:37,489
We have that only on feast days.

807
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,726
Oh, no wine, huh?

808
00:57:39,903 --> 00:57:41,302
And where are your women?

809
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:43,234
There are other things than wine.

810
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:44,930
Women.

811
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:46,735
Bring them. Bring me a young one.

812
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,641
I do not care if mine is young or not.
What matters so long as they are...

813
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:56,009
Does anyone else care to run?

814
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:03,182
We have wine in our homes. Good wine.

815
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,759
We will have our women bring it to you.

816
00:58:06,663 --> 00:58:08,790
See that they do, then.

817
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:18,630
No, do not stop.

818
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:31,311
Get to your homes.

819
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:38,588
Old woman. Old woman.

820
00:58:38,761 --> 00:58:42,754
Get the household together inside
quickly. The enemy comes.

821
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:44,727
Orchid, eldest daughter, all of you.

822
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:46,129
- What?
- Bring the children.

823
00:58:46,302 --> 00:58:48,566
- Lao San, my son.
- What of the speech?

824
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:51,673
Our mouths spoke
into the mouths of guns.

825
00:58:57,113 --> 00:58:58,740
Come with me.

826
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:07,613
You must scatter over the lands.
Each man look after his own.

827
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,281
My third son, his mother.
I'll stay with the house.

828
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,052
- I'll stay by you.
- No, you cannot.

829
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:15,129
- I'll climb the rafters and hide there.
- Then I'll climb also.

830
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:16,731
They come by the road.

831
00:59:16,899 --> 00:59:19,094
- Mother.
- Oh, no, no, wait.

832
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:21,498
No, this way.
They will see us there.

833
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:24,606
We must hide. Find the hole in the wall.

834
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,814
Here. My son.

835
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:36,376
Orchid. Take the baby.

836
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:43,855
Come, my son, you must be brave.
We will be soon be safe.

837
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:46,860
Safety. Where is safety?

838
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:50,296
Mother, please. Please, Mother.

839
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:51,728
She can go no further.

840
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:55,894
- Go. I will do my best for your mother.
- Yes. Yes, I...

841
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,139
- My mother.
- Remember...

842
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:08,340
...let each look out for those in his charge
and pay no heed to the others.

843
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,713
We must hide safely,
and each group to itself.

844
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:17,656
Yes, yes. Then if one is found,
only they perish.

845
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:24,556
Go. We must hide you. Quiet, quiet.

846
01:00:24,734 --> 01:00:29,364
Do not move. Do not speak.
We will not be far away.

847
01:00:33,176 --> 01:00:35,667
- Old man, hermit.
- The door is locked.

848
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,875
Our old dog. They will kill him.

849
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:16,807
Take what you want and destroy the rest.

850
01:01:17,283 --> 01:01:19,808
Is there anything here worth having?

851
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:26,054
All of them are gone.
No one is in the house.

852
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:36,497
You will stay here, my eldest son,
like a man and by yourself.

853
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:49,137
Lie down,
make yourself small against the ground.

854
01:01:53,218 --> 01:01:57,052
And you here, my wife.
Do not move for anything.

855
01:01:57,222 --> 01:01:58,917
Where will you go?

856
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:03,225
Back a little, between you
and the evil thing there.

857
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:05,192
Yes, my husband.

858
01:02:05,965 --> 01:02:07,694
You tremble.

859
01:02:07,866 --> 01:02:10,562
Your nose twitches like a little rabbit.

860
01:02:15,307 --> 01:02:17,867
Come, do not waste time here.
Find the farmer.

861
01:02:18,043 --> 01:02:19,670
Search the courtyard.

862
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,810
And the first woman we find
belongs with me.

863
01:02:27,753 --> 01:02:29,983
Is there a way out of this courtyard?

864
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:31,782
Here. Here's a hole in the wall.

865
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:35,222
Pull aside the vine.
Someone has crawled through here.

866
01:02:35,394 --> 01:02:38,022
Come, see what I found.

867
01:02:38,564 --> 01:02:40,054
Something they left behind.

868
01:02:40,232 --> 01:02:42,200
No wonder. Look at it.

869
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:47,929
Here is the first woman
and she belongs to you.

870
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:51,810
No. She is old.

871
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:53,842
There are the young to think of.

872
01:02:54,013 --> 01:02:56,641
Do not be afraid.

873
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:12,625
My husband.

874
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:15,666
My husband.

875
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:23,331
Come, my son,
we'll be safer in another place.

876
01:03:49,068 --> 01:03:50,467
I heard a child.

877
01:03:50,636 --> 01:03:52,797
Where there is a child,
there is a woman.Dragon Seed

878
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:27,370
Remember, a little man does not cry out.
No matter what he sees.

879
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:37,302
The sounds of death are far away now.

880
01:06:38,137 --> 01:06:41,334
My good red pigskin boxes...

881
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,366
...that I brought here as a bride.

882
01:06:52,284 --> 01:06:54,115
Come, old woman.

883
01:06:57,423 --> 01:07:00,085
There's worse to see in the courtyard.

884
01:07:18,644 --> 01:07:19,906
Wait here.

885
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,843
Do not spare me what you must see.

886
01:07:41,133 --> 01:07:42,361
Someone comes.

887
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,233
Is anybody here?

888
01:07:52,378 --> 01:07:53,640
It's our third son.

889
01:07:53,812 --> 01:07:56,440
Mother. Father.

890
01:07:56,815 --> 01:07:58,942
- You are safe.
- Yes, yes, we are safe.

891
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:02,110
We're safe.
Where's your brother and his family?

892
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:05,257
I don't know. We lost each other
and did not come together again.

893
01:08:05,424 --> 01:08:07,517
- Sit down.
- Where are the others?

894
01:08:07,693 --> 01:08:11,652
We met people who told us it was safe
in the foreign school in the city.

895
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:16,529
- My sister and her children are there.
- Where then is Wu Lien?

896
01:08:16,702 --> 01:08:18,863
Perhaps he stayed in safety
with our daughter.

897
01:08:19,038 --> 01:08:22,337
He went back to his shop
and he will stay there, he said.

898
01:08:23,209 --> 01:08:26,440
But how he can, I do not know.

899
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:32,315
The women, little children.
Streets run with their blood.

900
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:36,318
In the village, the young women
are dead in the grass.

901
01:08:36,622 --> 01:08:39,147
And no one knows
how many others still live...

902
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:41,316
...but would be better dead.

903
01:08:42,294 --> 01:08:44,922
Oh, what I have seen this night.

904
01:08:45,097 --> 01:08:48,089
Oh, I cannot. I cannot.

905
01:09:15,894 --> 01:09:20,661
There, there, my meat dumpling.

906
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:35,010
She was ever a poor, foolish little thing,
without courage.

907
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:38,646
But she was my wife.

908
01:09:38,817 --> 01:09:41,183
And the mother of my children.

909
01:09:55,034 --> 01:09:58,868
I cannot stay here. I cannot.

910
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:01,768
Quiet, my son. This is your home.

911
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:05,307
No longer. I hate it.

912
01:10:05,477 --> 01:10:09,538
I do not care where I go,
but I cannot stay here.

913
01:10:10,382 --> 01:10:13,943
I will go with those in the hills
who fight this horror.

914
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:16,053
Rest today first. Do not think of it now.

915
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:19,816
I cannot rest. I must go.

916
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:25,261
Help our third son
make ready for his journey.

917
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:38,098
Remember, my son,
all weeping ceases at last.

918
01:10:54,193 --> 01:10:57,094
Your brother's rash and foolish,
and I will keep an eye on him.

919
01:10:57,262 --> 01:10:59,696
If not my own, then one that I can trust.

920
01:10:59,865 --> 01:11:02,925
I would have you follow him to the hills
and watch over him for me.

921
01:11:03,102 --> 01:11:05,730
- Do you so command me, Father?
- I do.

922
01:11:05,904 --> 01:11:08,031
The hills.

923
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,835
There I, too, could fight.

924
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:14,270
Yes, I can pay these dwarfs
some of what I owe them.

925
01:11:14,446 --> 01:11:17,438
I could kill them like lice in a winter coat.

926
01:11:23,288 --> 01:11:28,225
Since this time yesterday, cousin,
we have both lost sons.

927
01:11:34,733 --> 01:11:39,466
- Can a cock still crow?
- It does not seem one should.

928
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,636
I feel there is no tomorrow.

929
01:12:34,493 --> 01:12:36,518
Come in. Come in, sirs.

930
01:12:36,695 --> 01:12:38,822
- Salted fish.
- Fish, yes. Yes, sir.

931
01:12:38,997 --> 01:12:43,263
Here, here is fish. Oh, no.

932
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:45,502
What...?

933
01:12:46,538 --> 01:12:48,768
I'm of all creatures,
the most unfortunate.

934
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:52,069
These fish are not salted. No, no, sir.
They are only soaked in oil.

935
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:55,475
- I will take them.
- Then take them as a gift, please.

936
01:12:55,647 --> 01:12:59,048
I bought them from your country
and now I return them to you.

937
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:02,813
- Thank you. You are Wu Lien?
- Yes, sir.

938
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:07,448
- And you do not hate us?
- Why, no. I hate no one, sir.

939
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:10,925
Thank you.
For all this damage we are sorry.

940
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:15,294
- Our soldiers very brave, angry.
- Oh, yes, I know. I know how soldiers are.

941
01:13:15,467 --> 01:13:20,234
But now... Now let us hope for peace.
Only in peace can we do business.

942
01:13:24,409 --> 01:13:28,038
I am glad to meet a man
who hates no one.

943
01:13:29,248 --> 01:13:33,548
What can I say except that
whatever you want me to do I will do.

944
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:36,244
You maybe useful to us, if you will.

945
01:13:37,389 --> 01:13:38,617
Will I not be...?

946
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,917
We shall set up
a people's government here.

947
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:43,994
And those who rule, shall rule for us.
Can you read and write?

948
01:13:44,162 --> 01:13:47,996
Oh, certainly, sir. I'm a man of culture.

949
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,467
- You know the address written there?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

950
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,770
I have delivered goods there.
It is the house of a very rich man.

951
01:13:58,944 --> 01:14:02,846
And now he shares it with us,
his friends.

952
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:08,081
You will come there tomorrow.
And live there.

953
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:12,085
You'll see how merciful we are
with those who do not resist us.

954
01:14:12,257 --> 01:14:13,690
Yes.

955
01:14:14,393 --> 01:14:18,124
Our flag above your door
will protect you until you come to us.

956
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:23,701
All my thanks, great one.
Oh, even to 10,000 thousand.

957
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:35,810
I'm more cheered than I've been for months.
Now I can be with my household again.

958
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:39,974
How wise am I
to arrange my own affairs so well.

959
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,847
- Another patriot has died.
- Patriot. What, then, is a patriot?

960
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:48,322
To be one must a man die
and let the worms eat his flesh?

961
01:14:48,493 --> 01:14:51,656
No, no, no. I think not.

962
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:54,424
All these thing that happen
are not my affair.

963
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,727
Whatever comes, I'm a man of peace.

964
01:14:56,902 --> 01:15:00,429
And whatever heaven sends
I will take and go on with my business.

965
01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:03,336
If this foolish resistance will stop
there will be peace.

966
01:15:03,508 --> 01:15:05,339
Do you not agree?

967
01:15:48,487 --> 01:15:51,650
Farmer, this country now belongs to us,
your conquerors.

968
01:15:51,823 --> 01:15:53,654
You must produce on your land
as we say.

969
01:15:53,825 --> 01:15:57,090
And the harvest is to come to us
at the price we tell you it shall be.

970
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,925
And those who disobey us
will need their land no longer.

971
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:04,068
- But they take all the fish. The pond is mine.
- Nothing is yours.

972
01:16:04,236 --> 01:16:06,796
Will you village men never learn
that you are conquered?

973
01:16:07,139 --> 01:16:10,199
If they take all the rice,
how can we live and plant in the spring?

974
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:14,175
You can live off your own fat and you
will be given seed when the time come.

975
01:16:14,346 --> 01:16:16,143
You don't even leave us breeding stock.

976
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:20,375
We will raise the animals henceforth
and also eat them.

977
01:16:20,552 --> 01:16:23,817
My ox. Who will pull the plow?

978
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:26,651
Your own back looks strong.

979
01:16:27,926 --> 01:16:29,951
How would we feed
our grandchildren now?

980
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:34,189
- Why did you not defy him?
- Alive, I can hold my land.

981
01:16:34,366 --> 01:16:37,802
Dead, I can only hold so much
as I am buried in.

982
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:46,336
<i>So while Ling Tan and his kinsmen</i>
<i>tried somehow to live on...

983
01:16:46,511 --> 01:16:49,378
<i>... those who had taken machines apart</i>
<i>with their hands...

984
01:16:49,548 --> 01:16:54,679
<i>... so they could be carried piece by piece,</i>
<i>were making their way forward.

985
01:16:56,788 --> 01:17:00,053
<i>Mud could not stop them. Nor could rain.

986
01:17:00,225 --> 01:17:03,752
<i>Rain that so filled the air</i>
<i>that fish could have lived in it.

987
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:08,662
<i>Mud so thick that it held them back</i>
<i>like evil hands.

988
01:17:09,968 --> 01:17:13,165
<i>Water was made to cross</i>
<i>and it was crossed many times.

989
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:16,330
<i>And when it could not be walked in,</i>
<i>boats were built.

990
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:18,533
<i>And the people rowed upon the water.

991
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:22,612
<i>And were grateful for the moment</i>
<i>that they need not walk.

992
01:17:26,618 --> 01:17:29,246
<i>Time came when the earth opened</i>
<i>at their feet...

993
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:31,355
<i>... but they did not stop.

994
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:36,927
<i>They took what they had, rags and belts</i>
<i>and ropes, and made bridges...

995
01:17:37,095 --> 01:17:39,222
<i>... and passed over.

996
01:17:43,168 --> 01:17:46,035
<i>And then they reached</i>
<i>the high mountain passes...

997
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:48,104
<i>... where no one had gone before.

998
01:17:48,273 --> 01:17:52,835
<i>And many faltered, for food was gone</i>
<i>and strength was near an end.

999
01:17:53,011 --> 01:17:55,411
<i>Many faltered but did not stop.

1000
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,378
<i>Nothing could stop them</i>
<i>but their own will.

1001
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,747
<i>Nor could it stop Jade and Lao Er.

1002
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,650
<i>Although now and then, they rested...

1003
01:18:04,823 --> 01:18:07,849
<i>... and she yearned</i>
<i>for the end of the journey...

1004
01:18:08,026 --> 01:18:11,894
<i>... for she knew</i>
<i>that her time was at hand.

1005
01:18:13,832 --> 01:18:18,860
<i>The enemy was everywhere,</i>
<i>leaving footprints on the sick earth...

1006
01:18:19,037 --> 01:18:22,336
<i>... and many of Ling Tan's kinsmen died.

1007
01:18:22,507 --> 01:18:26,568
<i>Some met death quickly</i>
<i>but they were the fortunate ones.

1008
01:18:26,745 --> 01:18:31,011
<i>For others found a longer,</i>
<i>harder way to die.

1009
01:18:36,221 --> 01:18:39,987
<i>And then starvation came,</i>
<i>and pestilence...

1010
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:43,594
<i>... and did not spare</i>
<i>the house of Ling Tan.

1011
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:48,563
<i>The little children were struck down</i>
<i>for they were the weakest.

1012
01:18:50,068 --> 01:18:52,866
<i>So Ling Tan and his wife</i>
<i>went into the fields...

1013
01:18:53,038 --> 01:18:56,371
<i>... to dig for roots</i>
<i>and forgotten kernels of grain.

1014
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,533
<i>All about them</i>
<i>were the other people of the valley.

1015
01:18:59,711 --> 01:19:03,613
<i>And the hunger pain in their bellies</i>
<i>drove some of them mad...

1016
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:08,276
<i>... and they became as animals</i>
<i>and fought each other.

1017
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:16,920
<i>Some of them fell upon their knees...

1018
01:19:17,095 --> 01:19:20,462
<i>... and fought for swill</i>
<i>that not even swine would eat...

1019
01:19:20,632 --> 01:19:22,293
<i>... while the enemy laughed.

1020
01:19:26,705 --> 01:19:31,335
<i>But still, Ling Tan and others like him</i>
<i>clung to their land.

1021
01:19:39,851 --> 01:19:41,546
Old woman?

1022
01:19:51,062 --> 01:19:52,893
I have found food for them.

1023
01:19:53,064 --> 01:19:54,588
Girl is dead.

1024
01:20:04,542 --> 01:20:06,635
But the boy... There is food.
We can help him.

1025
01:20:06,811 --> 01:20:10,212
It's too late. He is past all help.

1026
01:20:30,502 --> 01:20:33,562
What is a house where no children are?

1027
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,469
They brought only happiness
and they have taken it away.

1028
01:20:40,245 --> 01:20:43,009
What need
could the gods have of them?

1029
01:20:44,516 --> 01:20:47,644
That should I go on living
when my grandchildren die.

1030
01:20:48,286 --> 01:20:50,083
Curse all these men
who would make wars.

1031
01:20:50,255 --> 01:20:52,246
Curse all women
who give birth to these men.

1032
01:20:52,424 --> 01:20:55,052
And curse their grandmothers
and all who are their kin.

1033
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:57,725
Why do not men of peace and sense
band together...

1034
01:20:57,896 --> 01:21:00,660
...and forbid life
to those who would make wars?

1035
01:21:03,935 --> 01:21:05,960
Yet what can I do?

1036
01:21:06,604 --> 01:21:08,834
One man upon my land.

1037
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:16,713
Cousin, cousin? Are you here, then?

1038
01:21:20,885 --> 01:21:24,878
Cousin, are you here, then?
Cousin, cousin? Where is the man?

1039
01:21:25,056 --> 01:21:26,751
I come with big news in my mouth.

1040
01:21:28,293 --> 01:21:32,923
See. See, they have food
and did not share it.

1041
01:21:37,802 --> 01:21:40,703
This is from your son.
A messenger brought it to the teahouse.

1042
01:21:40,872 --> 01:21:44,103
A letter from a son
is something I will never have now.

1043
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:46,505
We have all lost much.

1044
01:21:46,678 --> 01:21:48,612
Well, then, open it.

1045
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:55,920
The cord is red.

1046
01:21:56,621 --> 01:21:59,852
- It is a son.
- We have a grandson.

1047
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:03,093
But you weep. This is a time for joy.

1048
01:22:03,261 --> 01:22:06,094
Two grandchildren lie dead in our house.

1049
01:22:06,264 --> 01:22:08,732
Shall I thank heaven
for sending us back but one?

1050
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,336
Quiet, woman, or heaven will hear you
and take even him away.

1051
01:22:13,204 --> 01:22:17,004
Thank you, cousin.
This news lightens our heavy hearts.

1052
01:22:17,175 --> 01:22:18,767
A grandson is no small thing.

1053
01:22:18,943 --> 01:22:22,037
By rights, this child of Jade's
is not yours.

1054
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:23,942
You talk with no thought.

1055
01:22:24,115 --> 01:22:27,084
Pray excuse her.
Bitterness has turned her words to gall.

1056
01:22:27,252 --> 01:22:29,447
Had Jade married my son as she ought...

1057
01:22:29,621 --> 01:22:32,886
...he would be alive today
and safe there with her.

1058
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:37,688
And so before the gods,
her child is our grandchild.

1059
01:22:37,862 --> 01:22:41,229
I should drive you from my house...

1060
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:44,361
...but it would soil this moment.

1061
01:22:52,777 --> 01:22:55,245
This joyful moment.

1062
01:23:00,284 --> 01:23:03,117
<i>But not even the enemy</i>
<i>could stop the seasons.

1063
01:23:03,287 --> 01:23:04,948
<i>And at last it was spring.

1064
01:23:05,122 --> 01:23:09,491
<i>And each farmer was given grain.</i>
<i>Not to eat, but to plant.

1065
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,890
<i>And it was said that each seed</i>
<i>was counted...

1066
01:23:12,063 --> 01:23:16,056
<i>... and the man would answer for it</i>
<i>if each seed did not yield.

1067
01:23:16,234 --> 01:23:20,170
<i>So Ling Tan harnessed himself</i>
<i>to his plow like an ox.

1068
01:23:20,338 --> 01:23:26,106
<i>And together, he and his old woman</i>
<i>felt the earth turn beneath their feet.

1069
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:38,580
<i>The grain grew straight and tall.

1070
01:23:38,756 --> 01:23:42,385
<i>But Ling Tan and his wife could no longer</i>
<i>take pleasure in it's promise...

1071
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,224
<i>... for they knew that what they worked for</i>
<i>would not be theirs.

1072
01:23:50,368 --> 01:23:53,667
Now what, old woman? Has the enemy
not done enough damage to my house?

1073
01:23:53,838 --> 01:23:55,305
Must you dig up the foundations?

1074
01:23:55,473 --> 01:23:57,998
We will keep our seed
and the vegetables we grow...

1075
01:23:58,175 --> 01:23:59,540
...and hide them in this hole.

1076
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:02,235
- I will make it big enough to hold a pig.
- What pig?

1077
01:24:03,014 --> 01:24:05,414
The one you'll steal
from the enemy's breeding farm.

1078
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:07,244
But it will have to be big.

1079
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:10,581
How can you dig such a thing without help.
The earth is stubborn.

1080
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:13,417
Heaven gave me the thought.
Heaven will provide the help.

1081
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:15,081
The shovel is there.

1082
01:24:15,526 --> 01:24:18,256
We will steal food from ourselves
and eat it.

1083
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:22,965
I am too just a man to deny sense
even to a woman, when I hear it from her.

1084
01:24:23,134 --> 01:24:26,592
If all do this, we'll harry the enemy
like fleas in a dog's tail.

1085
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:31,265
And it may be that he will make little
headway for stopping to gnaw at his rear.

1086
01:24:48,759 --> 01:24:51,694
- My son.
- My father.

1087
01:24:53,064 --> 01:24:55,259
Oh, what gladness.

1088
01:24:55,433 --> 01:24:57,162
My mother.

1089
01:24:58,903 --> 01:25:02,168
Have I no grandson?
Where is he? Where is he?

1090
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,673
Quiet, woman. Before you burst,
and the enemy hears the sound you make.

1091
01:25:05,843 --> 01:25:07,606
Where have you left
my little dumpling?

1092
01:25:07,778 --> 01:25:10,338
Books, still books.
You've crushed him beneath them.

1093
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:13,176
You seem to love them
more than you love your child.

1094
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:39,132
How sweet his flesh smells.

1095
01:25:40,945 --> 01:25:43,277
Bring the lamp close so I can see him.

1096
01:25:43,447 --> 01:25:46,678
Oh, my little meat dumpling.

1097
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:51,220
Oh, how firm he is of body,
and his hair like black silk.

1098
01:25:51,389 --> 01:25:53,380
He's exactly as I thought he would be.

1099
01:25:53,557 --> 01:25:56,287
I knew you'd bring him back to me.
I knew. I knew.

1100
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,860
Else I could not have lived.

1101
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:02,989
Night after night,
I've dreamed of holding him like this.

1102
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:05,397
Guard you heart, old woman.
Guard your heart.

1103
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:08,299
Yes, my mother, too much joy
is as bad as too much sorrow.

1104
01:26:08,472 --> 01:26:12,135
Here, my mother, drink down this cold tea.
Then the words can come out.

1105
01:26:14,278 --> 01:26:19,580
Why, this is no usual child.
Look at his face, how square it is.

1106
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,150
And he has a square mouth.

1107
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,686
- Now give him back to me.
- In a moment, old woman. In a moment.

1108
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,322
What can the enemy do to us
when our family goes on like this?

1109
01:26:31,495 --> 01:26:35,625
There, now.
You are in your home and you must eat.

1110
01:26:38,469 --> 01:26:40,460
I beg you not be angry with me, Mother...

1111
01:26:40,638 --> 01:26:43,232
...but do not put food from your mouth
into the child's.

1112
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:45,671
Well, I fed my own son so.
It did him no harm.

1113
01:26:45,843 --> 01:26:49,779
But it is not thought good now. I bought
a book and it told how to care for children.

1114
01:26:49,947 --> 01:26:53,314
- And it spoke against such things.
- Why, you better take your child back.

1115
01:26:53,484 --> 01:26:57,682
- Doubtless, I pollute him when I hold him.
- Mother, it was for you I brought him home.

1116
01:26:57,855 --> 01:27:01,450
Cool your anger, both of you.
Should we quarrel this night, of all nights...

1117
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:04,093
...and over the child
who is the center of our hearts?

1118
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:06,320
Did I ever have a book
to feed my children?

1119
01:27:06,497 --> 01:27:08,624
Did I ever lose a son?

1120
01:27:08,799 --> 01:27:12,792
Indulge her with the child.
It will heal her for everything.

1121
01:27:18,175 --> 01:27:21,167
Our house has come alive again, old man.

1122
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,753
- Good day, friends.
- Good day.

1123
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:34,413
My son comes from the free land.
He has a message from the high command.

1124
01:27:34,592 --> 01:27:37,652
There are many like me
and we spread among the villagers...

1125
01:27:37,828 --> 01:27:40,524
...to tell such men as you
what we must do.

1126
01:27:40,698 --> 01:27:42,427
This enemy must be resisted.

1127
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,593
Openly where the land is free
and secretly where the land is lost.

1128
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:50,002
We, who must resist secretly,
have a harder task than the others.

1129
01:27:50,174 --> 01:27:52,802
We must work together
as the fingers on one hand.

1130
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:55,537
We must track down this enemy
and kill him.

1131
01:27:55,713 --> 01:27:57,305
What we should do is this...

1132
01:27:57,481 --> 01:28:00,507
Join with the hill men?
You're inviting us to die.

1133
01:28:00,684 --> 01:28:03,448
Yes, but to die like men,
not sheep on the butchering block.

1134
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:04,986
You must not blame our cousin.

1135
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:07,522
A scholar can never be as brave
as one unlettered.

1136
01:28:07,691 --> 01:28:10,854
We must build the hole under
my father's house into one strong room.

1137
01:28:11,028 --> 01:28:13,758
And there we will hide the men
that must be hidden.

1138
01:28:17,601 --> 01:28:20,968
- Where did you find these guns?
- Some have foreign writing on them.

1139
01:28:21,138 --> 01:28:24,699
A wise man does not question a gift
too closely.

1140
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:42,282
I will take the guard now.

1141
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:44,859
No, eat first. I am not weary.

1142
01:28:47,331 --> 01:28:50,027
One of our kinsmen wants to know
where you found the guns.

1143
01:28:50,201 --> 01:28:54,535
Tell him they are easiest found by sticking
a knife into the belly of an enemy soldier:

1144
01:28:55,906 --> 01:28:59,398
And there is the gun for you,
as if from his insides.

1145
01:29:00,611 --> 01:29:03,444
My sons, all my sons.

1146
01:29:03,614 --> 01:29:05,605
What more can I ask,
who am only a woman?

1147
01:29:05,783 --> 01:29:09,150
To hear our third son speak,
one would think he'd like to kill.

1148
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:10,614
Oh, how well he looks.

1149
01:29:10,788 --> 01:29:12,915
And not on my cooking.
I do not understand it.

1150
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:15,422
Oh, you should see the women
admire him now.

1151
01:29:15,593 --> 01:29:18,118
- And still he has yet to choose one.
- Women.

1152
01:29:18,295 --> 01:29:19,956
Do not turn your nose toward heaven.

1153
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,997
It's time you brought home
a daughter-in-law. See that you do.

1154
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:26,398
What would become of us if we did not
have the women to keep at us?

1155
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,731
If you had no women,
none of you would be born.

1156
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:30,533
I want grandsons before I die.

1157
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:33,108
Let fat men like Wu Lien
bother with such nonsense.

1158
01:29:33,277 --> 01:29:35,802
I'm lean enough to fight.
That is what I'm going to do.

1159
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,346
I wanted to ask, what news of Wu Lien?

1160
01:29:38,515 --> 01:29:41,382
He and his family live in the city
and are protected, I heard.

1161
01:29:41,552 --> 01:29:44,749
Yes, we have heard, but they haven't
come to tell us so themselves.

1162
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:47,117
Nor has Wu Lien been here
to his mother's grave.

1163
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:49,851
I have known of others
who are protected.

1164
01:29:50,394 --> 01:29:52,589
Could this mean
he deals with the enemy?

1165
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:55,527
- I will not believe that until I know it is so.
- Nor will I.

1166
01:29:55,699 --> 01:29:57,690
Someone comes.

1167
01:29:57,868 --> 01:30:00,336
It is Neighbor Shen, the lookout.

1168
01:30:01,906 --> 01:30:03,897
Enemy soldiers are in the village.

1169
01:30:04,074 --> 01:30:06,406
They look for young men
to slave for them.

1170
01:30:06,577 --> 01:30:08,909
Well, then, let us help them
find what they seek.

1171
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:12,742
- How many of the enemy?
- A line from here to the door.

1172
01:30:16,887 --> 01:30:18,878
Kinsman, come out
and bring enough guns...

1173
01:30:19,056 --> 01:30:21,047
...for the others who will act with us.

1174
01:30:37,608 --> 01:30:39,200
This is the beginning of it, then.

1175
01:30:47,451 --> 01:30:51,046
- You will be safe?
- Let them come, the bandy-legs.

1176
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:01,097
Get into the cart.

1177
01:31:01,265 --> 01:31:03,290
These Chinese pigs do not fight.

1178
01:31:03,467 --> 01:31:06,061
They were born to be slaves.

1179
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:09,067
But this one is strong.

1180
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:11,867
Yes, a good work animal.

1181
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:16,275
- This one will be sent to the mine.
- We made a good catch tonight.

1182
01:31:17,081 --> 01:31:19,709
This is almost too easy.

1183
01:31:19,883 --> 01:31:22,147
Bring the rest to the cart.

1184
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:24,685
They're the ones I found.

1185
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:27,346
We need more work animals like this.

1186
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,923
Search the houses again.

1187
01:31:29,893 --> 01:31:32,259
Some of them are still hiding.

1188
01:31:32,429 --> 01:31:34,397
Shoot any that resist.

1189
01:31:34,565 --> 01:31:37,728
We must teach them
that it is an honor to serve the emperor.

1190
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,560
- Stop him.
- Catch him.

1191
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:08,493
If he escapes, we are lost.
He will bring others to kill us.

1192
01:32:17,674 --> 01:32:20,302
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- Do not be afraid.

1193
01:32:20,477 --> 01:32:23,605
I am not going to shoot you.

1194
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:46,330
Come to bed, old man.
Or have you learned to sleep standing up?

1195
01:32:46,503 --> 01:32:48,664
The name of the book
that Jade once read...

1196
01:32:48,839 --> 01:32:51,364
...was it not <i>All Men Are Brothers?

1197
01:32:51,542 --> 01:32:54,170
It was. But is that something
to steal your rest?

1198
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:56,175
This is what troubles me.

1199
01:32:56,346 --> 01:33:01,545
How can Jade send forth her husband
to kill other men if all men are his brothers?

1200
01:33:01,718 --> 01:33:05,415
Perhaps because the bandy-legs
are no longer men but beasts.

1201
01:33:05,589 --> 01:33:07,887
But must we, too, become as beasts?

1202
01:33:08,926 --> 01:33:12,418
Tonight, I learned
that men kill differently.

1203
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:15,827
I saw our third son with his knife and...

1204
01:33:16,567 --> 01:33:18,000
He came back into this house...

1205
01:33:18,168 --> 01:33:21,660
...and picked up food and ate it
with the blood still upon his hands.

1206
01:33:21,839 --> 01:33:23,466
I say that is wrong.

1207
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,234
Yet the enemy is upon us.
We must kill them or be killed.

1208
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:31,507
But there is one thing we must remember,
old woman, or we have killed ourselves too.

1209
01:33:33,617 --> 01:33:35,710
Peace is good.

1210
01:33:36,019 --> 01:33:37,919
The young cannot remember it.

1211
01:33:38,088 --> 01:33:39,646
And it is we who must remember...

1212
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:43,782
...and teach them again
that peace is man's great food.

1213
01:34:18,996 --> 01:34:21,931
If you had two sons,
there would be no work done.

1214
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:35,478
Someone comes.

1215
01:34:44,288 --> 01:34:45,778
It is only your elder sister.

1216
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:49,717
- Do not tell them we are here, Mother.
- We will go to the hidden room.

1217
01:34:51,628 --> 01:34:54,825
This is a strange day when brothers
and sisters hide from each other.

1218
01:34:54,998 --> 01:34:57,296
All days are strange now.

1219
01:35:01,438 --> 01:35:03,133
Soldiers.

1220
01:35:07,778 --> 01:35:09,769
They look rich.

1221
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:12,073
Were they always so fat?

1222
01:35:12,282 --> 01:35:16,082
Perhaps our eyes have grown
used to people afraid and hungry.

1223
01:35:22,526 --> 01:35:24,926
My old ones, here we are to see you.

1224
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,687
A thousand fortunes.

1225
01:35:26,863 --> 01:35:29,263
I trust you are well.

1226
01:35:31,702 --> 01:35:34,364
Are we then welcome to come within?

1227
01:35:34,538 --> 01:35:36,768
You and your family are welcome.

1228
01:35:37,074 --> 01:35:39,907
But I cannot let others into my house.

1229
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:43,504
You need not fear.
These two only came to guard me.

1230
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,114
What guard do you need in my house?

1231
01:35:46,984 --> 01:35:49,214
My father-in-law is old and afraid.

1232
01:35:49,386 --> 01:35:51,786
I'm not afraid.
But I will not have them in my house.

1233
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:55,186
Then I must wait here with the guards.

1234
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,319
- Will you bring stools to sit upon?
- I will.

1235
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:05,828
Country people, they have no manners.

1236
01:36:08,005 --> 01:36:09,370
Where, then, are my brothers?

1237
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:11,837
They are gone, and we are alone.

1238
01:36:12,009 --> 01:36:14,773
Even your elder brother's children
are dead.

1239
01:36:14,945 --> 01:36:17,505
They died of sickness and starvation.

1240
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:18,978
It is the times.

1241
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:23,142
I grieve for my elder brother
and for you also. I weep for you.

1242
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:27,086
Do not waste your tears.
My own have dried.

1243
01:36:30,227 --> 01:36:31,558
Why are you so stiff?

1244
01:36:31,728 --> 01:36:34,322
You must know that what I do
is done only for the best.

1245
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:36,056
I do not know what you do.

1246
01:36:36,233 --> 01:36:39,566
Times are times, and the wise man
takes his time as he finds it.

1247
01:36:39,736 --> 01:36:41,931
Compromise is sometimes
better than valor.

1248
01:36:42,105 --> 01:36:43,868
Where do you live now?

1249
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:47,070
At the 10th house
of the North Gate Street.

1250
01:36:47,244 --> 01:36:50,407
That is a street of fine houses.
How can you live there?

1251
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:53,409
I am told to live there.
I work for the new government.

1252
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:55,813
I'm well-paid and I'm content.

1253
01:36:55,986 --> 01:36:57,954
You see what I would say,
my father-in-law?

1254
01:36:58,121 --> 01:36:59,782
I am a common man. I am so stupid...

1255
01:36:59,956 --> 01:37:03,517
...I understand only a thing when it
is said to me, and when I hear it.

1256
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,894
I come here today to help you.

1257
01:37:06,063 --> 01:37:08,554
If you do as I say, your life will be easier.

1258
01:37:08,732 --> 01:37:11,963
- What must I do?
- Do whatever is told you to do.

1259
01:37:12,135 --> 01:37:14,968
And I will manage for you
here and there as I'm able.

1260
01:37:15,138 --> 01:37:16,605
What had you to do, son-in-law?

1261
01:37:16,773 --> 01:37:19,241
For one thing, I'm a controller
of all incoming goods.

1262
01:37:19,409 --> 01:37:21,969
Rice and wheat, fish, opium, salt...

1263
01:37:22,145 --> 01:37:26,013
Opium? Opium? That evil was driven from
our country by great pain and suffering.

1264
01:37:26,183 --> 01:37:29,949
- And now you bring it back.
- But I'm not my own master.

1265
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,588
How can you be so hard?

1266
01:37:35,759 --> 01:37:39,422
After all, there are only
you two old people left.

1267
01:37:39,596 --> 01:37:41,723
- And we are all you have.
- We can live.

1268
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:45,891
You do well to leave.
We are not wanted here.

1269
01:37:59,383 --> 01:38:01,351
What our son feared was true.

1270
01:38:01,518 --> 01:38:03,645
Curse this enemy.

1271
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:07,051
He has made me quarrel
with my daughter.

1272
01:38:11,795 --> 01:38:16,732
See? Silk coats and enemy soldiers
to serve him.

1273
01:38:17,501 --> 01:38:21,835
It is plain Wu Lien
has got his fingers into the fat.

1274
01:38:24,307 --> 01:38:29,074
Of what value is a rich relative
unless you can put him to use?

1275
01:38:39,156 --> 01:38:41,454
We are his kinsmen
and would see Wu Lien.

1276
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:44,617
Go in. Wu Lien sees anybody.

1277
01:38:55,405 --> 01:38:58,533
Where are the rooms of Wu Lien,
our rich relative?

1278
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,335
In there.

1279
01:39:04,281 --> 01:39:08,047
What greater pleasure is there
than a short visit from relatives?

1280
01:39:08,218 --> 01:39:12,177
But next time, eat the fish.
Do not bring it to us.

1281
01:39:12,355 --> 01:39:15,483
Wu Lien, you're a kind, good man.

1282
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:19,151
Can you not find my old man
a worthless little piece of work...

1283
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:21,559
...here in these walls
to pay us something?

1284
01:39:21,731 --> 01:39:25,428
But will my father-in-law
let him come here?

1285
01:39:25,602 --> 01:39:28,799
My husband by right should have
more power than your father-in-law...

1286
01:39:28,972 --> 01:39:32,100
...because he is older.
And it is time he took that power.

1287
01:39:32,275 --> 01:39:34,766
Do you think the same way,
elder cousin?

1288
01:39:34,945 --> 01:39:38,642
- My husband always thinks as I do.
- And how's that?

1289
01:39:38,815 --> 01:39:43,275
I think we must save ourselves
at all cost...

1290
01:39:43,453 --> 01:39:45,148
...and bow before what is upon us...

1291
01:39:45,322 --> 01:39:48,018
...and do what we can
to make something of it.

1292
01:39:49,793 --> 01:39:53,194
Yes, perhaps you will be more content
to remain in the village...

1293
01:39:53,363 --> 01:39:55,957
...where you are known
and know everybody.

1294
01:39:56,132 --> 01:39:59,295
But you are welcome to visit us here.
We'll give you food, money.

1295
01:39:59,469 --> 01:40:02,404
And then you can give us the news.

1296
01:40:02,606 --> 01:40:05,439
We have very little to tell.
Nothing happens in our village.

1297
01:40:05,609 --> 01:40:08,305
Much has happened and more will.
Wu Lien.

1298
01:40:08,478 --> 01:40:12,346
My old man and I will be
as one eye and one ear.

1299
01:40:12,516 --> 01:40:16,885
And all that we see and hear,
you shall see and hear also.

1300
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:21,683
We always like to hear how you do,
and my wife's father and mother.

1301
01:40:21,858 --> 01:40:24,224
- And her brothers also?
- Of course, of course.

1302
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:26,021
They are also our kin.

1303
01:40:26,196 --> 01:40:29,757
But since they are away,
there must be little news of them.

1304
01:40:29,933 --> 01:40:32,959
True, true, they're all in the free land
and not at home.

1305
01:40:33,136 --> 01:40:35,536
Then perhaps I saw Jade
and her fat child in a dream.

1306
01:40:35,705 --> 01:40:37,969
Oh, Jade has a child, then?

1307
01:40:38,141 --> 01:40:40,666
Yes, yes, the news came in a letter
from the free land.

1308
01:40:40,844 --> 01:40:45,110
- But we've not seen the child.
- Child is a fine boy. Too fine.

1309
01:40:45,282 --> 01:40:48,979
Death sits on his eyebrows, I say,
whenever I look at him...

1310
01:40:49,152 --> 01:40:50,483
...which is often.

1311
01:40:54,624 --> 01:40:57,991
You live well here, cousin.
Your position must be good.

1312
01:40:58,562 --> 01:41:01,622
It is smooth on the top
but under it is another thing.

1313
01:41:01,798 --> 01:41:06,531
Our conquerors feel a rising anger
that may engulf us all.

1314
01:41:06,703 --> 01:41:07,931
How then?

1315
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:11,301
Too many soldiers have gone forth
from the city for food and goods...

1316
01:41:11,474 --> 01:41:12,839
...and have not returned.

1317
01:41:13,243 --> 01:41:15,677
Not even their bodies have been found.

1318
01:41:15,845 --> 01:41:19,042
It is a great mystery,
and one that may destroy all of us.

1319
01:41:19,749 --> 01:41:21,774
Even the innocent.

1320
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:26,286
Now, now, I will speak and fully.

1321
01:41:26,556 --> 01:41:29,787
The enemy is sure to find out
that the killing started in our village.

1322
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,621
Then what will our lives be worth?

1323
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:35,026
Wu Lien, we had nothing to do with it.
It is Ling Tan.

1324
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:38,531
Ling Tan and his sons. They are
all returned and work with the hill men.

1325
01:41:38,702 --> 01:41:42,468
- I've seen them and they are the leaders.
- The woman's blind as a mole and crazy.

1326
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,665
Not too blind to see enemy dead
piled in the streets and buried...

1327
01:41:45,842 --> 01:41:49,039
...in the hidden room beneath
Ling Tan's house where men and guns are.

1328
01:41:49,212 --> 01:41:52,739
Yes, other young men have died,
my son among them.

1329
01:41:52,916 --> 01:41:55,384
But not the sons of Ling Tan.

1330
01:41:55,552 --> 01:41:59,386
No, they still spit
and stride about and boast.

1331
01:41:59,556 --> 01:42:02,582
Woman, how can you utter
such lies against Ling Tan?

1332
01:42:02,759 --> 01:42:04,750
He has been good to us.
He has fed us often.

1333
01:42:04,928 --> 01:42:06,691
- Can you forget this?
- I can forget it.

1334
01:42:06,863 --> 01:42:10,060
He likes to give us small gifts.
It makes him bigger in his own eyes.

1335
01:42:10,233 --> 01:42:13,669
- Shall we thank him for his own pride?
- I'm not concerned with his pride.

1336
01:42:13,837 --> 01:42:17,364
- I'd rather have some of my own.
- And you shall have. I will see to it.

1337
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:20,065
When you wear a silk coat
over a full round belly...

1338
01:42:20,243 --> 01:42:22,370
...you will have pride in yourself then.

1339
01:42:22,545 --> 01:42:25,844
What use to speak to you of pride
when we use the same word...

1340
01:42:26,016 --> 01:42:27,813
...but mean different things by it?

1341
01:42:27,984 --> 01:42:30,953
Of all men on earth,
you are least like a man.

1342
01:42:33,089 --> 01:42:35,717
- Do not worry about that one.
- Yes.

1343
01:42:35,892 --> 01:42:38,725
He will follow me, or answer to me.

1344
01:42:38,895 --> 01:42:41,625
We will always be glad to see you,
kinswoman.

1345
01:42:41,798 --> 01:42:46,633
Another time? Another quiet little talk
such as this one has been.

1346
01:42:46,803 --> 01:42:50,261
Yes. Yes, as soon as we have
fresh news.

1347
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:57,540
My poor father and his household
walk on a rope above a pit.

1348
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:00,915
I have forgotten
the things we have heard.

1349
01:43:01,084 --> 01:43:03,075
Have you, my husband?

1350
01:43:03,253 --> 01:43:06,745
No, I have a mind that lets go of nothing.

1351
01:43:07,924 --> 01:43:09,391
Captain Sato calls for you.

1352
01:43:09,559 --> 01:43:13,723
- He says, bring the work you have finished.
- Oh, yes, yes. Yes, at once.

1353
01:43:20,203 --> 01:43:22,535
The Chinese people
welcome their good neighbor...

1354
01:43:22,706 --> 01:43:25,937
...who gives them food,
peace and safety.

1355
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:28,339
- It is a clever work.
- Thank you.

1356
01:43:28,511 --> 01:43:32,470
And perhaps it will help us
to put an end to all these killings.

1357
01:43:39,022 --> 01:43:42,287
I will put the poster
in all the usual places.

1358
01:43:44,527 --> 01:43:46,222
Chinaman!

1359
01:43:49,365 --> 01:43:51,060
Come here.

1360
01:43:52,969 --> 01:43:55,460
Did I not instruct you
to obtain information for me...

1361
01:43:55,638 --> 01:43:58,766
...about the disappearance of our soldiers?
- Sir, I...

1362
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:02,778
I have found nothing as yet.

1363
01:44:02,946 --> 01:44:05,881
Do you think that one village
is the center of this rebellion?

1364
01:44:06,049 --> 01:44:09,109
And if it is, how can we find it?

1365
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:13,517
Perhaps we should burn all the villages
and shoot all the farmers.

1366
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:16,659
Will that end this stupid resistance?

1367
01:44:16,826 --> 01:44:19,021
Perhaps, sir. Perhaps, but then...

1368
01:44:19,195 --> 01:44:22,358
...who would plant and harvest
the crop next year if you did that?

1369
01:44:22,532 --> 01:44:25,729
And if there was no crop,
how could your army here be fed?

1370
01:44:25,902 --> 01:44:30,202
- How would you yourselves eat, great ones?
- We thought of that, Chinaman.

1371
01:44:30,373 --> 01:44:32,864
We only wondered if you had also.

1372
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:35,169
- And so we are all agreed.
- Yes, great one.

1373
01:44:35,345 --> 01:44:37,905
We are agreed
that we must find that center.

1374
01:44:38,081 --> 01:44:39,912
- And destroy it.
- Yes, great one.

1375
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:42,551
- And it will be your privilege to help us.
- Thank you.

1376
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:47,554
I will have information soon.
If it is possible, very soon.

1377
01:44:47,724 --> 01:44:49,248
Thank you.

1378
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,792
How could we conquer a country
without its traitors?

1379
01:44:57,734 --> 01:45:01,830
They order me to broaden the smile
on the face of the soldier.

1380
01:45:03,106 --> 01:45:08,203
Do they not know a broader smile will only
make him resemble a shark the more?

1381
01:45:08,478 --> 01:45:10,969
You did not speak
of your new knowledge?

1382
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,109
I did not.

1383
01:45:14,284 --> 01:45:15,581
Will you ever speak of it?

1384
01:45:16,452 --> 01:45:19,319
As long as I am able, I will not.

1385
01:45:19,489 --> 01:45:21,616
But when you are no longer able,
what then?

1386
01:45:21,791 --> 01:45:23,918
How can I tell that?

1387
01:45:24,227 --> 01:45:26,559
How does a man know today
what he must do tomorrow?

1388
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:29,391
You are afraid. You are in danger here.

1389
01:45:29,566 --> 01:45:31,830
Where am I not in danger?

1390
01:45:32,001 --> 01:45:35,334
In these times, one chooses to live
in the den of the tiger or the lion.

1391
01:45:35,505 --> 01:45:37,200
There is no other place.

1392
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:39,568
And I am a man in the middle.

1393
01:45:40,276 --> 01:45:44,235
How can a man in the middle stay there
without splitting himself?

1394
01:45:44,614 --> 01:45:47,708
And if he does that,
he is only half a man.

1395
01:45:48,017 --> 01:45:52,477
Half. Can half a man still live?

1396
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:56,252
Here is our third cousin.

1397
01:45:56,526 --> 01:45:58,460
How are you, cousin?

1398
01:45:59,529 --> 01:46:01,053
What is it?

1399
01:46:01,798 --> 01:46:04,528
I should have killed her
even as she spoke.

1400
01:46:04,701 --> 01:46:06,464
Who would you kill then?

1401
01:46:06,636 --> 01:46:08,399
The female I call my wife.

1402
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,937
Has that woman been snapping
at your heels again?

1403
01:46:11,107 --> 01:46:13,598
Had I killed her,
I myself would have been killed...

1404
01:46:13,776 --> 01:46:16,108
...but at least our village
would now be safe...

1405
01:46:16,279 --> 01:46:17,712
...and all our kinsmen.

1406
01:46:17,881 --> 01:46:19,143
What is this, cousin?

1407
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:23,150
This is not easy for me to say
but I must.

1408
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:24,946
My wife is a traitor.

1409
01:46:25,388 --> 01:46:28,585
She has told Wu Lien all she knows
of what happens here.

1410
01:46:28,758 --> 01:46:32,091
Of the secret room
and your sons and the resistance.

1411
01:46:33,196 --> 01:46:36,063
Wu Lien, the running dog.

1412
01:46:36,966 --> 01:46:38,399
He must be silenced.

1413
01:46:38,568 --> 01:46:40,399
But he may not speak.

1414
01:46:40,570 --> 01:46:43,403
There is another who has already spoken
and may do so again...

1415
01:46:43,573 --> 01:46:45,370
...the wife of our cousin here.

1416
01:46:45,541 --> 01:46:48,942
I can say only this.
She will speak no more.

1417
01:46:49,545 --> 01:46:50,910
You have killed her.

1418
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:54,379
No, no, I did not kill her.
Although there was a moment...

1419
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:56,541
...when I thought she no longer breathed.

1420
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:57,947
I beat her.

1421
01:46:58,121 --> 01:47:01,454
I beat her until she leaned
against the wall to keep from falling.

1422
01:47:05,128 --> 01:47:06,789
What then of Wu Lien?

1423
01:47:06,963 --> 01:47:09,329
We must remember this:
He is of our family.

1424
01:47:09,499 --> 01:47:11,330
Our sons return
from the hills tonight.

1425
01:47:11,501 --> 01:47:15,369
They will know how to deal with him.
There is but one way.

1426
01:47:15,538 --> 01:47:19,304
I know my husband will see it as I see it
and be willing to do what must be done.

1427
01:47:19,742 --> 01:47:21,903
Would you have him
kill his brother-in-law?

1428
01:47:22,445 --> 01:47:25,039
Rather than have
his brother-in-law kill him.

1429
01:47:27,417 --> 01:47:29,783
I cannot decide this alone.

1430
01:47:30,553 --> 01:47:32,316
Come, cousin.

1431
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:34,888
It concerns us all in the village.

1432
01:47:36,926 --> 01:47:39,724
Can anything ever be the same again
even though peace comes?

1433
01:47:39,896 --> 01:47:44,765
Some small good has come of this.
Out of it, I am born a man again.

1434
01:47:48,204 --> 01:47:50,104
I must go to the city.

1435
01:47:50,273 --> 01:47:52,468
I read what you would do in your eyes.

1436
01:47:52,642 --> 01:47:55,440
- You are with me on this, Mother?
- I am with you, Daughter.

1437
01:47:55,611 --> 01:47:58,774
Women ever must act
while men waste time in talk.

1438
01:48:00,683 --> 01:48:02,708
The great power of this...

1439
01:48:02,885 --> 01:48:08,380
...is that a grain kills in a second
and is as tasteless as flour.

1440
01:48:08,558 --> 01:48:12,517
Many women buy this poison
in these times.

1441
01:48:12,695 --> 01:48:16,722
Some for themselves
and some for others.

1442
01:48:16,899 --> 01:48:18,958
How much will you need?

1443
01:48:19,135 --> 01:48:22,832
I may not need any at all.
I hope I do not.

1444
01:48:23,006 --> 01:48:26,237
But I will take as much
as I have money to buy.

1445
01:48:46,529 --> 01:48:48,121
Wu Lien?

1446
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:23,696
Jade. It cannot be.

1447
01:49:23,866 --> 01:49:26,096
How are you, sister-in-law?

1448
01:49:26,569 --> 01:49:28,332
This house is well-guarded.

1449
01:49:28,504 --> 01:49:31,769
But when I told them I was your relative,
the gate opened like magic.

1450
01:49:31,941 --> 01:49:35,604
Yes, they guard themselves,
but not against my husband.

1451
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,413
Why do you stare so at me?
Are you not glad to see me?

1452
01:49:38,581 --> 01:49:40,674
Yes. Yes, I am glad.

1453
01:49:40,850 --> 01:49:43,648
You look well, if not fat.

1454
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:47,779
I have not rested yet. I returned
from the free land only yesterday.

1455
01:49:47,957 --> 01:49:50,050
- Only yesterday?
- Where's my silk coat, I...

1456
01:49:50,226 --> 01:49:53,161
Here is Jade to see us. She tells me
she returned but yesterday.

1457
01:49:53,329 --> 01:49:56,492
Together with my husband and son.
And today, they still sleep.

1458
01:49:56,666 --> 01:49:59,464
Welcome, sister-in-law,
we're glad you are home again.

1459
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:01,626
The old ones have been too long alone.

1460
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:08,770
- Now, where is my coat?
- Here it is. Ready for you to wear.

1461
01:50:10,279 --> 01:50:13,510
My husband will be honored tonight
at a banquet for the conquerors.

1462
01:50:13,683 --> 01:50:16,675
Yes, and now I must dress for it.

1463
01:50:17,687 --> 01:50:20,053
Will not our women's prattle disturb him?

1464
01:50:20,223 --> 01:50:23,056
Oh, no, no. I will not hear it.

1465
01:50:27,497 --> 01:50:30,193
As I came through the city,
I found many changes.

1466
01:50:30,366 --> 01:50:32,493
My husband says
the conqueror prides himself...

1467
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:34,636
...on the public improvements
he has made.

1468
01:50:34,804 --> 01:50:36,203
Improvements?

1469
01:50:36,372 --> 01:50:39,273
Today, I saw enemy soldiers
pasting up a picture...

1470
01:50:39,442 --> 01:50:43,879
...which showed another enemy soldier
smiling and giving food to our people...

1471
01:50:44,247 --> 01:50:45,612
...who knelt before him.

1472
01:50:46,048 --> 01:50:50,644
That is my husband's handiwork.
Is it not good to look upon?

1473
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:52,378
Very.

1474
01:50:52,822 --> 01:50:56,383
Beneath the picture and looking up at it
stood hungry people.

1475
01:50:56,559 --> 01:50:59,289
And they brought bowls
and crept close...

1476
01:50:59,462 --> 01:51:03,057
...and scooped up some of the paste
that the soldiers were using.

1477
01:51:03,232 --> 01:51:06,201
And then they ran away
and hid and ate it.

1478
01:51:06,369 --> 01:51:08,701
Ate the paste?

1479
01:51:09,272 --> 01:51:11,001
Even that is better than nothing.

1480
01:51:11,174 --> 01:51:12,971
But the conqueror does give food.

1481
01:51:13,142 --> 01:51:16,373
He gives it to us
and there must be others.

1482
01:51:17,313 --> 01:51:19,304
Yes, there are others.

1483
01:51:19,815 --> 01:51:23,808
The enemy sometimes gives sweets,
and often to children.

1484
01:51:23,986 --> 01:51:27,945
Well, then, you must admit
that giving sweets to children is not evil.

1485
01:51:28,991 --> 01:51:31,960
Is it not? In the sweets is opium.

1486
01:51:32,628 --> 01:51:36,826
When once the children eat it, they have
the hunger that is fire in their veins.

1487
01:51:36,999 --> 01:51:39,797
And so they are spoiled forever.

1488
01:51:42,271 --> 01:51:43,795
Your own children look well.

1489
01:51:47,877 --> 01:51:51,005
He has learned the tongue of the enemy
very quickly.

1490
01:51:52,381 --> 01:51:54,440
Who knows what
he may grow up to say in it.

1491
01:51:54,617 --> 01:51:57,279
We will remember
our own things to tell him.

1492
01:51:57,453 --> 01:51:59,853
Then do not forget
to tell him of the other children.

1493
01:52:00,022 --> 01:52:02,286
And the mothers and fathers
of those children...

1494
01:52:03,092 --> 01:52:05,652
...all tied together and soaked with oil.

1495
01:52:05,828 --> 01:52:08,194
And burned alive
while they cried for mercy.

1496
01:52:08,364 --> 01:52:10,889
I will hear no more of this.
All the killing.

1497
01:52:11,067 --> 01:52:13,797
Tell your wife not to shudder,
brother-in-law.

1498
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:17,997
People now take these as things
that may happen to any one of us.

1499
01:52:18,174 --> 01:52:20,734
- And any day.
- I will get tea.

1500
01:52:22,311 --> 01:52:23,938
I trust I did not disturb you.

1501
01:52:24,113 --> 01:52:26,308
I heard very little.

1502
01:52:27,817 --> 01:52:31,719
Can it be that you have trained your ears
not to hear what you do not wish to hear?

1503
01:52:31,887 --> 01:52:33,548
You...

1504
01:52:35,024 --> 01:52:39,723
You must forgive my wife.
She is but a woman and not as we are.

1505
01:52:39,895 --> 01:52:42,227
I do not think we are the same.

1506
01:52:42,398 --> 01:52:44,866
I think you are against me
and all who are with me.

1507
01:52:45,034 --> 01:52:47,127
I am against no one.

1508
01:52:47,903 --> 01:52:50,235
Are you for us, then?

1509
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:02,447
I'm neither for nor against anything.

1510
01:53:02,618 --> 01:53:05,416
What you are not for, you are against.

1511
01:53:06,622 --> 01:53:09,750
You have changed
while you were away in the free land.

1512
01:53:09,925 --> 01:53:12,621
I'm not sure the change becomes you.

1513
01:53:12,795 --> 01:53:15,025
No. No, it does not.

1514
01:53:15,197 --> 01:53:18,462
A woman should be soft,
like the skin of a peach.

1515
01:53:18,634 --> 01:53:21,398
Not hard like the stone
which does no one any good.

1516
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:25,165
Do not forget that the tree itself
grows from the stone.

1517
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:28,242
Surely that is the beginning
of everything.

1518
01:53:29,145 --> 01:53:32,512
If I could see my parents sometimes,
I would be content.

1519
01:53:32,682 --> 01:53:34,707
Your husband is content
and so must you be.

1520
01:53:34,884 --> 01:53:38,445
Yes, I am what I am. And so is my wife.

1521
01:53:38,621 --> 01:53:42,523
And she is one who has always known
her place as a woman and kept to it.

1522
01:53:42,692 --> 01:53:45,286
Will you tell my parents this for me?

1523
01:53:45,461 --> 01:53:48,589
- Will you tell them I think of them often?
- Yes, she will tell them.

1524
01:53:48,764 --> 01:53:52,825
And now, if you wish to feed
your children, we will excuse you.

1525
01:53:55,304 --> 01:53:58,034
Will you not share some tea with me,
brother-in-law...

1526
01:53:58,207 --> 01:54:00,607
...although I am only a woman?

1527
01:54:00,776 --> 01:54:02,801
Come, I will pour it for you.

1528
01:54:02,978 --> 01:54:04,878
No. Although I thank you.

1529
01:54:05,047 --> 01:54:07,447
I cannot eat when I have
something on my mind to do.

1530
01:54:07,616 --> 01:54:10,483
My stomach growls and takes offense.

1531
01:54:10,653 --> 01:54:14,282
Surely you are a man who should
nourish himself at every opportunity.

1532
01:54:14,457 --> 01:54:17,949
Do not worry about me.
I will eat myself full tonight.

1533
01:54:18,127 --> 01:54:20,994
There is duck
and I am very fond of duck.

1534
01:54:21,163 --> 01:54:23,131
Oh, enter, enter.

1535
01:54:23,299 --> 01:54:26,860
Well, then, cook,
I trust everything in the kitchen is well.

1536
01:54:27,036 --> 01:54:29,937
You sent for me. I am here.
Do not waste time on idle talk.

1537
01:54:30,106 --> 01:54:31,971
Yes, I sent for you, but only to ask...

1538
01:54:32,141 --> 01:54:35,042
...if the food will be prepared
in fashion as I have ordered.

1539
01:54:35,211 --> 01:54:37,202
Steamed duck,
pullets with Chinese herbs...

1540
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:39,905
...pigeon eggs in soup,
and shark's fins with crabmeat.

1541
01:54:40,082 --> 01:54:44,018
All will be ready.
You have too many words.

1542
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:50,350
- Be sure everything is ready...
- It will be ready when it is ready.

1543
01:54:50,526 --> 01:54:53,188
- I am not a man to be hurried.
- Yes.

1544
01:54:55,398 --> 01:54:59,494
You see, we have plenty of food here.
More than enough.

1545
01:54:59,668 --> 01:55:01,659
- Will you not take some home with you?
- No.

1546
01:55:01,837 --> 01:55:05,534
Oh, but why? It will only be thrown
to the dogs. Why do you not take it?

1547
01:55:05,708 --> 01:55:08,734
Because, brother-in-law,
we are not dogs.

1548
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:46,539
Wait. You cannot enter.
Strangers are not allowed in the kitchen.

1549
01:55:46,715 --> 01:55:48,410
What is the...?

1550
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:53,414
Did you not send for someone?

1551
01:55:53,856 --> 01:55:55,687
A new cook, perhaps?

1552
01:55:55,858 --> 01:55:59,259
Well, I would not think
cooking is one of your talents.

1553
01:55:59,428 --> 01:56:02,761
How can you know that
until you have tried me?

1554
01:56:04,533 --> 01:56:06,194
I will throw her into the street.

1555
01:56:06,368 --> 01:56:09,963
I will do that myself. Later, perhaps.

1556
01:56:12,241 --> 01:56:14,175
Get on with your work.

1557
01:56:17,746 --> 01:56:19,907
How did you get into this house?

1558
01:56:20,082 --> 01:56:22,915
Is it not plain? Wu Lien sent for me.

1559
01:56:23,085 --> 01:56:24,575
Why?

1560
01:56:24,954 --> 01:56:27,616
Oh, you need not answer.
I have seen his wife.

1561
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:31,191
It is time to baste the pigs.
Get them ready.

1562
01:56:37,333 --> 01:56:40,894
Now, tell me,
why did you come into the kitchen, huh?

1563
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:42,970
I am hungry. There is food here.

1564
01:56:43,138 --> 01:56:45,629
Why, did you not get food from Wu Lien?

1565
01:56:45,808 --> 01:56:49,141
Wu Lien will not last.
He could not feed me for long.

1566
01:56:49,311 --> 01:56:52,644
Nor can I.
Chinese are not allowed in the kitchen.

1567
01:56:52,815 --> 01:56:56,307
But I am one who is of no country.
I am only a woman.

1568
01:56:57,086 --> 01:57:01,682
Can you blame me if I would be
with those who have conquered here?

1569
01:57:01,857 --> 01:57:04,655
- So you like us, then?
- No, I do not.

1570
01:57:04,827 --> 01:57:07,660
But I like hunger even less.

1571
01:57:10,065 --> 01:57:11,896
Oh, so you're not afraid.

1572
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:15,594
Can it be that I have found
a woman of my own liking?

1573
01:57:15,771 --> 01:57:19,332
- You will feed me then?
- Feed you? Food is dear.

1574
01:57:19,975 --> 01:57:21,499
How will you pay for it?

1575
01:57:21,677 --> 01:57:26,910
How? How else then
to make myself useful?

1576
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:31,041
Useful? Oh, yes, I will make you useful.

1577
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:33,745
Noodles, bring the noodles. Hurry.

1578
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:38,526
Here, you. You, bring the noodles, quick.

1579
01:57:40,763 --> 01:57:41,991
I am busy.

1580
01:57:42,164 --> 01:57:45,793
Stay out of my way until I finish my work.
Then we shall eat.

1581
01:57:45,968 --> 01:57:48,698
Yes, we shall eat together.

1582
01:57:51,774 --> 01:57:55,141
Alone and in private.

1583
01:57:56,245 --> 01:57:58,611
Here. Soup noodles,
are they ready? Come.

1584
01:57:59,648 --> 01:58:01,946
Where are the pigeon's eggs?

1585
01:58:20,603 --> 01:58:22,468
These are the fish.

1586
01:58:23,038 --> 01:58:26,530
Have you not finished yet?
It's almost time to serve them.

1587
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:35,682
Fine duck. Gravy. Gravy for the duck.

1588
01:58:40,656 --> 01:58:43,352
Mushrooms. Where are the mushrooms?

1589
01:58:44,493 --> 01:58:46,358
- These are not fine enough.
- The fish.

1590
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:48,826
Noodles. More noodles, hurry.

1591
01:58:51,467 --> 01:58:54,595
You fool. Do not burn the sauce.

1592
01:59:06,849 --> 01:59:09,511
The crabmeat. Cut it fine.

1593
01:59:18,027 --> 01:59:20,655
I have said stay out of my way.

1594
01:59:45,454 --> 01:59:48,423
So you have eyes only for the food,
not for me, huh?

1595
01:59:49,191 --> 01:59:51,921
Very well, if you are so greedy,
take some of the duck.

1596
01:59:54,663 --> 01:59:56,824
Go on, take it.

1597
02:00:04,206 --> 02:00:05,696
Eat it.

1598
02:00:11,246 --> 02:00:16,707
No. No, little one, it would be my head
if I were to let you have any of that.

1599
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:21,451
Here, now, take these.
Serve them while they're hot.

1600
02:00:26,395 --> 02:00:29,558
I have your own word for it, little one.

1601
02:00:29,765 --> 02:00:33,929
The hungrier you are,
the better it is for me.

1602
02:00:35,037 --> 02:00:36,470
Duck.

1603
02:00:37,206 --> 02:00:39,504
Duck, swimming in its own juices.

1604
02:00:39,675 --> 02:00:43,270
I went to great trouble to get them
and have them cooked to your orders, sirs.

1605
02:00:43,445 --> 02:00:45,310
The wine for the duck, where is it?

1606
02:00:45,481 --> 02:00:46,778
Wine?

1607
02:00:46,949 --> 02:00:49,417
Well, it will be served soon,
I have ordered it.

1608
02:00:49,585 --> 02:00:52,554
- Order it again.
- Yes, great one.

1609
02:00:54,523 --> 02:00:57,754
He sweats a great deal,
even for a Chinese.

1610
02:00:57,926 --> 02:00:59,723
He will sweat even more tonight.

1611
02:00:59,895 --> 02:01:04,195
We will amuse ourselves a little with him
before we make him talk for us.

1612
02:01:04,366 --> 02:01:08,666
Excellency, admiral, major, captain,
please.

1613
02:01:49,378 --> 02:01:51,869
Be patient, little one.

1614
02:01:53,482 --> 02:01:56,747
Now, they call these shrimp?
I asked for fresh shrimp.

1615
02:01:57,186 --> 02:01:58,676
Here now.

1616
02:01:58,854 --> 02:02:01,846
You would not be leaving
before you have eaten.

1617
02:02:02,024 --> 02:02:04,891
I was weary of waiting.
I would eat elsewhere.

1618
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:06,925
- You will not...
- Where is the wine?

1619
02:02:07,095 --> 02:02:10,622
- The wine will come later. I am trying to...
- That woman! Stop her. Stop her.

1620
02:02:10,799 --> 02:02:13,927
Stop her. That woman.
Stop that woman.

1621
02:02:14,102 --> 02:02:16,764
Do not let her get away.
Stop. Stop her.

1622
02:02:16,939 --> 02:02:20,898
- You. You frightened her away.
- How long has she been in this kitchen?

1623
02:02:21,076 --> 02:02:23,806
Why the difference?
A woman like that is too good for you.

1624
02:02:23,979 --> 02:02:26,174
Now neither of us will have her.

1625
02:02:26,348 --> 02:02:27,975
Was she...?

1626
02:02:47,703 --> 02:02:49,933
Call the guard. Call the guard.

1627
02:02:51,373 --> 02:02:52,897
Family.

1628
02:02:54,476 --> 02:02:56,307
Call the guard.

1629
02:03:19,801 --> 02:03:21,428
Chinaman!

1630
02:04:02,878 --> 02:04:04,607
What is it?

1631
02:04:07,482 --> 02:04:09,347
The enemy...

1632
02:04:09,851 --> 02:04:11,682
...was poisoned.

1633
02:04:12,754 --> 02:04:14,187
They blame me.

1634
02:04:14,356 --> 02:04:16,347
Go to your father. Take children. Quick.

1635
02:04:16,525 --> 02:04:18,720
- Quick, quick.
- No. No, I cannot.

1636
02:04:18,894 --> 02:04:20,555
Who did this?

1637
02:04:20,729 --> 02:04:22,162
Go.

1638
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:51,688
Our kinsmen are not agreed
among themselves.

1639
02:04:52,094 --> 02:04:54,562
Some say kill Wu Lien at once.

1640
02:04:54,863 --> 02:04:58,629
I say kill Wu Lien. Yes, kill him
and let me do it.

1641
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:02,759
Heaven will lead me to the place and time
and heaven will put power in my hand.

1642
02:05:02,938 --> 02:05:05,031
Do not say heaven this and heaven that.

1643
02:05:05,207 --> 02:05:07,675
If we kill, let us not say
it is heaven who bids it.

1644
02:05:07,843 --> 02:05:10,073
It is not heaven's will
that men kill each other.

1645
02:05:10,245 --> 02:05:12,873
We know better.
You lie dead with your ancestors...

1646
02:05:13,048 --> 02:05:16,449
...instead of living.
- How could you have borne such a son?

1647
02:05:16,618 --> 02:05:20,076
- How could you have fathered him?
- Wu Lien is of our family.

1648
02:05:20,255 --> 02:05:23,486
It is our one hope that he cannot
bring himself to destroy us.

1649
02:05:23,658 --> 02:05:26,183
But we must be sure.

1650
02:05:28,196 --> 02:05:31,461
My mother, my father,
it is your daughter.

1651
02:05:31,633 --> 02:05:33,191
I will go.

1652
02:05:38,006 --> 02:05:40,031
- Mother. Mother.
- What is it?

1653
02:05:40,208 --> 02:05:43,302
My husband is dead.

1654
02:05:46,181 --> 02:05:50,083
And so poison was put into the food
of the high enemy officials by someone...

1655
02:05:50,252 --> 02:05:52,777
...and they blamed my husband for it
and killed him.

1656
02:05:52,954 --> 02:05:54,751
- The enemy killed him?
- They shot him.

1657
02:05:54,923 --> 02:05:58,859
And he came to me holding
the last of his life inside him with his hands.

1658
02:05:59,027 --> 02:06:03,020
He lived only for his family,
and now he is dead.

1659
02:06:03,198 --> 02:06:06,190
- He was so good.
- I have been cheated of my pleasure.

1660
02:06:06,368 --> 02:06:10,498
You were there today, Jade.
You saw him. And now he's dead.

1661
02:06:10,672 --> 02:06:14,233
My husband is gone and I'm a widow.

1662
02:06:37,933 --> 02:06:39,992
Poison is a woman's weapon.

1663
02:06:42,237 --> 02:06:44,137
Yes, it is.

1664
02:06:44,306 --> 02:06:46,740
And it was I who used it.

1665
02:06:47,476 --> 02:06:49,171
I thought so.

1666
02:06:49,644 --> 02:06:52,511
I saw the look that passed
between you and my mother.

1667
02:06:53,248 --> 02:06:55,648
You said we must be sure.

1668
02:06:56,017 --> 02:06:57,917
I was sure.

1669
02:06:58,653 --> 02:07:00,883
He would have betrayed us.

1670
02:07:01,323 --> 02:07:04,486
I would not have killed him
had I thought he would not.

1671
02:07:08,163 --> 02:07:10,028
You did not kill him.

1672
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:13,494
The enemy did.

1673
02:07:13,668 --> 02:07:15,101
No.

1674
02:07:15,871 --> 02:07:19,705
No, I killed him as surely
as I'm now here.

1675
02:07:19,875 --> 02:07:22,275
And he was one of ours.

1676
02:07:22,811 --> 02:07:25,075
It was right that he should die.

1677
02:07:32,921 --> 02:07:35,082
And will you hate me?

1678
02:07:35,857 --> 02:07:37,882
Why would I hate you?

1679
02:07:40,262 --> 02:07:42,560
I am so thin.

1680
02:07:43,532 --> 02:07:46,695
My flesh is so hard.

1681
02:07:47,269 --> 02:07:52,400
My face is dark
and not like a woman's face.

1682
02:07:54,543 --> 02:07:58,070
You do not look as you did
when I married you, it is true.

1683
02:07:59,047 --> 02:08:03,006
Would you have married me then
if I had looked as I do now?

1684
02:08:03,185 --> 02:08:05,119
Doubtless, I would not.

1685
02:08:10,058 --> 02:08:13,425
But I myself was not the same man
that I am now.

1686
02:08:14,062 --> 02:08:17,156
And what pleased me then
would not please me now.

1687
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:23,631
- Do I please you now?
- You do.

1688
02:08:25,207 --> 02:08:27,767
As always, this feeling between us...

1689
02:08:27,943 --> 02:08:30,241
...we can return to it from anything.

1690
02:08:35,116 --> 02:08:37,016
<i>And then summer was gone.

1691
02:08:37,185 --> 02:08:39,517
<i>And the grain had kept its promise.

1692
02:08:39,688 --> 02:08:43,624
<i>Again, the old ones waited for the return</i>
<i>of Jade and her husband...

1693
02:08:43,792 --> 02:08:47,728
<i>... who'd been summoned</i>
<i>to the meeting place in the hills.

1694
02:08:54,669 --> 02:08:56,364
Someone comes.

1695
02:08:57,739 --> 02:09:00,503
It is our children, home from the hills.

1696
02:09:03,211 --> 02:09:05,236
- Well, then, you are back.
- Father, Mother.

1697
02:09:05,413 --> 02:09:06,937
- You are well.
- Well enough.

1698
02:09:07,115 --> 02:09:08,742
You are in time to help us harvest.

1699
02:09:08,917 --> 02:09:11,181
If we are clever,
we can pass this winter safely.

1700
02:09:11,353 --> 02:09:14,811
The crop is good this year
and the grain lies heavy in the hand.

1701
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:16,514
Yes.

1702
02:09:16,691 --> 02:09:19,216
This field would feed many people.

1703
02:09:20,595 --> 02:09:22,893
Father, will you call
the heads of the village?

1704
02:09:23,064 --> 02:09:24,793
We have a task for them to do.

1705
02:09:24,966 --> 02:09:28,197
A meeting? But there is a danger
in a meeting while it is still light.

1706
02:09:28,737 --> 02:09:31,228
Tell them to gather
at the first hour of the darkness.

1707
02:09:31,406 --> 02:09:33,738
There is a thing we must do,
and at once.

1708
02:09:33,908 --> 02:09:36,502
The enemy will never be defeated
if we feed him...

1709
02:09:36,678 --> 02:09:38,543
...but without our food, he will starve.

1710
02:09:38,713 --> 02:09:41,204
- I will not destroy food nor my house.
- It's too much.

1711
02:09:41,383 --> 02:09:45,342
- It's against the law of man to do it.
- It is the task the high command has set.

1712
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:48,421
You must burn all you have
and leave only the ashes behind you.

1713
02:09:48,590 --> 02:09:51,991
Can it be that you, my son,
ask this of me and our kinsmen?

1714
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:54,128
I ask it that the enemy may be destroyed.

1715
02:09:54,296 --> 02:09:57,390
Not only do we feed them
but we stay here as their work animals.

1716
02:09:57,565 --> 02:09:59,556
What we hear are the words
of a young fool.

1717
02:09:59,734 --> 02:10:01,895
I, for one, will not listen to any more.

1718
02:10:02,070 --> 02:10:04,402
I will not burn my house,
nor leave what I have.

1719
02:10:04,572 --> 02:10:07,097
But we... We resist here.

1720
02:10:07,275 --> 02:10:09,243
We keep what food we can
from the enemy...

1721
02:10:09,411 --> 02:10:11,402
...and we kill him how and when we can.

1722
02:10:11,579 --> 02:10:13,547
- It is enough.
- It is not enough.

1723
02:10:13,715 --> 02:10:16,149
- Do you not love your country?
- Love my country?

1724
02:10:16,318 --> 02:10:19,981
You say that to me? Do I not love this earth
and is this earth not my country?

1725
02:10:20,155 --> 02:10:21,850
Though I die, I stay with it.

1726
02:10:22,023 --> 02:10:24,014
Can a man love his country
better than that?

1727
02:10:24,192 --> 02:10:27,457
But, my father,
this earth is only your country...

1728
02:10:27,629 --> 02:10:29,426
...in peacetime when there is freedom.

1729
02:10:30,198 --> 02:10:33,395
I know only this. We must hold the land.

1730
02:10:33,568 --> 02:10:35,559
You will hold only a handful of dead soil.

1731
02:10:35,737 --> 02:10:37,762
You will lose
your whole country doing it.

1732
02:10:37,939 --> 02:10:40,533
- I will not listen.
- Ling Tan is right as always.

1733
02:10:40,709 --> 02:10:44,167
Yes, we will not leave our land.
We will hold it.

1734
02:11:00,028 --> 02:11:03,054
Now, what's wrong
with all these long faces?

1735
02:11:03,231 --> 02:11:05,028
We have failed.

1736
02:11:06,935 --> 02:11:12,498
Our kinsmen and our father among them
have refused our plan.

1737
02:11:12,674 --> 02:11:16,337
- You will not do as you're told to do?
- I will not, nor will the other kinsmen.

1738
02:11:16,544 --> 02:11:19,570
There's an answer. Hold a gun
at their heads and make them do it.

1739
02:11:19,748 --> 02:11:22,717
- It must be their own will.
- The old should be allowed no will.

1740
02:11:22,884 --> 02:11:25,409
The old and the new again.
There must be some meeting.

1741
02:11:25,587 --> 02:11:27,851
There's no meeting
what is dead and what is alive.

1742
02:11:28,022 --> 02:11:30,889
Father and men like him grow too old
and have walked too long.

1743
02:11:31,059 --> 02:11:33,425
Others need the room they take.

1744
02:11:37,766 --> 02:11:40,132
You may not strike me.

1745
02:11:40,735 --> 02:11:42,464
I should beat you.

1746
02:11:42,637 --> 02:11:45,265
Killing and love of killing,
that is all you know.

1747
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:48,170
Yes, but I know it well.
These are other times.

1748
02:11:48,343 --> 02:11:51,141
And I can kill you as well as any other.

1749
02:11:52,113 --> 02:11:55,048
Yes, you can kill me.

1750
02:11:55,884 --> 02:11:58,853
I think you can kill anyone now.

1751
02:12:03,358 --> 02:12:04,757
But I will kill no more.

1752
02:12:09,697 --> 02:12:11,494
- Come back here.
- I will not.

1753
02:12:11,666 --> 02:12:15,432
I've eaten enough foolishness
in this house, and for the last time.

1754
02:12:20,575 --> 02:12:22,338
I must go with him.

1755
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:28,574
You will find us in the hills,
for you will follow us.

1756
02:12:29,984 --> 02:12:32,384
Happiness in this family is over.

1757
02:12:36,724 --> 02:12:38,351
Nothing is left to anyone...

1758
02:12:38,526 --> 02:12:41,654
...if the old can no longer
look to the young for obedience.

1759
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:43,798
I have come to this.

1760
02:12:43,998 --> 02:12:47,195
I will not grieve the day they tell me
my third son is dead.

1761
02:12:51,873 --> 02:12:56,071
He has become the sort of man
I hate and fear most.

1762
02:12:57,011 --> 02:13:00,276
Such men will not allow peace
in the world.

1763
02:13:00,448 --> 02:13:03,508
War springs from them
as fire does from tinder...

1764
02:13:03,685 --> 02:13:06,176
...and is their pleasure in their life.

1765
02:13:08,089 --> 02:13:10,819
Such men should die for the good of all.

1766
02:13:13,027 --> 02:13:15,188
You blame your son for what he is.

1767
02:13:15,964 --> 02:13:17,932
Who should I blame, then?

1768
02:13:18,433 --> 02:13:21,834
It was his own arm he raised against me
and his own voice.

1769
02:13:22,203 --> 02:13:24,398
You cannot blame him.

1770
02:13:25,073 --> 02:13:27,541
Has his life been as it should?

1771
02:13:28,009 --> 02:13:32,810
Has he had peace to live and find a wife?

1772
02:13:32,981 --> 02:13:34,972
Have sons of his own?

1773
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:37,915
No, he put the will
he would have used...

1774
02:13:38,086 --> 02:13:40,486
...into another thing: The will to kill.

1775
02:13:40,655 --> 02:13:43,920
So changed from the boy who wretched
at the sight of the first dead...

1776
02:13:44,092 --> 02:13:47,186
...that he would strike his own father.

1777
02:13:48,162 --> 02:13:50,722
Well, are we not all changed?

1778
02:13:50,899 --> 02:13:55,063
Can we get our old selves back
if the devils are not driven out soon?

1779
02:13:57,305 --> 02:13:58,829
Can you?

1780
02:14:00,842 --> 02:14:02,309
You...

1781
02:14:02,710 --> 02:14:04,701
You hate to kill above all else.

1782
02:14:04,879 --> 02:14:06,710
Yet you have killed...

1783
02:14:06,881 --> 02:14:10,078
...as skillfully as you once tilled the land.
- I will not hear this.

1784
02:14:10,251 --> 02:14:13,084
But you shall hear it.
And our mother, has she not changed?

1785
02:14:13,254 --> 02:14:15,745
Now she runs, takes up her hoe
and buries the enemy...

1786
02:14:15,924 --> 02:14:17,858
...as though the human flesh
were animal.

1787
02:14:18,026 --> 02:14:20,995
Can she get back to the old way?
Can she forget what she's done?

1788
02:14:21,162 --> 02:14:24,825
And your sons, they all kill. Your third son
because he has come to love it.

1789
02:14:24,999 --> 02:14:28,366
Your eldest because it's the easiest thing
to do and my...

1790
02:14:28,536 --> 02:14:32,438
Your second son because he must.
But we all kill.

1791
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:35,041
We kill and kill again. Can you deny this?

1792
02:14:35,209 --> 02:14:36,471
No, no, I cannot.

1793
02:14:36,644 --> 02:14:40,080
I've learned to hold a gun and fire it
from the doorway.

1794
02:14:40,248 --> 02:14:42,216
And then go in and feed my son.

1795
02:14:42,383 --> 02:14:45,784
And what is the child eat into himself
with the food?

1796
02:14:46,621 --> 02:14:48,612
Look at him. Look at him.

1797
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:50,758
Do not turn away.

1798
02:14:51,159 --> 02:14:55,459
Even now your grandchild sharpens
his little teeth on an empty shell...

1799
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:58,531
...and does not hate
the taste of gunpowder.

1800
02:14:59,367 --> 02:15:03,463
He's young still. His mind, at least,
is untouched.

1801
02:15:03,638 --> 02:15:05,936
He can be saved
and taught a decent way to live...

1802
02:15:06,107 --> 02:15:08,371
...if the enemy is driven
from our country.

1803
02:15:09,978 --> 02:15:13,345
What will become of him
if this horror goes on?

1804
02:15:13,848 --> 02:15:18,945
How can I teach him honesty
when he must lie and cheat to live?

1805
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:23,853
How can I teach him mercy when
he must either kill first or be killed?

1806
02:15:24,025 --> 02:15:26,516
How can I teach him faith in mankind...

1807
02:15:26,694 --> 02:15:30,494
...when he sees nothing but distrust and
when even in his own family are traitors.

1808
02:15:30,665 --> 02:15:32,690
- Am I to blame for these things?
- You're not.

1809
02:15:32,867 --> 02:15:35,199
But you will be to blame,
we'll all be to blame...

1810
02:15:35,370 --> 02:15:38,669
...unless we defeat the Japanese
and drive them from this country...

1811
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:41,070
...and prevent them
from ever doing this again.

1812
02:15:41,242 --> 02:15:44,643
How will you answer your son when
he asks you why you left our land?

1813
02:15:44,812 --> 02:15:46,302
I will tell him...

1814
02:15:46,481 --> 02:15:50,975
I will tell him it was to save him
and his family...

1815
02:15:51,152 --> 02:15:53,620
...and his whole country.

1816
02:15:56,691 --> 02:15:58,056
You had no...

1817
02:15:58,826 --> 02:16:00,123
I cannot...

1818
02:16:01,295 --> 02:16:04,025
For a cloud covers my mind.

1819
02:16:11,706 --> 02:16:13,674
What will you do now, my son?

1820
02:16:13,841 --> 02:16:17,242
We will join our brothers in the hills
where at least we can fight on.

1821
02:16:17,412 --> 02:16:21,439
We will leave this house during
the last hours of the darkness before dawn.

1822
02:16:26,054 --> 02:16:28,614
Here is food for your journey.

1823
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:35,192
We are glad you have come.

1824
02:16:35,463 --> 02:16:37,727
It would have been a bitter thing
if you had not.

1825
02:16:40,635 --> 02:16:42,694
If you can wait, we will go with you.

1826
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:44,235
Go with us?

1827
02:16:44,405 --> 02:16:47,135
Yes, I will burn my fields and my house
and go with you.

1828
02:16:48,276 --> 02:16:50,801
Do my ears hear what you are saying,
old man?

1829
02:16:50,978 --> 02:16:55,847
They hear what we must do,
for the cloud is now gone from my mind.

1830
02:16:56,050 --> 02:16:58,314
I have spoken to all our kinsmen
in the village...

1831
02:16:58,486 --> 02:17:00,511
...and told them the things you told me.

1832
02:17:00,688 --> 02:17:03,088
I gave them the hour
that I would fire my house...

1833
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:05,088
...and asked them to do the same thing.

1834
02:17:05,259 --> 02:17:07,853
- But will they?
- I do not know.

1835
02:17:08,029 --> 02:17:11,192
It is a great deal to ask of them,
and against their natures.

1836
02:17:11,365 --> 02:17:13,890
But what will become of me
and my children?

1837
02:17:14,068 --> 02:17:17,299
You will go and take your children
to where my sons are in the hills.

1838
02:17:17,472 --> 02:17:20,964
- The son of Neighbor Shen can guide her.
- Yes. We will meet you there.

1839
02:17:21,142 --> 02:17:23,508
And you will take our son too.

1840
02:17:34,288 --> 02:17:35,949
These things will mark our land...

1841
02:17:36,124 --> 02:17:38,957
...so when we come back
we can prove it is ours and claim it.

1842
02:17:48,636 --> 02:17:49,864
What nonsense is this?

1843
02:17:50,037 --> 02:17:53,473
In a while, these things will be ashes,
so, what matter how they look now?

1844
02:17:53,641 --> 02:17:56,633
Would you bury a friend
without first arranging him decently?

1845
02:18:01,749 --> 02:18:06,413
In these rooms, your father
and his father before him died.

1846
02:18:07,054 --> 02:18:12,185
And our children were born here
and should die here.

1847
02:18:15,296 --> 02:18:17,230
I helped you dig once, now you help me.

1848
02:18:31,879 --> 02:18:34,279
- A worry has struck me.
- What now, woman?

1849
02:18:34,448 --> 02:18:37,440
What if the stranger who walks
on the other side of your land...

1850
02:18:37,618 --> 02:18:39,518
...finds these things and steals them?

1851
02:18:39,687 --> 02:18:42,383
- He will not steal from us.
- How can you know that?

1852
02:18:42,557 --> 02:18:46,755
I see clearly now, and for the first time.

1853
02:18:46,928 --> 02:18:50,125
Third cousin once said that there
is one sun and one moon for all.

1854
02:18:50,298 --> 02:18:52,596
If that is true,
all share the sun and moon...

1855
02:18:52,767 --> 02:18:55,235
...why should we not also
all share the earth?

1856
02:18:55,903 --> 02:18:59,100
This valley is not the world
but only part of the world.

1857
02:18:59,273 --> 02:19:02,731
And there are others like me
whose faces I have never seen.

1858
02:19:02,910 --> 02:19:04,810
Elsewhere,
there are men who love peace...

1859
02:19:04,979 --> 02:19:07,812
...and long for good and who will fight
to get these things.

1860
02:19:07,982 --> 02:19:12,316
So the stranger is no longer
a stranger to me but a man like me.

1861
02:19:13,187 --> 02:19:15,382
If I could but know him.

1862
02:19:15,990 --> 02:19:17,582
If I could but see him.

1863
02:19:18,259 --> 02:19:20,693
What good to see him
if you could not speak?

1864
02:19:20,862 --> 02:19:22,887
You would not need speech.

1865
02:19:23,064 --> 02:19:26,431
If what you wish is the same,
there would be understanding between you.

1866
02:19:26,601 --> 02:19:28,193
Yes, that is true.

1867
02:19:28,369 --> 02:19:31,827
Somehow tonight, I feel that there
is a power sweeping around the world...

1868
02:19:32,006 --> 02:19:34,304
...bringing us all together
with that stranger.

1869
02:19:34,475 --> 02:19:37,069
- And I, too, feel it, my father.
- So do I.

1870
02:19:37,245 --> 02:19:40,442
- Why am I left out of this?
- It is time now, my father.

1871
02:19:40,615 --> 02:19:42,810
- Shall I fire the house?
- No.

1872
02:19:43,951 --> 02:19:45,441
Your mother and I will do this.

1873
02:19:48,189 --> 02:19:50,919
We will fire the east field first, then.

1874
02:19:51,792 --> 02:19:55,284
Leave the north fields for the last,
so that we may escape that way.

1875
02:20:12,046 --> 02:20:13,445
Look back once, old woman.

1876
02:20:13,981 --> 02:20:16,142
Then look back no more.

1877
02:22:05,059 --> 02:22:07,050
Keep to the hill road.

1878
02:22:31,919 --> 02:22:34,854
My father, look.

1879
02:22:42,730 --> 02:22:45,597
Can it be even one of our kinsmen
is with us?

1880
02:22:45,766 --> 02:22:48,166
It is only a lantern.

1881
02:22:51,072 --> 02:22:54,235
No. No, it is a fire.

1882
02:22:54,909 --> 02:22:57,878
- And there's another.
- And another.

1883
02:22:58,045 --> 02:23:03,005
- Can it be? The whole village?
- It is, old woman. We are not alone.

1884
02:23:15,329 --> 02:23:19,425
- I'm weary, my lord.
- But you are not bruised as yet.

1885
02:24:17,324 --> 02:24:18,791
Why can you not come with us?

1886
02:24:18,959 --> 02:24:21,291
No, my mother.
My place is here with my brothers.

1887
02:24:21,462 --> 02:24:24,556
The enemy fears to come here.
My sister will be safe and have food.

1888
02:24:24,765 --> 02:24:30,499
I think it best. Our road ahead will be hard,
old woman. And our daughter...

1889
02:24:40,915 --> 02:24:44,874
My father, I have seen what you have done,
and the others also.

1890
02:24:45,052 --> 02:24:46,349
I am ashamed.

1891
02:24:47,021 --> 02:24:48,454
No more than I, my son.

1892
02:24:48,622 --> 02:24:51,284
Well, then, I would have you
take your place of command...

1893
02:24:51,458 --> 02:24:53,221
...as head of our family once more.

1894
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:56,987
I think there is now another command,
even above that.

1895
02:24:57,164 --> 02:25:00,463
We have each been told what we must do,
and we will do it.

1896
02:25:00,634 --> 02:25:04,035
- You that our young will stay here and fight.
- And you, Father?

1897
02:25:04,371 --> 02:25:07,238
I would be where these hands
can be used.

1898
02:25:07,408 --> 02:25:09,535
I and my old woman
will go into free China...

1899
02:25:09,710 --> 02:25:12,372
...and raise food to fill your bellies
while you fight.

1900
02:25:12,546 --> 02:25:16,243
Let us go, then,
while the strength is still in us.

1901
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:19,786
There is a thing.

1902
02:25:19,954 --> 02:25:22,923
If one of us lives, he must go back one day
to claim the land.

1903
02:25:23,090 --> 02:25:24,887
I so charge you all.

1904
02:25:25,059 --> 02:25:27,152
If you live, you must do this.

1905
02:25:27,328 --> 02:25:29,558
My wife and I will walk
a little way with you.

1906
02:25:29,730 --> 02:25:32,028
We would see you out of sight.

1907
02:25:45,879 --> 02:25:48,643
At this moment we part,
we are closer than ever before.

1908
02:25:48,816 --> 02:25:50,784
When will this one begin to read?

1909
02:25:50,951 --> 02:25:52,509
As soon as he can be taught.

1910
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:57,714
He will learn quickly,
for he is the hope of us all.

1911
02:25:58,292 --> 02:26:00,055
His eyes are open.

1912
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:03,958
Make sure that the one who teaches him
has his eyes open also.

1913
02:26:07,635 --> 02:26:11,230
We will do that. We do it now.

1914
02:26:11,739 --> 02:26:13,331
Take your grandchild with you.

1915
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:18,578
Yes, my father, take him with you.

1916
02:26:26,353 --> 02:26:28,651
Care for him and teach him.

1917
02:26:29,790 --> 02:26:31,087
He will be as our own.

1918
02:26:31,258 --> 02:26:34,659
What else? For that is what he is.

1919
02:26:38,866 --> 02:26:43,269
<i>So it came about that while Ling Tan</i>
<i>left the land behind him...

1920
02:26:43,437 --> 02:26:45,530
<i>... he did not leave hope.

1921
02:26:45,706 --> 02:26:48,607
<i>For he carried it with him in Jade's child.

1922
02:26:48,776 --> 02:26:52,507
<i>That child so truly,</i>
<i>the seed of the dragon.
