1
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,040
Muriel,
or The Time of Return

2
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,080
What I'd really like
is a chest of drawers.

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,640
Not much more than a meter wide,
to put between the windows.

4
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,600
If I can't find one,
I'll buy a Swedish table in teak.

5
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,800
I don't want to go too antique.

6
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
You're dealing with two different
tastes, mine and my husband's.

7
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,480
You know what I have in mind.
I'm depending on you.

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
I want it to be in good condition.

9
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
Good- bye.

10
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,160
You're so careless.
How can I sell that if it's damaged?

11
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,440
Didn't you hear what I said?

12
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
- When does he arrive?
- In less than an hour.

13
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
Staying long?

14
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,520
Please don't ask him.
He's old enough to be your father.

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,320
That's not the point.

16
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't hold his age against him.

17
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,160
He has a hard life.

18
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,240
- I'm going to see Muriel.
- You'll be back for dinner, I hope.

19
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,520
For the first night.

20
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,840
Where did you meet this Muriel?
Such a strange name.

21
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,320
She's ill now.

22
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
No, she isn't ill.

23
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,880
- Damn this stupid thing!
- I've sold it. It's going soon.

24
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,760
You never know which period
you'll wake up to in this flat.

25
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,360
- Was that the Paris train?
- Yes, it was late.

26
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,320
When does the next arrive?

27
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,240
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

28
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,000
Was there a man
who seemed rather lost?

29
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,440
I just look at the tickets.

30
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,760
Thank you.

31
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,400
Maybe he was delayed.

32
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
I don't know.

33
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,560
It's so easy to miss a train.

34
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
You should have known.

35
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,160
Don't forget your gloves.

36
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll look around.
She may be late.

37
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
Ask if there's a room here.

38
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
I don't know what to say.

39
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,880
Haven't you got any luggage?

40
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,120
It's at the cafe.
My niece is with me.

41
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
I didn't know you had a niece.

42
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,120
She needed a break.
I told her to come.

43
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
Quite right.

44
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Will she stay long?
Just so that I know.

45
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,320
As long as you wish.

46
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,880
I meant to have my hair done,
but life is so hectic.

47
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,800
- Let me look at you.
- Later.

48
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
This is Francoise.

49
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,880
Meet Helene, our gracious hostess.

50
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,160
- Are you a student?
- I'm an actress.

51
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,520
- A lovely profession.
- But rather wearing.

52
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,920
Shall we go?

53
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Do you have any change, Francoise?

54
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,760
Let me pay.

55
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,560
We'll walk.

56
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
I sold my car to a friend.

57
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,000
The weather's been ghastly.

58
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,040
The same in Paris.

59
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,400
We're nearly there.
The sea is quite close.

60
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,160
- Can you hear it?
- When there's a gale.

61
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,120
- You look cold.
- No, it's just the fresh air.

62
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
I'm glad to see
it's more than a small town.

63
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,960
You have no idea
how dead it is at night.

64
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,840
- I must get cigarettes.
- Where can we buy some?

65
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I've got some at home.

66
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,000
- I only smoke Bensons.
- You must make do with Pall Mall.

67
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,080
- I'd prefer Gauloises.
- I've got those, too.

68
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,840
It's raining.
I felt a raindrop.

69
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,120
It's not such a great journey
from Paris after all.

70
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,680
We often misjudge distances.

71
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,640
See, it wasn't so far to walk.

72
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,880
- All rebuilt after the war?
- It's a martyr town.

73
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Yes, lots of people were killed, shot.
I forget how many.

74
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,600
200, 3,000. I'm not sure now.

75
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Like me, you're lucky to be alive.

76
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm so moved.
I wanted to tell you...

77
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,440
I'll lead the way.

78
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,280
Excuse me, Francoise.

79
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,160
Here, give it to me.

80
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
- I'll walk up.
- It's on the 5th floor.

81
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,480
HELENE AUGHAIN
Antique Furniture

82
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll lead the way.

83
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm sorry the place is such a mess.

84
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm still moving in, after two years.

85
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,200
Everything is just like you.

86
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,240
- Make yourself at home.
- It takes me a while to warm up.

87
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,600
Please excuse me
if I keep my overcoat.

88
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Since I returned to France,
I feel cold all the time.

89
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,040
We could go to a hotel tonight.
Tomorrow, we'll see.

90
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,760
It's no trouble.
There's room for everyone here.

91
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,640
We will figure it out.

92
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,920
You cut your hair.

93
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
You used to have long hair.

94
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,480
- What will you drink?
- Whatever you've got.

95
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
- Any Schweppes?
- No.

96
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,800
- Muscat, Alphonse?
- Don't open it just for us.

97
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
You know it's no trouble.

98
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,960
Shall I show you where
the bathroom is?

99
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
How can we least
inconvenience you?

100
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,120
I could share a room with Francoise.

101
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,560
Let it be.

102
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
What should I call you?

103
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Helene, as everyone else does.

104
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Can I help?

105
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
Oh, no. I'm fine.

106
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
Oh, it's you.

107
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,600
Two of them?

108
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Did he pick her up in the train?

109
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,760
It's Bernard.

110
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Go on.

111
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
You don't seem to be pleased.

112
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,080
Go on, please.

113
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,160
Bernard Aughain, Monsieur Noyard
and his niece Francoise.

114
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,920
- You must be tired.
- We're feeling better already.

115
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,720
Bernard's finished service in Algeria.

116
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,720
- I was still there a year ago.
- We must have met.

117
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,600
Fifteen years I was there,
the best years of my life.

118
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,680
I , only twenty-two months.

119
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,240
A wonderful country.

120
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,080
The sun, the eternally blue sky.

121
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,000
- He looks like you, Helene.
- Funny, everyone says so.

122
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
We always resemble those we love.

123
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,080
To your health.

124
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,960
To your return.

125
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,320
When I think that Bernard
fought in Algeria...

126
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,960
Where did you live?

127
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,880
I ran a cafe
in the northern part of Algiers.

128
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,360
You know how it is. Things are
uncertain, there's a curfew...

129
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,400
I hear that
it's a draper's shop these days.

130
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
What was it called?

131
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,280
You wouldn't know it.
It was more like an exclusive club.

132
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,680
I was rather influential.

133
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,920
What is that?

134
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,360
Remember these?

135
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,920
None of your jokes now.

136
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,320
It's not dangerous. It's sleeping.
It will only wake up when it's warm.

137
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,120
Put it away.

138
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,360
- You're scaring them.
- I pick up spiders by their feet.

139
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,200
- It's his age.
- This isn't the right time.

140
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,720
- It's the only monster left.
- Monster?

141
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,160
I can't even touch a bird.

142
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,120
- I'm a Scorpio. Are you?
- I don't know. Lobster, probably.

143
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,960
It's very late.
You must be starved.

144
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,200
Sit where you like.
Don't stand on ceremony.

145
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Damn! I've lost my keys again.

146
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,960
This is your style, Helene.

147
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,440
I'm very fond of crystal, too.

148
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,080
Mind the plates.

149
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,080
They're very delicate,
and I've sold them.

150
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,720
Bernard, get the wine, will you?

151
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,520
There's a chicken saute
in a light sauce with mushrooms.

152
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
You're not on a diet, I hope?

153
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,480
He's crazy about Italian salami.

154
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Just like you, Helene.
Although you preferred Prosciutto.

155
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,200
Those were the days.

156
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,560
There's still some fennel
and red cabbage left.

157
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Please, have some.

158
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,800
- Are the shops good here?
- I stick to the same people.

159
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
You're miles away, Bernard.

160
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm going to New Caledonia.

161
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,160
Good idea.

162
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,520
Who gave you that idea?

163
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,240
- Who gave you that idea?
- No one.

164
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,520
Where were we going, Helene?

165
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,760
Near Estampes,
because of the mirror in the house.

166
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,800
It made our faces look green.

167
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,880
What a funny family.
We never went anywhere.

168
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,200
Where are you going?

169
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,360
I don't like chicken.
I'll cook an egg.

170
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,000
It wouldn't hurt you for once.

171
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,920
Bernard has a passion for eggs.

172
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,440
- Bernard, get the spoons.
- I'll get them.

173
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,480
Big or little spoons?
Nothing's ever simple.

174
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,280
It would have been easier to eat out.

175
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,120
Your poor mother.

176
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,640
- She's not my mother.
- Then who is she?

177
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,200
She's my father's second wife.
I was already there.

178
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,840
Oh, I see.

179
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,920
- Where's your father?
- He's dead.

180
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,200
I said it would have been easier
to eat out.

181
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
I'll look after you better tomorrow.

182
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,160
I had so many customers today.
English amateurs, connoisseurs.

183
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
They took forever to decide.

184
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,640
I'll help you.

185
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,920
- Do you like crossword puzzles?
- Not at all.

186
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,280
They make me dizzy.

187
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,920
Alphonse can't live without them.

188
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,840
He even had to buy a new dictionary.
His was all worn out.

189
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,320
They always use the same tricks
for two- letter words.

190
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,480
- His favorite cake.
- With lots of rum.

191
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,200
He can't sit still.

192
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,400
This is paradise.

193
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,640
No, thank you.
It's silly, but it makes me nervous.

194
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,080
It ruins my acting
when I do radio plays.

195
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,800
I end up saying more than my lines,
and I act poorly.

196
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,600
Besides, I have a very bad memory.

197
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,200
People with good memories
have a much easier life.

198
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,400
- The cake must be finished up.
- I hear honey is very healthy.

199
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,080
We're eating
as if we were in a hurry.

200
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,840
One always overeats
in the provinces.

201
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:20,360
My trade, feeding people,
takes all the pleasure out of eating.

202
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,840
Congratulations, Helene!
We'll come again.

203
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,760
I've never seen my uncle
so relaxed before.

204
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,480
You've transformed him.
He's usually so nervous.

205
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,880
- Me, nervous?
- What's the time?

206
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,240
Bernard!

207
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
I'll come with you.

208
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,160
May I?

209
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,800
Do people still swim in the sea here?

210
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,120
You don't seem to be
enjoying yourself.

211
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,960
- What do you do?
- You know, I'm back from Algeria.

212
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,920
- What did you do there?
- The same as everyone else.

213
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
Is that all?

214
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
What about now?

215
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,840
I'm back.

216
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,400
Is all this stuff for sale?

217
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,680
That's not for sale.

218
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,600
Pity, it would make
a nice paper knife.

219
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,440
What's your job?

220
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,760
- What is it?
- I'm looking for one.

221
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,440
- What do you hope to find?
- I'm just looking.

222
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,760
What?

223
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,160
- Do you read?
- A little.

224
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,480
I only read short things.
I'm too busy.

225
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,960
Why are you so busy?

226
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,080
If I was in antiques,
I'd deal in Louis XV.

227
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,400
You're not easy to talk to.

228
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,640
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

229
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,440
What are you doing here?

230
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm with my uncle.

231
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,160
Yes, why not?

232
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,320
Did you enlist?

233
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,120
Yes.

234
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,760
Were you unhappy?

235
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,440
Did Boulogne get on your nerves?

236
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,960
Shall we go?

237
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,800
Coming?

238
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,000
This place is an auction room.

239
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,840
I was an extra in a war film once.

240
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,200
It was set in 1830.

241
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
It was exhausting.

242
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,440
- I'd like to see you eat lemons.
- I've got the right mouth!

243
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,920
To the sea?

244
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,920
It's on the way.

245
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm not used to walking.

246
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,280
- How is your sister?
- My sister?

247
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
- Francoise's mother?
- Oh, yes!

248
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Francoise is my sister's daughter.

249
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,440
You couldn't have known her. She's
dead, like everyone else I've known.

250
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
I'm sorry.

251
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,960
I was so afraid you'd be disfigured
in the war, an injury...

252
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,400
I don't know.

253
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,160
In my dreams I always saw
your head in the shadows,

254
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,280
as if you wanted to hide your face.

255
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You can sleep late tomorrow.
We all do here.

256
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,680
That's good. I'm so lazy.

257
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,480
- We'll upset your routine.
- Not at all.

258
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,720
Well, how are things?

259
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
Very good.

260
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,600
People in the north
are supposed to be aloof,

261
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,200
but that's not my experience.

262
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,080
- Is it hard to find a place?
- Like everywhere else.

263
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
There's a small core of rich people.

264
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,280
A friend gave me the idea
of selling from my flat.

265
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,680
Antiques can't be well displayed
in modern shops.

266
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Concrete walls, large windows...

267
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,200
Selling at home seems the best.

268
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,120
People seem to think they're
getting family treasures for cheap.

269
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,400
I've gotten to know a lot
of households very quickly.

270
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,880
We should kiss, Helene.

271
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,680
Are you afraid of me?

272
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,640
It's all so much. Tomorrow...

273
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,520
- I'm always misinterpreted.
- That's not what I meant.

274
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,200
But we've become...

275
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,320
We've become...

276
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,320
We were stupid not to meet again.

277
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,360
- You work too much.
- I don't like to sit around.

278
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,520
Where the devil are my keys?

279
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,600
This table doesn't roll very well.

280
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,960
Let's not sit at the table.

281
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,800
It's nice here.

282
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,440
- Did you marry?
- Did you?

283
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,400
Well, I married Gerard Aughain.
He had a son, Bernard.

284
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,440
Actually, I think he loved me.

285
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,080
I was looking for security, really.

286
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,600
You're afraid to be the odd one out,
and you pay for it.

287
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,000
I've had no time to think of myself
these past few years.

288
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I've been really busy.

289
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm working 24 hours a day.

290
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,360
Not a moment to myself,
but I never get downhearted.

291
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,600
So you've been happy.

292
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,920
Often, you don't have a choice.

293
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,960
Let's not sit here.

294
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,720
I never thought you'd settle
in the provinces.

295
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,000
A seaport isn't exactly provincial.

296
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,720
Do you live in the same place?

297
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,280
I've always lived the same way,
in Paris or Algiers.

298
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Still, an extra room
would be welcome.

299
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,600
- Lovely palm trees!
- You would have liked them.

300
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,640
I always forget to take photos.

301
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,720
I can't believe
I'll never see it again.

302
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,440
I'm so conservative.

303
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,840
You were impossible.

304
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Those phone calls at all hours.

305
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,840
I didn't dare go out
until you phoned.

306
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,200
I was always late
getting to my appointments.

307
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,520
I cooked you lobsters
and had to eat them myself.

308
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,920
Then you'd turn up
just as I was going to bed.

309
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
You were furious
because I looked you in the eye.

310
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,360
I loved you as only
a 20-year- old girl could.

311
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,840
I'm curious to know
what happened after...

312
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,960
During the Liberation,
I loved a girl.

313
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
Do you mind if I tell you?

314
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,200
We have nothing to hide.

315
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,160
And I owe it to myself
to tell you of my life.

316
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,840
She'd had a terrible time in the war.

317
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,600
In September 1939, she was
abandoned by a good- for- nothing,

318
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,720
a braggart, unable to live or love.

319
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,000
He treated her badly.

320
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
It was her first love.

321
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,640
- I felt pity for her.
- That's our story!

322
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,360
- Not at all.
- Wasn't I abandoned, too?

323
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,360
- Let's not rake up the past.
- But that's why you're here.

324
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,480
To think that you didn't even
mention Boulogne...

325
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,840
It's unforgivable of me.

326
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,240
Our three days
at the Folkestone Hotel.

327
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,920
We ate sole, fish at every meal.

328
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,600
Yes, we got lost
by the cold storage depot.

329
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,960
I must go out.

330
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

331
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,440
- Are you disappointed?
- I can't help it.

332
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,680
I can't help it.
I must go out.

333
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,280
I was so happy to come.

334
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,040
Why did you invite me?

335
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I remembered some words of yours:

336
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,960
"If you need me, let me know,
and I'll come at once. "

337
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
- Did I write that?
- No, you said it.

338
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,640
You see how I loved you.

339
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Alphonse, this is
Roland de Smoke.

340
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,000
- He demolished the town in 1945.
- As a contractor.

341
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,480
Monsieur Noyard, back from Algeria.

342
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,160
Algeria?
I'd like to talk to you about that.

343
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,280
We are very badly informed
on this issue.

344
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,520
It will be a long time before
I can speak openly about that.

345
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
We need time to heal.

346
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,880
Roland de Smoke
once lived right here.

347
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,360
And then, there was a bombing.

348
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,680
He says my flat is where
his attic once was.

349
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
I'm ready.

350
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,760
- Where are the children?
- Francoise has run off, as usual.

351
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,920
Don't worry.
She's gone out with Bernard.

352
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,800
She doesn't consider me...

353
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,920
How old is she?

354
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,480
I don't deserve
such offhand treatment.

355
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,200
If we see them,
we'll say how worried you are.

356
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,080
- We're late.
- Don't be so worried.

357
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,360
I really shouldn't have come.

358
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,640
I was better off in Italy.

359
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,680
Well...

360
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,320
His hair is quite white.

361
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,520
Quite white?

362
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,960
Yes.

363
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,840
It's quite natural for him
to have white hair.

364
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,000
He is just as I expected him to be.

365
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,400
Although his eyes...

366
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,720
Roland, what's the matter?

367
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,080
I lifted the cover.
Muriel's eyes weren't closed.

368
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,680
It's war. Only civilians
can think as they please!

369
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,080
Then I noticed he no longer
washed his hands.

370
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,160
He claims the soap
is harmful to skin.

371
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,200
They have their revolution.
What have we got, back in France?

372
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,720
People thought we were engaged.

373
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,560
I began to see the truth with Muriel.
Since Muriel, I can't really live.

374
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,240
I'm lost. I think I want to die.
Anyway, I'm not afraid.

375
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,280
Poor Helene.

376
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:27,040
Anyway, he didn't come alone.
He brought his niece.

377
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,680
- Lf I received such a letter...
- What would you do?

378
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,720
You know me.

379
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,960
Disappointed?

380
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,080
Where is the sea?
It's disappeared?

381
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,320
It's high tide, though.

382
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,880
Is England straight ahead?

383
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
I was going to stay near Paris.

384
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,920
Without your uncle?

385
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,560
You've known since the beginning.
He is not my uncle.

386
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,200
I met Alphonse a year ago.

387
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,880
A boring story, after all.

388
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,720
- In Algiers?
- No. In Paris.

389
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,480
I met him at the radio studio.
I don't know what he was doing there.

390
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,600
Nothing, probably.

391
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,920
He laughed, so did I.

392
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,320
- Love at first sight.
- Could be.

393
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,480
He used to get tickets
for dress rehearsals.

394
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,480
He got me the part in that war film.
I could have kissed him.

395
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,440
He took no advantage of it.

396
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,120
I was the one to thank him
as he deserved.

397
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,680
It was only fair.

398
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,720
- Why tell me all this?
- Because you asked.

399
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,120
I used to spend
a lot of my time in cafes.

400
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,160
I was only getting
bit parts of two lines.

401
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,920
I'd had enough of auditions,
"We'll let you know."

402
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,760
I'd had enough.

403
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,760
Do I shock you?

404
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,320
No. I know how it is.

405
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,640
You're not listening.

406
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,760
It's none of my business.

407
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,200
I don't want to be unhappy.

408
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,720
I'm afraid that if I'm miserable,
I'll never get over it.

409
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,280
I wanted to be a stage actress.

410
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,920
You sound as if
you were applying for a job.

411
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,480
As a kid, I acted the role
of a woeful child.

412
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,000
With Alphonse,
I can relax and breathe again.

413
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,440
He's clever.

414
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,040
He's clever and elusive.

415
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
I'm well aware of it.

416
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,560
"Very timely," he said
when he got Helene's letter,

417
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,760
all boyish.

418
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,040
I must leave you now.

419
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,280
I'm more or less engaged to a girl
who lives near here.

420
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,000
I won't be long. About an hour.

421
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,600
I'll meet you at the Amyot cafe,
over there.

422
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,200
You're not spending the night
shuttling between her and me.

423
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,600
There's no point in talking.

424
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,160
You're very much like a boy I know.

425
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,720
Tell me later.

426
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,400
I mustn't keep her waiting, you know?

427
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,920
I understand.

428
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,680
Isn't this your scarf?
I found it in the roulette room.

429
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,280
Thank you.

430
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,720
- I took the liberty to run after you.
- Thank you.

431
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,760
Alfred told me
you were unlucky tonight.

432
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,600
A bad day.
My mind wasn't on it, that's bad.

433
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,120
I'm sorry, I have nothing left.

434
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,720
Are you married?

435
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,440
My wife is the blonde cloakroom girl.

436
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,880
So you spend the winter together,
when the casinos are closed.

437
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,080
We work on the Riviera then.

438
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,600
That must be nice.

439
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,520
I don't know. It's very overrated.

440
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,120
Can't you both retire soon?

441
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,400
We'll get divorced first.

442
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,320
We haven't had time until now.

443
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,000
- Is it all over?
- It never began.

444
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,240
When I'm older, I will do as I please.

445
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

446
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,360
Will you come tomorrow?

447
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,800
Maybe.

448
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,480
I've got relatives staying with me.

449
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,600
Well...

450
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,800
Where is Francoise?

451
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,000
She was going to see a film.

452
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,480
- What do you think of her?
- Nothing.

453
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,400
I forgot to tell people
where to sleep.

454
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,080
You could sleep
at the Borges' upstairs.

455
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,840
Alphonse can sleep
in the living room.

456
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,160
Francoise can have your room,
and then we'll see.

457
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,560
I'll sleep in my studio.

458
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,280
Be careful.
The ceiling isn't too safe.

459
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,800
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

460
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,560
I just saw you as I went by.

461
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,000
Don't go to bed too late.

462
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,720
- Did you lose?
- My luck will change.

463
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,560
- Good night.
- Good night.

464
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,760
You're back late.

465
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,960
You shouldn't have waited for me.

466
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
Where do I sleep?

467
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
That's right, I forgot to tell you.

468
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,680
In the living room.
I'll make the bed.

469
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,960
Something to drink?

470
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,240
Still doping yourself?

471
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,520
Not at all.

472
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,560
Just sleeping pills, that's all.

473
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
When is the train for Paris
tomorrow?

474
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,720
Pardon?

475
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,680
When is the train for Paris
tomorrow?

476
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,120
Forgive me.

477
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,160
You have few nights alone.

478
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,560
Must I make an appointment
to see you?

479
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,640
What about that evening in June '39,
your birthday?

480
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
Where were you?

481
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,200
We even looked for you
at your mother's.

482
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,480
And that Sunday when I waited
with the picnic basket?

483
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,520
Everything is so difficult.

484
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,520
I used to disappear
so as to make you want me.

485
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,360
It was silly.

486
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,480
I would wait for you to call,
to look for me.

487
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,520
I could see it all,
me in tears and you laughing.

488
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,440
It never happened like that.

489
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,760
And tonight?

490
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,000
It's nearly one in the morning.
We must rest.

491
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,480
Do you keep
the demolition man waiting as well?

492
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,360
What am I to you?

493
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,160
You don't mean what you say.

494
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,080
Am I supposed to be a reminder,
nothing more?

495
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,760
Isn't this the "come and see me
before I die" act?

496
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,360
I don't know
what possessed me to do it.

497
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,080
We are never really
in control of our feelings.

498
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,520
I could have chosen
not to write to you.

499
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,200
I could have played dead.

500
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,520
But suddenly,
I remembered your hands

501
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,400
and in the street,
someone spoke with your voice.

502
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,960
I turned, it wasn't you.

503
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
Is Simone dead?

504
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,480
- No. Who told you that?
- Who told me she had disappeared?

505
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,760
She's alive.

506
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,280
Stop her coming here!

507
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,880
- Why?
- I don't know.

508
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,520
Do you want a pillow?

509
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,800
I wonder where Bernard took her.

510
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,960
Did you notice
how he looked at me?

511
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,200
You're imagining things.

512
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,320
He only occupied Algeria.
What does he know about real war?

513
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,760
Well, you should understand.

514
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,200
Leave Bernard and Francoise
to live their own lives.

515
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,720
That morning, I went to
the one cupboard that hadn't burned

516
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,320
and found nothing
but white ashes inside.

517
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,960
Rain dripped onto Bernard's bed.
He was still terrified.

518
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,520
Aughain looked at me.

519
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,320
I took them both to my place.

520
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,800
The silverware had melted in pools.

521
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,480
Bernard wouldn't let me
out of his sight.

522
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,440
That's why he looks at you
as if he must justify himself.

523
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,000
It hasn't been easy, loving him.

524
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,640
Could I have a front door key?

525
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,480
I'll leave one outside
for Francoise tonight.

526
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,800
All these memories, Helene...

527
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,400
I resent you for them.

528
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,320
One o'clock already.

529
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,560
Is there a photo shop
open tomorrow?

530
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,640
I'd like to have a photo of you.

531
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,520
You know I always look
as though I'm blind in photos.

532
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,000
Must we be so formal?

533
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,040
Where is Francoise?

534
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,800
Are you all right?
I am so worried.

535
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,640
Any plum brandy left?

536
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,040
Francoise will sleep in your room.

537
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,360
I must ask the Borges
if you can sleep there.

538
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,160
You could have cleaned your room.

539
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,720
I already told you,
I'd rather sleep at the studio.

540
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,160
- I'm taking the newspaper.
- But it's not in good shape.

541
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,240
I don't know why you like going there.
It's dirty and dangerous.

542
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,600
Don't be so careless.

543
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,440
Just for tonight.
Tomorrow I'll go riding very early.

544
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,960
- Alone?
- Ciao!

545
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,280
- Is Muriel better?
- Who said she was ill?

546
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,320
Why snap at me?

547
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,520
Have you got a clock?

548
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,240
If anyone asks for me tomorrow,
don't say where I am.

549
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,280
Don't over wind it.

550
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,640
Alphonse?

551
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,240
Come in.

552
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,760
I can hear voices in the dining room.

553
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,040
It's the neighbors.
They talk all night long.

554
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,200
The plumbing carries their voices.

555
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,400
- I can't understand them.
- They're southerners.

556
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Why didn't you come
to the Globe d'Or?.

557
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,880
I wrote in September,
just after war was declared.

558
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,240
I asked you to come
to the Globe d'Or.

559
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,520
I never got any letter.

560
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,440
Of course you did.

561
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,120
Was that to be the end?

562
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,960
I wanted to marry you.

563
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,200
I asked if you would be my wife.

564
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,840
I waited at the Globe d'Or
until midnight.

565
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,800
I didn't know what to order next.

566
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,520
You're lying.

567
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,680
- I swear...
- Don't swear anything!

568
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,520
I mailed it at the main post office.
There was a Sunday pickup.

569
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,560
What's the time?

570
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,760
What's the time?

571
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,280
Quite early, about 9:00.

572
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,760
I had a horse once,
when I was in Australia.

573
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,880
Are you new here?

574
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,840
Yes. I like this place.

575
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,520
The police doesn't bother you?

576
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,360
No. I've got a license
to gather mussels.

577
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,240
Listen, you can probably help me.

578
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,080
Where could I find a mate
for my goat?

579
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,840
- You must know lots of people.
- Of course.

580
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,880
For my goat!

581
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,040
- Did Marie-Do stop by?
- I haven't seen her.

582
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,040
No, the Casino will close
for the winter soon.

583
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,000
Claudie, I can't explain
everything all the time.

584
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,440
Believe me.

585
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,680
Thank you.

586
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,000
Thank you.

587
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,840
I swear.

588
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,720
I don't know, Claudie.
Can you manage 10,000 francs?

589
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,480
I didn't realize what was happening.
I screamed.

590
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,040
Everyone's jumpy sometimes.

591
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,600
He looked nice.
He was more surprised than I.

592
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Extraordinary things
always happen to you.

593
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,120
You're cold. We'll go back.

594
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,320
I know your throat.

595
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,600
It's always easier to talk
outdoors, isn't it?

596
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,000
- What's this?
- That's a piloconte, sir.

597
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Ah, a piloconte.

598
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,240
I used to have a trout pool
for my customers.

599
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,960
I reckon you could do
with less staff here.

600
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,960
I'd like to open
an exclusive snack bar here,

601
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,720
a buffet for rich people.

602
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,960
Just what I keep saying.
Good- bye.

603
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,280
- It's a small town.
- You must know everyone.

604
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,720
You think you know someone well
because you are on first-name terms?

605
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,440
- Darn.
- What's wrong?

606
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,720
Does it show?

607
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,320
Not even a window latch
for me to salvage.

608
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,920
- Not even a window latch for me.
- No kidding!

609
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Is this a documentary?

610
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,520
Even worse.

611
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,400
You scare me.

612
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,640
Mind you, I'm no mover.

613
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,520
Isn't this one cheaper?

614
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,880
What are we waiting for to be happy?

615
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
What are we waiting for to party?

616
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,040
You're not sleeping?

617
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,160
Did I wake you?

618
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,160
- I dozed off. What's the time?
- About 2:00 or 3:00.

619
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,760
- I dreamt about you.
- You shouldn't.

620
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,560
Don't do that while I'm here.
Don't close your eyes, Marie-Do.

621
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,280
I'll take a bicycle instead.

622
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,440
I have another one.

623
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,760
Excuse me. Do you have
a Monsieur Noyard staying here?

624
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,760
Noyard.

625
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,320
Disappointed?

626
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,760
I got a letter from Transat.
I'm going to Montevideo.

627
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,280
- Is it certain?
- For three years.

628
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,800
It will go by quickly.

629
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,640
We'll talk it over later.

630
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,760
But I couldn't have.

631
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,800
We were
the victims of circumstances.

632
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,560
- But you believed her? Why?
- You were capable of anything.

633
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,320
- But you believed her?
- I did and I didn't.

634
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,080
Me? I'd want to see you die?

635
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,760
Nobody knew this woman.

636
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,040
I would cross the office I was
working at, pass the typewriter.

637
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,200
I would cross the courtyard.
I can still see it.

638
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,440
The shed was in the back,
with the ammunition.

639
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,240
I didn't see her at first.

640
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,520
I stumbled over her
as I went up to the table.

641
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,760
She looked asleep,
but she was trembling.

642
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,520
They said her name was Muriel.

643
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,520
It probably wasn't her real name.

644
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,000
There were five of us around her
discussing it.

645
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,240
She had to talk before nightfall.

646
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,960
Robert bent down
and turned her over.

647
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,360
She moaned.

648
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,600
She had her arm over her eyes.

649
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,520
He let go,
and she collapsed like a sack.

650
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,480
Then it began again.

651
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,480
She was dragged by her ankles
to the middle of the shed.

652
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,960
Robert kicked her.

653
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,280
He pointed a flashlight towards her.

654
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,160
Her lips were swollen
and flecked with foam.

655
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,960
Her clothes were ripped off.

656
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,680
She was propped on a chair,
but she fell.

657
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,200
One arm was sort of twisted.

658
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,240
Finish it!
She was beyond talking, anyway.

659
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,400
I hit her, too.

660
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,040
Muriel groaned under the blows.

661
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,720
My hands hurt.

662
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,280
Muriel's hair was all wet.

663
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,600
Robert lit a cigarette
and went up to her.

664
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,040
She screamed.

665
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,600
She stared at me.

666
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,400
Why me?

667
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:24,280
Then she closed her eyes
and began to vomit.

668
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,800
Robert sprang back in disgust.

669
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,000
I left them then.

670
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,320
I went back later.

671
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,720
I lifted the cover.

672
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,400
As if she'd been a long time
in water,

673
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,720
like a sack of potatoes split open,

674
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,720
blood all over her body,

675
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,920
in her hair,

676
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,240
burns on her breast.

677
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,040
Muriel's eyes were open.

678
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,840
I almost didn't care.

679
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,880
Maybe I didn't care at all.

680
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,920
I went to bed.

681
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,200
I went to sleep.

682
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,640
Early next morning,

683
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,720
Robert disposed of her.

684
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,120
Where is that boy now?

685
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,680
Walking around Boulogne,
like everybody else.

686
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,240
Like you?

687
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,840
Well, there are always things
you can't anticipate.

688
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,640
When you start to dig...

689
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,320
Me, I stay in my corner.

690
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,600
We would have had to hide.
You wouldn't have let me go to war.

691
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,120
We would have tried
to cross the border to go to Spain.

692
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,880
We would have lived
in Madrid like poor refugees.

693
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,800
I could have introduced you
to my family.

694
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,960
You always imagined me
to be an orphan.

695
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,520
My sister, my finishing school
friends, my dog Lucky.

696
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,760
Then, we could have gone
to Africa together

697
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,000
on one of those sailing boats
that carry oranges.

698
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,520
It isn't worth worrying about.

699
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,240
The main thing is for you
to feel at home here.

700
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,880
Look at me through it.

701
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,320
Hurry. The van is waiting.

702
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,680
Come in for a minute.

703
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,920
I'm not going to buy that table.
It's too expensive.

704
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,760
- Are you alone?
- Here, yes.

705
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,720
- You look pale.
- I'm frightened.

706
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,840
- Why?
- I don't know what will happen.

707
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,320
What more did you expect?

708
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,520
I wonder what I am doing
with my life.

709
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,120
Later I'll be my age.

710
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,320
Do I look my age?

711
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,000
You are in such a state.

712
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,520
He's cold all the time.
I know he can't help it.

713
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,720
His overcoat and cigarettes
are always lying about.

714
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,640
I'm just as bad, I know.
But still, I am mad at him.

715
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,320
Bernard sneers,
and you think I'm ridiculous.

716
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,200
No.

717
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,360
I should have sorted things out
by myself, not involve everyone.

718
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,880
I should have gone in hiding
with Alphonse as soon as he arrived,

719
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,160
just us two, far from here.

720
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,600
It's my concern,
but everyone pokes their nose in.

721
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,520
You're very unkind.

722
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,200
Love affairs are like dinners.

723
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Some guests behave. Others don't.

724
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,840
I should have worked it out alone.

725
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,400
I should have... I ruined it.

726
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,640
And this flat...

727
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,920
I wanted it to be
extraordinary and wild.

728
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,120
You need sleep.

729
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,480
That's just it,
I've slept like a log.

730
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,400
Hello.

731
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,080
- Is it 220 volts here?
- Yes. Roland was saying...

732
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,200
What were you saying?

733
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,680
- Shall we go back?
- Where?

734
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,000
We must go.

735
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,800
Can you see me with Helene
in ten years?

736
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,600
I don't see you with her now,
but she loves you.

737
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,080
That will pass, now she's seen me.

738
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,120
Do you know what you're doing?

739
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,360
I'm thinking of you.

740
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,160
That's easily said.

741
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,880
And I'm thinking of her.

742
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,640
But memories of you
come more easily to mind.

743
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,520
It's just as though...

744
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,320
- And especially those...
- Finish your sentences.

745
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,280
I know I'm not making sense.

746
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,560
Give me your hand.

747
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,400
We'll leave tonight.

748
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,320
I'll leave you in Paris.
We can't go on after this.

749
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:50,160
- What about me?
- I mean it. It's inevitable.

750
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,320
I'm late!

751
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,800
You know I don't like to run.

752
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,120
That's him, indeed.

753
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,920
- Do you know where I can find him?
- No, but Marcel will know.

754
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,320
There's plenty of time,
that's what's so marvelous.

755
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,480
It was here.

756
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,360
Poor Folkestone Hotel,
it's a crossroads now.

757
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,520
Madame Aughain,
don't forget that round table for me.

758
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,680
- No, I...
- Remember that buffet?

759
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,400
You promised,
but someone else got it.

760
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,400
- There you are.
- Shall we have a drink?

761
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,560
- I never go to cafes.
- Today is a special treat.

762
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:08,280
- I don't know this place.
- It's nice.

763
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,360
Him again!

764
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,280
- I don't want anything.
- You must drink something.

765
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,120
Two beers with lemonade.

766
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,880
Help yourself.

767
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,120
Thank you.

768
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,080
Do you see who's here?

769
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,880
- Then you escaped?
- I didn't escape.

770
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,080
What nonsense.

771
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,600
- I wouldn't risk my life.
- That's what you wrote me.

772
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,400
- You'd escape to join me.
- But where were you?

773
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,440
- The war separated us.
- I can see that letter now.

774
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,280
We can't rehash every detail.

775
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,600
Well, did we love each other or not?

776
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,400
Poor Helene.

777
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,520
You deserved better.

778
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,000
You did.

779
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,520
I followed you for an hour,
then I came up to you in a restaurant.

780
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,920
Then a young man
came to the table.

781
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,840
Hello, Madame.

782
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,240
Hello, Robert.

783
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,120
Has Bernard gone to Paris?
I haven't seen him about.

784
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,200
No, he's in Boulogne.

785
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,760
- Are you on leave?
- No. Discharged.

786
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,960
I was hospitalized in Paris.

787
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,440
I was ill.

788
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,160
I haven't seen Bernard for a week.

789
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,000
- Were you badly injured?
- Just a small hole in my thigh.

790
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,800
Do you still live with your parents?

791
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,200
No. How could I?

792
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,840
Forgive me. I have a bad memory.
I forget everything.

793
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,120
Never mind.

794
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,120
Try to tell Bernard to go back
to his old job, will you?

795
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,760
You must come to see us.

796
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,480
Oh, I didn't introduce you.

797
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,240
- Is Bernard there?
- You never know when he's there.

798
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,160
He's discreet.

799
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,800
Pardon me.

800
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,400
I'm going up.

801
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:22,720
- What are you doing here?
- It is my place, isn't it?

802
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,840
It's strange to see you here.

803
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,840
- Will you show me a film?
- I don't want to be a filmmaker.

804
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,400
- I'm gathering proofs, that's all.
- Proofs? Against whom?

805
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,360
You wouldn't understand.

806
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,840
Please go.

807
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,000
I'm leaving.

808
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
You've been back for eight months,
don't forget.

809
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,680
Muriel isn't here, you know.

810
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,880
Can you lend me 3,000 francs?

811
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,160
I'm only interested in Muriel
because of you.

812
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,960
- Bernard.
- What?

813
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,400
Well, was he there?

814
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,960
There was the Polish shop,
then the seed merchant.

815
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,880
No, the Spanish grocer.

816
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,160
First, the florist, surely.

817
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,760
Haven't you forgotten
the fishing tackle-shop?

818
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,120
Then the hosiery.

819
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,720
I don't remember that one.

820
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,640
No, they sold cigarettes.

821
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,360
What are you talking about?

822
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:59,000
I haven't forgotten my street
just because it was bombed.

823
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,400
I've had sugar.

824
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,840
You're very quiet.

825
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,600
I never go brown.

826
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,880
I go red.

827
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,560
Helene tans well.

828
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,160
3 - 7 - 9, a foolproof system.

829
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,360
Many systems don't work in practice.

830
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,320
What would you have done?

831
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,680
Are you all right down there?

832
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,880
Were you better off behind your till?

833
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,320
I don't know if I told you,
but I was the manager.

834
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,080
I paid dearly
for the right to live in peace.

835
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,400
To our cost.

836
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,800
We had no transistors
to lull us in the Second World War.

837
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,560
Why did you leave Algiers?
You didn't want to serve Arabs?

838
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,040
I respect all races,
even if I can't stand Arabs.

839
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
Finish without me.

840
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,320
Don't forget this.

841
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,400
You could be
a little more considerate.

842
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,680
You're right, it's better if you go.

843
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,120
You've changed,
and I know who's changed you.

844
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,280
Whereas you don't change.

845
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,800
The things they invent in the news.

846
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,720
I read today
of a prisoner in Indochina

847
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,760
who was released
five years after the war.

848
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,800
Alphonse loves the bizarre.

849
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,320
What can be done with him?

850
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,440
It's like my story of the subsiding
house, which you all surely know.

851
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,240
It's that tall building
which looks like a tool chest.

852
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:32,000
They went through all the planning,
a 300-page quantity surveyor's report,

853
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,800
they began construction
with a 1,000-page specification

854
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,520
and full insurance cover.

855
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,280
The building went up.

856
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,840
Every doorknob,
every timber in place.

857
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,840
The block was finished,
windows glazed, but...

858
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,560
It is slipping on a subsiding cliff.

859
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,680
So we wait for it to collapse.

860
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,720
It's new, empty,
and we wait for it to collapse.

861
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:11,200
It will be an ugly ruin,
concrete and twisted iron.

862
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,720
And not even a window latch
for me to salvage.

863
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,440
Not even a window latch for me.

864
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,760
They never serve us scallops
at the Casino.

865
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,080
Sometimes we have tuna or flounder.
It's a revelation.

866
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,120
- They're wonderfully light.
- Southerners don't eat them.

867
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,680
There's a wonderful restaurant,
Chez Adrien, king of the lobster,

868
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,320
next to the St Lazare
train station in Paris.

869
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,360
You see him boil lobsters alive.
You get used to it.

870
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,080
Like with eels.

871
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:41,480
If this cook hadn't survived
deportation, the recipe would be lost.

872
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,520
I'll try to make some like it.

873
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,360
Give me a fresh grilled herring.

874
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,160
With mustard sauce.

875
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:53,360
With a cigarette in his beak?
A man's not a bird.

876
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,440
- He's got an eagle eye.
- That's a strange bird.

877
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,200
I can sell you 200 windows,
95 assorted doors,

878
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,400
30 fireplaces and 150 used cars
in perfect order.

879
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,560
Also the marble staircase
of the old Folkestone Hotel.

880
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,240
- And the submarine?
- The navy wouldn't sell it.

881
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,920
And a convoy of trailers
and six plane engines.

882
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,480
Would you have a fur coat
by any chance?

883
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,520
Where are we going?

884
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,080
I'm taking Francoise
to see the trawlers.

885
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,000
I'll bring her back.

886
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,760
Good night.

887
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,440
Good night.

888
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,400
Good night.

889
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:44,240
- She doesn't mean to be rude.
- Never mind. She's young.

890
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,760
- But I do mind, Helene.
- Stop worrying.

891
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:56,000
I must repay you tomorrow.
I've lost the keys to my desk.

892
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,160
It's better not to be young
like Francoise, but like you.

893
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,600
Good night.

894
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:08,240
- Aren't you going home?
- I'll be back soon.

895
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,040
Are you going to the Casino?

896
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,880
Shall I come, too?

897
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:16,800
You wouldn't enjoy it.
I won't be long.

898
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,040
Watch out.
He's spoken to me about you.

899
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,480
Who?

900
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,080
This Alphonse, who has
invited himself in your flat.

901
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:38,320
- I have no illusions.
- You'll find him gone one day.

902
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,680
I've heard his story,
seen his hands, and I know.

903
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,760
Lend me some money.
I must have some.

904
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,720
Stop gambling.
He doesn't trust you.

905
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,120
We suspect each other,
that's the problem.

906
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,560
Give me 20,000 francs.

907
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,440
I'm holding a bond on your flat,
don't forget.

908
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,040
I know, my sweet.
It's good business for you.

909
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,960
- Your Alphonse is afraid.
- We're all afraid.

910
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,480
Yes, but fear makes you forget.

911
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,480
You know how much I loved him.

912
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,840
Good night, Claudie.

913
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,360
Thank you.

914
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,640
Hello.

915
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,480
Hello.

916
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,560
It is you, Alphonse.

917
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,000
Is it you, Alphonse?
This is Ernest.

918
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,840
Hello?

919
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,400
Hello?

920
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,320
- Did you lose?
- Why?

921
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,520
What's wrong?

922
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,120
I don't want to blame you,
but you must admit...

923
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,960
Did I hurt you?

924
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,080
We must leave.

925
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,080
Why didn't you go to bed?

926
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:26,000
I never know what's on your mind.
It is as if you forget I'm here.

927
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:33,680
The forest,
trees without birds, rain.

928
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,600
You're gathering twigs,
making a pile of them, lighting it.

929
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,200
You tend the smoldering wood.

930
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,600
An hour later, the wood is blazing
in the rain, you get lost in a frenzy.

931
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,640
You run to tend to the fire, you dance
around it, carrying me along.

932
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,920
Darling, you're soaked to the skin.
You're so reckless.

933
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,560
That day I knew I loved you.

934
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,080
It's hard to follow you.

935
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,480
Helene?

936
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,840
I tried to kill myself.

937
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,480
Today?

938
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,120
Of course not.
You know when it was.

939
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,840
I still bear the scar.

940
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,000
You went to a meeting.

941
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,680
You never asked me any questions.

942
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,800
You don't care.

943
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:03,840
How often did you pretend to die,
bringing Simone running?

944
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,160
I can't help it if I have a hard life.

945
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,760
Don't answer it.

946
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,680
Why did you invite me?

947
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:31,400
We'll have lunch at home tomorrow.
We'll invite Claudie. It will be fun.

948
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,960
Helene.

949
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,480
We're back.

950
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,040
I'll get it.

951
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,880
Yes?

952
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,800
Yes.

953
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,040
Yes, one moment.
For you, Alphonse.

954
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,720
Yes, this is.

955
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,040
No, certainly not.

956
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,680
Where are you?

957
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,800
Certainly not. I'll come.

958
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,680
A liner has run aground,
all lights blazing!

959
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,760
It's fantastic!
It looks like a carnival float!

960
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,240
What a sight!
It's so close, you could swim to it!

961
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,400
Is it for television?

962
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,000
A beer.

963
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,720
What are you doing?

964
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,160
Hiding away?

965
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,160
No.

966
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,960
You don't come around anymore.

967
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,680
Not in bed yet?

968
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,400
I go to bed late now.

969
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,360
For a change.

970
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,440
Two Saint-Jacques.

971
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,880
- Alphonse.
- Shut up.

972
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,360
I know that boy.

973
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:13,920
- Helene said you should...
- Go back to my old job, I know.

974
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:17,320
You were supposed to be here
two days looking for a job.

975
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,080
You disappeared.

976
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,760
Simone's frantic.

977
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,520
- What about our plans?
- All off.

978
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,280
- But we agreed...
- That's all past.

979
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,520
I look around all day.

980
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,600
I've got an interview tomorrow.

981
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,240
What is courage?

982
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,480
You wouldn't know.

983
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,600
Who is this Aughain woman
you're staying with?

984
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,000
I'm taking you home tomorrow.

985
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
You and your camera!

986
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,360
What do you expect to film at night?

987
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,120
Give me two more days.
I'm expecting an answer.

988
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,120
I know what I'm doing.

989
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,280
Call Simone.
She just wants to hear from you.

990
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,280
You want to tell Muriel's story?

991
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,480
- It's impossible.
- Shut up about Muriel!

992
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,960
Two more days.

993
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,560
Call Simone. Don't let me down.
Have you got money?

994
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,720
It's a trap, really.

995
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,040
You dramatize everything.

996
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,160
You're right.

997
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:37,200
You must go.

998
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,600
Roland? It's me, Helene.

999
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,880
No. I'm frightened.

1000
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,960
What shall I do?

1001
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,600
You had blocked your door.

1002
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:08,280
You lived in a dressing gown
and ate yogurt.

1003
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,240
Marie-Do, don't close your eyes.

1004
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,640
Bernard!

1005
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,000
You should film that stranded boat.
It's like a monster.

1006
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,760
Muriel, come here at once!

1007
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:53,040
Some people attract stains
more than others. I'm one of them.

1008
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,880
Good- bye.

1009
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,640
Robert followed me.

1010
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,720
I'm sure he's after me.

1011
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,120
I'm afraid.

1012
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:06,160
- Are you sure?
- You don't know him!

1013
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,400
You're right. I'll talk to him.

1014
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,520
Marie-Do, it's so easy
to be happy with you.

1015
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,560
Listen, Claudie, I'll give you half
tomorrow, I promise.

1016
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,320
I think it would be best if you left.

1017
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,680
Wouldn't it be more convenient
if I stayed?

1018
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,640
Where's the town centre?

1019
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,040
This is it.

1020
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,120
I'll stay in a hotel
until you're ready to leave.

1021
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,040
Why?

1022
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,600
I'm sorry I've met Helene.

1023
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,720
Mireille's trying to find
a complete edition for him.

1024
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,440
Algeria is all over for us.

1025
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,920
The loudspeaker cars, the public
speeches, the leaflets, all gone.

1026
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,440
We're in France.

1027
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,720
The main thing is for every
Frenchman to feel alone, scared.

1028
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,720
He'll erect barbed wire
around his little ego.

1029
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,960
He doesn't want trouble,
so let's keep him guessing.

1030
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,520
- Do you enjoy the situation?
- You bet.

1031
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,880
Are you still on about Muriel?

1032
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,800
Is that your trouble?

1033
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,400
What about the amnesty?

1034
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,640
The others should hide, not us.

1035
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,560
- Worried about me?
- No, but you're still in a mess.

1036
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,960
Do you want to die?

1037
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,080
Why say that?

1038
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,080
- Don't trust that little Marie-Do.
- You're a bastard.

1039
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,720
Good evening.

1040
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,600
You know everyone!

1041
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,240
Don't wait for tomorrow!
Enter today!

1042
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,320
Enter our great contest
"The Future is Ours"!

1043
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,880
That's where I used to live.

1044
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,400
I miss you, Helene.

1045
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,080
We'll bring you oranges!

1046
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,160
I couldn't come yesterday.

1047
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,880
Never mind. I managed.

1048
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,320
- A woman was asking for you.
- Young?

1049
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,000
She looked like a Parisian.

1050
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,720
- Any message?
- She seemed in a hurry.

1051
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,000
Hello. Monsieur Noyard, please.

1052
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,720
He's out. Who's calling?

1053
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,280
Parting is so final.

1054
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,080
No, it isn't,
or people would never part.

1055
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,000
If you leave,
I'll never see you again.

1056
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,400
I wouldn't leave if I thought that.

1057
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:43,240
- Lf you leave, you won't see me again.
- You don't mean that.

1058
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,880
It's a country house.
We want to keep its style.

1059
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,360
- It hasn't got any style, really.
- Well, it's old.

1060
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,920
I've got just the right wardrobe.

1061
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,720
I'm sorry, my husband's asleep.

1062
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,920
He has a weak heart.

1063
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,720
Anyway, I don't have it all here.

1064
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,120
Can I take you to see
some furniture tomorrow?

1065
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,600
- Can one mix styles?
- Certainly.

1066
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,240
Have you got a painting
of some charming ruins?

1067
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,680
Or, rather,
a cliff with little temples?

1068
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,880
With jolly fisher folk
and lots of sky?

1069
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,960
We'll call again.

1070
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,240
I'll show you out.

1071
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,400
Thank you.

1072
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,920
It's nice to soak up the past,
especially in this town.

1073
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,080
- They saw you on my bed.
- I was doing nothing wrong.

1074
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,720
Somehow, I've been able
to sleep again in your house.

1075
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,640
I've fixed up a bedside lamp,
so you won't strain your eyes.

1076
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,000
- No one's watching.
- Let me finish.

1077
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,840
Finish what?

1078
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,320
You asked me to come here.

1079
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,160
I hurried without a thought.

1080
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,120
With you , one never knows
the right moment.

1081
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:11,000
Alphonse, can't we be done
with the past?

1082
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:11,960
We are.

1083
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,200
It's nice to think it's a
common enough story, really.

1084
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:24,080
It's amazing, you think you know
someone you love.

1085
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:30,440
But you're wrong.
Every person is a private world.

1086
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,960
I hope you'll need me
for years to come.

1087
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,920
- Will you need me for a long time?
- Always, I hope.

1088
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,600
I bet you've been through my things.

1089
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,480
- Looking for what?
- Just looking.

1090
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,080
- I wanted to marry you.
- Don't be idiotic.

1091
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,800
It's difficult enough living with you.

1092
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,120
- With me?
- Near you.

1093
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,280
You've touched my tape recorder.

1094
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,520
I only moved it to make room.

1095
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,800
What's on the tape?
Secrets? Confessions?

1096
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,800
I've had enough of this dump
that feeds on memories.

1097
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,080
What a family!
And now you slap me!

1098
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,520
A pair of ancient lovebirds.

1099
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,440
- And you, you're crazy!
- That's possible.

1100
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,960
I let everyone know when I'm fed up.

1101
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,920
Don't worry about me.

1102
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,120
I'm going.

1103
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,320
You can stay.

1104
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,480
A bar of Chocoreve.

1105
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,560
I could have sworn
you were Mrs. Clore's daughter.

1106
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,080
I'm often mistaken for someone else.

1107
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,280
Bring me the napkins, over there.

1108
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,160
Hold them flat.

1109
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,880
Linen creases very easily.

1110
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,560
Thank you.

1111
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,800
When are we leaving?

1112
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,480
You said we were leaving.

1113
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,080
I can't do that to Helene.
She's so considerate.

1114
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:31,240
We could wait a day or two.
Time to let her know.

1115
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,920
Did you really love Helene?

1116
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,000
Did she love you?

1117
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,080
How do you expect me
to answer that?

1118
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,000
Yet she invited you back.

1119
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,240
She needs to have
her world around her.

1120
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,560
Alphonse, how you've aged
in a few days.

1121
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,880
If we met now,
I'd help you cross the street.

1122
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,320
I'm going to leave.

1123
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,080
Are you mad?

1124
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,120
I'm changing the reel.

1125
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,400
Too late now.

1126
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,320
Are you making yourself useful?

1127
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,360
We must help Helene.

1128
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,920
Why stare at me?

1129
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,200
I'm trying to picture you in Algeria.

1130
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,440
I'll talk to you when I'm dressed.

1131
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,480
I'm not afraid.

1132
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,520
Good. The children
will dance at the wedding.

1133
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,920
I'll buy you
a ticket for Paris tomorrow.

1134
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,920
Why not tonight? I'm packed.

1135
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,720
I wouldn't like to be you.

1136
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,080
I put an end to things very quickly.

1137
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,480
Easily said.

1138
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:48,600
- Eavesdropping?
- I'm waiting outside my door.

1139
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,840
Don't take it out on the azalea.

1140
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,600
Visitors don't seem to please you.

1141
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,920
Is it normal to stroll around all day?

1142
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,040
Is it normal for Alphonse
to meet so many people?

1143
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,480
Is it normal to go through our things?

1144
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,960
He doesn't even have the guts
to defend his opinions.

1145
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,760
I know what I'm talking about.

1146
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:34,960
I've watched him in cafes,
buying drinks for ready listeners.

1147
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:39,520
He goes into all the cake shops,
as if half-starved.

1148
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,680
- Don't you know?
- Are you finished?

1149
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,360
Are you beyond reproach?

1150
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,240
Haven't I been indulgent enough?

1151
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,520
My brooch, it disappeared ages ago.

1152
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,360
I didn't sell it.

1153
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,880
Here it is.

1154
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,320
Bernard, what does this mean?

1155
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,160
I'm moving to the studio.

1156
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,840
We'll get on better apart.

1157
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:23,200
It's too bad, you're always late.

1158
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,200
Watch out!

1159
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,360
- Hello, Claudie!
- Hello! Do you know Marc?

1160
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,400
- No. Hello.
- I'll lead the way.

1161
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,960
Hello.
I've brought Marc, do you mind?

1162
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,400
Another cactus?

1163
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,680
- Where can I put this?
- In the kitchen.

1164
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,440
I found a hairdryer,
did I tell you?

1165
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,560
Excuse me.

1166
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:51,800
Poor Marc, he was like a lost soul.

1167
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:56,200
Here is what I brought.
There's mayonnaise.

1168
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:03,800
Lobster, cold meats,
cheese and pickles.

1169
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,480
Helene, Champagne!
Remember that day?

1170
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:11,160
The restaurant where
I ordered people to stop eating?

1171
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,360
One woman offered me a ring.
She took us for thieves.

1172
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,840
We were so drunk!
The car ended up in a pond.

1173
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,480
We had missed the road.
The wheels were covered in grass.

1174
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,200
Where's Bernard?

1175
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,840
I thought everyone had forgotten
how to laugh.

1176
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,680
Let's make punch!

1177
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,800
Remember that punch at the Casino?

1178
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,320
You never told me where
you wandered off to, afterwards.

1179
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,160
Phone for you.

1180
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,640
- I'm not here.
- Tell him yourself.

1181
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,120
I'll say that you're out.

1182
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,120
Hello. Mr. Noyard isn't here.

1183
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:55,640
It must be hard for an actress
in the provinces to be discovered,

1184
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,680
even in Paris.

1185
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,840
I gave Patachou a manicure.
She looks younger in person.

1186
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,360
She's not bad.

1187
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,040
She's very good!

1188
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,240
No, she's not bad.

1189
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:12,200
He hung up.
But I can't believe it.

1190
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,680
It was Ernest's voice.

1191
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,480
I stopped, I looked at him, and I told
Francoise, "That's him, indeed."

1192
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,520
He was dressed
in a ski outfit, in June.

1193
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,560
I asked him what he was up to.
You'll never guess his reply.

1194
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:30,600
"I'm going skiing on pine needles.
It's better than snow."

1195
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,720
Record us on your tape recorder.

1196
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,800
It's very funny.
I never recognize my voice.

1197
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,320
It's broken.

1198
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,960
Tape recorders
are too personal, too fragile.

1199
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:47,720
I had a big one in Algiers.
I recorded music on the radio.

1200
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,320
It must have been lively
at your place.

1201
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,240
Yes, very lively.

1202
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,840
Well, as lively as one could be
down there.

1203
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,880
I won my trip to London.
You lost the bet, pay up!

1204
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,200
I can't find the nutcrackers.

1205
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,320
Won't sugar tongs do?

1206
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,520
Don't worry,
the glasses aren't valuable.

1207
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,360
- I think the doorbell rang.
- I'll get it.

1208
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,320
No peace, even on Sunday.

1209
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:26,520
- Madame Aughain.
- It's you, Ernest!

1210
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,160
You know me?

1211
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:34,120
- I'm Helene. I'd been told...
- Me too.

1212
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,800
How nice to see you.

1213
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,000
I recognize you now.
You used to be so thin.

1214
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,520
- Come in. We're finishing lunch.
- No, I'll wait.

1215
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,200
Alphonse is here.
No doubt it's him you're after.

1216
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,680
So he came to Boulogne for you?

1217
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,520
For me?

1218
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,520
A ghost, Ernest Choisy.

1219
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:02,280
Bernard Aughain, my friends,
we'll make room.

1220
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:04,840
Take my place. I'm done.

1221
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,120
Well, I work long hours, yet I read.

1222
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:12,600
I read until the book
drops from my hands.

1223
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,440
He's a fishy guy from the suburbs.

1224
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,600
He's still hungry,
so he says he didn't eat well.

1225
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,200
I only like books
that I have seen as films.

1226
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,920
He's like a cat.
He can smell the lobster.

1227
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,600
- How long will you stay?
- As long as you.

1228
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,080
- Here on business?
- No.

1229
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,800
When I tracked him down...

1230
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,000
He's the man skiing
on pine needles!

1231
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,280
- How long since we last met?
- Exactly seven days.

1232
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,800
I'll get it.

1233
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:50,680
It's the way a dish looks,
that makes me hungry.

1234
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,680
For you.

1235
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,000
Thanks, Claudie.

1236
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,600
It was a nice thought.

1237
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,280
I'm sorry I came empty-handed.

1238
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,080
Cars aren't the only things
that go fast.

1239
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,400
Cars aren't the only things
That go fast

1240
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,080
It's infuriating

1241
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:24,400
Time flies
In such a crazy hurry too

1242
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,760
Take it easy, Mr. Time
Slow down, there is a turn

1243
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,240
My hair is grey, but only yesterday
I was a child

1244
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,960
It's true
I'm going grey already

1245
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,080
When you turn 30

1246
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:42,000
You start saying "already"
When talking about your age

1247
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,200
Then at the age of 40
You start saying it more often

1248
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,840
But at the age of 50
You tend to say "already" less often

1249
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:52,080
And when you're really old
You don't say it anymore

1250
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,280
But you often look
At your old photos

1251
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:59,720
You see yourself as a child
In your mother's loving arms

1252
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:05,160
And she was surely saying
"He's six months old already"

1253
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,840
If only women could be 20 forever
And men could be 30

1254
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,760
What a dream

1255
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:15,440
But we must grow old
We must die

1256
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:18,760
There's happiness around
But we can't see it

1257
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,440
We like to fear the future
Regret the past and say:

1258
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:25,920
"Already, already, already"

1259
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:31,400
Gallant Lindbergh flew here
Not so long ago

1260
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:36,200
Yet how long ago that is already

1261
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:40,200
And further back we count
The heads of presidents

1262
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,920
And going back further
We find Cecile Sorel

1263
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,760
Despite our cunning and tears

1264
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,160
Fate toys with us
All things pass

1265
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,280
Let me speak, Alphonse!

1266
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,000
I'm not here for fun!

1267
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,560
I do not want to meddle
in Helene's affairs!

1268
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,880
She's a big girl.

1269
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,720
Let's talk about Algiers.

1270
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,440
He whines about it,
but he never set foot there.

1271
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,800
Never, I tell you.

1272
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,200
Did he tell you he was
a secret agent in 1945?

1273
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:21,600
Four identities,
hobnobbing with royalty,

1274
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,960
high life in Cairo,
his film productions.

1275
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,240
Yet he's more discreet
about his bankrupt restaurant.

1276
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,160
I've come for you, that's all.

1277
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:40,080
You see, he's married
to my sister Simone.

1278
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,920
I'll speak as I please, Alphonse.

1279
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,080
You're bankrupt.

1280
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:49,400
Simone is alone,
stuck with the restaurant.

1281
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,440
I can't help out anymore.

1282
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,440
Why are you back with Helene
after all these years?

1283
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,520
Why, I don't know.

1284
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,120
No one ever knew
what you two wanted.

1285
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,120
That's what killed Simone.

1286
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,960
Yes, that's what
almost killed Simone.

1287
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:11,040
We were buddies during the war.

1288
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,960
Those were your best years.

1289
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,640
Alphonse, you're coming with me.

1290
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,800
When his Algeria story will get old,
he'll tell other stories!

1291
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,280
Yours, Helene!

1292
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:27,720
Why not tell Helene about
the appointment I made with her,

1293
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:32,120
one Sunday in September 1940,
at the Globe d'Or?.

1294
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:37,880
Yes, to tell you...

1295
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,000
It's not worth the effort.
You wouldn't understand.

1296
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,320
And I never sent my letter.

1297
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:52,920
You and your "love"!
That's not love!

1298
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,960
I'll take you back, Alphonse!

1299
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,840
- I'll take you back!
- Get my tape recorder.

1300
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,600
I'll take you back!

1301
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,800
I didn't start it on purpose.

1302
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,800
All I heard was laughter.

1303
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,880
Don't look at me like that.

1304
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,640
Was it you?

1305
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,520
Was it friends?

1306
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,400
Someone who's dead?

1307
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,280
Excuse me.

1308
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,200
Helene!

1309
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,880
Helene!

1310
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,480
Helene, where are you?

1311
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,800
Is that you, de Smoke?

1312
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,120
Helene's disappeared.

1313
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,440
It's serious.

1314
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,760
We must find her.

1315
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,960
I don't know.

1316
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,480
Yes, perhaps.

1317
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,080
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

1318
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,560
Robert!

1319
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,880
- Robert!
- What's wrong?

1320
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,360
Come down.

1321
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,400
- Come down!
- Why?

1322
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,000
Come down, I say!

1323
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,280
No, don't!

1324
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,400
Monsieur!

1325
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,280
Have you found a mate
for my goat?

1326
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,680
For my goat.

1327
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,000
For my goat.

1328
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,600
Helene!

1329
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:47,240
I was going to write to you and say,
"Let's bury the past."

1330
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,880
And here you are.

1331
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,400
You've taken the initiative.

1332
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,240
Thank you.

1333
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:59,360
Antoine will be pleased.
He's so fond of you.

1334
01:43:59,280 --> 01:43:59,960
Come in.

1335
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:12,000
Antoine, guess who's here.

1336
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,960
We've got a rush job for a wedding.

1337
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:23,400
The bridegroom's suit.
You know the man.

1338
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:27,560
The son of Maurice, the little chap
who had a crush on you.

1339
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,680
- How about some coffee?
- Nothing, thanks, Angele.

1340
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:35,680
We saw your sister.
She's changed a lot.

1341
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,400
She'd be delighted to see you again.

1342
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,600
How's Bernard?
We haven't seen him for ages.

1343
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,520
- He's well.
- Is he thinking of marrying?

1344
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,040
At his age, one settles down.

1345
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,400
He's just out of the army.

1346
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,480
All you think of is marriage.

1347
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:58,200
One of our neighbors is
a different man after army service.

1348
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,160
The little girl's asleep.

1349
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,360
She looks like you.

1350
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,240
She's so good.

1351
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:08,440
Thanks for the money order.
There was no hurry.

1352
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,920
Luckily, she didn't get sick
last winter.

1353
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,800
- Did you hear that?
- It was a plane.

1354
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:15,880
No!

1355
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:21,200
I hope it wasn't Bernard.

1356
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,200
I'm going.

1357
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,760
Remember the holes in the roof?

1358
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:06,640
The charred linen,
the melted silver?

1359
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:09,040
The snow fell on my bed.

1360
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:13,400
It wasn't snow. It was rain.

1361
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:18,720
Your hair was white with plaster.

1362
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,120
I'm going away.

1363
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,880
I'm saying good- bye.

1364
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:34,640
I don't think I'll be able
to come back.

1365
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,240
You haven't got any money.

1366
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,480
It doesn't matter.

1367
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:51,480
Stay here with us.
You look awful.

1368
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,520
Give Helene some brandy.

1369
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,280
Where do you want to go?

1370
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,560
- We must let Muriel know.
- Who is Muriel?

1371
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:11,840
Bernard's fiancee.

1372
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,920
But I've never seen her.

1373
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,960
Bernard told me
about a Muriel he knew.

1374
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:22,960
Better not disturb her.

1375
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,560
If only I had done
what I should have done!

1376
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:32,800
Bernard can't be far away.
He'll realize we're worried.

1377
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,280
He will surely come back.

1378
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:39,640
How nice if it ended like that.

1379
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,120
I need some cigarettes.

1380
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:22,600
- Where's the train for Paris?
- It doesn't stop here anymore.

1381
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,720
You must go to the new station.

1382
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,800
Things change.

1383
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,240
- Will we convince them?
- I hope so.

1384
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:38,120
That would solve everything.

1385
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,480
Alphonse.

1386
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,240
Alphonse.
