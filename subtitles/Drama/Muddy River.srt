My goodnes... what a mess you made?

14
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:52,369
<i>I'm just a lonely bird </i>
<i>who needs to find himself a nest. </i>

15
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,316
Can I have some sesame seed cake?

16
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:20,750
Just scraps, how can you be so mean?

17
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,867
You eat enough.
You never want for food.

18
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,836
Come and eat with me. Get a spoon.

19
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:27,973
Sure.

20
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,720
Your father likes playing the boss
and eating with the cook.

21
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,219
Eat up.

22
00:03:55,821 --> 00:04:00,040
Tell me...
would you like to drive a truck?

23
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,891
Do you want me to teach you?

24
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,443
Would you?

25
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,365
Can you really teach me?

26
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,178
I'm going to learn to drive a truck.

27
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:14,231
Really?
Who do you think you're kidding?

28
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:17,701
Uncle likes to joke with you for fun.

29
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:20,904
He's just pulling your leg.

30
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:23,441
You look at his horse and wagon...

31
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,189
it sometimes hauls
more than a truck in it.

32
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:35,264
A horse and wagon's no joke...
Take's a lot of effort.

33
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:36,486
Really.

34
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:43,216
I was away in Okinawa for ten years.
Still, life hasn't changed much.

35
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,113
Will he really let you
drive a freight truck?

36
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,653
Says he'll buy two,
but nothing so far.

37
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,152
Today loads are a very heavy.

38
00:04:57,393 --> 00:05:02,667
We were hoping...
he'd buy a truck for you.

39
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,814
Ahh...
- It'd be much better, no?

40
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:09,598
It would make life a lot easier.

41
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:13,965
Bill...
- Right.

42
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:18,959
Thank you.

43
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,110
I'm off then.

44
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:41,699
Uncle.

45
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,667
Git up!

46
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:59,841
Come on... git up!

47
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,941
Move it!

48
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:29,187
Pull! pull!

49
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,387
Put your back in it! Pull!

50
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:12,350
Driver uncle... he just died.

51
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,467
What?
- It's true.

52
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,426
The wagon rolled over his body.

53
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,615
Help!
- Quick, come on.

54
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:25,155
How'd it happen?

55
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,436
Quick, get him out!

56
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,989
O-san! O-san!

57
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,064
Wake up!

58
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,572
He's over there.

59
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,272
Don't look!

60
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:07,441
Quick! Call an ambulance!

61
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,481
Nobuo, stay back!

62
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:46,061
I never even thought about it...
that he could go so quickly.

63
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:51,202
The accident... was so sudden.

64
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,364
We hardly saw him.

65
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,734
He worked so hard,
but was still optimistic.

66
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:11,617
For ten years... he always came in
to eat our sesame cake.

67
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:18,309
It's true... he kept going.
He wasn't one to worry.

68
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:24,811
I thought... that dying in battle in
the war, that would our fate.

69
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:31,397
At least that's what I used to think.

70
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:37,650
Having survived the war...
he should have had a decent life.

71
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:45,112
But I now think...
compared with death in battle...

72
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,446
today's accident was much sadder.

73
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:53,457
Do you really think like that?

74
00:09:55,689 --> 00:10:01,685
Such a sudden accidental death...
one never knows it's coming.

75
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:17,617
Unfortunately...
this kind of person becomes...

76
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:22,226
isolated... and
remains unnoticed until he dies.

77
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,613
It's not easy.

78
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:32,900
Maybe... if he'd been at a protest...
he wouldn't have died.

79
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:37,342
Dear...

80
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:39,551
do you feel guilty?

81
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:43,839
No. a man died...
and won't come back.

82
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:47,978
Nothing I can do... will change that..

83
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:53,544
It's the first time I've felt...
something like divine intervention.

84
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,308
It's a great pity.

85
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:10,908
He was an kind...
and hard working man.

86
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,518
I was thinking...

87
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,672
Since coming to Osaka,
our family's safe now.

88
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:29,132
I... want to thank you very much.

89
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:35,573
I want to go somewhere.

90
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:37,604
Where to?

91
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,425
I have to go...

92
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,253
to O-san's hometown.

93
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,573
Do you really have to go?

94
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:49,783
Yes, even if only...
to console his family.

95
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,435
After all.. I'm his oldest friend.

96
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,050
Let's sleep now.

97
00:12:56,744 --> 00:12:58,783
What're you doing?

98
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:05,680
These things are dangerous.

99
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,734
Someone could die... because of them.

100
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:12,575
I'm not stupid... I know.

101
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:49,627
A big fish... a big fish...
it just jumped... over there.

102
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:56,983
There... a big fish... just there...
a real big one... just a moment ago.

103
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:06,516
Don't make loud noises.
Have to be quiet...

104
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,796
or it'll get scared away.

105
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,789
Oh... I saw it. A really big one.

106
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,549
I'm just fooling with you.
You getting frightened?

107
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,946
Are you okay with me?

108
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,898
My family's over there.

109
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:30,912
Where?

110
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:37,085
Over there... there...
over there on that boat.

111
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:42,077
I've never seen in one.
Can I have a look? -Sure.

112
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:45,954
You look cold.

113
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:52,364
You should be careful, it's cold out.

114
00:14:58,321 --> 00:14:59,985
I've got to get back.

115
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,907
Eat up, you look so dull.

116
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:31,187
You went out in the wet?

117
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:34,336
Why are you so hot?

118
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:37,601
If it's a fever,
it's all his own doing.

119
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:41,775
Get to bed and get under the covers.

120
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,518
How did you get in such a state!

121
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:50,939
I caught a chill.

122
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:59,102
Ehh... there's a boat
moored over there.

123
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:01,301
It showed up yesterday.

124
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:04,666
It doesn't look very nice.

125
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:07,096
Can you see in it from here?

126
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:09,462
It's a barge.

127
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:12,880
People live there...
right on the boat.

128
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,247
What kind of boat is it?

129
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,639
It's a houseboat... people live in
it just like in a house.

130
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:25,974
Just about the water line...
that's where the family lives.

131
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:30,979
Stay under the covers!

132
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,339
Here you are.

133
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:43,960
Here it is.
- No hurry.

134
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,030
I've got some.

135
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:56,004
Some seasoning for me, thanks.

136
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:07,343
Do you wanna play?

137
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,310
Wanna play together?

138
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:35,491
Well... about you...
I really don't know anything.

139
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,256
Shhh... keep your voice down.
This is just between us.

140
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,818
Sorry.

141
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,125
Want to come to the boat?

142
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:17,145
Come on.

143
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,804
Look out.

144
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,320
You okay?

145
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,161
Careful, that spot's dangerous.

146
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:37,176
Who's that?

147
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,234
He lives in the shop opposite.

148
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:55,083
Take off your shoes.

149
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:12,931
Kii-chan, can you clean these up?
- Right.

150
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:46,019
What's your name?

151
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,247
I don't like to say just yet.

152
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,187
What grade are you?

153
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:51,672
Third year.

154
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,530
He's my little brother, Kiichi.
<i>(Afectionately Kii-chan) </i>

155
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,963
Is your name Kii-chan?

156
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,135
MATSUMOTO Kiichi

157
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,314
What school do you go to?

158
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:11,185
I'm not in school.

159
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:30,984
All clean, get up.
- Thanks.

160
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:40,565
You can come inside if you like.
If you don't have to go back right away.

161
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:15,269
Did you drain the water?

162
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:19,136
Yes, all done.
I finished all my chores.

163
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:20,934
Yes?

164
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:25,735
Could you get me a glass of water?
Suddenly I feel so thirsty.

165
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,819
Is someone... there with you?

166
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,092
Kii-chan's friend.

167
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:10,378
His friend...?

168
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,471
Where does he live?

169
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:16,384
On the opposite bank.

170
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:25,258
Are you hungry?
Take a snack, and give him one too.

171
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:09,587
Ouch.

172
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:22,581
Nabuo, don't pee where we sleep!

173
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:25,440
What a silly thing. Go outside.

174
00:24:50,668 --> 00:24:53,355
Auntie... good morning to you.

175
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:55,644
Good morning.

176
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:08,394
Gran... have you read this book?

177
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,839
I had a look at it.

178
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,151
Damned annoying.
I'm always so tired.

179
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,432
Lately I can't seem to fall sleep.

180
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,665
One year follows another.

181
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,754
Never any prospects.

182
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,742
Is that so?

183
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:36,808
Mother-in-law...

184
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,457
I brought some sweet potato.

185
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:42,535
Ahh... very good. Thank you!

186
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:52,612
You're a good wife. Not only diligent,
but you choose your diet well.

187
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,713
Some things are easily forgotten, but
you never forget how to prepare food.

188
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:04,348
You're right again.
You're certainly a model housewife.

189
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:10,344
Ask your son if he figures
I'm a good wife and loving mother.

190
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,955
Oh my... now you value my oppion.

191
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,465
Submarine... you know about them?

192
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,981
What?

193
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,160
Gran... what are you talking about?

194
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,277
Simply put,
the ship sails under water.

195
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:30,792
Under water...
a ship can't sail under water.

196
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,969
Wrong... a submarine adjusts
the water it holds.

197
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:38,967
The volume of water...
decides it's depth in the water, no?

198
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,682
If it takes in water... it sinks down
and moves... under the water.

199
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:46,629
When it discharges water...
it rises...

200
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:52,359
dun, dun, dun to the surface.
Using water volume it can do that.

201
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:58,080
How come the people inside
don't get drowned under the water?

202
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:05,751
Nobuo...
loves the water like a fish.

203
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,622
My turn, my turn!

204
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:29,975
It's hard.

205
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:45,281
You should be careful. Don't just...
casually bring anyone onto the boat.

206
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:14,589
There's someone in the river.

207
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:16,716
In the river!

208
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:19,356
Maybe he's just going for a swim.

209
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:23,302
I saw it myself,
he hasn't come back up.

210
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,944
Oh, there really is a boat.

211
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:42,779
That's not good, there's no-one there.

212
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,255
Wha... no-one there?

213
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:52,960
You say this was yesterday evening.

214
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:59,492
You saw a man jump into
the water from his boat?

215
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,645
Okay then.

216
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,927
For you.

217
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,782
Think carefully.

218
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,765
Did it look like an accident,
or was it intentional?

219
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:20,270
I don't know.

220
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:23,672
This isn't getting anywhere!

221
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:26,004
I only know what I saw,
not why.

222
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,008
You said he went into the water?

223
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:32,581
Why couldn't he have
been acting intentionally?

224
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:40,725
It's also possible that that man
can't swim so well.

225
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:46,144
This missing man...
you don't know where he lives.

226
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:49,798
You hadn't considered he might've
been swimming to his house?

227
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:55,450
This investigation needs to be thorough.
It's not for you to decide arbitrarily.

228
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:01,145
Maybe the missing man
was catching fish illegally.

229
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,527
What did you say?

230
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:08,035
He was catching fish at night
so he wouldn't be fined.

231
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:19,858
They haven't found a body yet.

232
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:24,557
Could it be a man catching fish
was caught by the fish himself.

233
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:29,726
It's right there he disappeared.

234
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:31,874
Oh, is it?

235
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:38,506
Actually yesterday evening was so dark
my son couldn't have seen so clearly.

236
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:43,778
He wants me to catch a criminal
without any certainty of it.

237
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:51,025
This matter is a headache.
Couldn't it have been suicide?

238
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:53,343
Suicide... why think that?

239
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:58,702
He wants to end it that evening
and finishes his own life.

240
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:06,890
He's not originally a fisherman,
so he can't swim.

241
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:09,757
He responds to adds for work
encounters only rejections...

242
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:11,710
can't see any hope.

243
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:16,103
Ehh... no job?

244
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:55,875
What are you thinking? Eat your dinner.

245
00:35:56,742 --> 00:36:01,441
Say... the next time I see Kii-chan
can I bring him to visit us?

246
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:02,953
Who is Kii-chan?

247
00:36:03,101 --> 00:36:04,949
A friend of mine.

248
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:09,167
If you don't quarrel with him
he's welcome to come?

249
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:11,569
He also has an older sister.

250
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,018
Elder sister?

251
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:15,471
Can she come too?

252
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:20,178
Nobuo... this friend...
does he live in that houseboat?

253
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:24,744
Yes... he's in third grade,
and his big sister can read.

254
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,964
When did you become
friends with them?

255
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,988
Not long ago.
His sister is really nice.

256
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:37,831
You've been getting along with them?

257
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:42,189
Yes. I'm sure you'd like
to meet their mother too.

258
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,839
You mean... even their mother...
wants to come?

259
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:49,649
Maybe she can't.

260
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,278
Is it all right if they come?

261
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:02,769
I'm not against it...
friendship's good.

262
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,629
Only... that boat...
don't go there any more.

263
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,843
Why?

264
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:33,286
That boat...
why won't you let him go?

265
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:35,051
Why should he?.

266
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,083
Is the boy no good?

267
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,347
It has nothing to do with the children.

268
00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:41,515
What do you mean?

269
00:37:42,856 --> 00:37:48,242
A young child... shouldn't spend...
too much time on that boat.

270
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,536
It's not healthy for a young boy.

271
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:00,666
You say, "Good evening".

272
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,791
"Good evening. Good evening."

273
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,752
"Hello" is different.

274
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:06,838
Can't you shut up?

275
00:38:07,642 --> 00:38:10,896
Good evening, Good evening...

276
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,301
Hello!

277
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,762
Good evening!

278
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:42,411
Good evening!

279
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,755
Please come in.

280
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,669
It'll be so nice...
 to have a meal together.

281
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,967
You can sit here.

282
00:39:04,832 --> 00:39:07,418
Say... you don't need to be polite,
just eat.

283
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,080
Thanks for the food.

284
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,927
Thanks for the food.

285
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,107
Thanks for the food.

286
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:17,680
Everybody is so smart...
all using the right etiquette.

287
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:21,208
I'll get some more for you.

288
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,879
Here you are.

289
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,751
I hope you like this.

290
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:51,316
Auntie, you don't know our names.

291
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:56,352
Don't tell me I'm not remembering
what you told me to say.

292
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,459
What... is your name?

293
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:08,750
- I'm Ginko MATSUMOTO
- I'm Kiichi MATSUMOTO

294
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:13,684
Well... I'm glad to meet you.

295
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,695
Does your mother cook for your family?

296
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:25,046
No, I do it.

297
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,257
Really?  What a good girl.

298
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:32,525
Cooking and all the housework,
my sister does it all.

299
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,006
Then what does your mother do?

300
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:38,944
That's enough.

301
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,913
Ginko-chan, how old are you?

302
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,202
Ten years old.

303
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:45,305
I see.

304
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:50,213
For one so young....
you're a really diligent worker, aren't you?

305
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:54,441
Ginko-chan really is a fine young woman.

306
00:40:55,767 --> 00:41:00,297
My dream is to be a military officer,
a real man.

307
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:05,078
Yes? So determined!
Can you sing any military songs?

308
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:05,625
Of course.

309
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,516
Give us a song then.

310
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:09,109
Yes, sing for your supper!

311
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:11,398
Fine, my belly is not hungry now.

312
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:17,132
<i>We are the nation's brave servicemen...</i>

313
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:22,796
<i>crossing the mountains <i>
<i>and bridging the seas. </i>

314
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:29,034
<i>We fight with no fear for our life...</i>

315
00:41:29,129 --> 00:41:34,600
<i>but only for the motherland. </i>

316
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:41,068
<i>We must surely achieve final victory. </i>

317
00:41:41,328 --> 00:41:46,816
<i>Even if it means </i>
<i>we fight single-handedly. </i>

318
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:52,316
<i>Do not fear the battlefield gunsmoke. </i>

319
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:58,230
<i>Only show your loyalty. </i>

320
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,247
You sing really well!

321
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,458
Really great.

322
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:11,481
So...

323
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:14,411
tell me then...

324
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,582
can you sing...
other military songs?

325
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,188
Sure...
I can sing all the military songs.

326
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:25,027
You can sing all of them?
That's really something!

327
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:28,546
Then sing another,
a different one.

328
00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:29,473
Okay.

329
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,038
Go on.

330
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:38,280
<i>We live here </i>
<i>seeking our longed for life. </i>

331
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:43,944
<i>Life like dust </i>
<i>fills the air and the sky. </i>

332
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:49,305
<i>It has not blocked </i>
<i>our clear judgement. </i>

333
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:54,537
<i>Life is as helpless </i>
<i>as a bandage wrapping...</i>

334
00:42:54,843 --> 00:43:00,811
<i>But cannot bind </i>
<i>our determined footsteps...</i>

335
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,380
<i>as we continue </i>
<i>to advance straight ahead. </i>

336
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:12,232
<i>Our mood is as wide as the world. </i>

337
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:18,219
<i>Freedom is our goal. </i>

338
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:25,516
Really... it's so nice to hear.

339
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:32,184
It's the first time I've ever
heard a child sing so well.

340
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,011
Who's your teacher?

341
00:43:39,222 --> 00:43:43,610
My dad... but he's not here now.

342
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:46,368
I see.

343
00:43:50,157 --> 00:43:55,158
Your father was really great... teaching
you such an outstanding ability.

344
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:10,893
That's right...
I have a one-piece dress upstairs...

345
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:12,830
that would suit Ginko-chan perfectly.

346
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:17,399
Come on, come with me.

347
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:20,263
You just wait and see.

348
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,718
Itakura!

349
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:33,597
Ahh... you got off early tonight.

350
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:38,221
We're starved.
- Can't you get us something quick?

351
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:40,653
I don't have anything ready now.

352
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:42,278
Want a drink?

353
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,864
No, I'm not drinking.

354
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,059
Something to eat.

355
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,644
We couldn't come earlier.

356
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:52,174
It's not all business with us.

357
00:44:52,229 --> 00:44:53,853
That's so.

358
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:56,244
Nobu-chan...

359
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,814
You don't need to study now.

360
00:44:57,924 --> 00:45:01,275
Just reading doesn't always
bring good results.

361
00:45:03,142 --> 00:45:05,843
Isn't this kid from that brothel boat?

362
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:13,276
Yeah, it's the prostitute's kid.

363
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:17,870
That's enough! Don't talk like that...
not in front of the boy.

364
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:19,464
What's the fuss?

365
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:23,268
There's no harm in it.
We're just teasing him a little.

366
00:45:28,253 --> 00:45:30,279
I don't agree.

367
00:45:33,057 --> 00:45:34,708
Time to go now.

368
00:45:36,756 --> 00:45:38,318
Didn't you hear?

369
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,368
What did we do?

370
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:45,118
You're crazy to send customers away.

371
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,092
This is crazy.
- It's crazy.

372
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:57,713
Why did they leave?

373
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:01,096
They're not welcome.
- What happened?

374
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:04,078
No matter.

375
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:13,517
Ohh! Look at this.

376
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,205
Hey... what a beautiful young woman?

377
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:20,343
Yes.

378
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:25,555
And if fits well too.
It's just right for you.

379
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:35,284
Why don't you have a look at your sister?

380
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,787
What do you think?

381
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:48,502
That's right... there's also
something for you, just wait.

382
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:52,810
Kiichi-chan... My dad's
going to do some magic for us.

383
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,801
Here we are.

384
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,809
These are the stage props.

385
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:04,762
Some peas.

386
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:10,351
Here are three cups, all the same.

387
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:15,107
We take one of these out
and put it here, so...

388
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,454
This is empty.

389
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,992
This is also empty.

390
00:47:21,245 --> 00:47:22,399
And this is empty.

391
00:47:23,038 --> 00:47:25,538
And then...
I put the pea under this cup, so...

392
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:27,967
I'm going to move the cups.

393
00:47:28,084 --> 00:47:31,405
The hand is quicker than the eye.

394
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:34,882
Here.

395
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:36,400
Here.

396
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,546
It's moving.

397
00:47:38,785 --> 00:47:42,789
Where is the pea hiding now?

398
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,812
Which one is it under?

399
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,947
This one?
- Are you sure?  Have a look.

400
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:50,880
Whaaat!?

401
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:54,859
Under this one.

402
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:01,988
Can I try again.

403
00:48:02,142 --> 00:48:04,394
You want another go?  Fine, fine.

404
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:09,322
This one has nothing, this one has nothing,
and this one has nothing.

405
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:12,972
We cover it up.
The eye stays fixed on this cup.

406
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:15,893
Check to see where it actually is, so.

407
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,332
This to here, This to here.

408
00:48:24,558 --> 00:48:25,387
Where is it now?

409
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:29,896
Let's see...which one should I say?

410
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:33,079
Guess quickly.

411
00:48:33,922 --> 00:48:34,532
This one.

412
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:36,782
That's not it

413
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:38,868
Wrong guess.

414
00:48:38,884 --> 00:48:41,868
Wrong guess once again, eh?

415
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,160
This one.

416
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:49,887
Uncle, how do you do it?

417
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:52,941
Actually, it's not too difficult.

418
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,778
The bathroom's on the left, just there.

419
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:59,081
You're always tricking children.

420
00:48:59,225 --> 00:49:03,625
The only time I can trick them is when
they're still innocent children, so why not?

421
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:05,826
Who's trying?

422
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,058
Nabuo-chan... try for me.

423
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:10,581
I don't know where it is either.

424
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:14,902
Uncle, were you a magician before?

425
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:16,519
I'd like to be a magician.

426
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:22,504
He used to perform tricks for me, too,
and keeps on doing them.

427
00:49:23,097 --> 00:49:25,621
Don't tell them the secret.

428
00:49:26,293 --> 00:49:28,010
Come on, guess again.

429
00:49:41,874 --> 00:49:42,874
You changed...?

430
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:47,850
Auntie...
would like you to have it?

431
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:55,982
What's wrong?
Did something upset you?

432
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:01,422
I'm very happy.
Thank you for tonight.

433
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:09,506
Kii-chan, let's go.

434
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:25,470
Uncle... will you show me next time?

435
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:28,827
Oh... yes... for sure.

436
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:31,280
Ginko-chan, you come again too.

437
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,741
Yes.

438
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:40,607
I'll go with them.

439
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:01,424
Those two children...
really are pitiful.

440
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:05,976
Leave that kind of sorrowful talk alone.

441
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,719
Every day they get up...
they have to depend on themselves.

442
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:16,418
They don't have anything.

443
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:23,314
A father in name only.
One never to be seen... or relied upon.

444
00:51:23,386 --> 00:51:27,979
No doubt he suffered hardship...
before returning from the war.

445
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,929
Intended to live well... originally

446
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:38,748
He couldn't manage on the battlefield,
his two children are left to suffer.

447
00:51:43,772 --> 00:51:46,660
Such is the calamity of war.

448
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:54,990
War with a neighboring country... seeing
masses of people die again and again.

449
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:01,175
Can anyone... really come back normal?

450
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:28,790
You are really lucky to have them...
your parents.

451
00:53:23,812 --> 00:53:29,782
Ginko-san, Kiichi-kun...
did you understand? - Yes.

452
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:35,187
Everybody's father and mother...
are now living in Osaka.

453
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:38,995
But they all go out to work for you.

454
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,069
To them you are all very important.

455
00:53:41,395 --> 00:53:44,850
Regardless of the type of work
they have to do.

456
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,465
For instance freight loading
is very laborious.

457
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:54,107
Therefore you musn't think
that studying is boring. - Yes.

458
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,773
Why are you standing?

459
00:54:18,105 --> 00:54:19,839
School's out at last.

460
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,726
Oh, you made me jump!

461
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:33,864
I'm going to watch
the sumo wrestling at home.

462
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:34,952
Sumo wrestling?

463
00:54:35,115 --> 00:54:37,968
They're broadcasting the
sumo wrestling competition.

464
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:43,363
Hiroshi... can I watch?
Can I bring Kiichi with me too?

465
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:48,761
Can't.

466
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,471
Why?

467
00:54:51,796 --> 00:54:53,972
He's my friend.

468
00:54:54,126 --> 00:54:55,463
Can't.

469
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,601
We could all go together.

470
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:02,969
No, we'll go by ourselves... let's go.

471
00:55:37,795 --> 00:55:39,661
Sorry for the wait.

472
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,351
It looks good.

473
00:56:13,522 --> 00:56:15,361
That's it... He's got him!

474
00:56:15,988 --> 00:56:19,378
He's in the way. Let's get up higher.
- Right.

475
00:56:52,026 --> 00:56:53,424
Hey there!

476
00:57:19,772 --> 00:57:23,772
At least, come to see her...  please.

477
00:58:00,349 --> 00:58:02,927
When did you get back?
- Just now.

478
00:58:06,303 --> 00:58:08,153
That fellow...

479
00:58:10,851 --> 00:58:12,675
is insisting.

480
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:20,204
I'd better go back.

481
00:58:38,084 --> 00:58:41,274
Why does it have to be like this?

482
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:43,880
It would seem...

483
00:58:44,936 --> 00:58:47,816
he really is a bastard.

484
00:58:55,259 --> 00:58:57,383
Where do you have to go?

485
00:58:57,924 --> 00:59:00,211
Ah... today...

486
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:03,551
That man who was here?
- Ya.

487
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:09,224
I mean... regardless of whether I
want to go... I have to.

488
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:10,515
Absolutely.

489
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:16,221
You understand... right...
I have to go see her in hospital.

490
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:20,883
Although you don't know her...
she's closely related to you.

491
00:59:21,782 --> 00:59:24,056
Who is she?

492
00:59:24,483 --> 00:59:28,998
Well... it was...
from before you were born.

493
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,633
Dad's...

494
00:59:31,444 --> 00:59:33,037
friend.

495
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:36,695
But why did that man tell you?

496
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:40,754
That's because... she's now his wife.

497
00:59:41,406 --> 00:59:46,573
It's hard for Dad...
because she's now being treated

498
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:48,349
for a serious illness.

499
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,580
She had fallen in love
with your father... long ago.

500
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:57,058
She and your Dad were very close.

501
00:59:57,215 --> 00:59:58,879
Do you understand?

502
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,409
That is... she's your mother.

503
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,122
Your change, thank you.

504
01:00:29,915 --> 01:00:35,680
You see... Sadako-san...
He can't afford her treatment.

505
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,899
That may be...

506
01:00:40,277 --> 01:00:44,630
Regardless...
whatever happens to this woman...

507
01:00:45,277 --> 01:00:48,948
I have always...
treated him as my own son.

508
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:53,158
Even though...
you've done nothing wrong.

509
01:00:53,243 --> 01:00:56,916
Truly... she is very ill.
Let him visit her.

510
01:00:57,465 --> 01:01:00,468
He has always been good, yes?

511
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:07,269
He has been brought up by you...
and has become very lovable.

512
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:13,166
She is the biological mother...
shouldn't she at least see her child?

513
01:01:17,816 --> 01:01:19,699
We are all human...

514
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:25,563
everyone gets hurt...
and has to feel pain.

515
01:01:26,362 --> 01:01:29,739
Everyone's this way.

516
01:01:30,397 --> 01:01:35,339
You must think about it carefully...
Sadako-san.

517
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:43,347
She also feels pain...
and deserves some sympathy too.

518
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:52,162
I've decided what I'll do...

519
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,607
I'll go too.

520
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,719
It's you.

521
01:02:15,157 --> 01:02:17,849
I always think well of you.

522
01:02:27,259 --> 01:02:29,168
I brought him to see you.

523
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:41,404
Is it already ten years?

524
01:03:16,966 --> 01:03:23,223
Your Papa will...
love you well and much longer.

525
01:03:41,036 --> 01:03:46,392
I can't live very long.
Thank you.

526
01:03:48,597 --> 01:03:50,217
Thank you.

527
01:04:13,898 --> 01:04:17,843
It's all because of me... I'm sorry!

528
01:04:29,397 --> 01:04:31,388
Mother.

529
01:05:33,024 --> 01:05:37,429
<i>THE POSTWAR DAYS ARE OVER

530
01:05:42,065 --> 01:05:45,373
<i>TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION..!

531
01:06:14,256 --> 01:06:18,639
Nabuo, want some?
- Ya.

532
01:06:28,093 --> 01:06:30,623
Your mom already fell asleep.

533
01:06:38,353 --> 01:06:41,564
You met your biological mom... eh?

534
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:51,350
It's a long time since you were born.
It's already 11 years.

535
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:55,901
Still your mom...
continues to think about you.

536
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:58,720
Kiichi?

537
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:05,377
No... it's me.

538
01:08:06,189 --> 01:08:09,506
Oh... Nabuo-chan?

539
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,354
Right.

540
01:08:12,674 --> 01:08:15,799
Since you're here now...
come and see me.

541
01:08:17,953 --> 01:08:21,884
Nabuo-chan, why don't you say anything?

542
01:08:27,401 --> 01:08:30,716
Are you feeling shy?

543
01:08:32,632 --> 01:08:34,360
No, I'm not

544
01:08:34,626 --> 01:08:40,125
Let me see then how Nabuo-chan
presents himself in public.

545
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:50,019
Nabuo-chan.

546
01:09:51,273 --> 01:09:53,699
You really are lovely.

547
01:10:02,722 --> 01:10:06,982
You always look out for
my two children.

548
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:12,904
Please convey my thanks to your
mother and father also.

549
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:29,106
Your family has had the shop opposite
for a long time?

550
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:30,748
Yes.

551
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:43,519
Your mother... and your father
living together... how happy it is.

552
01:10:43,755 --> 01:10:47,003
It also makes me envious.

553
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:56,143
Since my husband left,
I've faced many unpleasant things.

554
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:05,101
Not everyone... can understand...

555
01:11:05,234 --> 01:11:09,116
how I suffer to keep us alive here.

556
01:11:10,078 --> 01:11:15,626
Before we had children...
he worked hard to earn.

557
01:11:16,827 --> 01:11:20,490
I also used to work in a company.

558
01:11:29,794 --> 01:11:33,054
Nabuo-chan...
- Yes.

559
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:42,158
Your mother... must surely be...
a kind and beautiful person.

560
01:11:43,392 --> 01:11:46,149
Auntie, you are also very pretty.

561
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:54,279
If you have free time,
we can play together.

562
01:11:54,654 --> 01:11:59,865
Thank you...
you really are a lovable fellow.

563
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:04,990
Ah... I think Ginko's come back.

564
01:12:17,677 --> 01:12:20,247
Did you just get back now?

565
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,111
Just now I had a nice chat
with your mother.

566
01:12:30,519 --> 01:12:34,899
Maybe there, maybe here... or there.

567
01:12:35,413 --> 01:12:39,201
Fine, now guess.
1, 2, 3, stop.

568
01:12:40,262 --> 01:12:43,248
Well?  Which one?

569
01:12:44,522 --> 01:12:45,521
This  one.

570
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:46,920
This one?

571
01:12:47,098 --> 01:12:50,715
Are you sure?
Want to change your mind?

572
01:12:53,924 --> 01:12:55,720
What?!

573
01:12:56,794 --> 01:13:00,787
That's right...
you still haven't figured it out.

574
01:13:01,862 --> 01:13:04,770
Looks like you don't have the talent.

575
01:13:04,974 --> 01:13:08,978
Dad, this year I will
see through your magic.

576
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:13,389
Kiichi-chan, you can come here
and study together with him.

577
01:13:13,747 --> 01:13:16,201
You don't wanna try again.

578
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:17,481
It's no good.

579
01:13:18,856 --> 01:13:24,277
We'll continue another time.
Tomorrow you may have better luck.

580
01:13:24,548 --> 01:13:28,495
But I don't feel like stopping now.

581
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:32,408
That may be...
but you have to take time to refuel.

582
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:36,793
Dad... we can come to
a 'gentlemen's agreement' ?

583
01:13:37,601 --> 01:13:40,416
Uncle...
it's a 'gentlemen's agreement' then.

584
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:44,281
I understand, I understand.

585
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:52,138
You two... really are young men.

586
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:56,538
Your figure's good!

587
01:13:56,862 --> 01:14:01,812
Ginko-chan...
you really know what to say.

588
01:14:01,914 --> 01:14:05,918
I've never taken a bath
together with my mother.

589
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,433
Is that so?

590
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:13,287
I've always bathed myself
since I was very small.

591
01:14:13,419 --> 01:14:14,989
I see.

592
01:14:15,506 --> 01:14:21,252
Because you know... I always thought...
a girl should learn to do such things.

593
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,972
I'm not a very good girl.
Do you know what things I've done?

594
01:14:25,175 --> 01:14:27,552
No, I'm listening.

595
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:33,952
I was in the cabin.
Mom was in the other one.

596
01:14:35,549 --> 01:14:41,428
One time... in the winter...
I gripped the boat... breathing deeply...

597
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:45,219
Mom was sleeping soundly.
I made it sound like my hand...

598
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,672
was grasping the boat from the river.

599
01:14:47,787 --> 01:14:52,523
"Mother", I said again loudly...
but she didn't seem to hear me.

600
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:54,490
Did it really happen?

601
01:14:54,687 --> 01:15:01,733
Yes it did... but 30 seconds later...
they were awakened by my noise.

602
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:07,600
They started to think I was in the
river and would freeze to death.

603
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,986
So then she... woke up my father,
and he became worried too.

604
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:16,650
Both of them ran out to rescue me.

605
01:15:16,957 --> 01:15:21,910
But by that time, I was lying down...
comfortable in my quilt.

606
01:15:26,517 --> 01:15:28,728
That really hapapened.

607
01:15:30,886 --> 01:15:34,879
Nabuo, do you know the steamboat?

608
01:15:39,942 --> 01:15:41,933
The steamboat.

609
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:13,952
I've...
always wanted to ride on it.

610
01:16:28,388 --> 01:16:31,544
It's auntie.
- Nobuo...!

611
01:16:31,716 --> 01:16:33,419
She looks frightened.

612
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:37,370
Nobuo-chan... d'you know
where your father is?

613
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,044
No, I don't.

614
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:43,910
It's just we've got lots of customers...
and he's not in.

615
01:16:44,035 --> 01:16:48,004
Nobuo-chan, I need your help.
Can you come for a bit?

616
01:16:50,071 --> 01:16:53,697
Ginko, you can help too.

617
01:16:53,799 --> 01:16:55,220
Good, delicious.

618
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:57,996
Here, take this out.
- Yes.

619
01:16:58,215 --> 01:17:00,051
You haven't finished that?

620
01:17:00,202 --> 01:17:01,270
No I haven't.

621
01:17:01,665 --> 01:17:04,259
This is good, too.

622
01:17:07,388 --> 01:17:09,390
You really are too busy!

623
01:17:10,044 --> 01:17:11,372
Some tea here.

624
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,310
Yes, just a moment.

625
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:19,063
These vegetables are good.

626
01:17:24,468 --> 01:17:29,202
Your father... where did he go?

627
01:17:33,313 --> 01:17:37,024
He isn't back yet.
What can have happened?

628
01:18:45,002 --> 01:18:49,725
Heho God, blesses the common people.

629
01:19:10,433 --> 01:19:16,628
He's not here, my dad.
- He forgot our 'gentlemen's agreement'.

630
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:20,488
He tricks people.

631
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:28,416
Don't you wonna play too?

632
01:19:31,384 --> 01:19:33,150
Both of us?

633
01:19:35,388 --> 01:19:36,947
Hey there!

634
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:39,494
Catch!

635
01:19:54,383 --> 01:19:57,197
Hey... it's good and delicious.

636
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,147
Thanks!

637
01:19:59,242 --> 01:20:00,734
Don't forget.

638
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,827
Is it sweet?

639
01:20:02,984 --> 01:20:08,570
Very sweet and very delicious.
Hopefully your elder sister's the same.

640
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:11,553
That's disgusting!

641
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:17,732
What are you doing?

642
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:24,913
I'm warming my hands.

643
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:32,991
It's getting colder more often.
The season's changing.

644
01:20:37,697 --> 01:20:39,619
You like the boat?

645
01:20:40,453 --> 01:20:42,405
It all depends.

646
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:48,713
Before the cold comes,
it feels good and we're all happy.

647
01:20:48,862 --> 01:20:51,057
That's the best time.

648
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:57,034
My mother said as much.
Good memories, eh.

649
01:21:04,398 --> 01:21:08,550
Can we have some money...
We wanna go play at the fair.

650
01:21:08,976 --> 01:21:10,804
You both going?

651
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:14,279
My father is really bad.

652
01:21:15,177 --> 01:21:16,036
Where's your brother?

653
01:21:16,146 --> 01:21:17,862
The other side.

654
01:21:19,482 --> 01:21:24,438
Don't play for too long...
and don't lose the money.

655
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,871
I won't lose it.

656
01:21:28,743 --> 01:21:30,705
Be careful.

657
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:47,423
What?

658
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:52,972
It's the first time I've had so much...
in my own hand.

659
01:21:53,406 --> 01:21:55,480
Let's hurry.

660
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:45,749
How much?

661
01:22:45,843 --> 01:22:48,288
One copper.

662
01:22:50,124 --> 01:22:56,001
We want this, we want that...
we don't have enough money.

663
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:01,319
We won't buy anything now,
We'll check everything out first

664
01:23:10,102 --> 01:23:12,412
Welcome.

665
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:17,806
Kiichi, we should keep it together...
otherwise it's easier to lose.

666
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:19,360
Fine.

667
01:23:20,658 --> 01:23:22,294
Keep it safe.

668
01:23:36,715 --> 01:23:41,269
We can buy something...
but only with half the money.

669
01:23:41,376 --> 01:23:43,367
That's good.

670
01:23:47,149 --> 01:23:48,282
We'll buy one.

671
01:23:48,344 --> 01:23:51,219
Fine.  Where's your money?

672
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,677
It's gone.

673
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:09,885
If we'd bought something... when
we started, it would've been better.

674
01:25:34,809 --> 01:25:40,053
We have nothing...
I don't want to go back like this.

675
01:25:42,269 --> 01:25:44,128
Your mother...

676
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:52,541
had to work for it... so... hard.

677
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:40,690
If we go back to my boat
we can play...

678
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:44,410
with crabs.

679
01:26:45,044 --> 01:26:46,278
With crabs?

680
01:26:46,387 --> 01:26:49,176
Right, I'll show you.

681
01:28:06,101 --> 01:28:07,320
Are there crabs?

682
01:28:07,523 --> 01:28:10,274
Wait a minute and let me grab it.

683
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:27,612
These are what's left over.

684
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:46,264
I think I'll go home.

685
01:28:46,438 --> 01:28:49,217
I'm only starting it now.

686
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,248
This way, it'll die.

687
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,344
Just watch.

688
01:29:51,745 --> 01:29:53,736
Let's do it again.

689
01:30:14,072 --> 01:30:17,008
What's so fun...
watching it struggle?

690
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:27,411
Kiichi, it's dangerous. Don't do it.

691
01:33:28,617 --> 01:33:30,608
Put some vegetables with it.

692
01:33:39,519 --> 01:33:42,207
Did you run off to play.

693
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:47,160
Now that you're home...
why don't you come and help Dad?

694
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:49,977
Our little treasure can help too.

695
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:55,619
Come in... you just gonna
to stand there and gawk?

696
01:33:56,843 --> 01:33:59,112
What is it?

697
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:08,213
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

698
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:10,069
Nothing's wrong.

699
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,193
Really...?
If that's so... come on in.

700
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:26,279
Sit down.

701
01:34:32,635 --> 01:34:38,214
Dad... urgently...
had to leave for a while.

702
01:34:38,502 --> 01:34:42,666
But I hadn't forgotten
our 'gentlemen's agreement'.

703
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,669
Still keen?

704
01:34:46,594 --> 01:34:48,891
All of a sudden your Dad's back.

705
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:53,003
Are you so happy
you're lost for words?

706
01:34:53,336 --> 01:34:55,761
He's changed.

707
01:34:57,941 --> 01:35:02,706
I had to see an old friend
before he left...

708
01:35:03,308 --> 01:35:05,378
They were sending him to China.

709
01:35:06,177 --> 01:35:11,099
Nabuo-chan, we were hoping
every day that Dad would come back.

710
01:35:11,233 --> 01:35:13,732
Well now he's back with us.

711
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:22,514
Excuse us. It's a private matter.
Don't be embarrassed, go on eating.

712
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,140
Good.

713
01:35:28,381 --> 01:35:30,372
Drink this down.

714
01:35:30,951 --> 01:35:32,953
Me too, waitress.

715
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,719
Good.

716
01:36:01,498 --> 01:36:07,083
<i>Henceforth I'm no longer the fool.</i>

717
01:36:07,473 --> 01:36:18,430
<i>No longer am I a lonely bored person. </i>

718
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:24,290
<i>As always the matter </i>
<i>which worries me the most...</i>

719
01:36:24,423 --> 01:36:30,050
<i>Leaves me here unable to get to sleep. </i>

720
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:48,561
Can't sleep?

721
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:51,203
All tired out?

722
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:07,223
Today I went to see a play.

723
01:37:07,348 --> 01:37:10,020
Yaa...
what a nice artistic treat you had?

724
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,106
I very rarely see one.

725
01:37:13,129 --> 01:37:18,339
Nabuo... you ever see a play...
together with a group?

726
01:37:18,637 --> 01:37:20,794
I hate watching plays.

727
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:34,369
My goodness... Nabuo... Nabuo-chan...

728
01:37:34,463 --> 01:37:37,503
take a look at the boat opposite.

729
01:38:10,828 --> 01:38:15,213
Nabuo, did you guys quarrel?

730
01:38:16,953 --> 01:38:19,390
We didn't quarrel.

731
01:38:23,531 --> 01:38:27,038
Nabuo-chan...
what's your problem them?

732
01:38:31,264 --> 01:38:33,029
Nabuo.

733
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:52,976
Kii-chan...

734
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:21,064
Kii-chan...

735
01:41:30,303 --> 01:41:32,139
Kii-chan...

736
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,131
Kii-chan...

737
01:41:37,178 --> 01:41:38,827
Kii-chan...

738
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:53,307
Kii-chan!

739
01:42:28,937 --> 01:42:31,533
Kii-chan.....!

740
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,206
Kii-chan!

741
01:42:47,856 --> 01:42:50,637
Kii-chan.....!

742
01:42:54,129 --> 01:42:56,776
Kii-chan.....!
