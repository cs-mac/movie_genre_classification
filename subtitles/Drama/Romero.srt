it happened in 1932.

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,496
Atanza!

3
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,656
(Crowd)
They killed us!

4
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:36,258
It happened in the election...

5
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,065
Of 1945 and 1950!

6
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,767
- They killed us!
- It happened...

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,279
In the one-candidate
election of 1962.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,440
(Crowd)
They robbed us!

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,815
It happened
in the election...

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,911
- Where the winner kept changing.
- We need reinforcements.

11
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:59,287
(Claramount)
Even though the voting was
long since completely done!

12
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,826
They robbed us!

13
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,422
(Claramount)
And now, 1977,

14
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:12,028
and this time, we will not
stand for it anymore!

15
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,732
We will occupy this plaza...

16
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,901
Until there is a true election,

17
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,206
a free election!

18
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,043
Freedom, freedom, freedom!

19
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,980
Freedom, freedom!

(Man)
Everybody who's finished voting,

24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,490
please get back on the bus.

25
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,454
Thank you.

(Father Morantes)
Alfonso, take care of
these two that never voted.

27
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,427
Let's go! Everybody
line up over there to vote.

28
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,143
Good morning.

29
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,274
Hey, Fernando, listen.

30
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,352
Pick up the bus
at El Paisnal,

31
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,943
and take it to San Martin.

32
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,080
There are 100 more voters
waiting for you. Hurry.

33
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,182
Come.

34
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,188
Look at them.

35
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,891
(Woman)
We need more voting
papers over here.

36
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,771
I cursed the rain.
I cursed the dirt.

37
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,542
But after the land
was saved,

38
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,174
I knew I loved it, too.

39
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,753
It was ours.

40
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,879
But now,

41
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,083
they came and said
we had to go.

42
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,186
We were only sharecroppers.
We had no rights.

43
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:21,461
When we wouldn't go,
they burned our homes.

44
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,468
They left us with nothing.

45
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,696
It's God's will.

46
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,328
Who says it's God's will?

47
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,374
I think God looks at
these things and vomits!

48
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,711
What's the matter?

49
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,214
Oscar, what are you thinking?

50
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,377
What are you doing?

51
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,510
I am not doing anything.

52
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,921
It is the people that
are doing it, at last.

53
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:50,462
Archbishop Chavez says
you are going too fast.

54
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,326
What do you think?

55
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:01,138
I've always believed in you
and your strength, your ideals.

56
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,472
But some are
even saying you're a...

57
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,446
Sub... subversive, an agitator.

58
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,186
Remember who else
they called such names.

59
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,882
Jesus is not somewhere
up in the clouds...

Lying in a hammock.

61
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:24,187
Jesus is down here with us,
building a kingdom.

62
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,161
Oscar,

63
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,323
what else can I do?

64
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,697
I cannot love God,
whom I do not see,

65
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,600
if I do not love
my brothers and sisters,

66
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,673
whom I can see.

The voters can't get through.

72

Where?

We have to get to

sabotage the election.

Good afternoon,
lieutenant.

85
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:17,466
These people want
to get to the polls.

86
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,546
There are snipers shooting
at anything that moves.

87
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,876
The polls close in 3 hours.

88

I'm sorry, but I
cannot jeopardize...

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,416
The safety of all of these people.

90
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,725
They say the road
is too dangerous.

91
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,924
We'll take the risk!

92
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,002
These buses are not
going anyplace.

93
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:53,141
The lieutenant will not
let us drive to Aguilares,

94
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,682
so...

95
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,011
Shall we walk?

96
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,950
Yes, father!

Come, lieutenant,

98
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,420
you can protect us.

99
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,425
You don't need me.

100
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,395
No terrorist would dare
shoot at the church.

101
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,813
I'll see the jeep
gets back, Monsignor.

102
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,544
A little walk will do you good.

They've been trying
to kill these people.

First, they will have to kill us.

109
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,603
We walk in the
protection of the Lord.

110
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,836
Jesus was vulnerable.
Don't think we're not.

111
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,571
What should we be,
cowards?

112
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,510
Not cowards,
but not heroes either.

113
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,482
Just ordinary people
trying to do our job.

114
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,676
So are the soldiers.

115
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,448
You know, I think
that pretty soon,

116
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,185
they won't allow the Bible
into our country anymore.

117
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,761
All we'll get is the bindings,
because everything inside,

118
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,763
all the pages, will be
declared revolutionary.

119

Taking Archbishop
Chavez's place.

I’m not even a bishop.

But you can talk.
You know the people.

Please sit down,

I think you may
need to sit down.

to know all the answers,

implement them.

It would be our privilege
to offer it to you...

As a home, as a quiet
place to get away to.

The church's job is
to preach the gospel.

409

as a political statement.

I am not trying to make
a political statement.

of confession?

No, not exactly.

432
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,773
Not really.

433
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,714
How can I confess
what I did not do?

434
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,087
Please.

435
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,059
What, then?

00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,069
Maybe you can help me.

437
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,041
How could I
possibly do that?

438

Everyone else is
giving me advice.

439

Mine?

441
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,721

Father Grande?

442
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,286
Yes.

443

I should do?

444
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,060
Will I go to heaven
when I die?

445
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,728
It's so bad here.

446
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,899
Someone has to
take a stand.

447
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,001
I've got to have something
to look forward to.

448
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,282
(Romero over radio)
If this were...

449
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,479
An ordinary funeral,

450
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:01,718
I'd speak of my friendship
with Father Grande.

451
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,020
At crucial moments
in my life,

452
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,622
he was always there,
close to me.

453
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,230
Those times will
never be forgotten.

454
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,334
But this is a moment...

455
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,272
To gather from these
deaths a message,

456
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,545
for all of us who
remain on pilgrimage.

457
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,018
(Romero)
The liberation that
Father Grande preached...

458
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,716
Was a liberation
rooted in faith.

459
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,756
And because it is
so often misunderstood,

460
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,700
for it, Father Rutilio
Grande died.

461
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,507
Who knows?

462
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,773
Perhaps the murderers are
listening to these words.

463
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:03,916
So we want to tell you,
murderous brethren,

464
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,013
that we love you,

465
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:10,992
and that we ask for
repentance in your hearts.

466

This is my wife, Maria,
on our wedding anniversary.

467

This is our house.

00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,002
These are our children.

470

See his face?

471
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:38,814
Always into trouble,
and always good.

472
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,687
You know... a boy.

473
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,526
The soldiers came
and took him,

474
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,362
and now we can't find him.

475
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,527
He has disappeared.

476
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:59,042
We tried to find him.
We went to the police.

477
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,701
We tried everything,

478
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,177
but we can
find out nothing.

479

He has
disappeared.

480
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:48,149
Rafael always calls me
before he leaves the office,

481
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,227
so when he
didn't call me...

482
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,928
why, Rafael?

483
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,458
He works beside
his men in the fields.

484
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,170
He's the Minister
of Agriculture,

485
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,833
but he supports
agrarian reform.

486
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:05,636
We have some money,

487
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,870
but nothing to do with
political prisoners.

488
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,502
Have you told
the police?

489
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,741
You read the
ransom demand.

490
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,477
Have you told your father?

491
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,680
I am afraid of
what he might do.

492
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,618
I called you...

493
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,025
Because you are our friend,

494
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,529
and because you can
help us, can't you?

495
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,231
Please help me.

496
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,742
Good morning,
fathers.

497
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,318
Good morning.

498
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,512
Monsignor, what
brings you here?

499
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,612
I need to ask
your help.

500
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,893
Rafael Zelada
has been kidnapped.

501
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,460
Would either of you have
a way to find out...

502
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,259
Who might have
taken him?

503
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,371
I can't help you, father.

504
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,204
Father Osuna?

505
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,872
I can't, either.

506
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,380
You can't,

507
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,180
or you won't?

508
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,222
Here is your car,
Monsignor.

509
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,547
Hello, Monsignor.

510
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,276
How can I help you?

511
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,717
It can be dangerous to wait
on corners in El Salvador.

512
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,987
I'm trying to find a way to
get Rafael Zelada released.

513
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,618
Why should
I want that?

514
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,321
Money was demanded.

515
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,092
Money is just
icing on the cake.

516
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,760
The real issue is
political prisoners.

517
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,063
Free them, and you'll
find Zelada free.

518
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,834
Think of the family,

519
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,674
of what they're going through.

520
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,640
If I did, he
wouldn't be alive.

521
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,350
We must find other ways
to work these things out.

522
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,982
Excuse me,
Monsignor.

523
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,653
I’ve grown tired
of this conversation.

524
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:46,957
We'll let you off.

525
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,965
Take a look and
see what it's like,

526
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,831
how our people
are forced to live.

527
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,164
Monsignor.

528
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,400
Good morning.

529
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,410
Good morning,
Monsignor.

530
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,340
I have an appointment
with the president-elect.

531
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,442
Yes, Monsignor.

532
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:17,850
I am sorry, Monsignor,

533
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,116
but it's a pity.

534
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,556
The president-elect
has been detained.

535
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,218
I will wait.

536
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,229
The president-elect
expresses his sincere regrets,

537
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,559
but he will have to call you

538
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,099
and reschedule
the appointment...

539
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,634
At the earliest opportunity.

540
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,533
I will wait.

541
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,987
It may be hours.

542
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,318
He is coming back?

543
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,083
Yes.

544
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,655
Give him this.

545
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,251
Monsignor.

546
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:03,887
Monsignor.

547
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,599
I'm afraid the president-elect
hasn't returned,

548
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,796
but he sent you
this note.

549
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,071
Good night,
Monsignor.

550
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,704
Good night.

551
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,967
I've done what they said,
exactly as they told me,

552
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,698
hours and hours ago,
and no word.

553
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,967
Waiting and waiting,
and no word.

554
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,843
I don't know.

555
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,643
There's nothing to do,

556
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,479
and we're waiting.

557
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,985
What else can we do?

558
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,522
There must be something
else we can do.

559
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,592
There should
be word soon.

560
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,861
Soon?

561
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:13,725
How soon is soon?

562
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,272
I’m sorry.

563
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,741
I'm glad you're
here with me.

564
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,437
Of course I'm here.

565
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,718
I hear things,
Monsignor.

566
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,148
What things?

567
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,762
That you're only
sympathetic to the poor.

568
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,802
Not only to the poor.

569
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,133
To radicals.

570
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,701
I must minister to everyone.

571
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,543
To the men who
have taken Rafael?

572
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,293
You are brave,

573
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,954
but how could you think
I wouldn't find out?

574
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,690
Why didn't you
tell me?

575
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,365
This is
my doing, father.

576
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,632
We've done what
they asked.

577
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,207
We've saved him.

578
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,842
Haven't we?

579
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,607
(Arista)
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

580
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,007
They asked for
political prisoners.

581
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:41,914
Perhaps you could...

582
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,646
I could do
no such thing.

583
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:49,049
If they harm him,
it will be our turn,

584
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,387
and there
will be blood.

585
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,428
That can't help.

586
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,793
You church people,

587
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,162
you live in your souls.

588
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,030
You don't understand
what we do;

589
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,070
producing, selling,

590
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,264
bringing dollars in.

591
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,931
Capital to develop
the country,

592
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,170
to create jobs, to build
a prosperous economy.

593
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,212
What does this have
to do with Rafael?

594
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,078
That is what affects people.

595
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,118
(Galedo)
But for that, we must
have law and order.

596
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,846
These priests of yours,

597
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,516
with all their talk about
justice and human rights,

598
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,252
organizing these people,

599
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,794
convincing them
they are God almighty;

600
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,761
they are responsible
for these problems.

601
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,294
And so are you, Monsignor.

602
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,536
But the...

603
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,614
The church is a whore.

604
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:48,343
(Galedo)
She'll spread her legs
to the highest bidder.

605
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,174
Bring him.

606
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,915
Bring him home.

607
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,720
You're a part of this.

608
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,878
[Knock at door]

609
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,351
Monsignor!

610
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,427
We are here to see
Father Alfonso Osuna.

611
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,091
Who?

612
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,999
He's not here.

613
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,231
I am Father Villez,

614
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,240
and I would like
to see Father Osuna.

615
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,139
Father Villez is
the Jesuit provincial,

616
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:28,643
and I'm Archbishop Romero,

617
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,713
and we would like
to see the father.

618
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,117
Could we have
a moment alone, please?

619
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,826
What happened?

620
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,022
I...

621
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:25,525
I was preparing to
celebrate the Eucharist,

622
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,502
and they came,

623
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,869
and they
blindfolded me,

624
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,305
and they brought
me here.

625
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,933
Why?

626
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,912
They said I was responsible
for Zelada's death.

627
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:42,007
They said I was in collusion
with the guerillas.

628
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,450
How could they?

629
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,682
I do know some of them.

630
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,588
But you are not?

631
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,659
You met with
a guerilla, Monsignor.

632
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,664
Does that make you one?

633
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,206
Because Zelada died,
is it my fault?

634
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,711
(Father Osuna)
Is it yours?

635
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,780
What did they do?

636
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,404
They used electricity.

637
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,809
I'm just glad I'm
a priest and celibate,

638
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,153
because I don't think I would
have a choice any longer.

639
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:30,359
[Crying]

640
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,603
Monsignor,

641
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,970
what are you
doing here?

642
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,439
We are here to get
Father Osuna.

643
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,541
Who let you in?

644
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,883
Why was this man
brought here?

645
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,423
He cannot be released.

646
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,230
I do not have the
authority to release him.

647
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:09,328
Who had the authority
to arrest him?

648
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,964
I was carrying out
instructions.

649
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,669
Instructions to
torture him?

650
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,361
(Aide)
Monsignor!
You need an appointment!

651
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,436
Please, Monsignor!

652
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,767
The new Swedish ambassador
will be at the embassy.

653
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:45,739
Hector, I would
like you there.

654
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,639
Monsignor.

655
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,575
How are you?

656
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,441
Fine, thank you.

657
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,811
Good to see you.
Come in.

658
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,850
Can I offer you an aperitif?

659
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,316
No, thank you.

660
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,977
Sit down, please.

661
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,354
Now, what can
I do for you?

662
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,693
I'm sorry to come to you
like this, general,

663
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,529
but this is a matter
of importance.

664
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,693
A few weeks ago,

665
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,328
Father Grande
was assassinated.

666
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,135
Yesterday,
a priest was tortured.

667
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,676
Today, I presided
at a funeral mass...

668
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,645
For Minister of
Agriculture Zelada.

669
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:27,683
This violence
is destroying us.

670
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:31,151
There is trouble on
many sides, Monsignor.

671
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:32,881
Even inside the church.

672
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,786
Elements have
gone astray.

673
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,085
The priests...

674
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,057
Must stay out of politics.

675
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:41,688
But there are political
implications to the gospel.

676
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,266
We will take care of those.

677
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,959
Now, in a week,

678
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,333
I will be inaugurated.

679
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,668
The archbishop
has always attended...

680
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,834
To symbolize
the church’s blessing.

681
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,178
We have not heard
from you, Monsignor.

682
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,579
It would be of great
help to all of us...

683
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,049
If you would be present.

684
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,986
How can I bless a situation...

685
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,319
In which innocent people
are disappearing...

686
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,359
Night after night?

687
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,624
Unfortunately,

688
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,223
I have found it
necessary...

689
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:22,293
To occupy Aguilares
and to close the church,

690
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,066
until there is order again.

691
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,699
You can't do that.

692
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,675
It is a tragedy,

693
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,803
but let's face lt.

694
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,646
This Grande...

695
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,049
we know what they
are doing out there.

696
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,553
We have proof.

697
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,682
Inciting the people,
agitating,

698
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,783
calling political meetings;

699
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:48,625
on the day you
became archbishop,

700
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,757
on the day he was killed,

701
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,428
he was a communist.

702
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,436
Father Grande
was here with me...

703
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:03,478
The day I became archbishop.

704
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,980
(Romero)
On the day
he was killed,

705
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:09,245
it was baptisms
he was performing.

706
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,387
You are a liar.

707
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,363
(Bishop Estrada)
You cannot count
on my support.

708
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,837
I will attend
the inauguration.

709
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,534
It is going to be
a magnificent ceremony.

710
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:37,010
I am military vicar,
and it is my function to go.

711
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,843
Who else?

712
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,476
I will go.

713
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:48,921
This is not an action I wish
to take, or take lightly,

714
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,051
but we mustn't do anything
to give the impression...

715
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,629
We approve of
what is going on.

716
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,666
There is no
persecuted church.

717
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,031
Don't you see what's
going on out there?

718
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,434
There are only sons
of the church...

719
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,131
Who have lost their way,

720
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,265
and put themselves
outside of the law!

721
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,344
Gentlemen, please!

722
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:17,942
I won't go.

723
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,123
Monsignor Flores?

724
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,286
I would like to support
the archbishop,

725
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,261
but I don't agree with him.

726
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:29,729
In fact, I seldom do.

727
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,026
In fact, I think he’s
become a Jesuit dupe.

728
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,898
Except...

729
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,204
Priests are getting killed.

730
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,940
Except I could get killed.

731
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,482
Except it's reprehensible.

732
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,142
So...

733
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,219
I'm not going.

734
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:02,421
This is a scandal,
these divisions,

735
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:06,468
ever since you became
archbishop, Monsignor.

736
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:09,470
Rome is going to be
very unhappy.

Come on, let him go!

(Lucia)
You'll break his arms!

[Shouting in Spanish]

743
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,633
We are here to remove
the blessed sacrament...

744
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,228
While the town is occupied.

745
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,068
This is a barracks.

746
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,904
This is a church.

747
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,739
What are you doing here?

748
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,914
We are here to take care
of the Eucharist.

749

[Gun shots]

750
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,556
Now, get out of here.

751

Now!

752
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,717
(Master Sergeant)
Hey, hey, hey!

753
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:22,828
You again?

Move! Get out!

01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,365
Are you all right?

759
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,053
(Romero)
We are here today...

760
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,620
To retake possession
of this church building,

761
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,892
and to strengthen all those...

762
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,265
Whom the enemies of the
church have trampled down.

763
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:27,306
You should know that you
have not suffered alone,

764
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,004
for you are
the church.

765
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:33,013
You are the
people of God.

766
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:39,318
You are Jesus,
in the here and now.

767
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:43,014
He is crucified in you,

768
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:47,789
just as surely as he was
crucified 2,000 years ago...

769
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,890
On that hill
outside of Jerusalem.

770
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,333
You should know...

771
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:59,374
That your pain and your
suffering, like his,

772
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:05,573
will contribute to El Salvador's
liberation and redemption.

773
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,187
Buenos dias, padre.

774
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,153
Later we will play a game.

Arista.

776
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,569
You could have
come to my office.

777
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,272
I did, but there
were so many people.

778
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,577
Oh, this can be a bit
of a crazy house.

779
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:43,879
I hope it's
a sanctuary.

780
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:47,080
It's time to
baptize my baby.

781
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,292
It's past time.

782
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,088
It would be
my privilege.

783
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,931
I would like to
pick a date.

784
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:59,967
There are baptisms
every Sunday.

785
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,661
The choice is yours.

786
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:07,037
I think the first Sunday
in December would be fine.

787
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,668
That's a good week.
It's not so crowded.

788
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,647
I would like
a private baptism.

789
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,627
We have so many
to baptize now,

790
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,494
we don't have
private ones anymore.

791
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,994
Will you...

792
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,069
you will make an
exception, won't you?

793
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,170
I'm sorry.

794
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,074
You expect me
to baptize my baby

795
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,483
with a bunch of Indians?

796
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,554
You have deserted us.

[Bell jingles]

God bless you.

799
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,400
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

800
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:47,373
It's been a month since
my last confession.

801
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,839
Yes?

802
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,709
I am a believer in the
theology of liberation,

803
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,181
and I have worked in
the people's struggle.

804
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:57,951
That is no sin.

805
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:03,355
No, but I had a belief
in one single man,

806
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:04,721
and in no one else.

807
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,694
That is no sin.

808
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:11,061
Especially not
the archbishop.

809
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,430
I deplored him,
mocked him,

810
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:17,164
laughed at him.

811
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,798
How can I tell him...

812
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,341
I was wrong?

813
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,247
Just pray for him.

814
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,342
Let's make that
your penance.

815
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:36,489
I absolve you in
the name of the father...

and of the holy spirit.

A beautiful
and difficult truth.

824
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,221
Our faith requires...

That we immerse
ourselves in the world.

01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:53,850
Who sees Marxists
and Christians...

997
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:56,890
Struggling to liberate
the same people.

998
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:58,822
Jesus is part of
that struggle.

999
01:29:58,926 --> 01:29:59,756
He would not stand by

1000
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:02,091
and watch his people
being murdered.

1001
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:07,128
So you've become like the
military and the aristocracy.

1002
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:09,926
You wage class warfare.

1003
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:11,265
You become violent.

1004
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:13,932
How can we continue
to speak against violence...

1005
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:17,977
When they keep killing
the people that we love?

1006
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,776
Even you admit we have
the right to defend ourselves.

1007
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:23,942
You're not defending!

1008
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:26,519
You're attacking!

1009
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:32,717
And you’ll lose God,
just as they have!

1010
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:41,631
What else can we do?

1011
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:46,871
You think I want this?
To live like this?

1012
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,116
With what you say,

1013
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:58,777
there'll be no end
to the bloodshed.

1014
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:04,687
I have no choice.

1015
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:26,567
I can't.

1016
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:31,104
You must.

1017
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,177
I'm yours.

1018
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:42,747
Show me the way.

1019
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:16,419
Hey, a priest!

1020
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,185
Bring him over here.

1021
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:28,866
(Woman)
Monsignor!

1022
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,562
Search him.

1023
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,173
Nothing here.

1024
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,505
Maybe he's got
something underneath.

1025
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,636
Let's see.

1026
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:41,772
Take his clothes off.

1027
01:33:41,882 --> 01:33:44,180
I have nothing.

1028
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,583
Strip him.

1029
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:59,157
It's all right.
It's all right.

1030
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:01,325
But you are our voice.

1031
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,164
You speak for us.

1032
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:39,331
Let us begin a celebration
of the mass now.

1033
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:45,778
In the name of the father...

1034
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,574
And of the son...

1035
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,911
And of the holy spirit.
Amen.

1036
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:57,523
The grace of our Lord, Jesus
Christ, and the love of God,

1037
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:00,788
and the fellowship of
the holy spirit be with you all.

1038
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:03,455
And with you.

1039
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:07,866
Lord, you created us
for freedom.

1040
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:10,266
(All)
Lord, have mercy.

1041
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:13,238
Christ, you made us
to live in dignity.

1042
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,865
(All)
Christ, have mercy.

1043
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:20,276
Lord, you strengthen us
in the struggle for justice.

1044
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:23,317
(All)
Lord, have mercy.

1045
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,576
(Lieutenant Columa)
We developed our country.

1046
01:35:27,688 --> 01:35:32,648
We penetrated its jungles,
planted coffee and sugar cane.

1047
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,890
We are like the pioneers
of the united states.

1048
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:40,433
We do not want what
doesn't belong to us.

1049
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:44,026
We only want to have what
the North Americans have.

1050
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:45,833
To live as they do!

1051
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,807
[Cheers and applause]

1052
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:50,240
Bravo!

1053
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:53,204
Bravo!

1054
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:11,662
(Romero)
The mission of the church...

1055
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:16,897
Is to identify itself
with the poor,

1056
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:18,596
and to join with them...

1057
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:21,266
In their struggle for justice.

1058
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:24,875
By so doing,

1059
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:28,813
the church finds
its own salvation!

1060
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:36,949
(Lt. Columa)
The new government
is riddled with communists.

1061
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:40,857
The priests are working
with the guerillas.

1062
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:44,920
All the unions are infiltrated.

1063
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:47,262
(Lt. Columa)
Don't ever feel guilty...

1064
01:36:47,368 --> 01:36:49,563
For having fought
these subversives.

1065
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:53,162
They have declared war
on our way of life.

1066
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,834
Those who fight them,

1067
01:36:55,943 --> 01:36:59,140
they will be national heroes.

1068
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:02,579
I hope that this call
of the church...

1069
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:04,674
Does not further
harden the hearts...

1070
01:37:04,785 --> 01:37:07,219
Of the rich and the powerful,

1071
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:10,654
but will move them
to conversion.

1072
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:13,192
You are the principal
protagonists...

1073
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:16,058
In this hour of change.

1074
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:18,791
On you depends,
in great part,

1075
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:21,834
the end of violence.

1076
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:25,963
There is no clinging
to our feudal past.

1077
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:28,598
This is a new age,

1078
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:32,110
an age in which
all God's children...

1079
01:37:32,213 --> 01:37:33,771
(from radio)
May live in peace,

1080
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:36,611
freedom, and dignity.

1081
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:42,213
I'd like to make an appeal,
in a special way,

1082
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:44,348
to the men in the army.

1083
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,454
Brothers,

1084
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:54,023
each one of you is one of us.

1085
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:56,261
We are the same people.

1086
01:37:58,072 --> 01:38:00,597
The farmers and peasants
that you kill...

1087
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,109
Are your own brothers
and sisters.

1088
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:10,773
When you hear the words
of a man telling you to kill,

1089
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:15,322
think instead
in the words of God!

1090
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:18,858
"Thou shalt not kill!"

1091
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:25,188
No soldier is obliged
to obey an order...

1092
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:27,961
Contrary to the law of God.

1093
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:32,661
In his name,
and in the name...

1094
01:38:32,773 --> 01:38:35,367
Of our tormented people...

1095
01:38:35,476 --> 01:38:38,036
Who have suffered so much,

1096
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:42,980
and whose laments
cry out to heaven,

1097
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:46,246
I implore you,

1098
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,548
I beg you,

1099
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:52,287
I order you,

1100
01:38:53,727 --> 01:38:56,787
stop the repression!

1101
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:09,662
[Gun shot]

1102
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:15,331
[Screams]

1103
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:20,966
(Romero)
I have often been
threatened with death.

1104
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,339
If they kill me,

1105
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:27,403
I shall arise in
the Salvadoran people.

1106
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:30,347
Let my blood
be a seed of freedom,

1107
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:35,013
and the sign that hope
will soon be reality.

1108
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:37,420
A bishop will die,

1109
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:41,585
but the church of God,
which is the people,

1110
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:43,720
will never perish.

1111
01:44:44,005 --> 01:44:45,720
---the end---
