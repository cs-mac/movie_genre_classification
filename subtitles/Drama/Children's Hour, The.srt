1
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,996
# Bring out what's been in me #

2
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,554
# Far too long #

3
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:48,056
# And, uh... #

4
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:54,394
# That's all
I've been dreaming of #

5
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:56,921
# Do me, baby #

6
00:00:56,962 --> 00:01:00,093
# Like you never done before #

7
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:03,513
# Ahh, ooh, give it to me #

8
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:06,588
# Till I just can't take no more #

9
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:12,639
# Come on, do me, baby,
like you never done before #

10
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:16,570
# Ahh, ooh, I want you, babe #

11
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,026
# Like I just can't take no more #

12
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,882
# Ooh, ahh #

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,363
# Hooh-ooh ooh! #

14
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:29,438
# Ooooooooh! #

15
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:30,979
Whoo!

16
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,026
What the hell are you doing?

17
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,476
What the hell?!

18
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:35,646
I didn't tell you to go!
Goddamn!

19
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:37,113
- It was him!
- It was you!

20
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:40,094
Shit! Oh, man!

21
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,042
Ain't nobody listenin' today.

22
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,565
Ladies, you just dented
a '81 Cutlass Supreme.

23
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,296
I need to see your license
and registration.

24
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:48,893
Brother, you OK? You cool?

25
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,678
Ten minutes.
Doors open on my signal.

26
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,146
I'm glad you're here, Lee.

27
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,491
I always feel better
with you watching my back.

28
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:06,592
I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Ambassador.

29
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,485
Stay close today, Lee.

30
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:09,630
We're making history.

31
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:15,163
This is bullshit!
Do you know who I am?

32
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:17,311
My family owns
half of Rodeo Drive.

33
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,844
Do you know who I am?

34
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,991
Detective James Carter, LAPD.

35
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,819
My family owns half of
Crenshaw Boulevard.

36
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:23,781
I want a lawyer.

37
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:25,243
You need a personal trainer.

38
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:26,563
This license says 180 pounds.

39
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:27,940
You weigh more than
the damn car, girl.

40
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:30,243
- I have a thyroid condition.
- Well, stop eating thyroids.

41
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:34,208
Look, can't you just,
like give us a warning or something?

42
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:37,630
That depends.
You girls like Chinese?

43
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:42,019
Excuse me.

44
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,167
Carter.

45
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,669
Lee, we are on for tonight.

46
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,581
I just picked up two girls who wanna
play hide the little Asian policeman.

47
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:50,176
I can't talk now. I'm in the car
with Ambassador Han.

48
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,809
Trust me, these girls
are sushi grade.

49
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:54,052
- We gotta hit this!
- I have to go. I'm sorry.

50
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:55,494
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

51
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,797
You're mad because of what happened
when we was in New York.

52
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:58,846
I don't want to talk about that.

53
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,124
It was three years ago.
When you gonna let it go?

54
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,548
Let it go? Isabella was my girlfriend.

55
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,519
Lee, we're friends, man.

56
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,697
Just come out with me one night.

57
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,646
The mu shu's on me.

58
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,281
Lee!

59
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,926
My mom says hi.

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,871
World Criminal Court

61
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:43,016
The Chinese triads now have
half a million members...

62
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,417
in over 100 countries.

63
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,964
And these are not street kids
shaking down local merchants.

64
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:53,127
These are businessmen who have built
a $50 billion empire...

65
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:56,807
of extortion, drugs, sex and slavery.

66
00:03:56,843 --> 00:04:01,928
We must cut off the head of this snake
before it swallows us whole.

67
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:04,035
As chairman of
the World Criminal Court...

68
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:07,785
I have entrusted my good friend
Ambassador Han to lead the fight...

69
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,688
against the largest criminal
organization in the world.

70
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,485
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

71
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,782
Chairman Reynard,
ladies and gentlemen.

72
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:33,733
The triad society
is built on secrecy.

73
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,897
Nobody knows who these men are,
who controls them, who leads them.

74
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,267
Nobody has known for 500 years.

75
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,945
But today, I stand before you
with a secret of my own.

76
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:48,487
Today, I will disclose information
that affects everyone in this room.

77
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:52,966
After years of searching,
I believe I've finally located Shy Shen.

78
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:57,225
Mr. Ambassador,
Shy Shen does not exist.

79
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,110
Excuse me, who is this Shy Shen?

80
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:01,636
With all due respect, sir, I li...

81
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:13,741
Everybody down!

82
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:15,301
Call an ambulance!

83
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:16,390
Someone get a doctor.

84
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:18,405
Ambassador down,
Ambassador down.

85
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:19,788
Stay with him.

86
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,241
Yugh!

87
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,921
Uh-uh-uh. Keepin' these
till I see you tonight.

88
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,262
Attention all units, shots have been fired
at the World Criminal Court building.

89
00:05:57,297 --> 00:05:59,239
The Chinese Ambassador
has been shot.

90
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,687
Chinese Ambassador?
Move your asses over.

91
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:02,663
- Move over!
- What? Whoa. Shit!

92
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,346
What're you doing?!

93
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,729
Lee!

94
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:49,385
- Where the hell is he goin'?
- Ah!

95
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,282
LAPD! Get the hell outta the way!

96
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:55,981
People are crazy.

97
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:59,787
I'm-a give your ass a ticket
when I come back!

98
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,947
Lee, I'm comin'!

99
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:33,935
Ugh!

100
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,749
Don't move!

101
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,801
Hello, Lee.

102
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,945
Put your hands up, Kenji!

103
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,620
Lee, what're you waiting for?
Shoot me.

104
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,020
Maybe this will help.

105
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,500
Drop the gun or I'll shoot!

106
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,309
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

107
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,168
Kenji!

108
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,454
You see?
I know you too well.

109
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,538
Aaaah!

110
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,752
- Ugh!
- Aaaah!

111
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:46,487
- Ungh.
- Lee, you OK?

112
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,633
We almost killed your ass.
Why you didn't move?

113
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:53,265
Ohh.

114
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:57,102
I'd like for you to meet our dates
for this evenin'. Masha and Zoe.

115
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,072
Urgh.

116
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,534
Fat one's yours.

117
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,902
How many times do you want
me to say it? I'm sorry.

118
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,694
I'm sorry I ran you over, man. Damn!

119
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,974
- Not now, Carter.
- Aww.

120
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,857
All right, hold it right there.
Don't say a word, Carter.

121
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,865
Captain Diel, I had nothin'
to do with this.

122
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,947
All I did was borrow a car,
backed up Lee.

123
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:17,935
Tell him, partner.

124
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:19,385
I need to see Ambassador Han.

125
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,523
The Ambassador
is just out of surgery.

126
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,050
The bullet missed his heart.
He's gonna be OK.

127
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,651
Captain, you have to give me
back my shield...

128
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,479
and put me on this case.
I made one little mistake.

129
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:29,619
- Take a brother off the bench.
- One little mistake?

130
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,317
You handcuffed two women
and stole their car.

131
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:32,882
Isn't that why we have insurance?

132
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:34,516
Everyone has an off day, Captain.

133
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:37,075
Last month you put
six Iranians in jail for a week!

134
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:39,603
You and I both know
them Iranians was terrorists.

135
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,715
They were scientists at UCLA!

136
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:42,770
Big deal.

137
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:44,120
'Cause they cure cancer in rats...

138
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:45,944
that doesn't mean
they won't blow shit up.

139
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,606
Let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

140
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:50,513
Relax, Carter. The LAPD won't
be leading this investigation.

141
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,465
The Ambassador
is my responsibility.

142
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,126
Well, then maybe you could tell me
exactly how that shooter got away.

143
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:57,435
Thought so.

144
00:09:57,468 --> 00:10:00,763
The Ambassador's daughter is coming
to see her father right now.

145
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,650
Make sure nothing happens to her.

146
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,724
Don't worry, Captain,
we're gonna make you proud.

147
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,706
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

148
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,178
She'll come back.

149
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,628
Soo Yung's here?

150
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,318
I haven't seen her
since she was ten years old.

151
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:13,331
She lives in Los Angeles now.

152
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:15,478
Let's go to the gift shop
and get her a little teddy bear.

153
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,062
And a bra.

154
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,050
- Lee!
- Soo Yung.

155
00:10:20,094 --> 00:10:21,719
I'm so glad you're here.

156
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,984
- Detective Carter.
- Soo Yung.

157
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:27,672
- It's been so long.
- So long, Soo Yung.

158
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,887
So... So young.

159
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:32,564
- How is he?
- He's out of surgery.

160
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,515
They said he'll be OK.

161
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,648
Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

162
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,540
It was my fault. I didn't
get to him fast enough.

163
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,978
I want you both to
promise me something.

164
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,981
I want you to find the man
who did this to him.

165
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,022
I want you to find him because
I don't think he'll stop...

166
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:57,405
until my father is dead.

167
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,676
Soo Yung.

168
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,653
I need to hear you say it.

169
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,537
OK, I promise.

170
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:05,523
And so do I.

171
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,129
Thank you.

172
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:15,423
Soo Yung, your father was addressing
the court before he was shot.

173
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:18,838
Two weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope.

174
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,767
He said if anything ever
happened to him...

175
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,939
- I should give it to you.
- Where is it?

176
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:26,588
I put it in my locker at the
kung-fu studio where I teach.

177
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:31,032
It's at 8347 First Street...

178
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:32,927
Chinatown.

179
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,497
Go home, Carter.
This has nothing to do with you.

180
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,610
I made Soo Yung a promise,
the same as you.

181
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,137
This is the business of China.

182
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,633
Well, for your information,
I'm part Chinese now.

183
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,560
That's right, Lee. For the last
three years I've studied...

184
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,535
the ancient teachings of Buddha,
earning two black belts...

185
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,366
in wushu martial arts,
spending every afternoon...

186
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,639
at the Hong Kong Garden massage
parlor on Pico and Bundy.

187
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:01,983
I am half-Chinese, baby.

188
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:04,406
If you're half-Chinese,
I'm half-black.

189
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,352
I'm your brother and I'm fly.
You down with that, Snoopy?

190
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,855
That's dope, isn't it?

191
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:11,800
Sorry, Lee, you can't be black.
There's a height requirement.

192
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:12,988
Same as riding the Matterhorn.

193
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:14,041
Go home, Carter.

194
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,392
I can't leave you, Lee.

195
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,719
Can't leave my brother.

196
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:42,237
All right, listen up!
I need everyone's attention.

197
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:45,538
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee.

198
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:48,354
We need to see Soo Yung's
locker right now.

199
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:51,040
No one's allowed in the back
without the master's permission.

200
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:54,939
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We need to see that locker.

201
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,987
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Carter.

202
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:58,719
Lee, I got this.

203
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:01,953
Hey! Heh heh. Kids.

204
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,804
Listen. Violence will solve nothin'.

205
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:07,968
Now, as the Chinese say, all great
battles are won without fightin'.

206
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,183
- Sorry.
- OK?

207
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,431
I don't know him.

208
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:11,484
Now, let's just calm down
and put this...

209
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,671
- Haa!
- Ow!

210
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,116
God da...

211
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,005
OK...

212
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,672
I tried talkin'.

213
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,128
Hoo! Now I'm about to beat
the puberty out of y'all.

214
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,883
You ain't gonna see it comin'.
You ain't gonna see it comin', come on!

215
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,500
Stop!

216
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,854
Runnin' for your lives.

217
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:33,472
About time y'all showed
some respect around here.

218
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:37,413
- Huh?
- Carter, wait for the master.

219
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:44,705
Whoa! Damn!

220
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,328
Heh, I'm sorry, man.
I thought this was the bathroom.

221
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:48,544
Sorry.

222
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:51,518
Lee, I got a big problem, man.

223
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,829
This boy's on steroids.
He got a head like Barry Bonds.

224
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:55,008
- Oh, no.
- Come on, man.

225
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,989
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaah!

226
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,046
Ah!

227
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,909
Carter, are you OK?

228
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:01,602
Lee, Lee, get him, Lee!

229
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,588
Ooh!

230
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,191
Ahhh! Ah!

231
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:05,541
Ah!

232
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:07,038
Urgh!

233
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,640
Lee, let's get the hell outta...

234
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,142
Aah! My bunions!

235
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:13,120
Yah! Hyah! Mm! Ungh!

236
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,103
- Grr! Rargh!
- Ha ha ha.

237
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,381
Urgh! Whoo!

238
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,791
Oh! Aaaah!

239
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,864
Come on, man, let me go.
I love Chinese people!

240
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:22,432
Aaaah!

241
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,586
Wait. I don't...

242
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,287
Ah!

243
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,848
Urgh!

244
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,994
How do you say "surrender"
in Chinese?

245
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:38,688
Aaaah!

246
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,912
OK. I'm about to slice you up
like a giant California roll!

247
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:44,197
Raaah!

248
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,953
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Ha ha ha. Funny black man.

249
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:51,368
Ooh... Oh! Shit!

250
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:54,374
I'm not playin' no more.

251
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:56,036
Ahh!

252
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,016
Aaah!

253
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:06,374
- Lee, let go!
- Carter!

254
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,410
Grrrrr!

255
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,590
Down! Put us down!

256
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,015
Let me down! I'm sorry!

257
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:17,190
- Aaaaah!
- I'm sorry, man!

258
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:19,082
How the hell did we
get in this mess?

259
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,384
- Ugh!
- Agh!

260
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:35,370
May I help you?

261
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,274
We'll be asking
the questions, old man.

262
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:39,364
- Who are you?
- Yu.

263
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,095
- No, not me. You.
- Yes, I am Yu.

264
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:42,539
Just answer the damn questions.

265
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,198
- Who are you?
- I have told you.

266
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,211
- Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind.

267
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:47,431
I'm not blind, you blind.

268
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:49,771
- That is what I just said.
- You just said what?

269
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:52,357
- I did not say what, I said Yu.
- That's what I'm asking you.

270
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:54,251
- And Yu is answering.
- Shut up!

271
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,179
- You!
- Yes?

272
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:56,227
Not you, him!

273
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:57,414
- What's your name?
- Mi.

274
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,882
- Yes, you!
- I am Mi.

275
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,813
He is Mi, and I am Yu.

276
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:03,715
And I'm about to whup your old ass, man,
'cause I'm sick of playin' games!

277
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,856
You, me, everybody's ass
around here! Him!

278
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,169
- Carter, Carter.
- I'm-a kick his ass.

279
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:09,579
- I'm sick of this.
- Carter, let me handle this.

280
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:10,726
- Lee. No, Lee. No!
- Carter!

281
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:12,391
Go.

282
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,860
My name is Inspector Lee.
We have a key to Soo Yung's locker.

283
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,300
Some men came here this morning.
They had guns.

284
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:23,820
They emptied her locker.
I could not stop them.

285
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,140
You must go to her at once.

286
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:25,785
Why?

287
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,940
They said, she would end up
like her father.

288
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:32,717
Let's go.

289
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,277
I don't know what the hell
you feedin' him...

290
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,133
- but he is too damn big!
- Carter. Go.

291
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,406
Where is everyone?

292
00:16:58,448 --> 00:16:59,942
Where's all the damn cops?

293
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,182
- Lee.
- Where's security?

294
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:08,459
They were called away.

295
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:10,569
W... What's wrong?

296
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,234
Carter.

297
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,119
Aw, this ain't good.

298
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:17,291
They're coming for him.

299
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,758
What do we do?

300
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:32,079
No.

301
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:36,335
No!

302
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,998
Don't move, or I'll
blow your ass cheeks off.

303
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,352
Get back.

304
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:43,662
Ugh!

305
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,417
Who sent you?

306
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,711
Oh!

307
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:52,049
Don't move!

308
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:57,713
Lee, throw me a gun!

309
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:58,957
- Huh?
- Throw me a gun!

310
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,276
- Damn, Lee!
- Huh?

311
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:30,224
Lee! I thought you had my back!

312
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,932
Aaaaaah!

313
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:41,392
Ugh!

314
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:47,442
Soo Yung, one more!

315
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,060
Hyah!

316
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:53,871
Aaaaah!

317
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:57,324
Lee, I'm in trouble!
I need some assistance.

318
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:00,338
Here.

319
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:02,863
It's empty.

320
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,080
What?

321
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:07,826
Hah!

322
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,357
You see? I always got your back.

323
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,885
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun, then?

324
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,814
I didn't know.

325
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:19,985
You almost got me killed, Lee.

326
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:24,173
- Ah! Ahh!
- Who are you? Who sent you?

327
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:29,645
What the hell is that?

328
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:30,702
I think he's speaking French.

329
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:32,631
French? What kind of
Chinaman speak French?

330
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:34,093
Tell him to stop playin' around
and talk right.

331
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:35,696
How can I tell him?
I don't speak French.

332
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,718
Ah!

333
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,508
Talk right, man.

334
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,966
No! You're Asian.
Stop humiliatin' yourself.

335
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:46,162
Shut the hell up.
Shut up. Come here.

336
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,372
We're gonna need a few minutes
alone with this guy.

337
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:50,546
Find someone here
who speaks French, please.

338
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,397
Speak English!

339
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:58,039
Uh, this is Sister Agnes
from the chapel upstairs.

340
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,723
She speaks fluent French and
has agreed to interpret for you.

341
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,549
Sister, we appreciate you doin' this.

342
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:03,513
My pleasure.

343
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,934
Sister Agnes,
please ask who sent him.

344
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:14,392
He says you're both making
a big mistake.

345
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,367
That one day soon
you'll beg for mercy.

346
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:17,751
He also said...

347
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:19,346
What?

348
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,807
Please, Sister, we have to know.

349
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:22,897
There's lives at stake.

350
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,459
Well, he used the N-word.

351
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:27,473
What? The N-word?

352
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:29,521
- You tell this little motherf...
- Carter!

353
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,497
She's a nun.

354
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:37,273
Sister, you tell this piece of S-word
that I will personally F-word him up.

355
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:47,825
Did he say "Negro"?

356
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:50,768
He used the N-word again, but this
time he mentioned your grandmother.

357
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,462
You tell him
that his mama's a H!

358
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:56,565
Carter, I believe "whore" is
spelled with a W.

359
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,807
Right. W. And his sister's a W.

360
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,697
And his grandmama's
a two-bit W...

361
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:02,641
who makes double
'cause she got no teeth!

362
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,374
You tell him I said that.

363
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:17,147
Did he say it again?

364
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,090
No. This time he called...

365
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,686
this gentleman a word
that means "cat"...

366
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:24,343
and another word that rhymes
with "maggot."

367
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:25,428
What?!

368
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,203
Well, you tell him he's an A.W.

369
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,667
Uh, Lee,
"hole" is spelled with a H.

370
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,302
I have a dictionary upstairs.

371
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:34,770
Just call him an asshole.

372
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:42,259
He says you've both been marked
for death, like Han and the girl.

373
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,985
Ooh. Sister, turn your back.
You don't want to see this.

374
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,963
Who is Shy Shen
and how do we find him?

375
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,373
Tell us right now or I'll cut your
B's off and shove 'em in your mouth.

376
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:51,578
- His beads?
- His beads, Sister.

377
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,021
His hairy, stinkin' beads.

378
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,482
Tell me somethin' now.

379
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,893
Lee, give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Lee.

380
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:01,533
It's over, brother. It's over. OK.

381
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:03,093
Who is Shy Shen?!

382
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:04,083
What did he say, Sister?

383
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,501
He said "shoot me."

384
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,954
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

385
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,438
- I'm sorry.
- I am trying to kill somebody, man.

386
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,064
Damn. OK.

387
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,280
You better tell me
something right now.

388
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,399
I'll send you right to heaven, man.

389
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:18,781
- I don't even care no more.
- Carter.

390
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:21,849
I'm marked for death.
I ain't got nothin' to lose.

391
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,735
That's right, Sister. Call the Lord and
tell him he 'bout to have some company.

392
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:26,623
Carter, stop.

393
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:28,542
Tell me something!

394
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:30,485
- Carter, enough.
- Oh, she's almost done.

395
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:32,863
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned!

396
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:34,651
He says wait!

397
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,871
- What did he say?
- 50 Franklin D. Roosevelt.

398
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:41,016
Genevieve.

399
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:42,779
Thank you.

400
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,300
Nice workin' with ya, Sister.

401
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:47,831
Anytime, brother.

402
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:51,391
50 FDR.

403
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:53,279
- It's an address.
- It's a wild goose chase.

404
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:55,702
Every city in America has
a street named after Roosevelt.

405
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:57,817
- And who is Genevieve?
- I don't know.

406
00:22:57,857 --> 00:23:00,410
Soo Yung, we're getting you
out of here.

407
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:02,010
- Why?
- It's not safe for you here.

408
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,227
I won't leave him.

409
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:04,858
We have no choice.

410
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:30,946
- Soo Yung.
- Mr. Reynard.

411
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:33,658
I'm glad your father is OK.

412
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:35,358
My people won't leave his side.

413
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:37,021
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

414
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:38,302
So, let's go.

415
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:40,510
- Ah.
- Wh... Where am I going?

416
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:43,776
We're getting out of Los Angeles.
It's not safe for us.

417
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:45,851
Just a few days, Soo Yung.
I promise.

418
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,445
You'll come with me
and my family to Paris.

419
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,465
OK.

420
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:58,400
Wait.

421
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,762
You made me a promise.

422
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:05,187
Don't forget.

423
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:17,119
My God.

424
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,184
We got a assassin in custody
who only speaks French...

425
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:23,708
a limo blows up
at the French Consulate...

426
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:27,524
and the next meeting of the World
Court is in Paris, two days from now.

427
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:28,735
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

428
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:29,755
Yeah.

429
00:24:29,797 --> 00:24:31,488
That we go to Fiji,
we hide out for a year...

430
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:33,281
maybe change our names,
get jobs as bartenders...

431
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:34,594
and I'm-a call you Kiko.

432
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,347
We have to find Shy Shen
before he finds us.

433
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:38,756
We're going to Paris, aren't we?

434
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,447
Yes. Tonight.

435
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:53,605
Did you know the average French woman
is naked 34 percent of the time?

436
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:55,329
We are not going there
to meet women.

437
00:24:57,607 --> 00:25:00,258
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up.

438
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:03,078
Hook me up?
After what you did to Isabella?

439
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,704
It was an accident.

440
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:06,085
Besides, you never even
slept with her.

441
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,540
Thanks to you.
It was going to happen.

442
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,925
But you just had to ruin it.

443
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,137
What did I do that was so terrible?

444
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,630
You shot my girlfriend.
In the neck!

445
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:14,948
There's nothing else to say.

446
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:16,096
It's not like she died.

447
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:19,038
So she has droopy eyes.
So she works at El Poco Loco.

448
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,487
That was temporary.

449
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,941
As soon as she could blink,
the Secret Service took her back.

450
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:25,886
You know what your problem is?
You need to relax, have some fun.

451
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:28,481
You have too much rice in your diet.
You're constipated.

452
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,981
I never should have brought you.

453
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,365
Face it, you need me, brother.

454
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,696
I don't need anyone.
And please don't call me brother.

455
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:35,676
What is this?

456
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,826
Underground gentleman's club
in Paris.

457
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:39,588
"Club La Passe"? Forget it.

458
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,697
Check out the address.

459
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:44,039
"50 Franklin D... Roosevelt."

460
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:46,276
Like I said, you need me.

461
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:50,820
'Scuse me. Can we have one
gefilte fish and some Ex-Lax?

462
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,583
Where the bags at, man?

463
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:03,296
Excuse me, gentlemen.

464
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:06,240
Commissaire Revi of the DST.
Would you please come with me?

465
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:07,526
Why?

466
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:10,180
Just need to ask you
a few questions.

467
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:13,601
Oh! Oh! Man!
Goddamn, man!

468
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:17,352
Oh! Man, this is by far the
worst airport I ever been to.

469
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:18,947
Oh!

470
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:20,481
- Ooph!
- Ah, man!

471
00:26:20,523 --> 00:26:22,792
Now that I have your attention,
why don't you tell me...

472
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,866
what you cops are looking for
here in Paris.

473
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:27,143
I told you, man. We on vacation.

474
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,586
Just taking in the sights.

475
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,954
Gentlemen, this is my city...

476
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:33,638
and I'm responsible
if two stupid cops come here...

477
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,229
and get their heads
blown off by the triads.

478
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:40,228
Now, I can't force you to leave,
but I can make the suggestion.

479
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:44,806
After all, I found this dirty
little gun inside your jacket.

480
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:48,641
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

481
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:50,178
Do we understand each other?

482
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,227
Do we understand each other?

483
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,286
Excellent. It was wonderful
meeting you both.

484
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,809
So we can go now?

485
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:02,633
This will just take a moment.

486
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,359
Welcome to Paris.

487
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:05,803
Oh, shit.

488
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,867
Ohh. Ohhh.

489
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:20,104
- Ahh.
- Where you go?

490
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:22,029
- Ugh.
- 50 Franklin, uh...

491
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:23,076
D. Roosevelt.

492
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:24,906
No. Get out.

493
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:26,502
- What?
- I don't drive his kind.

494
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,003
- My kind?
- Americans.

495
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,355
I don't drive Americans.

496
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:31,299
- But I'm Chinese.
- Yeah, but you're with him...

497
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:33,065
and they're the most
violent people on earth.

498
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,339
Always starting wars,
always killing people.

499
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:36,967
Americans make me sick.

500
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,948
Look, man, we are not
in the mood for this.

501
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,608
Me and my partner just got
violated by a small Frenchman.

502
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:43,140
Wearing a very large ring.

503
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:46,630
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals
who always resort to violence.

504
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,077
Always push around the little guy.

505
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,835
Hey, that stuff ain't true.
America's not violent!

506
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:51,726
Come on, America is a joke.

507
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:53,646
You lost in Vietnam,
you lost in Iraq.

508
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,100
You can't even beat the Europeans
in basketball anymore.

509
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:57,550
The Dream Team is dead.

510
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,853
Ha ha. I didn't hear you, man.

511
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,188
Talk about the NBA again,
I dare ya. I double-dare ya.

512
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,394
Even your skinny women disgust me.

513
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,220
- Halle Berry.
- Wh...? Aw, hell no.

514
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:07,400
Now you done gone too far.

515
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,934
You want violence,
smelly Frenchman? Huh?

516
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:10,634
Do you want violence?
Well, you got it!

517
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,560
- Carter, put the gun down.
- Say you love America.

518
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,893
I love America.
Please, don't kill me.

519
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:16,205
Sing the national anthem!

520
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,944
Not that one, man!
Sing the American one.

521
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,294
Don't know it.

522
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:25,605
# Oh, say can you see #

523
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:29,383
# Oh, say can you see #

524
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:32,971
# By the dawn's early light #

525
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:35,878
# Ah-doo da-doo-dee light... #

526
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:06,673
Wait for us here, George.

527
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:22,185
Ooh la la. Lee.

528
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,754
Carter, stay focused.

529
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,421
We're looking for Genevieve.

530
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,656
Let's split up.
I'll take the women.

531
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,610
Carter. James Carter.

532
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:01,901
I know you probably don't
understand a word I'm saying...

533
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:03,185
but I gotta tell you...

534
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:05,523
you're the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in my life.

535
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:07,696
And I'd like to strip you down
and butter you...

536
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:09,588
like a slice of Wonder Bread.

537
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:13,233
And shave your armpits and pour
honey all over your naked body.

538
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,270
And for the next two weeks
pretend I was a hungry bear.

539
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,566
Well, James Carter,
I happen to speak six languages.

540
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:22,192
One of 'em English?

541
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,742
Are you in or out?

542
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:30,827
Money plays.

543
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,757
Sir, it's a thousand-euro minimum.

544
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,197
How much I'm short?

545
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,118
930 euros.

546
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:38,223
- Heh.
- It's OK.

547
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:39,954
Let him play.

548
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:41,006
Thank you.

549
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,290
Changez.

550
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:43,255
- Changez.
- Changez.

551
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:44,236
Changez?

552
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,435
I'm looking for Genevieve.

553
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:09,521
Maybe I can help you.

554
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:15,215
Do you know what
I hate about cops?

555
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:18,898
Even when they're
with a woman...

556
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:22,198
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man.

557
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:24,884
Who is Shy Shen?

558
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:26,198
See what I mean?

559
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:31,732
Come upstairs, cop.
I'll give you what you want.

560
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:39,223
- Hit me.
- Monsieur, this is baccarat.

561
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:40,436
I know that!

562
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,678
You think I don't know
baccarack when I play it?

563
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:44,438
When I was a kid,
me and my friends and I...

564
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:46,100
used to hang out in front of
the Magic Johnson Theater...

565
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,243
and play baccarack all night long.

566
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,169
Now hit me.

567
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,035
Three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

568
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:03,257
Three kings is a zero.

569
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,680
You have the worst possible hand.
You lose.

570
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,184
What?

571
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:11,314
Ah, madame has a 7.

572
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:13,690
She wins 100,000 euros. Bravo.

573
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,277
Mr. Carter, it appears you have
brought me luck.

574
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,617
I'd like to bring you
breakfast in bed.

575
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:23,920
Excuse me.

576
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:33,722
Way to go, Lee.

577
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:35,861
Today, my boy becomes a man.

578
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,320
Why are you helping me?

579
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,658
Maybe I'm helping myself.

580
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,515
How do I find Genevieve?

581
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:45,818
I see you like to get right to it.

582
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,446
Do you know Shy Shen?

583
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:51,100
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

584
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,410
Yes, please.

585
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,347
Someone's gonna die here tonight.

586
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,939
And it's you.

587
00:33:02,973 --> 00:33:04,217
- Huh! Huh!
- Ugh!

588
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:06,261
- Huh!
- Ahh!

589
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,455
Unh!

590
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:11,868
- Unh!
- Ah!

591
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,062
- Uh!
- Urgh! Ah!

592
00:33:15,102 --> 00:33:18,299
Ohh! Ah! Oh!

593
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,636
Ugh! Grrrrr!

594
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:23,798
Ohhh!

595
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,333
Ohhh!

596
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,546
Ah! Ahhh!

597
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:29,722
- Nngh! Guh!
- Oh! Ah!

598
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,838
- Gnnh!
- Ahhh!

599
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,123
Come on, crouching tiger,
don't hide that dragon.

600
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,654
- Uh!
- Aaah!

601
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:00,249
Do it, Lee.
You tear that ass up.

602
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,144
- Ahh!
- Oh, oh!

603
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:14,104
You are a super freak!

604
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:15,455
Carter!

605
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,667
Oh!

606
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:17,981
- Run!
- Oh!

607
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,564
- Ahh!
- Sorry.

608
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:27,358
- You got a boyfriend?
- Carter!

609
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,977
Start the car.

610
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,377
- Start the car!
- Drive fast!

611
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:56,219
Carter. Look!

612
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:58,909
Uh, George?
We need you to go faster, man.

613
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:00,060
No. Forget it.

614
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,231
You wanna kill me,
then go ahead, kill me.

615
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,242
- Ahh!
- Drive faster!

616
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:09,472
Please! I'm scared!

617
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,034
George, you watch
American movies?

618
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,091
- Yeah.
- OK, man. All right.

619
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:14,139
Listen, you're a super-spy.

620
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,668
A super-spy.

621
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,359
Now drive this cab.

622
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:20,989
- Come on.
- OK.

623
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,587
I'm a super-spy.

624
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,708
Oh, shit, George. Go!

625
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:41,946
- Aah!
- George...

626
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,647
When I tell you to,
hit the brakes.

627
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:48,581
Now!

628
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:55,104
Oh, they got guns, Lee!

629
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:56,866
- Ungh!
- Ah!

630
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:00,899
- Ungh!
- Back up!

631
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,193
Argh!

632
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,294
Way to go, George.

633
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:18,628
It's OK.

634
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:23,587
Uh!

635
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:24,571
Aah!

636
00:36:25,512 --> 00:36:26,460
Hey!

637
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,383
I got this one.

638
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:38,948
Aah!

639
00:36:38,984 --> 00:36:41,089
Oh! Whoa! He's got my leg!

640
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,678
Aaaah!

641
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,214
Lee! God!

642
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:49,763
- Aaaaah!
- Hold m...

643
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,848
Ah!

644
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,634
Get your own damn cab.

645
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:06,471
Ow!

646
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:07,880
Lee!

647
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:09,539
- Urgh!
- Yah!

648
00:37:10,857 --> 00:37:12,133
Yeah! Whoa!

649
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:13,478
- Ungh!
- Oh!

650
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:16,264
The French are neutral!
This is not my fight!

651
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:17,246
This is not...!

652
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:23,875
Ah! Lee, I'm alive.

653
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:25,769
My whole life flashed in front of me.

654
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:27,461
In three years I'll be married
to a Chinese woman.

655
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:30,182
We had three kids looked just
like you, only a little darker.

656
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:31,145
- Carter.
- What?

657
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,934
Put your hands up.

658
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,792
What you talkin' 'bout?

659
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:36,582
Whoa!

660
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,723
Some people say the modern world
was invented...

661
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:58,439
when the French built
these sewers.

662
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,608
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour.

663
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:04,775
A marvel that no one ever sees.

664
00:38:04,812 --> 00:38:06,853
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

665
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:08,266
Lee, you know this clown?

666
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:12,010
Go on, Lee. Tell him who I am.
Don't be shy.

667
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,986
Introduce him
to your shyong dih.

668
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:16,679
Shyong dih? Your brother?

669
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:18,243
He doesn't talk about me much.

670
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:21,220
In fact, he's spent his whole
life trying to forget me.

671
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:23,781
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

672
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:26,341
had a brother on the
wrong side of the law?

673
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,770
You're not my brother anymore.

674
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,560
Are you forgetting about Chenzhou?

675
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:32,305
Yes, I forgot.

676
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,305
You spared my life in Los Angeles.

677
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,320
You could have shot me in that alley.
But you didn't pull the trigger,

678
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:41,485
because you can't escape your past.

679
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,440
I didn't kill you because
I'm not an assasin.

680
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:47,461
Let me repay the favor, Lee.

681
00:38:47,502 --> 00:38:51,114
I'll allow you to live if you
promise to leave Paris tonight.

682
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,801
You got a deal. Thank you
for showin' us the sewer.

683
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:56,391
Listen, that's a badass suit.
Let's get the hell outta here.

684
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,918
What about Han and his daughter?

685
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,617
There is nothing I can do for them.

686
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:04,362
- I have no choice.
- Then I have no choice.

687
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:07,399
Well, I guess he's stayin'.
Who wanna take me to the airport?

688
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:11,464
We'll always be brothers, Lee.

689
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:13,892
In this life and the next.

690
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:19,727
Tell me, Kenji, who's Shy Shen?

691
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:24,107
Some secrets are worth dying for.

692
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,214
Oh. OK. A... All right. OK.

693
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,669
Lee, what the hell is goin' on?

694
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,647
Go!

695
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:39,469
Hey, which way, man?

696
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:51,281
- Shit, Lee, it's locked!
- Over here!

697
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:52,939
- Lee!
- We have to jump!

698
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:56,359
- Ooph.
- Oh, that's the sewer!

699
00:39:56,401 --> 00:39:58,344
- Hell no, Lee!
- No choice!

700
00:39:58,386 --> 00:39:59,564
- I'd rather die.
- Come on!

701
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:02,380
Oh!

702
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:06,858
Shi-i-i-i-i-it!

703
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:12,427
I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

704
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:22,991
Bonjour. Welcome to
the Plaza Athenee.

705
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:24,073
How may I help you?

706
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:27,115
It's great to see you again.
It's been too long.

707
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:28,562
Yes, far too long, sir.

708
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,443
Listen, I need a big suite,
two beds, two showers...

709
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:34,858
a massage therapist, some new
clothes and a case of Old Spice.

710
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:41,070
It's all your fault. How come
you didn't tell me about Kenji?

711
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:43,278
It was none of your business.

712
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:47,058
In case you missed it, man,
people are tryin' to kill me.

713
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,809
I'm covered in shit and some
French cops whupped my ass...

714
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:51,120
with some Yellow Pages, man.

715
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,683
So don't tell me it ain't
none of my business.

716
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:54,152
You're lucky we're not
in Hong Kong.

717
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:55,625
Phone book is twice as big.

718
00:40:55,668 --> 00:40:57,773
Why you didn't tell me
you had a brother, man?

719
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,639
Oh, hell, no...

720
00:41:03,477 --> 00:41:04,425
- Lady.
- Oui?

721
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:06,989
This damn dog just pissed on me.

722
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,621
Good girl.

723
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,806
You know what I think?

724
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:16,812
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

725
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,762
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA.

726
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:22,638
Maybe you let him go.

727
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:26,988
The yakuza killed his family in Tokyo.
He was sent to China when he was 7.

728
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,308
He was put in Chenzhou,
the orphanage where I grew up.

729
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,422
We kept each other alive.

730
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:36,658
You protected each other.
And you're still protectin' him.

731
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,955
I call him shyong dih.

732
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,380
He was like my brother.

733
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:44,397
And then I left him.

734
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,348
You was adopted.
What choice did you have?

735
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:48,397
He ended up on the streets.

736
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:51,405
You could never understand.

737
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:52,973
I understand, man.
I got a brother.

738
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:53,963
My little brother Perry.

739
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:56,146
We used to be best friends.
Now we don't even speak.

740
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,802
He think I tipped off the cops about
his chicken fights in his garage.

741
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:01,228
Can you believe that?
My own brother think I'm a snitch.

742
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,995
Just 'cause my chicken lost
in the semifinals.

743
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:03,959
I didn't even really care.

744
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:05,202
- Carter.
- Fight was fixed, man.

745
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:07,126
My bird was fightin' a chicken
that didn't make his weight.

746
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,174
And he still went the distance.

747
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:10,517
He had a lotta heart.
And he was delicious.

748
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:13,868
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

749
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:15,406
Lemme help you, man.
I'm-a tell you right now...

750
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:16,909
whatever Kenji's
tellin' you, it ain't true.

751
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,571
- He ain't your brother.
- And you are not my brother.

752
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:22,070
Huh.

753
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:26,191
Fine.

754
00:42:26,232 --> 00:42:28,404
I'm not your brother.

755
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:42,544
# What have I got to do
to make you love me? #

756
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:49,398
# Sorry seems to be
the hardest word #

757
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,196
- # It's sad #
- # So sad #

758
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:55,892
# So sad #

759
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:59,607
# It's a sad, sad situation #

760
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:03,952
# And it's getting
more and more absurd #

761
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,024
Wow. Holy smokes!

762
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,561
- # It's sad #
- Crash landing!

763
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:11,472
- # So sad #
- Short Round... step on it!

764
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:14,330
Okey-dokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

765
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:16,916
# Always seems to me #

766
00:43:16,955 --> 00:43:18,133
# That sorry... #

767
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:21,945
Yes, I would like to order
some fried chicken, please.

768
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,249
Oh, and some sweet-potato pie.

769
00:43:25,243 --> 00:43:26,192
Merci.

770
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:28,569
Enjoy your mu shu, sir.

771
00:43:28,604 --> 00:43:30,513
- Merci.
- Goodbye.

772
00:43:32,316 --> 00:43:33,974
# East Coast girl are 'ip #

773
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:38,419
# I really dig those styles
they wear #

774
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:41,842
# And southern girls
with the way they talk #

775
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:45,627
# They knock me out
when I'm down there #

776
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,694
# The Midwest
farmers' daughters #

777
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:52,245
# Really make you feel all right #

778
00:43:52,285 --> 00:43:55,765
# And the northern girls
with the way they kiss #

779
00:43:55,804 --> 00:43:59,700
# They keep their boyfriend
warm at night #

780
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:03,319
# I wish they all could
be California #

781
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:06,707
# I wish they all
could be California #

782
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,165
# I wish they all
could be California...  #

783
00:44:10,205 --> 00:44:12,148
Hm. "Genevieve."

784
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:21,085
Phew.

785
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:27,508
- Oh.
- Hello, Inspector.

786
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,859
Minister Reynard.

787
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:31,643
They want to kill me.
Me and my family.

788
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:33,653
A dozen agents
from the French secret police...

789
00:44:33,694 --> 00:44:36,597
have already been murdered...
only this last month.

790
00:44:36,638 --> 00:44:39,126
We are at war with the triads,
right here in my own city.

791
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,759
Who is Shy Shen?

792
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:43,995
Ah, Shy Shen... uh...
Shy Shen is not a person.

793
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:45,460
It's a list.

794
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:47,643
- A list?
- Yes.

795
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,527
Every 5 years, the triad bosses
come together...

796
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,855
for an election, and during that
ceremony they choose the men...

797
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:56,157
who will lead the triads.

798
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,331
- Dragon heads.
- Yes.

799
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:00,539
13 dragon heads who will control...

800
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:03,194
the largest criminal organization
in the world.

801
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:07,771
And their 13 names are inscribed
on the list known as Shy Shen.

802
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:10,590
A list which has been handed
down and kept secret...

803
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,341
from generation to generation.

804
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,929
If the names on that list
were ever to get out...

805
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:19,067
well, the secret society
wouldn't be so secret anymore...

806
00:45:19,105 --> 00:45:21,975
and they would all end up in jail,
or dead.

807
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:23,675
And the list is somewhere in Paris?

808
00:45:23,712 --> 00:45:28,055
A young lady named Genevieve
made contact with Ambassador Han...

809
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:30,007
and we believe she knows where it is.

810
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:35,354
I'm asking for your help, Inspector.

811
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:38,426
Finish what Ambassador Han started.

812
00:45:38,465 --> 00:45:43,288
Get to the girl before the triads
do and you'll get Shy Shen.

813
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,343
Ha ha ha!

814
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,023
Ca va, oui, oui, voulez-vous.

815
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:23,481
I don't understand.
Who are you?

816
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:25,466
- Who am I?
- Oui.

817
00:46:25,507 --> 00:46:29,184
I'm Bubbles.
The new costume designer!

818
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,194
Has anyone seen Genevieve?

819
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:32,927
Uh, she has her own dressing room.

820
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:34,371
Ah.

821
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:37,181
Wait. Bubbles.

822
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:39,965
Uh, do we look OK?

823
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,519
No. No, no.

824
00:46:51,557 --> 00:46:53,117
These costumes are terrible!

825
00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:55,840
Ladies, please, we have work to do!

826
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:37,311
First, I will dress the blondes.

827
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:45,573
And then...

828
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:47,779
the brunettes.

829
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:52,902
And finally...

830
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,462
the hybrids.

831
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,391
The Lord have truly bless you all
with tremendous talent...

832
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:05,090
trust me.

833
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:11,106
And some of you have
what I like to call...

834
00:48:11,145 --> 00:48:14,440
silver-dollar potential.

835
00:48:20,712 --> 00:48:22,884
# Vous avez lu l'histoire
de Jesse James? #

836
00:48:25,258 --> 00:48:28,258

838
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:35,871
# Et bien... #

839
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:38,019
Lee! What you doin' here?

840
00:48:38,058 --> 00:48:38,985
What are you doing here?

841
00:48:39,018 --> 00:48:40,643
- I found Genevieve.
- So did I.

842
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:42,308
- They're gonna kill her.
- What?

843
00:48:42,346 --> 00:48:44,168
- Look.
- # Comment il vcut #

844
00:48:44,203 --> 00:48:47,552
# Comment il est mort #

845

# Ca vous a plu, hein? #

846
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,975
- Lee, you get the lights,
I'll get the girl.  - Oh.

847
00:48:52,011 --> 00:48:55,273
# Et bien, coutez I'histoire #

# Moi, lorsque j'ai connu

# Qu'est-ce qu'on

864
00:50:00,046 --> 00:50:02,381
- Your life is in danger.
- What the hell's going on?

865
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:06,091
You step into that spotlight, it's
the last step you ever gonna take.

866
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:08,711
They're gonna kill you right now.

867
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,133
- Who are you?
- # On est bien oblig #

00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,434
James Carter, LAPD.

870
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,958
# Bonnie and Clyde #

871
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:20,235
Sorry, James.
It's time for my solo.

872
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:23,173
# Bonnie and Clyde #

873
00:50:27,631 --> 00:50:29,803
You gotta come with me now, girl.

874
00:50:41,743 --> 00:50:44,427
# The closer I get to you #

875
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:54,600
# The more you make me see #

876
00:50:56,785 --> 00:51:02,797
# By giving me all you've got #

877
00:51:04,337 --> 00:51:10,599
# Your love has captured
meee-ee-ee #

878
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:15,017
# Over and over again #

879
00:51:15,057 --> 00:51:18,986
# I tried to tell myself that we #

880
00:51:19,026 --> 00:51:22,769
# Could never be
more than friends #

881
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:23,849
# And all the while #

882
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,948
# Inside I knew it was real #

883
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:33,867
# The way you make me feel #

884
00:51:33,907 --> 00:51:37,583
# Sweeter and sweeter
love grows #

885
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,619
# And heaven's there for those #

886
00:51:40,658 --> 00:51:42,414
- What's happening?
- # Who fooled...  #

887
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:47,563
Get your hands off me!

888
00:51:47,603 --> 00:51:49,163
We are friends of Ambassador Han.

889
00:51:49,203 --> 00:51:50,665
Trust us, girl.

890
00:52:09,107 --> 00:52:10,318
Taxi.

891
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:12,080
Taxi!

892
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:13,426
- Get in.
- It's George!

893
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,889
Go, go, go.

894
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:20,428
I've been looking for you
all day, my friend.

895
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:21,484
We need to talk.

896
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:23,565
Forget it, George.
We're not paying for any damages.

897
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:25,546
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want you to pay.

898
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:28,589
I wanna ask if I could
drive you full time no charge.

899
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:29,611
Why you want to drive us?

900
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:32,915
Today was amazing.
The guns, the shooting.

901
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,219
Now I understand
what it is to be an American.

902
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:37,872
Please, I'm begging you.
Let me be your driver.

903
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:40,462
Let me kill someone tonight!

904
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:42,476
You'll never be an American, OK?

905
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:44,623
I'll drink this shit
all day if I have to.

906
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,938
Just give me a chance.

907
00:52:45,974 --> 00:52:47,862
All right, fine.
Get us to the Plaza, fast.

908
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:49,934
You got it, boss.

909
00:52:49,974 --> 00:52:50,902
Hold on.

910
00:53:00,118 --> 00:53:02,574
So you think she stole this
Shy Shen list from the triads?

911
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:04,437
Only one way to find out.

912
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:05,878
You thinking what I'm thinking?

913
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,213
We need her to talk.
Get her relaxed.

914
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:10,319
Maybe open up some wine
from the minibar.

915
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:11,820
Wow.

916
00:53:15,544 --> 00:53:16,886
Maybe we should put on
a dirty movie.

917
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:18,861
- Lee!
- Only 9.95.

918
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,562
This our chance to find Shy Shen.

919
00:53:21,592 --> 00:53:23,152
I'm goin' in.

920
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:24,435
What's wrong with you?

921
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:25,781
Wait, let me go with you.

922
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,709
Some things a man has to do
on his own.

923
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,912
You OK?

924
00:53:37,944 --> 00:53:39,984
Kenji must have figured out
what I've done.

925
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,999
I'm as good as dead.

926
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:45,839
You stole the list, didn't you?
You tried to sell it to Han?

927
00:53:47,193 --> 00:53:50,805
You don't get it.
I'm one of them.

928
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:53,394
And if I'm dead, you're dead.

929
00:54:00,185 --> 00:54:05,368
Hey, we're safe.
No one knows we're here.

930
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:06,645
Just relax.

931
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:09,998
No one is safe.

932
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,384
I'm marked.

933
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:12,563
Trust me.

934
00:54:12,602 --> 00:54:14,063
Now why should I trust you?

935
00:54:14,106 --> 00:54:15,862
As the Chinese say...

936
00:54:18,618 --> 00:54:19,862
What does that mean?

937
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:22,581
"A donkey's lips will not fit
on a horse's mouth."

938
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:26,099
I'm not sure how that applies.

939
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:31,542
Well, I was just thinking
you had nice lips.

940
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:35,024
That's all.

941
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,739
You saved my life today.
Thank you, Carter.

942
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,397
Oh, please. Call me James.

943
00:54:41,436 --> 00:54:42,744
Or Stallion.

944
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,009
No one's saved me
in a long time.

945
00:54:46,043 --> 00:54:47,384
How can I repay you?

946
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,946
You got 20 bucks?

947
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:52,977
How 'bout ten?

948
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:56,060
Oh, man. Mmm.

949
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:57,172
- James.
- What?

950
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,521
- I'm bad.
- I'm bad too.

951
00:54:58,556 --> 00:54:59,636
I'm a bad girl.

952
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:01,532
Hallelujah!

953
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:11,260
Oh, yeah.
That's it, baby. Yeah. Uh-oh.

954
00:55:11,293 --> 00:55:12,886
Ha ha. Oh, yeah. That's it, baby.

955
00:55:12,924 --> 00:55:15,259
Oh, yeah. Bite that ear.
Punish that ear.

956
00:55:15,293 --> 00:55:16,602
Do what you wanna do.

957
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:18,492
Oh, baby... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

958
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:19,932
My nipples are sensitive.
Be careful down there.

959
00:55:19,965 --> 00:55:22,071
I've never been with
an American man before.

960
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,189
Neither have I.

961
00:55:23,229 --> 00:55:25,651
I feel so safe with you.
Do you want me?

962
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:28,890
Ha. How you say "Twice now
and once in the shower" in French?

963
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:31,260
Wait here. I'm going
to the bathroom.

964
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:33,181
Make myself more comfortable.

965
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:36,060
You need some matches?

966
00:55:36,094 --> 00:55:38,777
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

967
00:55:41,598 --> 00:55:42,743
Hello, room service?

968
00:55:42,782 --> 00:55:44,790
Send me up a bottle of honey
and some Red Bull.

969
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:14,751
Do you like it?

970
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:17,751
No wonder Lance Armstrong came
all the way here to ride a bike.

971
00:56:18,848 --> 00:56:20,309
Merci beaucoup.

972
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:25,470
Oui, baby, oui!

973
00:56:27,744 --> 00:56:29,632
Oh, yeah.

974
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:33,855
Voulez... vous
coucher avec moi, baby?

975
00:56:34,816 --> 00:56:36,344
Je t'aime.

976
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:37,629
Voulez-vous.

977
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:39,006
Oh, yeah.

978
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,626
Je t'aime, baby, je t'aime!

979
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:45,880
Freeze! Don't move!

980
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:48,704
Ah! Shit! Damn!

981
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:57,750
- I'm shot.
- It's OK, it's OK.

982
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,070
It's just a flesh wound.
It's OK. Gen...

983
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:00,218
Genevieve, Genevieve,
let me help you.

984
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:01,185
- Let me help you, baby.
- I'm terribly sorry.

985
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,363
- I'm OK.
- Where you going?

986
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:04,191
Je... Damn.

987
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:06,462
So we even now, huh?
Is that it?

988
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:08,091
I shoot your girl,
you shoot my girl?

989
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,690
I was trying to save your life.

990
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:10,843
Well, you couldn't
wait five minutes?

991
00:57:10,882 --> 00:57:12,737
We... We was about to
make love, man!

992
00:57:12,771 --> 00:57:13,698
And you ruin it.

993
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,797
They will be coming for us.
We have to get out of here now.

994
00:57:16,835 --> 00:57:18,842
You hear that?
We have to get out of here now.

995
00:57:18,883 --> 00:57:20,770
- Damn, Lee! Damn you.
- Sorry.

996
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,626
Next time I'm getting
my own damn room.

997
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,041
Get them out, George.

998
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,628
These people are danger,
they're bleeding.

999
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,194
How can you bring them
to our home?

1000
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:33,853
Paulette, there is something
you should know.

1001
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:35,517
I'm not what you think I am.

1002
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:38,434
Are you telling me you're gay?

1003
00:57:43,012 --> 00:57:46,689
I'm trying tell you...
I'm an American spy.

1004
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:48,218
Ha. You a spy?

1005
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,234
Yes, I'm working undercover
with the police.

1006
00:57:50,276 --> 00:57:51,421
We're about to crack a big case!

1007
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:54,111
Shut your mouth, George.
Not another word.

1008
00:57:54,149 --> 00:57:57,280
You're a stupid cab driver, like
your father was a stupid cab driver.

1009
00:57:57,317 --> 00:57:58,724
What kind of case could you crack?

1010
00:57:58,757 --> 00:58:00,033
Can't talk about it.

1011
00:58:02,085 --> 00:58:06,046
From this moment on, don't ever
ask me about my business!

1012
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:09,114
Come with me, schmuck. Now.

1013
00:58:15,365 --> 00:58:16,827
We need to get out of the city.

1014
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,968
We're not going anywhere till you
tell us exactly what's going on.

1015
00:58:20,005 --> 00:58:21,500
Did you steal that list
from the triads?

1016
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:24,542
Genevieve, we cannot help you
until you tell us the truth.

1017
00:58:24,582 --> 00:58:26,523
Where is Shy Shen?

1018
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,331
It's right here.

1019
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:33,572
Holy mother of Jesus!
She's a man.

1020
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:36,159
I went to second base
with a damn Frenchman.

1021
00:58:36,198 --> 00:58:37,508
It's The Crying Games.

1022
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:39,365
I'm Brokeback Carter. Oh, God.

1023
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:41,089
I'm not a man. It's just a wig.

1024
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:43,266
You sure about that? Huh?

1025
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:44,961
Lee, go over there
and check the hardware.

1026
00:58:44,998 --> 00:58:47,170
If she got anything in her bag
bigger than a three-iron...

1027
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:48,451
we gonna beat his ass!

1028
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:50,942
I'm a woman, James.
A woman who needs a way out.

1029
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:52,227
You have to help me.

1030
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,206
- You have Shy Shen?
- No.

1031
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:56,156
I am Shy Shen.

1032
00:59:03,528 --> 00:59:07,303
In ancient times, when the triads
would select new leaders...

1033
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:10,052
they would secretly tattoo
the names onto a woman...

1034
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:14,085
a woman who could carry
the list of Shy Shen...

1035
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:16,673
to the 35 provinces of China.

1036
00:59:16,712 --> 00:59:20,062
When her journey ended and
the new leaders were informed...

1037
00:59:20,105 --> 00:59:23,204
the woman would be beheaded
and buried forever.

1038
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:25,575
No records, no witnesses.

1039
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:27,267
What type of tradition is that?

1040
00:59:27,305 --> 00:59:29,409
Have these guys ever heard of
a damn fax machine?

1041
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,199
Kenji made me do it,
said it was a great honor.

1042
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:35,103
I wanted to do it for him.
For the brotherhood.

1043
00:59:35,145 --> 00:59:36,706
Then why did you
send the names to Han?

1044
00:59:36,745 --> 00:59:39,200
Because I thought the World Court
could protect me.

1045
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,925
But now I see... nobody can.

1046
00:59:41,962 --> 00:59:44,231
You are messed up
in some weird shit, lady.

1047
00:59:44,265 --> 00:59:46,087
I mean man.
Whatever the hell you are.

1048
00:59:46,122 --> 00:59:47,464
I'm a woman!

1049
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:50,694
And they will send a army to
kill me. To protect their way.

1050
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,902
You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

1051
00:59:52,938 --> 00:59:55,010
Who gonna protect me? I mean us?

1052
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:57,089
I know a place.

1053
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:08,585
I won't be here
when you come out. I'm sorry.

1054
01:00:08,618 --> 01:00:12,448
My wife says I can't be a spy,
that I have to be home for dinner.

1055
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:15,655
The truth is I'm a driver.
Nothing more.

1056
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:17,350
This is my destiny.

1057
01:00:17,387 --> 01:00:19,940
I will never know what it's like
to be an American.

1058
01:00:19,979 --> 01:00:22,729
Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

1059
01:00:22,764 --> 01:00:24,454
George, it's OK.

1060
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,948
Thank you.

1061
01:00:26,988 --> 01:00:29,192
Au revoir. And good luck.

1062
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:31,530
- Au revoir.
- Bye, George.

1063
01:00:39,532 --> 01:00:41,224
Minister Reynard.

1064
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:43,523
We have it.

1065
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:48,748
The Shy Shen list?
This is incredible.

1066
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:50,057
Some people said it was a myth.

1067
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:52,777
Naw, it's no myth.
I've seen it. Felt it.

1068
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:54,569
Kissed it.
But I didn't French kiss it.

1069
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:56,515
You do understand
how dangerous this is?

1070
01:00:56,558 --> 01:00:57,932
I was gonna use protection.

1071
01:00:57,965 --> 01:00:59,688
Can we go to the police?

1072
01:00:59,725 --> 01:01:02,343
The triads control
too many of them here.

1073
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:04,618
We have to get you
out of the country.

1074
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:06,858
Now, my dear...

1075
01:01:06,893 --> 01:01:10,636
would you mind taking off that
wig and showing us Shy Shen?

1076
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,524
We never told him she was the list.

1077
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:23,336
Look at that. 13 names linked
to centuries of tradition.

1078
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:26,408
The only real proof
that their secret world exists.

1079
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:35,177
Ugh!

1080
01:01:35,215 --> 01:01:36,874
Genevieve, get their guns.

1081
01:01:46,128 --> 01:01:48,015
I told you he was bad.
Didn't I tell you?

1082
01:01:48,048 --> 01:01:49,706
No.

1083
01:01:49,744 --> 01:01:50,823
Well, I was thinkin' it.

1084
01:01:50,864 --> 01:01:52,173
The explosion at the embassy.

1085
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,866
As head of
the World Criminal Court...

1086
01:01:53,904 --> 01:01:56,009
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

1087
01:01:56,048 --> 01:01:57,509
Why did you come to my room?

1088
01:01:57,552 --> 01:01:59,691
Genevieve was going to be killed.

1089
01:01:59,728 --> 01:02:03,885
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

1090
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:06,092
Now, it will end another way.

1091
01:02:06,129 --> 01:02:09,162
Ha ha. It's over, Reynard.

1092
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,590
You know what it's like
for old men in prison?

1093
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:14,568
They call you "pops."
They make you work in the library.

1094
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:16,878
Your best friend? Gonna be a mouse.

1095
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,643
I'm not going to prison.

1096
01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:23,820
You have a phone call, Inspector.

1097
01:02:29,682 --> 01:02:31,787
Hello, brother.

1098
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:33,484
I'd like to make a trade.

1099
01:02:33,522 --> 01:02:37,264
Some friends of mine came across
something in Los Angeles.

1100
01:02:37,297 --> 01:02:39,632
Something very valuable.

1101
01:02:40,594 --> 01:02:42,155
Lee.

1102
01:02:42,194 --> 01:02:44,169
Help me, please.

1103
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:48,652
Do we understand each other?

1104
01:02:48,691 --> 01:02:49,770
What do you want?

1105
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,469
Shy Shen.

1106
01:02:51,507 --> 01:02:54,257
You and Genevieve
will meet me alone tonight.

1107
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:58,601
If I see your partner
or any other cops, the girl dies.

1108
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,621
Where?

1109
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:05,645
Jules Verne restaurant, midnight.
Don't be late.

1110
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,040
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

1111
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:14,766
Welcome to the party, Lee.

1112
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:18,283
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Shy Shen...

1113
01:04:18,327 --> 01:04:21,175
and the return of my brother.

1114
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:22,800
Where is Soo Yung?

1115
01:04:30,551 --> 01:04:31,664
Ungh.

1116
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:40,560
This sword has a past.

1117
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,178
And like ours, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

1118
01:04:44,216 --> 01:04:45,809
Urgh!

1119
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:51,410
Hundreds of years ago the triads
would kill their enemies...

1120
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:53,685
with 100 cuts to the body.

1121
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,103
They would be very careful to
avoid any major arteries...

1122
01:04:57,144 --> 01:05:00,690
so that the victim would stay
alive for as long as possible.

1123
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:05,296
You have just experienced
your first cut.

1124
01:05:06,265 --> 01:05:08,404
If anything happens to Soo Yung...

1125
01:05:09,817 --> 01:05:13,298
You could never kill me, Lee.
We both know that.

1126
01:05:13,337 --> 01:05:15,344
You know nothing about me.

1127
01:05:15,385 --> 01:05:19,858
I know you have no wife,
no children, no family.

1128
01:05:19,897 --> 01:05:23,094
Your life ended when we were kids,
back in Chenzhou.

1129
01:05:28,282 --> 01:05:31,216
You have nothing. Just like me.

1130
01:05:32,282 --> 01:05:34,137
I wouldn't say nothin'!

1131
01:05:38,395 --> 01:05:40,729
He has me.

1132
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:42,901
His brother from another mother.

1133
01:05:49,147 --> 01:05:50,521
Where is she?

1134
01:05:50,555 --> 01:05:52,245
Enjoying the view.

1135
01:05:55,803 --> 01:05:56,981
Soo Yung!

1136
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,579
Lee!

1137
01:06:00,091 --> 01:06:01,586
Help.

1138
01:06:03,739 --> 01:06:04,949
Let her go.

1139
01:06:04,988 --> 01:06:06,450
What the hell is wrong with you?

1140
01:06:06,492 --> 01:06:07,987
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

1141
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:09,588
Get her in here!

1142
01:06:10,492 --> 01:06:12,314
Carter, drop the gun.

1143
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:13,722
Get her off that damn rope,
or I'm shootin' you...

1144
01:06:13,756 --> 01:06:15,349
and the damn Temptations.

1145
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,469
Right now!

1146
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:20,178
Oh, no! Lee!

1147
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:23,002
Lee.

1148
01:06:23,036 --> 01:06:24,661
- Do it!
- Put her down!

1149
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:26,228
I'm serious!

1150
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:28,634
I'm not playin'!

1151
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:31,090
You ain't my damn brother.

1152
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:32,213
Kenji.

1153
01:06:32,253 --> 01:06:34,140
- Drop the gun.
- No.

1154
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:35,221
Drop it, Carter.

1155
01:06:36,222 --> 01:06:37,651
Shit.

1156
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,286
Damn it.

1157
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,277
- Tonight I lose a brother.
- Aah!

1158
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:54,131
Get him, Lee!

1159
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:57,656
Gonna get your ass kicked, Kenji.

1160
01:07:09,823 --> 01:07:11,711
Come on, kill him already!

1161
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:21,724
Lee, he might be your brother,
but turn him into your sister.

1162
01:07:37,728 --> 01:07:38,743
Watch out!

1163
01:07:43,456 --> 01:07:45,017
Yeah!

1164
01:07:45,056 --> 01:07:46,714
Bring your little ass here.
Come here.

1165
01:07:49,344 --> 01:07:51,384
Aaaargh.

1166
01:07:51,425 --> 01:07:52,701
Give me your hand.

1167
01:07:57,313 --> 01:07:58,742
Nnngh!

1168
01:08:01,345 --> 01:08:03,647
Ah!

1169
01:08:05,473 --> 01:08:07,295
- Grrrah!
- Aaaah!

1170
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,036
Lee? Lee!

1171
01:08:11,073 --> 01:08:13,179
- Gnn!
- Hold on, I'm comin'!

1172
01:08:20,674 --> 01:08:22,103
Get the hell off me.

1173
01:08:28,258 --> 01:08:29,436
Oh.

1174
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:41,340
Yeah, Lee!

1175
01:08:42,211 --> 01:08:43,902
Whoo!

1176
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:46,076
Whoa!

1177
01:09:22,021 --> 01:09:24,028
Yaaaaah!

1178
01:09:30,086 --> 01:09:31,613
Ah! Ahhhh!

1179
01:09:31,654 --> 01:09:33,988
Ahh... ah...

1180
01:09:34,022 --> 01:09:35,778
Ahhhh! God da...

1181
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:09,028
Enough, Kenji!

1182
01:10:09,063 --> 01:10:10,656
Grrrargh!

1183
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:20,486
Aaaaah!

1184
01:10:27,945 --> 01:10:30,432
Rrrraaaargh!

1185
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:39,717
Rrrraargh!

1186
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:43,076
Hoh hoh hoh hoh
hoh hoh hoh!

1187
01:10:44,361 --> 01:10:48,071
# Everybody was
kung-fu fightin' #

1188
01:10:48,105 --> 01:10:50,310
# The man was fast as ligh...  #

1189
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:51,938
Soo Yung!

1190
01:10:55,465 --> 01:10:57,124
Aaaaah!

1191
01:11:04,074 --> 01:11:06,463
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1192
01:11:10,218 --> 01:11:11,429
Ah!

1193
01:11:13,098 --> 01:11:14,626
Ungh!

1194
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:20,739
Let go.

1195
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:22,153
Or we're both gonna die.

1196
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:23,747
No! I can save you.

1197
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:26,561
Ungh. Grrn.

1198
01:11:30,604 --> 01:11:31,880
Guh.

1199
01:11:33,387 --> 01:11:34,499
Goodbye, Lee.

1200
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:35,750
No, Kenji!

1201
01:11:40,044 --> 01:11:42,117
No!

1202
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:47,204
Aaah!

1203
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,580
Ah...

1204
01:11:57,132 --> 01:11:58,560
Gah!

1205
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:00,485
Unh.

1206
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:05,031
Aaaah!

1207
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:12,074
I'm comin', Soo Yung!

1208
01:12:16,718 --> 01:12:18,659
Oh, my God!

1209
01:12:19,758 --> 01:12:22,146
What the hell am I doin' up here?

1210
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:25,128
Aah! Help.

1211
01:12:28,078 --> 01:12:30,412
Stay cool, lady.
This doesn't have to end this way.

1212
01:12:31,758 --> 01:12:34,311
Don't do it. Don't do it, lady.

1213
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,041
Don't you do it!

1214
01:12:36,846 --> 01:12:38,275
Think about what you doin'.

1215
01:12:38,318 --> 01:12:39,747
Please.

1216
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,481
Please. No.

1217
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:43,045
Hey. Hey!

1218
01:12:44,046 --> 01:12:46,349
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

1219
01:12:46,383 --> 01:12:48,205
No.

1220
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:51,369
Please.

1221
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:53,862
Aaah! Oh, no! No!

1222
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:55,692
No!

1223
01:12:55,727 --> 01:12:57,189
Aaaah!

1224
01:12:57,231 --> 01:12:58,279
Ah!

1225
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,174
Aaah!

1226
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:01,996
Ah! Aaah!

1227
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:03,526
Ah! Aaaaaaah!

1228
01:13:03,568 --> 01:13:04,844
Oh! Oh.

1229
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:05,828
Oh.

1230
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:20,519
Huh!

1231
01:13:21,136 --> 01:13:23,591
Uh! Uh!

1232
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,640
Uh!

1233
01:13:29,585 --> 01:13:32,105
Lee! You shoulda seen us, man.
We whupped their ass.

1234
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:34,283
Soo Yung!

1235
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,914
I'm OK.

1236
01:13:37,905 --> 01:13:38,952
Oh, shit!

1237
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:42,096
Call the police.

1238
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:16,807
Ungh!

1239
01:14:29,204 --> 01:14:31,211
Ohhhhh!

1240
01:14:35,829 --> 01:14:36,973
Ah... yah!

1241
01:14:37,011 --> 01:14:38,288
Yeah!

1242
01:14:38,324 --> 01:14:39,534
Whoa! Whoa!

1243
01:14:39,572 --> 01:14:41,645
Whoa-oa! Whoa!

1244
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,310
Rah! Hah! Carter!

1245
01:14:43,348 --> 01:14:44,755
- Hold on!
- Aaah!

1246
01:14:45,364 --> 01:14:47,884
Ah! Yaaaaah!

1247
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:49,298
- Aaaaah!
- Aaah!

1248
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,926
Gnn.

1249
01:14:50,965 --> 01:14:51,947
Ah! Oh!

1250
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:54,029
- Hang on!
- Lee! Reel me in.

1251
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:56,338
- I got you!
- Black people don't fly.

1252
01:14:56,372 --> 01:14:57,999
Get me up. Get me up.

1253
01:14:58,037 --> 01:14:59,978
Come on, man. Hurry up.

1254
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:01,232
Ungh.

1255
01:15:01,269 --> 01:15:04,116
Oh! Lee! Get me outta here!

1256
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:07,149
Ungh. Argh. Ah.

1257
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:08,269
Don't let go of that flag!

1258
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,935
- Argh.
- Ah!

1259
01:15:09,974 --> 01:15:11,981
Ungh.

1260
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:13,297
Ah!

1261
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:15,439
- Ah.
- Thank you, Lee.

1262
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,124
Carter! Hold on to the flag!

1263
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:23,596
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1264
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:25,679
- Aaaaah!
- Aaaaah!

1265
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:30,194
- Aaaaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

1266
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,692
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1267
01:15:31,734 --> 01:15:32,749
Aaaah!

1268
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:34,765
Aaaaaaaah!

1269
01:15:41,815 --> 01:15:45,492
Lee, I'm gonna kill you
if we don't die!

1270
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:50,037
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

1271
01:15:50,071 --> 01:15:53,235
Oh, dear Lord, please!
Baby Jesus, help us!

1272
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:58,678
- Aaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaah!

1273
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,479
Lee! Where you at?

1274
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,789
I'm drownin'! I'm drownin'!

1275
01:16:04,824 --> 01:16:07,213
Get this thing off me, Lee!

1276
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:13,007
- Carter.
- What?

1277
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:15,732
I'm not constipated anymore.

1278
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:26,769
Put your hands up.

1279
01:16:26,809 --> 01:16:27,888
Genevieve.

1280
01:16:27,929 --> 01:16:30,068
Hey, man, you're the head
of the World Court.

1281
01:16:30,105 --> 01:16:32,244
What you gonna do,
shoot us down like animals?

1282
01:16:32,281 --> 01:16:33,558
We're police officers.

1283
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:36,343
Yes. And you two
just killed this girl.

1284
01:16:36,378 --> 01:16:37,719
Blew her brains out.

1285
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:40,820
- Carter!
- Don't do it!

1286
01:17:02,363 --> 01:17:03,737
Carter.

1287
01:17:03,771 --> 01:17:06,192
- You all right?
- Put the gun down.

1288
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:07,926
I followed you.

1289
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:11,990
Case closed.

1290
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:20,244
Good job, man.

1291
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:32,312
Hey, man! You touch me again...

1292
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:33,843
you gonna owe me
dinner and a movie.

1293
01:17:33,885 --> 01:17:34,964
Congratulations.

1294
01:17:35,004 --> 01:17:37,972
It appears we have finally
brought down the triads.

1295
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:39,670
- We?!
- You didn't do shit.

1296
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:40,985
My butt still hurts.

1297
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:43,410
The Americans and the French...

1298
01:17:43,453 --> 01:17:45,974
need to work together
in the spirit of brotherhood.

1299
01:17:46,013 --> 01:17:47,868
Together, we can do anything.

1300
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:49,462
Anything! Ha ha ha.

1301
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:51,508
He's right, Lee.
Together, we can do anything.

1302
01:17:51,548 --> 01:17:52,531
You go this way...

1303
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:54,035
And I'll go that way.

1304
01:17:57,278 --> 01:17:58,204
# War #

1305
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:00,278
# Huh, yeah #

1306
01:18:00,318 --> 01:18:02,205
# What is it good for? #

1307
01:18:02,237 --> 01:18:03,732
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1308
01:18:03,773 --> 01:18:05,530
# Uh-huh #

1309
01:18:05,566 --> 01:18:06,494
# War #

1310
01:18:06,526 --> 01:18:08,348
# Huh, yeah #

1311
01:18:08,382 --> 01:18:10,553
# What is it good for? #

1312
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,116
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1313
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:13,652
# Say it again, y'all #

1314
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:14,622
# War #

1315
01:18:14,654 --> 01:18:16,793
# Huh, look out #

1316
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,772
# What is it good for? #

1317
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:20,222
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1318
01:18:20,255 --> 01:18:21,181
# Listen to me #

1319
01:18:21,215 --> 01:18:22,459
# Ohhhh, war! #

1320
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:25,529
That's right, Lee.
For the last 3 years...

1321
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,509
I've studied the ancient teaching
of booty. Ev...

1322
01:18:27,551 --> 01:18:29,526
Oh, booty. Ha ha ha ha!

1323
01:18:29,567 --> 01:18:30,974
Cheese!

1324
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,600
- Ha ha ha!
- "Cheese"?

1325
01:18:32,639 --> 01:18:34,908
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- What?

1326
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:37,082
- Freeze.
- Oh, freeze!

1327
01:18:37,983 --> 01:18:40,405
As soon as she could blink,
the s... seafood service...

1328
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:42,204
- Seaf... seafood...
- Secret Service.

1329
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,483
As soon as sh... she could blink...

1330
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,374
the sheafood shervish...
Uh, swa...

1331
01:18:45,408 --> 01:18:46,520
Secret Service.

1332
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,927
The ssssseaf...

1333
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,651
Secret, not seafood.

1334
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:52,029
I know seafood.

1335
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:53,309
- I know secret.
- Secret.

1336
01:18:53,344 --> 01:18:54,871
- Secret.
- Secret. See?

1337
01:18:54,912 --> 01:18:57,661
But when everything together,
it become a seafood!

1338
01:18:57,697 --> 01:18:59,703
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1339
01:18:59,745 --> 01:19:01,435
Action!

1340
01:19:01,472 --> 01:19:03,643
- I'm sorry! So sorry.
- It came off.

1341
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:05,023
Action!

1342
01:19:05,057 --> 01:19:06,551
- Oh, shit. You all right?
- Yeah, good.

1343
01:19:06,593 --> 01:19:09,211
That was my...
Muhammad Ali swing, man!

1344
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:10,972
Yeah, baby!

1345
01:19:13,377 --> 01:19:14,392
Ooh.

1346
01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:16,343
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1347
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:18,043
- That's the one, Mama.
- That would have been it.

1348
01:19:18,082 --> 01:19:19,161
I'm sick of you, Kenji.

1349
01:19:19,201 --> 01:19:22,463
You been tryin' to kill us ever
since the start of this damn movie.

1350
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:25,431
- Raaaaah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1351
01:19:25,473 --> 01:19:26,968
Ah!

1352
01:19:27,649 --> 01:19:28,729
Ah!

1353
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:29,718
Action.

1354
01:19:31,202 --> 01:19:32,347
Action.

1355
01:19:33,153 --> 01:19:34,201
Action.

1356
01:19:34,242 --> 01:19:35,518
Ooph!

1357
01:19:35,554 --> 01:19:36,831
You OK?

1358
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:40,375
So her eye is a little
droopy now and she's...

1359
01:19:40,418 --> 01:19:42,361
So she's working for
El Loc... Lar El Poco.

1360
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:43,645
- Ha ha ha.

1361
01:19:43,683 --> 01:19:44,991

01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,907
El Lo... Loro Poco. Uh.

1365
01:19:50,947 --> 01:19:52,026
El Poco Loco.

1366
01:19:52,066 --> 01:19:53,147

El Pollo Loco.

1376
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:17,888
The mom's gone.

1377
01:20:19,012 --> 01:20:20,539
Maybe we should
put on a dirty movie.

1378
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:21,857
Lee!

1379
01:20:21,892 --> 01:20:23,900
- I like the ones with a story.
- What?

1380
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,210
- I like the one with
a locker-room scene.  - What?

1381
01:20:26,245 --> 01:20:27,674
I like the one with a prison scene.

1382
01:20:27,717 --> 01:20:29,027
I like the one with a shower scene.

1383
01:20:29,061 --> 01:20:30,468
I like the ones with a white girl.

1384
01:20:30,501 --> 01:20:31,843
I'm into feet.

1385
01:20:31,877 --> 01:20:33,502
I like the one with the horses.

1386
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:35,134
- What's that mean?
- Damn.

1387
01:20:35,173 --> 01:20:36,318
What he teach me?

1388
01:20:36,357 --> 01:20:37,503
That's it, one more, one more.
Last one.

1389
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,882
Are you teaching me a bad word?

1390
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:40,379
I like the one with hairy woman.

1391
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:41,500
What's wrong with you?

1392
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:42,654
I don't know. Brett Ratner tell...

1393
01:20:42,693 --> 01:20:44,581
- teach me that.
- He'll teach you anything.

1394
01:20:44,613 --> 01:20:46,206
And you're not my brother.

1395
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:48,996
I'm not your brother?

1396
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:50,939
All the stuff we've been through?

1397
01:20:52,422 --> 01:20:54,016
Rush Hour 1, Rush Hour 2?

1398
01:20:55,078 --> 01:20:56,933
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
