1
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,160
Hold on.

2
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,640
- Hilary!
- What?

3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
Keys.

4
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,200
- Hey! Whoo!
- You couldn't handle it.

5
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
What's up?

6
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,080
<i>Get out ofhere!</i>

7
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,440
<i>Now, these are a collector's item.</i>

8
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,960
<i>You've got me on hold
for 10 minutes already.</i>

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,320
<i>Look at that.
There's only 39 left.</i>

10
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh, I love that hat.

11
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,760
And Roger Callahan...

12
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
and Misty Ryan...

13
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,640
and the Kinsella boy...

14
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,160
<i>and-and his sister...
what's her name?</i>

15
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,760
<i>- Rosemary.
- Rosemary. Exactly.</i>

16
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,920
Out of that whole gang,
you were the smartest.

17
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,560
- You had the best report cards.
- The best report cards.

18
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,640
<i>And now she's a Realtor.</i>

19
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
<i>She has a Cadillac
with a sign on it.</i>

20
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,080
<i>Hello. Hello?</i>

21
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,920
Hmm. Could you at least put out
the cigarette while you eat?

22
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,720
<i>Hello. Oh, look at that!
There's only 15 left.</i>

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,440
<i>Well, how 'bout
the business course, then?</i>

24
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,240
<i>You could go back. You could.</i>

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,360
Then call Danny.

26
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
<i>Tell...</i>

27
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,360
- A guy cheats on you once.
- Don't.

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,960
<i>And you walk out on him
like he shot somebody.</i>

29
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,920
<i>Go back to him,
yell at him, holler at him...</i>

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,640
but make something happen,
Hilary, for once in your life.

31
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,880
<i>At least he supported you.</i>

32
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
You missed it, Mom.

33
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,480
Didn't know it was gonna happen quite
that fast, though. Isn't she something?

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
16 Nob Hill?

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
- Right up those stairs, miss.
- Thanks.

36
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,720
Uh, straight back and to the right.

37
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,680
Thank you.

38
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,920
Will you please! You too! Here.

39
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,000
Hi. What's happening?

40
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,000
Take a seat.
Fill this out, please.

41
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,440
Hi.

42
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Does anybody have a pen?

43
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,880
Thank you for coming.
We'll be in touch with the agency.

44
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,400
Ms. O'Neil.

45
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,120
Hi.

46
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I know you're nervous. Yes.

47
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,000
- Please, have a seat.
- Everything's in place, so relax.

48
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,520
<i>Yes, bags are packed.
Plane is waiting. Hotel is waiting.</i>

49
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,760
<i>All ofJapan is waiting.</i>

50
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,320
She's not on the agency list, David.

51
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,720
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

52
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,560
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

53
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,400
- I have my personal briefs in the suitcase with my socks.
- You're not on the agency list.

54
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,840
Oh, no.
I'm answering the ad.

55
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,920
The very moment, Marvin,
the second. Yes, I promise.

56
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
<i>Right. Listen, Marvin.</i>

57
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,080
<i>I have to... I have to go.</i>

58
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,680
<i>- Take a pill, Marvin, please.
I'll see you in Japan.</i>

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
Excuse me.

60
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,480
<i>- Ah, yes, Miss...
- O'Neil.</i>

61
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm afraid, Miss O'Neil...

62
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,480
my son ran this ad...

63
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,240
<i>and, uh, long story short,
I need a nurse for my son.</i>

64
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,760
- Are you a nurse?
- No, but I thought that it said...

65
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,440
- I mean, only a few things...
- I'm sorry.

66
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,160
Thank you for coming.

67
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,560
No, thank you for having me.

68
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,280
<i>- Give her cab fare, David.
- I don't want cab fare.</i>

69
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,800
<i>- Give her cab fare.
- I don't want your goddamn cab fare!</i>

70
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,680
Give her cab fare
and hire the last nurse we saw.

71
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,440
Miss. Miss, please, come back.

72
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,960
Miss, the farther we go down,
the farther we must go back up.

73
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm not going back up.

74
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Understand, this is my duty.

75
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,880
If I'm required to chase you back to,
God forbid, Oakland, I will.

76
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,240
Oh, what a marvelous day.

77
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,400
Yes, all... all right.

78
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,000
And I quote,
"There has been a terrible mistake.

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,520
Would you please come back to the house
for an informal interview downstairs?"

80
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,240
- Downstairs?
- Yes. Please?

81
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,840
Go ahead. It's all right.

82
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,760
<i>Yes. Please come in.</i>

83
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
I'm Victor Geddes.

84
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,680
<i>- Trapped.
- Hey, what's goin' on here?</i>

85
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
No, no. L... I'm sorry.

86
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,920
Ajoke. Um, an icebreaker.

87
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,720
Oh. Well, I can see
why the job's still open.

88
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,200
<i>- Ms. O'Neil?
- Hilary. Yeah.</i>

89
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,080
Hilary.

90
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,960
<i>Good.</i>

91
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,000
This is going very well.

92
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
How old are you?

93
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,880
<i>- Twenty-three.
- I'm 28.</i>

94
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,440
<i>You are not a nurse.</i>

95
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,280
<i>- No, I am not a nurse.
- But you were a candy striper?</i>

96
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,560
Well, yeah, in school...

97
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,880
<i>but I dropped out.</i>

98
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,760
Well, I was in
Future Nurses of America.

99
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,360
I was the vice president.
Alert the media.

100
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,280
No, that's...

101
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,040
<i>- What did you do?
- We went to the hospital after school.</i>

102
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,960
<i>- Mercy?
- Uh, Our Lady.</i>

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
- Oakland.
- It's where I'm from.

104
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,280
<i>I interrupted.</i>

105
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,680
<i>- Oh, right. I dropped out.
- You worked there?</i>

106
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,240
Right. Well, the sisters...
You didn't go to Catholic school?

107
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,880
<i>The sisters at the hospital talked
to the sisters at the school...</i>

108
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,440
and if we did something like, um...

109
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,120
wear a skirt too short
or committed some mortal sin...

110
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
such as French kissing...

111
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
Ah.

112
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,200
<i>Then we got the terrific
duties at the hospital.</i>

113
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
- Bed pans.
- Bed pans.

114
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
Changing sheets.

115
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,840
<i>Uh, cleaning all kinds of things.</i>

116
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,760
But sometimes they let us
change the babies...

117
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,360
and then point them out
to their parents through the glass...

118
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
<i>hold them up.</i>

119
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,480
That's about it.

120
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
I have leukemia.

121
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I've had it for, uh, 10 years.

122
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm 28. Uh... I said that.

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,720
<i>So, since high school.</i>

124
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,160
<i>U- Uh, not the whole time.</i>

125
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,280
<i>I've had remissions.
I've led a pretty normal life.</i>

126
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,520
Been to Europe.

127
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,280
Finished college. Ran the dash.

128
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,880
<i>The hundred.</i>

129
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,240
You're not the first woman
in my house.

130
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,160
<i>I, uh...</i>

131
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,040
<i>Do you know anything
about chemotherapy?</i>

132
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,720
Well, I know it's a treatment for...

133
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,680
They give me a course of it
every time I fail their blood test.

134
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,880
It, uh...

135
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,800
it's pretty...

136
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,680
Well, I need help during it.

137
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,120
Want the job?

138
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,920
You make it sound so attractive.

139
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,440
<i>Your father said...</i>

140
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,280
Forget my father.

141
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,000
<i>- Well, he said you needed a nurse.
- Forget what he said.</i>

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,840
<i>- Well, if he's the one hiring...
- He's not hiring.</i>

143
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,080
He is flying toJapan
in a luxurious airplane. I am hiring.

144
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,240
Uh, if you choose
to take this job...

145
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,320
you will be working for me,
not for my father.

146
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,800
So why would you pick me?

147
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,200
Oh...

148
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I got it.

149
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,720
I had the shortest skirt, huh?

150
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,040
Oh, actually, no, there was one
with a shorter skirt...

151
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,160
but he was never a candy striper.

152
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,480
<i>Anyway, um...</i>

153
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,120
it's room and board...

154
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,920
and, uh, $400 a week.

155
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,320
Cash?

156
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,880
This is your room.

157
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,840
If you take the job.

158
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,040
He's got a cold, or what?

159
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,960
- How sick?
- Cancer.

160
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,560
Oh, shit, Hils.
Maybe I don't want to hear this.

161
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
- Okay. How's Jim?
- Jim's a prick.

162
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,600
How's his prick, then?

163
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,480
Mike, give us two beers.

164
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,080
Okay, so what's this guy look like?

165
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,400
- Upper classy, Nob Hill.
- Hmm. College snot.

166
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,160
- I kinda get the feeling that he was...
- He was what, Hils?

167
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,720
- Cute.
- Well, go ahead, girl.

168
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,840
- You gonna take it?
- I don't know. The place isn't bad.

169
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,400
Fancy antiques. I have
my own bathroom. It's not in the hall.

170
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,520
- How much a week?
- Four hundred big ones.

171
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,960
Fuck me! Not you.

172
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,440
Grab it, Hils.
Your mom would go crazy.

173
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,520
You could buy the Cadillac she's always
talkin' about, go shoppin' every day.

174
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,040
You can buy the outfit for me...
What?

175
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,120
Just be cool, girl.
Don't worry about it.

176
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,040
Hey, hey, baby.
You need a walk home?

177
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,040
Hey, watch it.

178
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,160
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,080
Ah. Welcome.

180
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
- Thanks.
- Oh, let me...

181
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,440
Uh, that'll be all.
Thank you, Malachi.

182
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,280
Yes, sir.

183
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
That'll be all, Malachi.

184
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,280
Wait.

185
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,840
You coming in this room
is not part of the deal.

186
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,960
I never thought it was.

187
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,440
<i>Pardon me.</i>

188
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,360
Uh, yes.

189
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,280
- How are you doing?
- My friend, how are you?

190
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,880
<i>- Fine.
- This is, uh, Moamar.</i>

191
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,120
Moamar Gadhafi.

192
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,600
He, uh, drives me every Monday
morning to the, uh, chemo.

193
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,720
- Hilary O'Connell.
- My honor.

194
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,440
O'Neil.

195
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,200
O'Neil. I'm sorry.

196
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,120
<i>Peter Schmidt, 1886.</i>

197
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,880
<i>Barth and Kenitzer, 1892.</i>

198
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,480
Both of them stood up
to the earthquake.

199
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,320
The incomparable Hiss and Weekes...

200
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,320
<i>1910.</i>

201
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,440
Oh, Ronald McDonald, 1986.

202
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,640
You know, the chemicals
they inject me with, th...

203
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,800
Actually, they're poison.

204
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,960
<i>- Poison?
- Mmm.</i>

205
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,320
Hiss and Weekes again, 1911.

206
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,040
Yes, the idea is to kill the cancer...

207
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
and, uh, not me.

208
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,480
<i>So, anyway, there might be
some reaction.</i>

209
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,160
<i>- What kind of...
- Oh, sweating.</i>

210
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,800
Shaking and vomiting.

211
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,280
Sometimes it makes me scream.

212
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,400
<i>Ah, Mercy Hospital.</i>

213
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,320
1936.

214
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
- Miss O'Neil?
- What?

215
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,120
- Do you want me to stay?
- I don't know. No.

216
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
I'll give him a call tomorrow.

217
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,080
Okay. Okay.

218
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,680
It's okay.

219
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,640
No, no. No.

220
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,720
- How's that?
- Thank you. Thank you.

221
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,080
Oh.

222
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,840
Too loud!

223
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
- Too loud!

224
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,320
<i>It's up... too loud!</i>

225
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,080
<i>Too loud.</i>

226
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,480
Okay.

227
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,680
It's okay. It's okay.

228
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,560
Come on. Come on, come on.

229
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,480
Let me wrap this around you.

230
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,040
- Oh, much too loud.
- No, I turned it down.

231
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,240
- Much too loud. It's much too loud.
- It's okay. I turned it down.

232
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
Come on.
Let me get you into the bed.

233
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,200
Okay? I've got you.

234
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,080
I've got you. I've got...

235
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
Okay.

236
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,560
The room is humming.

237
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,600
Go to sleep.

238
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,480
Go to sleep.

239
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,000
Shit.

240
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
Shit.

241
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,320
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

242
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,840
I don't... I don't get it.
What do you mean, "poison"?

243
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,120
I mean poison.

244
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,600
I mean, I thought he was gonna die.

245
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,680
I thought, one more time
and this guy is gonna fucking die.

246
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,080
Shauna, I need help.

247
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,960
I feel sorry for him. I do.

248
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,680
I don't think anybody comes to see him.

249
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,720
<i>I wish I knew how to care for him,
but I don't.</i>

250
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
<i>He needs a nurse.</i>

251
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,560
<i>He needs somebody who can...</i>

252
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,240
<i>deal with this sort of thing.</i>

253
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,160
I don't think I can deal with this.

254
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,040
I don't.

255
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,160
<i>I'll have to tell him tonight.</i>

256
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,720
<i>No.</i>

257
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
You've reached the home of Victor
Geddes. Leave a message after the tone.

258
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
<i>This is your father.
Are you there?</i>

259
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,880
<i>I know you're there.</i>

260
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,400
<i>I'm calling to find out
how the chemo went.</i>

261
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Are you all right?</i>

262
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,800
<i>I understand you didn't hire the nurse
from the agency. You got that redhead.</i>

263
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
I guess I don't have to ask why.

264
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,960
<i>I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
I love you, Victor.</i>

265
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,160
- Dinner.
- Thank you.

266
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,760
<i>- Eggs.
- Thanks.</i>

267
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,040
That's all this redhead could find.
There's no real food in the house.

268
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,400
No. No.

269
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,040
Unless you want a Twinkie omelet.

270
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,520
Twinkie omelet.

271
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Uh... Oops.

272
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,440
<i>Oh. Oh, I'm...
Oh, God, I'm sorry.</i>

273
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,960
- No, that's all right. It's nothing.
- No, it's...

274
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,400
I'm sorry. Is this important?
Is this your diary?

275
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
<i>No, it's nothing.
It's, uh, notes.</i>

276
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,840
I'm, uh...

277
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,160
This is what I do.
It's my Ph. D. Thesis.

278
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,280
I've been working on it for five years.

279
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,400
<i>When I can, uh, I will finish it.</i>

280
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,200
I'm determined to finish it.

281
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,080
<i>- What's it on?
- Uh, art.</i>

282
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,360
<i>Art history. Do you know
the German impressionists?</i>

283
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Do they live in Oakland?

284
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,360
<i>Do... Like, um, Renoir?</i>

285
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,160
<i>Or, uh, Monet? Gauguin?</i>

286
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,920
Uh, van Gogh.

287
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,240
<i>- The flowers?
- Sunflowers.</i>

288
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

289
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,520
Well, that's not who I'm doing.

290
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,280
Oh.

291
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,200
Would you like to see
who I'm doing?

292
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
<i>Klimt.</i>

293
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,080
<i>Gustav Klimt.</i>

294
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,800
<i>He was obsessed with women.</i>

295
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,880
<i>He needed them the way
most people need food.</i>

296
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,920
<i>Valerie Neuzil.</i>

297
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,080
<i>He called her "Wally. "
She was 16.</i>

298
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,240
For a while, she was
the embodiment of it all...

299
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,520
beauty, love, sex...

300
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,400
<i>until he got bored
and passed her on.</i>

301
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,280
<i>She lived only another
five years, then died...</i>

302
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,400
<i>it is said, of a broken heart.</i>

303
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,200
Too late for spying, Malachi.

304
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,280
- Never too late, sir.
- Good night, Malachi.

305
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,080
<i>Good night, sir.</i>

306
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,000
<i>Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</i>

307
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,760
Also obsessed,
but with just one woman.

308
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,280
<i>Elizabeth Siddell, his wife.</i>

309
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,120
<i>She was only 28 when she killed herself
with a drug called laudanum.</i>

310
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,200
Beautiful name for a drug.

311
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,400
<i>Rossetti couldn't stop painting
her image over and over again.</i>

312
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,000
Until he died just a few years later.

313
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,520
Um, Klimt again.

314
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
It's called "The Kiss. "

315
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,520
Did he use real gold?

316
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,680
I should have explained
the, uh, chemo...

317
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,520
more clearly to you.

318
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,520
<i>It wasn't fair.</i>

319
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,320
<i>So, if you... if you'd like,
I can pay you now.</i>

320
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
For the week.

321
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,400
Uh, you've earned
every penny of it.

322
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,840
<i>And, uh, we can... we can just...</i>

323
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,960
you know, we can just, uh...

324
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,640
It's okay.

325
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,360
Thank you, Moamar.

326
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,360
I'll pull this back for just a second.

327
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,000
I was reading today
that the survival rate...

328
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,120
of adult onset leukemia...

329
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,320
is now 50%...

330
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,080
and it is even greater...

331
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,440
with aggressive therapy.

332
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,960
Here we go.

333
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,880
Was therapy
aggressive enough for you?

334
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,800
<i>This is gonna get warm
in just a minute, okay?</i>

335
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,360
No. Victor, what can I do?

336
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,600
- What can I do? What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. Nothing!

337
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,920
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing!

338
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,440
There's nothing you can do.

339
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,320
Not a goddamn
motherfucking thing!

340
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,520
<i>Fuck! Fuck!</i>

341
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,280
<i>Fuck!</i>

342
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
Fuck.

343
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,280
I'm right here.

344
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,240
I'm right here.

345
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,720
I know. I know.

346
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,480
I know.

347
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,800
All gold. That's right. All gold.

348
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,040
<i>- This is the epitome, you might say...
- Oh!</i>

349
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,720
She has teeth. See?

350
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,960
<i>That is so rare.
You never see that.</i>

351
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,040
I mean, anybody can paint
a little closed mouth...

352
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,160
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Tell me that's not a snake.

353
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,040
It's a part of a snake.
The whole snake's too expensive.

354
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,520
- He eats that?
- He doesn't eat.

355
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,440
Well, Hilary, honey, make him a ham.

356
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,760
I mean, it's hot.
It sticks to the ribs.

357
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,680
<i>Ham has too much fat
and too much salt.</i>

358
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,280
You can get two or three dinners
out of it and some sandwiches.

359
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,600
Your grandmother never ate Chinese
snake for lunch, for God's sakes.

360
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,040
<i>- Or Aunt Elma, who lived to be what...
- 206?</i>

361
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,120
Ninety-two years old,
thank you very much.

362
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,560
<i>She smoked a pack of Luckys and drank
a pint of scotch every day ofher life.</i>

363
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,720
God rest her soul.
Did he pay you yet?

364
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,440
He offered.

365
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,240
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
And you said, "It's okay. "

366
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,720
And I'm not married,
and Rosemary Kinsella has a Cadillac.

367
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,280
- Do you do his wash too?
- No, Mom, I don't.

368
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,960
The man has cancer and weighs
14 pounds, but I tell him...

369
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,040
"You want clean slacks? Then get off
your skinny ass and wash them yourself. "

370
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,240
I just thought maybe you were a nurse
instead of a cleaning lady.

371
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,800
Who makes a better wage
than I do, by the way.

372
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,000
<i>And is it possible...
is itjust possible...</i>

373
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,680
that he wants a little more
than a... ham dinner, huh?

374
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,520
Uh-huh. Huh?

375
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,920
Sorry. Is the music too loud?

376
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,080
Uh, no. May I come in?

377
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,080
Um, just a second.

378
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

379
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,920
- Is everything all right?
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,120
You have something, um...

381
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,560
Oh. Thanks.

382
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,080
Oh, uh, did I say thank you
for the other night?

383
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,480
You said "fuck" a lot.

384
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,280
Well, thank you.

385
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,120
So it's almost 8:00.

386
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,480
<i>And, uh, you're not going out.</i>

387
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,640
Uh, I mean you could.
You can. You're allowed.

388
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,960
You don't have to stay home.

389
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,840
- It's not, uh, part of the deal.
- Thanks.

390
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,760
But you're not.

391
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,480
So, um...

392
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
how 'bout a date?

393
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,360
<i>Malachi.</i>

394
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,280
<i>- I, uh, let myself in. Yes.
- Let yourself in, yes.</i>

395
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Shall I leave you two alone?

396
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,920
It's not necessary, sir. Your mail.

397
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,760
And your news.

398
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,640
<i>- Thank you for the personal delivery.
- My pleasure, sir.</i>

399
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,800
<i>One additional news item. Your father
is returning at the end of the week.</i>

400
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,560
And may I assume from the intense odor
of mayonnaise in the air...

401
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,720
<i>that, uh, we will be
dining in tonight?</i>

402
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,520
Actually, no.
We're going out.

403
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,280
<i>Aren't we? Going out?</i>

404
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,200
Sure.

405
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,200
We're going out.

406
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,920
You look great.

407
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,120
<i>The Chronicle, the food review,
said it was the best new place in town.</i>

408
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,840
- The best, uh... Isn't this great?
- It's great.

409
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,640
- Okay.
- Oh.

410
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,200
Okay.

411
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,080
<i>- Great. Thank you.
- Certainly, sir.</i>

412
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,960
My mother said you don't
have to like everything...

413
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
but you have to try everything.

414
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Oh.

415
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,280
My mother always said,
"Pass the Velveeta. "

416
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,840
<i>- What is it?
- Raw cow.</i>

417
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,120
Dead.

418
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,960
What if I throw up?

419
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,680
Then I'll take care of you.

420
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,840
Go ahead.

421
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,960
Carpaccio.

422
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,840
Carpaccio.

423
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,120
- Isn't that great?
- It's great.

424
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,200
What do they, um, charge
for something like this?

425
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,720
I don't know. Uh, 30, was it?

426
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,200
Thirty? Wow.

427
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,080
- Wow.
- What?

428
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,600
No, it's great.

429
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,680
This place is great.

430
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,760
It's not great, is it?

431
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,320
Victor...

432
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,040
- Hi!
- Hey, hey! Hil!

433
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,040
<i>Baby! What's goin'on?</i>

434
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,360
This is Victor. This is Jim.

435
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,680
- How are you doin', Jim?
- All right, all right.

436
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,600
- Come on. Let's jam.
- Shall we dance?

437
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,760
- No, no, I'm...
- Could you hold my jacket?

438
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,440
- Yes. Of course.
- Don't be nervous.

439
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,840
<i>Are you dancing
or taking up space?</i>

440
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,000
<i>- Watch out. Coming through!
- Whoa!</i>

441
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,840
Excuse me! Excuse me!

442
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,680
Sorry, man.

443
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,720
- Hi.
- You were great.

444
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,720
Thanks.

445
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,560
<i>Hey, look out!</i>

446
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,560
This place isn't really
that great either, is it?

447
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,640
- Shall we go back to the restaurant?
- No.

448
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,480
Arthur Rubinstein.

449
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,120
<i>He was almost 80 when he played this.
I met him.</i>

450
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,840
My... My mother took me
to his apartment. I shook his hand.

451
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,000
Size of a basketball player's.
This little, skinny man.

452
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,560
How'd she know him?

453
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,040
He was a client
of my father's law firm.

454
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,160
- Oh. I'm impressed.
- My father is a very impressive man.

455
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,920
- Do I get a cigarette if I drink this?
- No.

456
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,760
How is this one?

457
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,680
- Mmm.
- Mmm?

458
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,840
Mm-hmm.
And the hits keep coming.

459
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,680
- It's awfully late.
- One more. This is the best one.

460
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,040
I'm sure you have a story to go with it
about some beautiful dead woman.

461
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,080
Yes. My mother.

462
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,920
<i>This was her favorite song.</i>

463
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,160
<i>- She died when I was nine. She was beautiful.</i>

464
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,880
I'm sorry.

465
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
Dance?

466
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,200
Thanks for the date.

467
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,040
I'm done with the chemotherapy.

468
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,520
<i>- Uh, that was the last one.
- Really?</i>

469
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,200
Yeah. It's a course. It's over.

470
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,640
I thought you had to take a test.

471
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,240
- Would you like to call my doctor?
- No.

472
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,960
- Go ahead. The number's on the desk.
- I said no.

473
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,760
I'm sorry.

474
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Uh, that's what you get
for saving my life.

475
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,160
Believe me, it's done.

476
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,520
And, uh, to celebrate,
we are going away.

477
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,560
- Where?
- Up north.

478
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,520
I haven't been out of here for years.

479
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,880
<i>- What about your father?
- Uh, I'll call him in the morning.</i>

480
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,000
A vacation.

481
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,840
I need to finish my thesis.
The door buzzes every five minutes here.

482
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,360
<i>- Once in two weeks.
- It'll be an adventure.</i>

483
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,600
We deserve an adventure,
a safe adventure.

484
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,920
<i>It's only a couple-hour drive
right back to the hospital.</i>

485
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,280
Look, I will sign a contract, okay?

486
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,400
I, Victor Geddes, promise to return
if anything happens.

487
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,160
Anything. You name it.

488
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,360
- Like you die?
- No.

489
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,280
I'm not going to die.

490
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,600
I'm going to recover,
but I can't do it without help.

491
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,920
I can't do it without you.

492
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,080
- It's a 55 zone.
- What?

493
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,480
If you drive any faster,
this heap will blow up.

494
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,120
This is not a heap.

495
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,480
This is a 1974 Cadillac,
bought and paid for by yours truly.

496
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,600
- Nice color too.
- It's a cool color. It's a cool car.

497
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,400
Can you say that, Victor?
"Cool"?

498
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,120
I can say "70 miles an hour. "
I can say that.

499
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,640
Well, then... why don't you drive?

500
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,560
No! Please don't do that.
I can't. I can't drive. Hilary.

501
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,240
- Are you kidding me?
- Thank you for your compassion.

502
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,560
I'm sorry.

503
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,360
My father had a driver.
I never learned how.

504
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,600
- I think it's time you started to learn.
- No, please don't do that!

505
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,440
- It's cool, huh?
- Take... Take the wheel.

506
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,400
I'm helping you. I'm helping you
stay between the lines.

507
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,240
There you go.
You're doing fine. There you go.

508
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,600
<i>- I know why you like it here.
- Why?</i>

509
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,400
<i>- 'Cause all these buildings
have dates on them.</i>

510
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,800
Oh, look at that.
Don't look. Watch the road.

511
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,400
- Goin' a little fast?
- What?

512
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,960
I'm kidding.
You're driving, like, 23 miles an hour.

513
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,800
Scared you?

514
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,120
Thank you.

515
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,240
Oh, look. Hi!

516
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,840
<i>Wejust moved in!</i>

517
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,760
Kind and friendly neighbor.

518
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,200
Here, let me get that.

519
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,520
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

520
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,880
You okay?

521
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,560
So beautiful.

522
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,920
What is this?

523
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,680
Those are ampules of morphine.

524
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,200
<i>- For pain.
- Isn't a doctor supposed to do this?</i>

525
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,360
Oh, I know precisely what to do.

526
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,120
Years of experience.

527
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,920
<i>- Do you need one?
- No, I won't need one.</i>

528
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,840
Put them away.
I won't need one.

529
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

530
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,720
No, it's okay. I'm done.

531
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,520
Come on.

532
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,520
- They'll start by staring.
- No, they won't.

533
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,040
Someone will ask,
"Hey, man, why ain't you got any hair?"

534
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,760
- They'll be too busy drinking.
- I've been to places like this. They always ask.

535
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,600
- Come on.
- They always ask.

536
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,200
Two beers.

537
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,880
Thanks. Save the glasses.

538
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,240
- You moved into Demazian's place?
- Uh-huh.

539
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,160
Bring your foul-weather gear?

540
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,520
Geez, you're gonna fuckin'
freeze to death up there.

541
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,880
Weather-strip it. That'll fix it.

542
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,000
<i>I've weather-stripped
around 30 houses. Works every time.</i>

543
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,240
You mean you stripped
in about 30 houses.

544
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,400
Anyway, I'd do yours.

545
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
- Cappy.
- Hilary.

546
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,360
- Thank you.
- Victor.

547
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,280
How do you do?

548
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,400
<i>Hilary, beer's on the house.</i>

549
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,800
<i>- You're kidding!
- So, Vic, how come you shaved your head?</i>

550
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,040
Yeah.

551
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,840
He's a Hare Krishna.

552
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,760
- No, you know, at the airport, the guys in the yellow...
- Saffron.

553
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,240
- Robes, passing out flowers.
- Daisies.

554
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,040
- Take off.
- With his little cymbals, singing.

555
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,880
- Sing.
- What?

556
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,280
- Sing, hon.
- Yeah, give us a few notes.

557
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,800
No, I can't.
I can't.

558
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,120
- I left the order.
- Come on, come on.

559
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,720
- I gave back my robe and cymbals.
- Why?

560
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,040
Because the order is celibate.
We're like priests.

561
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,480
<i>- No kidding.
- Yes. Stricter, really.</i>

562
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,920
And, uh, I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

563
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,520
- That's all right. We're good for it.
- Very private.

564
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,800
Well, the truth is,
Hilary came along.

565
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,200
I was at the airport, at United, which,
as you know, is the best location.

566
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,640
And, uh, I was stopping people...

567
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,400
giving them a flower and saying,
"God is love. Have a nice day. "

568
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,640
Then I stopped Hilary.

569
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,000
She turned to me, and I knew.

570
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,480
I stopped shaving my head the next day,
and we got in the car and came here.

571
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,160
Probably her favorite
vacation spot. Right, hon?

572
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,480
<i>Nah!</i>

573
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,000
- No, no, no, no.
- Nice try, kid.

574
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,400
That'll be 2.50 for the beer.

575
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,960
That's good. That's real good.

576
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,040
Are you okay?

577
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,320
Do you need me?

578
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,480
<i>Sorry.</i>

579
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,360
Yes, I need, uh...

580
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,760
I can't sleep.

581
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,840
I, uh...

582
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,320
I need to, uh, lie down...

583
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,920
Next to you.

584
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,080
I mean, I need to...

585
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,240
I want to sleep... in your bed.

586
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,760
<i>Not... Believe me, I'm no threat.
Not after the chemotherapy. I just can't...</i>

587
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,280
This is not part of the deal.
Tell me to leave.

588
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,480
No, it's okay.

589
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,360
Okay.

590
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,920
What does your tattoo mean?

591
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,160
Strength of heart.

592
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,080
- Good morning.
- Morning.

593
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,080
- If I drink this, can I have a cigarette?
- No.

594
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,000
No, I didn't think so.
Wait a minute. Show you something.

595
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,920
Feel it. Feel it.

596
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,960
- It's coming in.
- Yeah.

597
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,200
- No fever. Is there?
- No.

598
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,280
Uh, wait a second.

599
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,240
- I have an idea.
- That's okay.

600
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,560
- I'd like to tell you about it, but...
- But what?

601
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,760
- But don't get mad.
- Why?

602
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,640
Well, it has something
to do with...

603
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,880
something you're sensitive about.

604
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,320
My cooking? My clothing? My hair?

605
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,560
Your education.

606
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,320
You know, I have spent
my entire life studying.

607
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,040
Years of lying in a bed reading.
Not what you were doing.

608
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,960
- Sleeping with construction workers.
- No. Living.

609
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,240
I am trying to learn a bit about that from
you, and I want to give you something back.

610
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,520
To, uh, teach you.
Not school, but, uh...

611
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,800
I see in you...

612
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,040
I don't care about
your little jokes or anything.

613
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,200
I see interest...

614
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,800
<i>about things.</i>

615
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,800
Tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me to go to hell.

616
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,520
- Go to hell.
- Tell me you're not interested.

617
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,840
What would you teach me?

618
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,760
Uh, well, you like Klimt, right?
We start with a book on modern art.

619
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,440
<i>You take a look at it, you read it.</i>

620
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,760
<i>Then, uh, we talk. That's all.</i>

621
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,280
Damn it. I know I do that.
You can hit me if I start.

622
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,160
<i>I mean it. Strike me. Humble me.</i>

623
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
I will.

624
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,400
My hair looks good.
Don't touch my hair.

625
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,360
<i>Read 'em and weep.</i>

626
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,200
<i>- Check.
- Check.</i>

627
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,600
<i>- I'll bet.
- Oh, man, you got nothin'.</i>

628
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,320
<i>- Go fish.
- Hon, hon, you have zippo.</i>

629
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,640
<i>- Two dollars.
- Oh, come on!</i>

630
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,040
<i>You're bluffing.</i>

631
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,200
Put up or shut up.

632
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,440
<i>- Two bucks. Cards for the players.
- I'm in.</i>

633
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,200
I think they should
just change the rules.

634
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,880
For instance, you get like partial
credit for a four... a four-card flush.

635
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,680
<i>Especially if you have an ace.
I had an ace. It was the best ace.</i>

636
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,480
The biggest ace.
The ace of spades. It was fan...

637
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,400
A big, bold card, and it deserves
to beat a pair of deuces.

638
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
You want to dance?

639
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,800
You really are well,
aren't you, Victor?

640
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,880
Yes, thanks to you.

641
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,520
<i>What?</i>

642
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,760
I don't know. Um...
it feels like the deal's over.

643
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,360
What do you mean?

644
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,520
<i>Well, like, the chemo's done
and you're better...</i>

645
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,120
and, uh... I'm still taking money.

646
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,680
<i>- That's okay.
- It doesn't feel right.</i>

647
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,280
Maybe we should just go back.

648
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,920
Back? Why would you
want to go back?

649
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,080
Well, I-I feel like there's
no job here for me anymore.

650
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,800
Is there?

651
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,680
I guess not.

652
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,720
Okay.

653
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,600
<i>Good night.</i>

654
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,760
Good night.

655
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,640
Mmm. Hi.

656
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,240
I have a confession to make.

657
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,200
- You awake?
- No.

658
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,880
Good. Then it'll be easier.

659
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,720
I lied.

660
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,360
There were never any
other women in my house.

661
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,280
That's okay. I lied too.

662
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,680
I was never vice president
of the Future Nurses of America.

663
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,520
What about the picture
of you and that girl?

664
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,240
- What picture?
- The one in your apartment.

665
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,000
Jean. Jean.

666
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,760
College.

667
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,840
She was...

668
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,680
I was in remission and...

669
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,840
we were in love, I guess.

670
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,400
I don't know.

671
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,240
I got sick, she left.

672
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,040
Now you're leaving
because I'm well.

673
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,400
No. I just told you I don't want
to take your money anymore.

674
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,640
Okay, no more money.

675
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,440
I have to give you
something then.

676
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,160
Mmm. No more art history
lessons, please.

677
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,160
Well...

678
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,440
then I have only
one thing to give you.

679
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,160
My heart.

680
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,040
You can have my heart.

681
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,240
I couldn't say that before.

682
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,320
You can't say that
to someone when you're sick.

683
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,880
Yes, you can.

684
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,760
I love you, Hilary...

685
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,640
and I don't want you to leave.

686
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,840
You don't have to say anything.
It's all right.

687
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,560
I do have to say something.

688
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,520
I want to...

689
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,560
I want to say, um...

690
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,640
You're a pain in the ass.

691
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,400
But I know the sweetness in you,
and I know that you've changed me.

692
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,960
And I want to say...

693
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,120
thank you.

694
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,440
I won't leave you.

695
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,560
Oh! It's cold!

696
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,120
Never dare a Geddes.

697
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,000
Good morning, Mrs. Merkel.

698
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,680
<i>Hello? Anybody home?</i>

699
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,760
<i>Hello?</i>

700
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,720
- Hey. Time to strip the windows.
- Hi.

701
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,400
Sorry I've been so long.

702
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,920
I've been working up at this winery
for this old lady, making barrels.

703
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,520
<i>She's crazy. She's got three husbands
buried out there.</i>

704
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,600
And she reads tea leaves.
I'm not kiddin'.

705
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,880
She's crazy.
You gotta meet her.

706
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,240
Here's where your problem is.
Comes right off the water and right in.

707
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,000
Feel.

708
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,240
- Feel it?
- Mm-hmm.

709
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,560
- Hello, Gordon.
- Vic! Hey!

710
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,080
<i>- Hi. How are you doing?
- All right.</i>

711
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,440
Uh... what are you doing?

712
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,840
I got a surprise.

713
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,320
- Well, it is freezing in here.
- Mm-hmm.

714
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,160
Call me insane,
but I'd venture a guess...

715
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,040
that Gordon would like to
warm you up in any way possible.

716
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,600
Cappy told me
you didn't have a TV set.

717
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,520
Yes. Uh, no.

718
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,640
<i>I guess we never... ever...</i>

719
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,680
Well, it's only black and white.

720
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,360
I don't use it, so...

721
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,480
- Oh, I, uh...
- Here.

722
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,640
I'll put it on the table.

723
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,480
<i>Oh, cripes.</i>

724
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,240
"Cripes"?

725
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,520
Be careful. God.

726
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,720
- Oh, no. It works.

727
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,600
<i>Thanks, Gordon.</i>

728
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:03,120
I don't think... We're not really
very big, uh, television watchers here.

729
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,360
But thanks. We're not, uh...

730
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,960
- What is nectar?
- Absolutely right.

731
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,040
<i>- Oh, wait.
- TheJetsons!</i>

732
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,600
<i>- Are you a big fan of TheJetsons now?
- Go back one.</i>

733
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,400
- Belle of Amherst.
- Emily Dickinson.

734
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,600
- Duncan.
- Who is Emily Dickinson?

735
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,440
- Correct.
- "TR" for 400, please.

736
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,240
Answer there:

737
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,760
- Troika.
- What is a troika?

738
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,920
<i>- Yes.
- What is a troika?</i>

739
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,360
<i>- What is a troika?
- It's a light Russian sleigh pulled by three horses.</i>

740
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,120
<i>Uh, Glass Menagerie.</i>

741
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,440
<i>- Duncan.
- What is Glass Menagerie?</i>

742
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,120
<i>- What is Glass Menagerie?
- College snot. College snot answer.</i>

743
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,800
<i>The most beautiful play ever written.</i>

744
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,480
- Oh, the Mertzes!
- Who are the Mertzes?

745
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,400
<i>- Correct.
Who are the Mertzes?</i>

746
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,280
We're just incredible. We're
an intellectually wonderful couple.

747
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,880
<i>- Oh, wait! Wiggle her nose.
- What is wiggle her nose?</i>

748
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,400
<i>- "Television"for 300.
- Cripes.</i>

749
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,520
- What are they talking about?
- David Cassidy!

750
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,200
- Is that the actor? No, they want the character.
- Oh, Partridge. Keith Partridge.

751
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,840
Too late. Sorry.

752
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,400
- Strict standards here on television.
- It's under the wire.

753
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,280
<i>- What are springs?
- Oh, shit!</i>

754
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,880
You have to be quiet
while we're trying to watch.

755
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,680
"To the moon, Alice!"

756
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,720
<i>What is "To the moon, Alice"?
- Zoom!</i>

757
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,360
<i>- Were you people weaned on television?
- "American History"for 500.</i>

758
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,040
The last clue in that column:

759
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,160
- Buchanan.
- Who was Abraham Lincoln?

760
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,480
- Ha! You got it wrong!
- Shh! Buchanan!

761
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,760
- James Buchanan.
- Oh, yes!

762
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,800
<i>Thank you very much.
Hello, Jeopardy people!</i>

763
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,760
<i>Send my money
through the Pony Express.</i>

764
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,440
<i>Bring me a check.
Put it in my furry little hand.</i>

765
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,960
Watch this and don't be frightened.

766
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,040
- Oh.
- Ha!

767
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,680
I expect you to be duly impressed.

768
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,520
<i>- Hey!
- That's great you made it.</i>

769
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,520
- How are you?
- Good.

770
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,600
- Casks.
- Yeah.

771
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,360
- Oak.
- Oak, right.

772
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,520
He's an expert.

773
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,480
Is that the cask room?

774
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,840
<i>Want a tour? Come on.</i>

775
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,360
There's this crazy old lady
who owns this place.

776
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,960
She'll do anything I ask
because she loves me.

777
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,480
Yes. Like a mother
loves her idiot child.

778
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,480
This is Estelle Whittier.

779
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,840
<i>- Hilary.
- Hi.</i>

780

<i>- Hello.

781
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,960

- Victor.

782
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,320
<i>Uh, well, we thought
we'd take you to lunch.</i>

783
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,480
- Victor's driving.
- Pass.

784
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,120
Well, have lunch with me.

785
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,400
How are you doing over here?
Want some more wine?

786
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,280
All right.

787
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,360
- Thank you, Annabel.
- You're welcome.

788
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,040
<i>What?</i>

789
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,360
- It's a maze.
- Yes!

790
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,720
<i>- Very good.
- Tell him what's in it.</i>

791
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,360
- What?
- My three husbands.

792
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,800
- Dead.
- Buried, he meant to say.

793
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,640
<i>By me.
Each one in their turn.</i>

794
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,360
Good men.

795
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,680
<i>No one knows where.</i>

796
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:35,040
<i>Sooner or later, everyone tries
to find them and get back out.</i>

797
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,360
- Not many succeed.
- It can't be that hard.

798
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,520
<i>Take my word for it.
Step inside, and you're lost.</i>

799
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,800
Brewer's yeast.
"Delightful nutty flavor. "

800
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,000
<i>- I'm sure.
- It's good for iron.</i>

801
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,800
- Iron! - Oh, Tiger's Milk.
Ninety-five percent protein.

802
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,360
"Four heaping teaspoons
in a glass of milk. "

803
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,680
Just enough
to choke an ostrich.

804
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,920
<i>Help me find, um,
Royal Jelly. I need Royal Jelly.</i>

805
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,920
Do you know
what RoyalJelly does?

806
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,240
Is this a quiz?

807
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,800
- What?
- You look sweaty.

808
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,040
- It's hot in here.
- Let me.

809
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,760
Tsk. Warm.

810
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,040
My lips are warm too.

811
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,560
Just a little night sweats, Vic.
It's just a little night sweats.

812
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,600
<i>What, honey?</i>

813
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,120
It's okay, baby.
Go back to sleep.

814
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,760
More tea, Mrs. Whittier?

815
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,920
Uh, no, thank you, Annabel.
It's time to read the leaves.

816
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,480
- Little baby Gordon doesn't
have to have his read.

817
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,320
<i>- Thank you.
- I've already read his.</i>

818
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,920
<i>Ladies first.
Thank you, dear.</i>

819
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,720
Dum, dum, dum, dum.

820
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,080
- Hmm.
- What?

821
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:28,720
<i>A scattering. A road. A rabbit.</i>

822
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,400
<i>- A bunny!
- A "cwazy wabbit. "</i>

823
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,920
Is that good or bad?

824
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,320
It means luck.

825
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,240
Luck at the end of a journey.

826
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,160
<i>Out of confusion.</i>

827
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,880
- Really?
- And now Victor.

828
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,440
Uh...

829
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,760
Uh, I can read my own leaves.

830
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,840
Yes. Another one
of my many hidden talents...

831
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,720
<i>along with bocci
and advanced masonry.</i>

832
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,840
Hmm. I'd rather forget.

833
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,040
<i>How about that?</i>

834
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,280
My future, it's something...
It's short, difficult.

835
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,600
<i>Lots ofblind curves.</i>

836
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,280
Oh, my God! Why, it's a maze!

837
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,680
Not yet. Wait till I get up there.

838
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,560
All right, all right.
Okay, wait a minute.

839
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,160
<i>- Wait.
- All right. All right. Okay?</i>

840
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,000
- All right?
- All right. Wait, wait. Go, go!

841
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,080
My first husband
built the damn thing.

842
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,520
He used to run through it naked.

843
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,040
- Gordon, I think we should go get him.
- Oh, no. He's doin' fine.

844
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,800
<i>One minute, Victor!</i>

845
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,240
Yes, yes, Gordon.

846
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,640
The clock is ticking!

847
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,920
Okay, let's find the center here.
We'll go...

848
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,080
Damn it.

849
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,920
<i>- Three minutes, Victor!
- Yeah.</i>

850
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,280
Yes!

851
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,520
Are you lost? Want some help?

852
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,560
I don't like this.
I'm gonna go get him.

853
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,840
- No! No, no, no.
- Let her go.

854
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,720
Victor? Victor?

855
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,240
Victor!

856
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,120
Lost my head there for a...

857
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,160
Jesus.

858
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,440
Okay, find the center here,
and we'll get out.

859
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,520
Goddamn it!

860
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,760
Eureka.

861
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,560
Victor?

862
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,760
Oh, God. Oh, no.

863
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,880
Oh, no.

864
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,520
Victor. Victor!

865
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,440
Please. Please. No.

866
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,000
Victor!

867
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,160
<i>Victor!</i>

868
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:39,160
Victor! Victor!

869
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,360
Why are you screaming?
Come along. Time's a-wasting.

870
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,120
- You scared me. Why didn't you answer me?
- Shh. Come along.

871
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,560
- Why didn't you answer me?
- Oh! Ha-ha!

872
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,880
- There's a grave site back there.
- 12:24.

873
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,280
12:24! Victor victorious!

874
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,640
<i>- Oh, Victor.
- Jesus. Yes. You scared me.</i>

875
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,880
<i>- Sorry. Will you get an extra blanket for the bed because...
- What? Why?</i>

876
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,920
<i>- It was really cold, and I really don't want you to...
- Oh, okay... Mom.</i>

877
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,760
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

878
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,000
Too bad the maze
wasn't any longer.

879
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,320
We could still be inside.

880
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,360
<i>There's always Versailles.</i>

881
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,520
You know, I told Estelle
you have a terminal disease.

882
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,120
- What?
- Asshole-itis.

883
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,760
Asshole-itis.
Very cute. Thank you.

884
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,880
Mm-hmm.

885
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,120
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

886
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,440
- Victor. Hey.
- What? What?

887
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,680
- Can you...
- What?

888
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,040
- You know.
- Do it? No. I can't do it right now.

889
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,800
- Because you're sick?
- No. Because...

890
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,680
Because you're sick.

891
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,800
Because I can't always do it
when you want, all right?

892
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,160
Perhaps I'm just not as prolific
as your construction worker friends.

893
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,600
<i>- Fuck you.
- Oh, Jesus.</i>

894
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,800
Think we can get through this
without a "fuck you," Hilary?

895
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,640
Hilary.

896
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,560
Hils.

897
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,720
I'm sorry.

898
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,240
Are you sick?

899
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,440
No.

900
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,920
Would you tell me if you were?

901
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,360
Yes.

902
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,120
It's all right.

903
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

904
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,960
<i>- How are you?
- Fine.</i>

905
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,040
<i>Oh, guess what? Estelle gave me this great
white dress ofhers for the Christmas party.</i>

906
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,600
It's beautiful. Want to see what I got
my mom for Christmas? It's not a doll.

907
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,280
Did you call your father
to wish him a merry Christmas?

908
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,040
Give it a rest, hon.

909
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,520
He doesn't know
where you are, does he?

910
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,200
<i>I'll call him in the morning, okay?</i>

911
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,400
I ran into Gordon in town today.

912
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,200
<i>- Great.
- I invited him to dinner tonight.</i>

913
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,280
He didn't have anybody
to spend Christmas Eve with.

914
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,560
I'll get it, hon!

915
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,280
- Honey, it's Gordon!
- Merry Christmas.

916
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,840
Merry Christmas.

917
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,880
- Good to see you.
- Merry Christmas!

918
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,640
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- I'm knocked out you asked me.</i>

919
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,280
<i>Well, we're knocked out you came.</i>

920
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,240
- Nothing.
- Nope, nothing.

921
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,040
<i>Excuse me, Gordon.
I do the garbage around here.</i>

922
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,440
- Did you bring us some figgy pudding?
- No. Presents.

923
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,200
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

924
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,080
Open it.

925
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,880
- Bubble bath.
- Yeah. That's not all.

926
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,560
Ooh.

927
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,920
Bubble bath.

928
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
- Merry Christmas.
- Whiskey!

929
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,840
- It's 52 months old.
- It won't get a day older.

930
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,680
Let's have a toast.

931
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,280
<i>Okay, this is to... how great this is.</i>

932
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,000
Really.

933
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,720
<i>Okay.</i>

934
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,120
Well, this is not like my mother's.

935
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,880
<i>- There's not enough lumps
in the potatoes.</i>

936
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,120
<i>My mother was
the worst cook ever born.</i>

937
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,600
<i>No. No, my mother.</i>

938
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,680
What did she make you
for lunch in school?

939
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,920
Wait. Did she give you
a bag or a pail?

940
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,400
A pail? Are you kidding me?

941
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,160
<i>I had a pail.
It had the Six Million Dollar Man on it.</i>

942
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,640
<i>- And every time you
opened it, it squeaked...</i>

943
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,080
<i>and everybody would look.</i>

944
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,720
Did she give you, uh, peanut butter
and banana sandwiches?

945
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,760
No. Fluffernutters.

946
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,760
Fluffernutters?

947
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,960
Van Gogh.

948
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,680
Huh?

949
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,120
Van Gogh is the answer.
What is the question?

950
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,200
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

951
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,560
<i>- Too late.
- No. Again. Go again.</i>

952
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,400
<i>Youngest president.</i>

953
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,120
<i>- No, you have to ask the question with an answer.
- Kennedy.</i>

954
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,760
- T.R.
- Who?

955
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,040
- Colors of the French flag.
- Red, white and blue.

956
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,080
- Blue, white and red.
- Oh, come on.

957
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,600
<i>- Sculpted the Piet.
- Do sports.</i>

958
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,920
Michelangelo.

959
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,640
Executed by Elizabeth I.

960
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,960
<i>Do sports, for Christ's sake.</i>

961
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,680
<i>Mary, Queen of Scots.
The "S"in U.S. Grant.</i>

962
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,120
All right, wait a minute.

963
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,720
Simpson. Grant. Grant Wood.
Grant. Grant Wood.

964
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,400
<i>Come on, honey.
You should know this one. Grant Wood.</i>

965
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,120
<i>American Gothic, for Christ's sake, honey.</i>

966
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,680
Whoa, contestant number one,
hold up, hold up.

967
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,920
Aren't you gonna play, sweetheart?
Oh!

968
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,720
Victor, we'll play
if you do sports or sitcoms.

969
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,320
<i>- Okay, we'll do sitcoms. Sitcoms? Great, okay.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

970
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,000
<i>Uh, he wrote Lysistrata.
Aristophanes.</i>

971
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,160
<i>Sitcoms, Victor.
Come on. Like Mr. Ed.</i>

972
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,600
<i>Shakespeare. That's a sitcom.
She Stoops to Conquer. Oliver Goldsmith.</i>

973
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,360
<i>- This is no English class!
- They're all situationally comic.</i>

974
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:55,480
Hils, what is he doing? What are you
doing, Victor? For Christ's sakes.

975
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,440
<i>Jesus, come on!
Nine. All right. Nine.</i>

976
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,800
Nine!

977
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,120
Hello! Hello in there!

978
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,400
Gordon, don't.

979
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,040
Number of players
on a baseball team, Gordo.

980
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,600
<i>Here, let me help him.</i>

981
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,680
All right. Okay.

982
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,720
Just take it easy, Victor.
You'll be all right.

983
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,320
<i>Come on. You'll sleep it off.</i>

984
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,840
<i>Put your head down.
You'll be okay.</i>

985
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,520
<i>Sorry I brought the bottle.
I didn't know that, uh...</i>

986
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,520
- Neither did I.
- If I can do anything...

987
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,200
Good night.

988
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,600
Um, remember, if you need me...

989
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,440
Thanks.

990
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,800
Ugh!

991
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,160
You lied to me.

992
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,200
I'm sorry.

993
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,800
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

994
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,840
<i>I've been so crazy,
I don't know what's going on.</i>

995
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:10,200
I didn't want... I don't...
don't want it to end.

996
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,160
That's all.

997
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,600
<i>- But you're sick. We have to go back.
- No, listen.</i>

998
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,120
Can't we just pretend that, um...

999
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,760
<i>- Pretend?
- Yes.</i>

1000
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,880
Yeah, that it, um, um...
that I'm all right.

1001
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,360
But you're not all right.
You're sick.

1002
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,800
- No, no. No.
- And you're going back to the hospital.

1003
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,360
- Listen to me. Do you love me?
- What?

1004
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,720
Just tell me. I know it's difficult.
I'm sorry. Just tell me.

1005
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,200
- Tell me.
- I don't like this.

1006
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,080
All right, all right, all right.

1007
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,840
I'm not going back.
I am never going back.

1008
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,800
I did lie to you. I wasn't through
with the chemotherapy.

1009
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,520
- What!
- Shh. Shh. My beautiful, sweet girl.

1010
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,400
I'm sorry. I had to.
It was killing me.

1011
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:58,080
You saw it.
That's why I chose you.

1012
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,760
Not just to come up here
with me...

1013
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,560
but to stay with me
no matter what happens.

1014
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,360
- No matter what happens.
- No!

1015
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,320
Shh, shh, shh!

1016
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,440
Just to stay for good... or whatever.

1017
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,080
Just no more hospitals.
No more treatments.

1018
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,240
No more.

1019
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,680
It is enough, Hilary.

1020
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,520
Ten years is enough.

1021
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,400
That's no life. I need a life.

1022
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,720
I have a life with you.

1023
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,760
- If you love me, you'll help me.
- Do what?

1024
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,960
Let it happen.
Just let it happen.

1025
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,320
- Let you die?
- No.

1026
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,800
When you decide?

1027
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,120
<i>You don't ask me or anything.
You just decided?</i>

1028
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,840
And then you want me to say...
You want me...

1029
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,240
You want me to tell you I love you?

1030
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,840
Then you can say, "Well, great. Now
I'm gonna die and I'm gonna leave you. "

1031
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,560
Hilary.

1032
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,600
And you let me believe
that we had...

1033
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,080
that I was part of something real
for the first time in my life.

1034
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,720
And the whole goddamn thing
was a lie!

1035
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,320
No, Hilary, I believed it too.

1036
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,520
I thought that this time
I wouldn't get sick again.

1037
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,360
<i>- I thought you could...
- What? That I could what?</i>

1038
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:32,520
<i>Do you have any idea
what it's like for me here?</i>

1039
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,600
You know, every day...

1040
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,560
every fucking day I wake up
to see if you're still alive.

1041
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,240
I watch to see if you eat,
to see if you shit.

1042
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,040
<i>And you knew that you were
getting sick again the whole time...</i>

1043
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,920
<i>and you didn't tell me.</i>

1044
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,240
<i>How was I supposed to know?
Because I'm not a nurse.</i>

1045
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,840
I'm not a fucking nurse!

1046
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,880
You think I don't feel something
because I'm stupid?

1047
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,320
Fuck you,
because I feel something!

1048
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,760
I feel everything,
and I can't watch you die!

1049
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,640
- Hello.
- M-Mr. Geddes, this is Hilary O'Neil.

1050
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,440
- I'm your son's...
- I know exactly who you are, Miss O'Neil.

1051
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,280
I must tell you
that if my son is in any danger...

1052
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:09,080
Uh... he is.
That's why I'm calling.

1053
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,800
He's very sick, and I think you
need to come get him now.

1054
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,680
Yes. All right.
Where? Where is he?

1055
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,720
He's, um...

1056
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,760
Miss O'Neil...

1057
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,280
please.

1058
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,120
3 Main Street, Mendocino.

1059
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,640
Okay. Okay, okay.

1060
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,760
You did the right thing.

1061
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,760
Oh, Victor. Shit!

1062
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,360
Okay, okay.

1063
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,280
Victor, Victor.

1064
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,960
<i>I had the police looking for you.
I hired two detectives to look for you.</i>

1065
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,640
I just don't understand why... I don't
know why you would sneak away like that.

1066
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,960
<i>Do you hate me that much?</i>

1067
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,440
No. No.

1068
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,360
You're my father.

1069
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,320
I love you.

1070
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,560
<i>But I am not a boy anymore...</i>

1071
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,200
and I just wanted to be alone
with Hilary, that's all.

1072
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,800
All right.

1073
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,880
Yes.

1074
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,120
But when you're through
with the treatment.

1075
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:53,560
I mean, Victor, God, how could you
walk away in the middle of it?

1076
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,160
I wanted... her
to see me with hair.

1077
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,520
So why didn't you tell me that?

1078
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,000
- You think I wouldn't understand?
- Would you have let me go?

1079
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,920
No.

1080
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,600
Victor, believe me,
believe me, believe...

1081
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,320
I would love to hide away here,
too, with a beautiful girl.

1082
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,760
- It's the enchanted cottage.
- It was.

1083
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,280
But I am taking you
back to the hospital now.

1084
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,880
Okay. Okay, but tomorrow.

1085
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,640
- No.
- I'll go back with you tomorrow.

1086
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,800
- Victor, listen to me.
- There's a party tonight.

1087
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
Well, you...

1088
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,280
I have to see her one last time.

1089
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,440
I have to.

1090
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,480
Please.

1091
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,400
All right.

1092
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,000
Somebody dropped
something over there.

1093
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,480
Sylvia, bring that stuff
and put it right over there.

1094
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,520
I'm sorry I can't come
to your party tonight, Estelle.

1095
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:52,560
Victor is very sick, and I had to
call his father to come get him.

1096
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,520
I know. Victor called.

1097
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:59,360
He and his father
are coming tonight.

1098
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:04,600
You know... people think it's funny
that I buried three husbands.

1099
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:07,000
It's a joke around here.

1100
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,640
I don't know why.

1101
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:14,000
<i>It isn't funny at all...</i>

1102
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
<i>watching someone you love
get sick, is it?</i>

1103
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,760
I don't give advice, love.

1104
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,920
But if I were you...

1105
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,480
I'd be at the party tonight.

1106
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,080
Merry Christmas.

1107
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,680
Hello. I'm Victor's father.

1108
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,160
Hi. Gordon.
Nice to meet you.

1109
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,200
Thank you, Miss O'Neil.
You saved his life.

1110
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,680
- Is he here?
- Yes.

1111
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,320
<i>Well, he was standing
right over there a second ago.</i>

1112
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:19,560
You want to dance?
Let's dance.

1113
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,720
<i>- No, I don't think I...
- Come on, let's dance.</i>

1114
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,760
What's the matter?

1115
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,360
Um... I'll be back.

1116
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,200
Hilary...

1117
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,960
Victor.

1118
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,680
I'm sorry.
I had to call your father.

1119
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,200
I'm going back with him.

1120
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,680
<i>- To the hospital?
- Yes.</i>

1121
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,840
Good.

1122
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,080
They'll take care of you there.

1123
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,200
Tell Gordon he better
damn well take care of you.

1124
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,600
No, it's not like that.

1125
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:23,360
I'll be going back
to Oakland soon, and...

1126
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,600
and I'll visit you, if that's okay.

1127
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,680
I think we should just...

1128
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,520
Good-bye.

1129
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:16,000
Well, I remember them. Of course.

1130
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,080
<i>They've moved into the area,
and they would love to see you.</i>

1131
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,960
<i>- Why don't you stop in and see them?
- Next time I'll do that.</i>

1132
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:24,240
- Mr. Geddes. Hi.
- Hello.

1133
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,560
I thought Victor
was going back with you.

1134
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,680
He is. Tomorrow.

1135
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,320
He, uh, wanted
to spend the night alone.

1136
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,600
Now, don't worry.
He's safe now.

1137
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:40,360
He said he'd call me
in the morning.

1138
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,120
<i>- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas, Miss O'Neil.</i>

1139
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,520
Excuse me.

1140
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,760
- You running away?
- Jesus.

1141
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:39,920
I thought that was my trick.

1142
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,520
No more tricks, Hilary...

1143
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:48,280
and no more hospitals.

1144
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,200
<i>I don't want to hurt you anymore.</i>

1145
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,440
I never wanted to hurt you.

1146
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:56,560
<i>You know, you are the first person...</i>

1147
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,080
in 10 years that made me
forget that I was sick.

1148
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,240
I just wanted
to stay here with you.

1149
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,840
<i>- To make love with you.
- Then where are you going?</i>

1150
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,400
You gonna hide somewhere
till you die?

1151
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,720
I can't let you do that, Victor.
I can't let you give up.

1152
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,360
I gave up when you left me.

1153
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,480
No, you didn't.
You gave up before I left.

1154
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:28,560
Hilary... I don't want
to be sick anymore.

1155
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,600
I know. That's why I want you
to come back with me.

1156
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,160
<i>- I can't.
- Why?</i>

1157
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:37,080
<i>- I'll drive you to the hospital. I'll carry you.
- I cannot do it.</i>

1158
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,280
<i>- Why?
- I can't do it.</i>

1159
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,400
<i>- Tell me why.
- Because.</i>

1160
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,080
Because I am afraid.

1161
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,960
Afraid of what?

1162
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,480
Of hoping!

1163
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:58,160
It hurts to be around you, Hilary...

1164
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,960
because...

1165
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:05,800
you make me want to live...
so much.

1166
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,200
Then live, Victor.

1167
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,560
You don't know
what's gonna happen.

1168
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,840
You don't know when
you're gonna die. Nobody does.

1169
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,680
But we have right now.
So fight, Victor. Live with me.

1170
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,520
- I can't.
- Live with me.

1171
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,000
I can't do that.

1172
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,920
Look at you.

1173
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:31,040
You are so... young...

1174
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,240
and so beautiful and smart.

1175
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:39,120
You can do anything, Hilary.
Anything you want to do.

1176
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,600
Why do you want to do this?

1177
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,720
Because I love you.

1178
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,400
And if you come back with me
to the hospital and fight for us...

1179
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,640
if you fight for us,
I will never leave you, Victor.

1180
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:54,840
But you have to fight.
And if you get well...

1181
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,720
when you get well...
I- I'll be there with you.

1182
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,560
And if you, if you die,
I'll hold your hand.

1183
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,200
I'll hold your hand.

1184
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:10,520
And the last thing
you'd ever see would be me...

1185
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,480
because I love you.

1186
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,840
I do.

1187
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,720
Oh, God.

1188
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,680
I love you.
