00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,887
Mm-hmm.

174
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,794
May I, Alma?

175
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,699
I like to see
who I'm talking to.

176
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,406
Here.

177
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,714
(Alma laughs softly)

178
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,151
There you are.

179
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:34,022
That's better.

180
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:38,691
Does your mother
have brown eyes?

181
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,526
Green.

182
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:43,529
Do you look very much like her?

183
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:45,731
I don't know. I think so.

184
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:48,134
Do you have a photograph?

185
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:50,136
Yes.

186
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:51,704
Would you let me see it?

187
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:54,444
Not here. At home.

188
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,145
Carry it with you.

189
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:02,585
Always carry her with you.

190
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:08,120
Where's yours?

191
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,589
Your mother.

192
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,995
She's here in the canvas.

193
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,935
- What do you mean?
- Hmm.

194
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:24,808
You can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat.

195
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:29,709
Secrets.

196
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:35,050
Coins, words, little messages.

197
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,753
When I was a boy,
I started to hide things

198
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:40,789
in the linings of the garments,

199
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,528
things that only I knew
were there.

200
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,696
And over my breast, I have
a lock of my mother's hair,

201
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:51,669
to keep her close to me always.

202
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:54,669
She was quite
a remarkable woman.

203
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:56,705
She taught me my trade.

204
00:18:56,707 --> 00:19:00,546
So I try to never be
without her.

205
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,786
You must love her very much.

when I was 16 years old.</i>

ALMA:
Beautiful.

216
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:09,113
REYNOLDS: 'Twas for her second
husband, for the wedding.

217
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:11,950
My father had died
many years before.

218
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:15,720
Our nanny,
the evil Miss Blackwood...

219
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:18,391
Black Death,
we used to call her...

220
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:19,791
because of superstition,

221
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,861
she refused to help me
sew the dress,

222
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,864
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune,

223
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,999
to never be a bride.

224
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,000
Not that anyone
would've had her.

225
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:30,736
And she seemed ancient to us.

226
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:32,738
I have no idea
how old she actually was.

227
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,709
And monstrously ugly.

228
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,845
So I worked alone
for months and months,

229
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:44,217
hunched over, sewing
and sweating and sewing.

230
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:46,853
And the Black Death
never married anyway.

231
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:49,122
All the help I could have had
from her.

232
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:53,029
'Twas my sister, Cyril,
came to my rescue in the end.

233
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:57,263
There are endless
superstitions

234
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,733
when making a wedding dress.

235
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:01,368
Young girls afraid
they'll never marry

236
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,904
if they touch one.

237
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:06,374
Or models afraid
they'll marry only bald men

238
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:08,945
- if they put one on.
- (Alma chuckles)

239
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:15,019
And where's the dress now?

240
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:20,253
I have no idea
what happened to it.

241
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:21,789
No idea.

242
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,760
Oh, most probably turned
to ashes by now,

243
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,731
fallen to pieces.

244
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:32,000
And your sister?

245
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,238
What?

246
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:37,039
Did she ever marry?

247
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,207
No.

248
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:42,478
Come on, boys,
let's have a fire.

249
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,050
(flames crackling)

250
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:53,225
(sighs)

251
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:03,099
If you want to have
a staring contest with me,

252
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:06,005
you will lose.

253
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,975
Hmm.

254
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:13,146
(chuckles)

255
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,050
(chuckles softly)

256
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:26,059
You are a very handsome man.

257
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:31,997
You must be around
many beautiful women.

258
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,739
Yes.

259
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:43,574
So why are you not married?

260
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:47,379
I make dresses.

261
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:50,148
You cannot be married
when you make dresses?

262
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,818
I'm certain
I was never meant to marry.

263
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,189
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

264
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,961
I'm incurable.

265
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,031
Hmm.

266
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:06,098
Marriage would
make me deceitful,

267
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,771
and I don't ever want that.

268
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,439
You sound so sure
about things.

269
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:16,143
I'm sure about that.

270
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:24,450
I think you're only
acting strong.

271
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:27,289
No, I am strong.

272
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,358
For who?

273
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,063
Not for me, I hope.

274
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:40,901
I think it's the expectations
and assumptions of others

275
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,072
that cause heartache.

276
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:54,184
Would you help me
with something?

277
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:58,355
- Yes.
- Come on.

278
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:15,139
Good. Just jump up
on the box for me.

279
00:24:45,404 --> 00:24:48,007
(clasps clicking)

280
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:15,202
Um...

281
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:20,604
I think we're gonna try and...

282
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:23,311
pull this back for you.

283
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:50,503
Pretty good.

284
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,507
One moment.

285
00:25:57,178 --> 00:26:00,448
We'll save that one for...
another time.

286
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:09,522
Quite nice.

287
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:11,361
But, um...

288
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:15,265
Mm.

289
00:26:16,698 --> 00:26:19,035
Bit serious.

290
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,519
This one.

291
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:40,458
Do you like it?

292
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,362
- Yes.
- It's very good.

293
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,401
(scissors cutting)

294
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:56,103
That's it.

295
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:57,472
Let's get that off you,

296
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:59,641
and then I'd like to take
your measurements.

297
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:01,579
Is that all right?

298
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:21,529
Who's this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice?

299
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,834
Hello. I'm Alma.

300
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:26,405
I'm Cyril.

301
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,311
Sandalwood and rose water.

302
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,547
(sniffs)

303
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:42,818
Mm, sherry and...

304
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,188
(sniffs)
lemon juice?

305
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,625
Mm. Mm-hmm,
we had fish for dinner.

306
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:52,532
REYNOLDS: My old so-and-so,
would you mind?

307
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,628
(pencil scratching on paper)

308
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,540
Can you step towards me?

309
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:35,710
Ready?

310
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:41,617
Thirty-two.

311
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:46,752
Thirty.

312
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:48,590
Thirty-one.

313
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:57,396
35 and a half.

314
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:03,270
14 and a half.

315
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:05,505
Seventeen.

316
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:07,774
Twenty.

317
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:09,809
Just stand normally.

318
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,615
(quietly):
Yes.

319
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,615
I stand normally.

320
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,282
Like before.

321
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:17,717
What do you mean?

322
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,252
- Straight.
- Straight.

323
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:21,524
- Like that.
- Yeah, you didn't say that.

324
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:32,533
16 and a half.

325
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:34,639
(pencil scratching on paper)

326
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,973
Eight and a half.

327
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,340
You have no breasts.

328
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,509
Twenty-two.

329
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:43,912
- Yes, I know.
- 32 and a half.

330
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,679
You can drop your arm now.

331
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,315
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

332
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:49,452
No, no, you're perfect.

333
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,723
My job to give you some.

334
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:56,327
If I choose to.

335
00:29:58,595 --> 00:29:59,797
Ten.

336
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,331
Nine.

337
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,536
Six and a half.

338
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:10,005
Twenty-five...

339
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,908
and... 45.

340
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,613

01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:33,831
(closes door)

828
01:02:37,668 --> 01:02:39,635
Oh, Alma.

829
01:02:39,637 --> 01:02:41,403
What is this?

830
01:02:41,405 --> 01:02:43,674
I love you, Reynolds.

831
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:48,380
Yes, but what is this?

832
01:02:49,614 --> 01:02:51,614
It's a surprise.

833
01:02:51,616 --> 01:02:52,981
Are you hungry?

834
01:02:52,983 --> 01:02:55,418
Where is Cyril?

835
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:56,886
(Alma clears throat)

836
01:02:56,888 --> 01:02:58,858
I've sent everyone home.

837
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,528
Where is Cyril?

838
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,062
She's left.

839
01:03:05,064 --> 01:03:07,430
What time did she leave?

840
01:03:07,432 --> 01:03:09,401
This afternoon.

841
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:13,872
I've made us dinner.

842
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:35,692
Let me collect myself
for a moment.

843
01:03:35,694 --> 01:03:36,760
(clears throat)

844
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:40,063
I'll just have a bath,
I think.

845
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:42,666
This is very kind of you, Alma.

846
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:45,104
Would you like a champagne
or a martini?

847
01:03:45,106 --> 01:03:47,972
No, thank you.

848
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:50,376
Oh, is that your dress?

849
01:03:50,378 --> 01:03:51,776
It's finished.

850
01:03:51,778 --> 01:03:53,681
Let's have a look at it.

851
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:03,825
Hmm. It's rather interesting.

852
01:04:05,158 --> 01:04:07,426
Very good work.

853
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:09,862
I'll just have my bath now.

854
01:04:09,864 --> 01:04:11,965
When will Cyril get back?

855
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:14,470
Mm, tonight?

856
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:23,411
(approaching footsteps)

857
01:04:47,035 --> 01:04:48,903
(grunts softly)

858
01:04:48,905 --> 01:04:52,441
How was your appointment
with the princess?

859
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,685
She's very beautiful,
like a sculpture of some kind.

860
01:05:06,056 --> 01:05:07,891
Mm-hmm.

861
01:05:09,158 --> 01:05:14,431
(clears throat) So, will you
make her a wedding gown?

862
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:19,701
I have made her baptism,

863
01:05:19,703 --> 01:05:23,539
her First Communion
and confirmation dresses.

864
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:26,209
I made the dress
for her presentation at court,

865
01:05:26,211 --> 01:05:30,146
indeed the entire wardrobe
for her coming out season.

866
01:05:30,148 --> 01:05:33,182
It's only right that I should
make her wedding dress,

867
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:35,050
wouldn't you think?

868
01:05:35,052 --> 01:05:36,552
(softly):
Oh, Christ.

869
01:05:36,554 --> 01:05:40,622
No, but this is not
what I wanted to say.

870
01:05:40,624 --> 01:05:43,226
I'm-I'm sorry, I don't know
what I said, I...

871
01:05:43,228 --> 01:05:45,832
This is meant to be
nice evening.

872
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:49,502
Let me serve you.

873
01:06:08,154 --> 01:06:10,724
(shaking continues)

874
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:29,007
Do you like it?

875
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:31,008
I do.

876
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:33,312
(continues chewing)

877
01:06:33,314 --> 01:06:36,147
No, you don't.

878
01:06:36,149 --> 01:06:38,883
You don't like it at all.

879
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:42,020
Usually you always tell me
what you think.

880
01:06:42,022 --> 01:06:43,988
What is this?

881
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,726
You're lying.

882
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:53,765
As I think you know, Alma,

883
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:57,540
I prefer my asparagus
with oil and salt.

884
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:00,105
And knowing this,

885
01:07:00,107 --> 01:07:02,909
you've prepared the asparagus
with butter.

886
01:07:02,911 --> 01:07:05,911
Now, I can imagine
in certain circumstances

887
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:10,018
being able to pretend
that I like it made this way.

888
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:14,853
Right now, I'm just admiring
my own gallantry

889
01:07:14,855 --> 01:07:17,759
for eating it the way
you've prepared it.

890
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:21,865
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

891
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,200
I-I don't know
what I'm doing here.

892
01:07:27,202 --> 01:07:32,608
I'm just waiting around
like an idiot for you.

893
01:07:33,943 --> 01:07:36,743
This was an ambush, Alma.
To what purpose?

894
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:39,046
This is not...

895
01:07:39,048 --> 01:07:41,082
I know it's not going
as I expected.

896
01:07:41,084 --> 01:07:43,117
I-I didn't mean these things
to come out.

897
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,686
I'm sorry,
but it was meant to be nice.

898
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:47,089
Well, what did you expect?

899
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:48,290
I wanted time with you.

900
01:07:48,292 --> 01:07:50,157
I wanted to have you
to myself.

901
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:51,927
You have me all the time.

902
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:53,695
- No.
- What are you talking about?

903
01:07:53,697 --> 01:07:54,962
I don't.
I... There-there's...

904
01:07:54,964 --> 01:07:56,864
there are always people around.

905
01:07:56,866 --> 01:07:59,634
And if not, then there's
something between us.

906
01:07:59,636 --> 01:08:01,203
- Something between us?
- Yes.

907
01:08:01,205 --> 01:08:02,637
What?

908
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:04,706
Some...

909
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:07,078
- What?
- Distance.

910
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:10,146
When did this happen?

911
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:13,052
What happened to make you
behave like this?

912
01:08:14,718 --> 01:08:17,922
Is it because you think
I don't need you?

913
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:21,857
- Yes.
- I don't.

914
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:24,292
Well, that's very predictable
of you.

915
01:08:24,294 --> 01:08:26,129
Don't act so tough.

916
01:08:26,131 --> 01:08:27,664
I know you are not.

917
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,131
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

918
01:08:29,133 --> 01:08:30,133
If I don't protect myself,

919
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:32,403
somebody will come
in the middle of the night

920
01:08:32,405 --> 01:08:34,071
and take over my corner
of the room

921
01:08:34,073 --> 01:08:36,674
and ask me about
their fucking asparagus.

922
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:37,774
Don't be a bully.
You're being a bully.

923
01:08:37,776 --> 01:08:39,409
There are other things
I'd like to do with my time.

924
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,877
- It's my time. My time!
- I have no idea

925
01:08:40,879 --> 01:08:42,680
what I'm doing here
in your time.

926
01:08:42,682 --> 01:08:44,081
What am I doing here?

927
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,149
I'm standing around like
an idiot waiting for you.

928
01:08:46,151 --> 01:08:47,818
- Waiting for what?
- Waiting for you.

929
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,823
Waiting for what?

930
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:53,857
Waiting for you
to get rid of me.

931
01:08:53,859 --> 01:08:56,093
To tell me to leave.

932
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:58,029
So tell me.

933
01:08:58,031 --> 01:09:01,166
So I don't stand around
like a fucking fool.

934
01:09:01,168 --> 01:09:03,167
Asparagus, is this all about
your asparagus?

935
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:05,203
- No, it's not about asparagus.
- Then what...

936
01:09:05,205 --> 01:09:06,337
the hell is it about?

937
01:09:06,339 --> 01:09:07,905
Are you a special agent
sent here

938
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:09,873
to ruin my evening
and possibly my entire life?

939
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,376
Why are you so rude to me?

940
01:09:11,378 --> 01:09:13,278
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- Is this my house?

941
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,145
- This is my house, isn't it?
- Yes, this is your house.

942
01:09:15,147 --> 01:09:17,782
- Is this my house?
- Of course it's your house.

943
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:19,184
Or did somebody drop me
on foreign soil

944
01:09:19,186 --> 01:09:21,087
- behind enemy lines?
- What a question.

945
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:23,054
- You brought me here.
- I'm surrounded on all sides.

946
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:24,323
It's you who brought me here.

947
01:09:24,325 --> 01:09:26,057
When the hell did this happen?
Who are you?

948
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:28,293
Do you have a gun?
You here to kill me?

949
01:09:28,295 --> 01:09:30,396
- Why are you talking like...?
- Hmm? Do you have a gun?

950
01:09:30,398 --> 01:09:33,065
- Stop it! Stop being a child.
- Where's your gun?

951
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:35,066
- Where's your gun?
- Stop playing.

952
01:09:35,068 --> 01:09:37,936
- Show me your gun.
- Stop playing this game.

953
01:09:37,938 --> 01:09:39,204
- I'm not playing a game.
- I am not.

954
01:09:39,206 --> 01:09:40,439
Yes, mm-hmm, uh-huh.

955
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:42,141
What game am I playing?
What game?

956
01:09:42,143 --> 01:09:44,777
What precisely is the nature
of my game?

957
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,178
You tell me.

958
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,282
Oh, this whole...

959
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,916
What?

960
01:09:50,918 --> 01:09:52,486
All your rules and your walls

961
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:54,821
and your doors and your people

962
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:58,924
and your money and all this
clothes and everything.

963
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:00,826
This, this, this game!

964
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:02,094
Everything here!

965
01:10:02,096 --> 01:10:03,996
- The whole... (sputters)
- (silverware clattering)

966
01:10:03,998 --> 01:10:07,233
Nothing is normal
or natural or...

967
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:08,872
Everything is a game.

968
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,974
"Yes, mister. No, madam.

969
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:15,009
Yes, uh..." (mutters)

970
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:17,377
- Well, if it's my...
- "I don't eat this.

971
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,247
- I don't drink that. I don't do..."
- If-if-if...

972
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:21,883
If it's my life
that you're describing,

973
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,216
it's entirely up to you

974
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,051
whether you choose
to share it or not.

975
01:10:25,053 --> 01:10:27,188
If you don't wish to share
that life, as apparently

976
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,157
it's so disagreeable to you
in every respect,

977
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:32,194
why don't you just fuck off
to back where you came from?

978
01:10:32,196 --> 01:10:34,199
F... Yeah, mm-hmm.

979
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:38,136
(departing footsteps)

980
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:43,007
(door slams shut)

981
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,516
Sometimes, it's good for him

982
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:58,890
to slow down his steps
a little.

983
01:11:00,392 --> 01:11:02,961
(flames crackling)

984
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,383
(birds chirping)

985
01:11:49,642 --> 01:11:52,212
♪ ♪

986
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:25,379
(talking quietly)

Alma, there's a strange boy
in the room.

1149
01:24:29,867 --> 01:24:31,266
Can you get him out, please?

1150
01:24:31,268 --> 01:24:33,903

- Fuck off.

1151
01:24:33,905 --> 01:24:35,705
CYRIL: Reynolds, please,
just let him examine you.

1152
01:24:35,707 --> 01:24:38,808
Mm-hmm, yes.
Yes, fuck off.

1153
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:41,743
I think this is clear. Hmm?

1154
01:24:41,745 --> 01:24:43,748
He wants you to fuck off.

1155

I'm so sorry, Doctor.

HARDY:
Not to worry.

1159
01:25:05,303 --> 01:25:07,837
I'll drop by tomorrow morning
to see how he's coming along.

1160
01:25:07,839 --> 01:25:09,440
- 9:00 a.m.?
- Yes. - Yes.

1161
01:25:09,442 --> 01:25:12,176
If his fever increases during
the night, you'll telephone me?

1162
01:25:12,178 --> 01:25:13,911

- Of course, Doctor.

1163
01:25:13,913 --> 01:25:15,311
Good night, Mrs. Woodcock.

1164

1170
01:26:11,973 --> 01:26:14,140
This dress will be ready
by 9:00 a.m.,

1171
01:26:14,142 --> 01:26:16,979
because that's when
it leaves for Belgium.

1172
01:26:23,918 --> 01:26:25,484
CYRIL:
Ladies, I'm very sorry,

1173
01:26:25,486 --> 01:26:28,154
but I'm afraid you'll have
to work late this evening.

1174
01:26:28,156 --> 01:26:31,458
The dress needs to be ready

1175
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:34,060
to make its journey to Belgium.

1176
01:26:34,062 --> 01:26:37,864
Do expect to be here
for quite some time.

1177

If you need to use
the telephone,

1178
01:26:39,869 --> 01:26:41,536
please use the one in my office

1179
01:26:41,538 --> 01:26:43,136

- Nana and Biddy,

1180
01:26:43,138 --> 01:26:45,872

- NANA: Could you pin the ribbon

1181
01:26:45,874 --> 01:26:47,207

Thank you.

1182
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:49,143
CYRIL:
Ladies, I'm very sorry,

1183

but I'm afraid you'll have

So please do expect to be here
possibly for most of the night.

1187
01:27:00,023 --> 01:27:02,024
If you need to make
telephone calls,

1188
01:27:02,026 --> 01:27:04,493
do so from my office.
Thank you.

Didn't I tell you to fuck off?

1306
01:38:38,984 --> 01:38:40,651
Yes. Yes, you did.

1307
01:38:40,653 --> 01:38:43,490
LADY BALTIMORE:
Dinner is served, everybody.

1308
01:38:44,289 --> 01:38:45,891
Come along with me.

1309
01:38:47,859 --> 01:38:51,027
So, that's your
shifty-eyed godson?

1310
01:38:51,029 --> 01:38:53,063
Shifty-eyed?

1311
01:38:53,065 --> 01:38:56,067
He's got perfectly normal eyes.

1312
01:38:56,069 --> 01:38:58,903
I'm rather less fat, I think,
than when you last saw me.

1313
01:38:58,905 --> 01:38:59,871
Really?

1314
01:38:59,873 --> 01:39:01,605
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

1315
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:03,241
It's fallen off me.

1316
01:39:03,243 --> 01:39:05,042
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1317
01:39:05,044 --> 01:39:06,844
REYNOLDS:
Very hard to tell sometimes.

1318
01:39:06,846 --> 01:39:10,247
I suppose that, um, there
are secrets nobody tells.

1319
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:11,716
(Alma laughing)

1320
01:39:11,718 --> 01:39:14,685
Your wife has got
that gorgeous glow

1321
01:39:14,687 --> 01:39:16,688
you get with a first marriage.

1322
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:19,057
HARDY:
How long will you be here for?

1323
01:39:19,059 --> 01:39:22,930
Seems my godson's rather
enjoying that glow as well.

1324
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:28,667
So, what are your plans
for New Year's Eve?

1325
01:39:28,669 --> 01:39:32,541
Oh, um... we don't have any.

1326
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,945
Then you should come out
for the Chelsea Arts Club Ball.

1327
01:39:38,044 --> 01:39:39,011
(chuckles)

1328
01:39:39,013 --> 01:39:40,945
- I don't know what that is.
- Well, it's not

1329
01:39:40,947 --> 01:39:42,382
something I'd suggest
if I didn't think

1330
01:39:42,384 --> 01:39:43,816
you'd have a wonderful time.

1331
01:39:43,818 --> 01:39:45,821
It's really something
to be seen.

1332
01:39:47,221 --> 01:39:50,323
(clears throat)
I'll pass it on to my husband,

1333
01:39:50,325 --> 01:39:52,862
but I think we'll stay in.

1334
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:58,063
Change your mind.

1335
01:39:58,065 --> 01:40:00,734
- Or get him to change his mind.
- (chuckles)

1336
01:40:00,736 --> 01:40:02,636
Or whatever it takes.
Now, please come.

1337
01:40:02,638 --> 01:40:05,174
I promise you
the time of your life.

1338
01:40:08,144 --> 01:40:11,181
How do you know
how my life has been?

1339
01:40:12,914 --> 01:40:14,818
I don't.

1340
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:17,884
You're right.

1341
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:20,120
I think this would be
quite a fine time,

1342
01:40:20,122 --> 01:40:22,990
if you'd like to come.

1343
01:40:22,992 --> 01:40:25,862
She's barely looked at you
this evening, has she?

1344
01:40:29,265 --> 01:40:31,603
(loud rattling)

1345
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:38,005
I think they're well
and truly shaken now.

1346
01:40:38,007 --> 01:40:40,811
(rattling stops;
dice drop on board)

1347
01:40:44,414 --> 01:40:46,750
(muttering quietly)

1348
01:40:47,685 --> 01:40:49,350
What on earth are you doing?

1349
01:40:49,352 --> 01:40:50,786
I rolled a three.

1350
01:40:50,788 --> 01:40:52,787
Yes, but that's the four pip.

1351
01:40:52,789 --> 01:40:54,957
- Get back to the bar where you belong.
- Oh.

1352
01:40:54,959 --> 01:40:56,792
Sorry.

1353
01:40:56,794 --> 01:40:58,226
Let's not start cheating
at this stage, Alma.

1354
01:40:58,228 --> 01:40:59,895
- I'm not cheating.
- (dice rattle on board)

1355
01:40:59,897 --> 01:41:01,430
- I don't need to cheat.
- Oh, good.

1356
01:41:01,432 --> 01:41:04,199
You do need to be able
to count, on the other hand.

1357
01:41:04,201 --> 01:41:06,935
Backgammon, by the way,
I get treble the score

1358
01:41:06,937 --> 01:41:10,006
because you haven't got
any checkers off the board.

1359
01:41:10,008 --> 01:41:11,340
Oh.

1360
01:41:11,342 --> 01:41:12,475
(sputters)

1361
01:41:12,477 --> 01:41:13,943
Stupid game anyway.

1362
01:41:13,945 --> 01:41:15,310
Well, maybe it seems stupid

1363
01:41:15,312 --> 01:41:17,447
to you now,
as you're currently losing,

1364
01:41:17,449 --> 01:41:19,315
but I dare say,
if you were victorious,

1365
01:41:19,317 --> 01:41:21,918
I'm confident you'd see it
in a different light.

1366
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,320
Now, they need your chair
for my next opponent.

1367
01:41:24,322 --> 01:41:25,791
Next.

1368
01:41:27,058 --> 01:41:28,926
- (Reynolds chuckles)
- LADY BALTIMORE: Me, please.

1369
01:41:28,928 --> 01:41:30,259
What?

1370
01:41:30,261 --> 01:41:32,428
What are you so cranky about?

1371
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:34,064
Have fun with
your next opponent.

1372
01:41:34,066 --> 01:41:37,200
Why, I think I will...
a lot more than I did with you.

1373
01:41:37,202 --> 01:41:38,802
LADY BALTIMORE:
Gosh.

1374
01:41:38,804 --> 01:41:41,774
She's really very rude,
isn't she?

1375
01:41:42,809 --> 01:41:44,843
My heart breaks for you.

1376
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:46,811
Oh, really?

1377
01:41:46,813 --> 01:41:49,083
Like being married
to a toddler.

1378
01:41:50,317 --> 01:41:53,050
I don't want to be racist,
but, I mean...

1379
01:41:53,052 --> 01:41:55,520
is there some sort of custom
at this time of the night

1380
01:41:55,522 --> 01:41:57,054
in her country where...

1381
01:41:57,056 --> 01:41:59,124
- I mean, what is she doing?
- Where what?

1382
01:41:59,126 --> 01:42:01,959
I don't know. I don't know
if she's up stealing things

1383
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:04,094
or attacking people. I mean...

across it, every time...

1386
01:42:08,468 --> 01:42:10,335
I want to go dancing.

1388

When?

1389
01:42:16,043 --> 01:42:17,846
Right now.

1390
01:42:20,782 --> 01:42:22,548
You're joking.

1391
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,753
No, I'm not.

1392
01:42:25,485 --> 01:42:27,321
It's New Year's Eve.

1393

(pen scratching on paper)

1395
01:42:38,267 --> 01:42:40,867
There's a party
at the Devonshire Hall

1396
01:42:40,869 --> 01:42:43,202
to celebrate the New Year,

1397

to do about it?

take it in at the waist?

- Yes.

Yes, okay, just take it out.

Mm-hmm.

a quarter of an inch

Why didn't you tell me?

Because I didn't want to.

Is there something
I'm unaware of?

Because,
as far as I can remember,

1459
01:49:05,769 --> 01:49:08,269
all I have done
is to dress her beautifully.

I don't think that matters
to some people.

01:49:11,775 --> 01:49:15,611
I think they want
what is fashionable and chic.
