1
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,898
My mother made me promise
to be an artist.

2
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:40,968
She taught me that imagination
could take a person anywhere.

3
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:43,138
Mine took me from Indiana...

4
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:46,208
...to Broadway to Hollywood.

5
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,818
She was right.

6
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:53,536
- Hello, Lou.
- Mr. Kazan, how are you?

7
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:56,586
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, sir.

8
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:59,591
- Otto. How are you?
- Good morning, sir.

9
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:03,136
- Good morning, Mr. Kazan.
- Good morning, Miss Harris.

10
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,677
You look beautiful, Julie.

11
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,334
Thank you.

12
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:14,184
- Perfect, Anna.
- Thank you, Mr. Kazan.

13
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:17,287
- Let's film this, Mike.
- Yes, sir.

14
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:19,011
What else do we have?

15
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:21,960
- Raymond. Where is he?
- Let's clear.

16
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:25,541
Good morning. Hello!
It's nice to see you again.

17
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:28,291
Elia, good heavens,
they're shooting.

18
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,629
It's okay.
We're not shooting with sound.

19
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:33,193
Good. How are you?
Good morning, Anna.

20
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,393
Julie, you look marvelous.

21
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:37,382
Thank you. Good morning, Raymond.

22
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,617
- Good morning, Mr. Massey.
- Good morning.

23
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,859
Good morning. Lovely day.

24
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:45,124
This is what he'll wear
in the birthday scene.

25
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:46,729
I like the cloth.

26
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:48,100
Just for you, Raymond.

27
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:51,396
Do you think I'm back playing
Abe Lincoln in this get-up?

28
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,600
Not at all.
It seems right to me.

29
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:55,590
All right. It feels good.

30
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:57,858
Thank you.
Let's shoot Mr. Massey next.

31
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:59,204
Can I have one that works?

32
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:03,198
Absolutely. We'll get Props on that.
Props, Mr. Massey needs you!

33
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,344
I am so looking
forward to this.

34
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:08,481
- So am I, Raymond. So am I.
- Good.

35
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:11,617
- Do you want this smiling or natural?
- Natural.

36
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,086
I wanted to call you last night.

37
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:17,927
I wanted to tell you how wonderful
you were in rehearsals.

38
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:20,294
Just so beautifully...
Just very pleased.

39
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:24,931
- I think we've broken through.
- Oh, yes. I do too.

40
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,664
James Dean is here.

41
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,647
Send him in.

42
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:30,403
Be right back.

43
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:32,999
Raymond, let's stop this for a moment.

44
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:34,816
Sorry, everybody.

45
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:38,944
The boy I've cast as Cal is coming in
and I'd like you to meet him.

46
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:40,805
Well, I'd be happy to.

47
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:43,235
He's never done a feature before.

48
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:47,874
He's done some first-rate stage
and TV work. He's a natural.

49
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,840
He may strike you as odd,
but he's enormously talented.

50
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,015
Well, let's take a look.

51
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,167
Jimmy.

52
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,015
Jimmy, come meet Raymond Massey.

53
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,112
- Oh, he's probably shy.
- Come on.

54
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:03,941
All right.

55
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:16,485
This man can't play my father.
He's too old.

56
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,299
Get somebody else.

57
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:28,196
- I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him.
- What-

58
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,451
What the hell
were you thinking in there?

59
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:45,695
Raymond Massey is a highly respected
actor and you've offended him.

60
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,766
- He said I offended him?
- Of course you deeply offended him.

61
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:51,298
Good.

62
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:54,334
Why good?

63
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:58,885
Because I need him to hate me.

64
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:14,982
Yeah, we're still a little hot.

65
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,598
Mark, you up there?

66
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,603
Hey, Al!

67
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,785
Al, pan that lamp around.

68
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,800
All right, who isn't ready?

69
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:28,582
Good. Let's shoot this one.

70
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:32,127
Okay, we're going, people.
Let's all settle down.

71
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:35,593
- And... roll camera.
- Rolling.

72
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:38,687
Scene 163 Apple, take three.

73
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,799
Okay, marker!

74
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,579
And action!

75
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,215
Cal, you'll have to give it back.

76
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:54,887
No, I- I made it for you, Dad.

77
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:56,194
You'll have to give it back.

78
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,447
- To who? I can't give it back-
- To the people you got it from.

79
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:02,366
The British Purchasing Agency?

80
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,813
I can't give it back to them.

81
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,537
Then to the farmers you robbed.

82
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,738
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.
We paid two cents a pound...

83
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:11,839
- Two cents over market for that stuff.
- Cal.

84
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,557
I sign my name...

85
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,791
...and boys go out
and some of them die.

86
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,572
And some live helpless
without arms or legs.

87
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,616
Not one will come back untorn.

88
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:27,329
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

89
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,163
I don't want the money, Cal.
I couldn't take it!

90
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,107
But thank you for the thought.

91
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:37,825
I'll keep it for you.
I'll wrap it up and-

92
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:41,060
I can't take it! I won't take it!

93
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,614
Son...

94
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:47,208
...I'd be happy if
you gave me something...

95
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,570
Well, something like your brother.

96
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:51,656
Something honest and...

97
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,631
...and human and good.

98
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,387
Now, don't be angry, son.

99
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:59,847
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

100
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,559
That's something I can value.

101
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:07,938
No, Cal.

102
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,858
No. Damn it!

103
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,319
I'm sorry, IKaz. I'm...

104
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:21,766
Cut it!

105
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:25,598
IKaz, may I speak to you
a moment? Privately!

106
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,393
Let's not everybody fall apart.

107
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,698
- What's up?
- Why is he trying to hug me?

108
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:34,337
It's infuriating! What he's supposed
to do is turn from me and exit.

109
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,130
That is what-

110
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,402
The last moment is mine.

111
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,503
- I understand.
- He's humiliating my character.

112
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:45,251
- I'll talk to him and take care of it.
- Please do.

113
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:52,864
He'll be fine.
He's right where we want him.

114
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:55,587
But I need one more.
You got another one in you?

115
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,339
You just let me know
when you're ready, okay?

116
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:01,220
This time, try to kiss him.

117
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:05,602
Raymond.

118
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,402
- I've talked to him. He's very sorry.
- I should think.

119
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:17,503
I don't know what to do either.
I need your help.

120
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,299
- If you could do me one favor...
- What?

121
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:23,358
If you could stay in the scene
and react in character.

122
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,927
No matter what he does, wait
for me to yell, "Cut. "

123
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,062
You have no idea how difficult it is.

124
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:30,153
- He's so unprofessional.
- He's a young man.

125
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:33,412
- Yes, he is.
- You're a brilliant actor. Help him.

126
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,707
Help him. Help me because
I don't know what else to do.

127
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:38,279
All right, all right, all right.

128
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:42,822
Thank you. Everybody, let's take it
from Adam's line "I sign my name"...

129
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,865
...right through Cal's exit
and no stops, no matter what!

130
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,423
Okay, everyone,
back to one, back to one!

131
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:52,097
- "I sign my name" right to the end.
- All right.

132
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,871
- Let's go. Quickly.
- Roll camera.

133
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:11,236
Scene 163 Apple, take four.

134
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,110
- Slate it.
- Marker!

135
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,206
And action.

136
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,832
Cal, I sign my name...

137
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,642
...and boys go out and some die.

138
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,295
And some live helpless
without arms or legs.

139
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:31,906
Not one will come back untorn. Do you
think I could take a profit from that?

140
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,682
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

141
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,860
Well, thank you for the thought.

142
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,780
I'll keep it.
I'll wrap it up-

143
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:42,083
I'll never take it!

144
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:44,323
Son...

145
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:48,737
...I'd be happy
if you'd given me something...

146
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:51,461
...like your brother's given me.

147
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:53,599
Something honest and human and good.

148
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:57,095
Oh, don't be angry, son.

149
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,742
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

150
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:03,041
That's something I could value.

151
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:17,792
Cal.

152
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:20,456
Cal, I-

153
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:27,973
Cal!

154
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,297
Cut!

155
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,630
Print that one, please.

156
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:44,040
Gets no better than that.

157
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:46,724
Did you see that?

158
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,336
I did. It was brilliant.
Thank you, Raymond.

159
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:55,366
Okay, that's it.
Let's print three and four.

160
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,827
"O the raggedy man
He works for Pa

161
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:24,294
And he's the goodest man you ever saw

162
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:26,277
He comes to our house every day

163
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:29,797
Waters the horses and feeds them hay

164
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:33,256
And he opens the shed
And we just all laugh

165
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:36,612
When he just drives out
Our little wobbly calf"

166
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:38,437
What is he saying?

167
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,798
It's a poem, Daddy.

168
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,485
He's memorized three entire verses...

169
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,339
...of James Whitcomb Riley's
"Raggedy Man. "

170
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,996
I am trying to read my paper.

171
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,192
It's a lovely poem, Win.

172
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,254
Fine, you two take the front room.

173
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,184
It's not you, honey.

174
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:08,614
Daddy's upset with me.
Now, he loves you.

175
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,939
Come on, come here.
It's not your fault, Jimmy.

176
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:17,701
- It was a long time ago.
- I need a place by myself.

177
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:19,937
- But I'll be lonely.
- A place where I'm being respected.

178
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:23,453
Please don't leave me, Win. Please!

179
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,579
You asleep, Jimmy?

180
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,176
No.

181
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:56,128
- Jimmy, I have to go away for a while.
- Where, Mama?

182
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:58,335
I have to go to the hospital.

183
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,116
Why?

184
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,358
Because I'm not well.

185
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:11,718
The doctors, they need to...

186
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,691
They need to do some things
to make me get better.

187
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:20,994
Can I go with you?

188
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:23,295
I wish you could.

189
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:27,461
Who's gonna get me up for school?
Who's staying with me?

190
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:28,604
Daddy.

191
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:34,563
Daddy doesn't like me anymore.

192
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,892
No, of course he does.
He loves you.

193
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,678
He won't hug me.

194
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:44,191
Listen, Daddy's not mad at you, Jimmy.

195
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:49,159
Just keep showing Daddy
your love and he'll love you back.

196
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:54,174
It's not Daddy's fault, Jimmy.

197
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,327
Now go to sleep.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,277
I love you.

199
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,022
I was nine years old
when my mother died.

200
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:52,254
My grandmother Emma
came out to Los Angeles...

201
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:55,653
...to bring my mother's body
back to Indiana for the funeral.

202
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:58,237
I think it would be better
if you came with us now-

203
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,512
I can't do that, Mother.

204
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,202
- The boy is so upset.
- I can't leave work just now.

205
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,407
I really can't.
I'll be there at the funeral.

206
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,300
All aboard!

207
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:16,832
Take good care of your grandma, Jim.

208
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:22,046
Winton, you shouldn't
take this out on the boy.

209
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,102
Now, for God's sake, give him a kiss.

210
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:27,613
Say something encouraging.

211
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I'll be coming out to Indiana
in a couple of days, Jim.

212
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:42,278
All aboard!

213
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:56,351
You gotta go, Jim.

214
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,997
All aboard, please.

215
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,167
Jimmy?

216
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:41,086
Jimmy.

217
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:45,734
No, thanks, Grandma.
I'll go sit with her.

218
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,261
I'm right here with you...

219
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,529
...so don't worry about nothing, okay?

220
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:19,168
Can you hear me?
Mama, can you hear me?

221
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:29,278
My father never came
to my mother's funeral.

222
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,196
In fact, he never came
to Indiana at all.

223
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,682
I moved in with my Aunt Hortense
and Uncle Marcus.

224
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,611
Son, you can't stay here.

225
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:20,262
You almost got me
that time, Mr. Walther.

226
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,141
Yeah, one of these days, James.

227
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,405
You got anything for me from California?

228
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,574
No, just the usual.

229
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,258
Want ads, circulars.

230
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,044
I'm sorry.

231
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,127
Yeah.

232
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:49,987
Our next graduate holds
the Grant County record...

233
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:51,939
...for the pole vault.

234
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,339
He is a four-letter man...

235
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,693
...an outstanding dramatic speaker...

236
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:02,019
...and as everybody knows,
a fine actor.

237
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:16,416
And he will soon be off
to study Business Administration...

238
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:21,444
...at Santa Monica
Community College in California.

239
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,375
James Byron Dean!

240
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,040
Jim, is that you?

241
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,553
Come on in.

242
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:27,199
Thank you for letting me
stay here with you.

243
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:31,042
You can stay here
a month or so, till you're on your feet.

244
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,061
It's fine with us.

245
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:34,847
This is Ethel.

246
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,477
Oh, hi.

247
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:40,544
Your dad's told me so much about
you. I'm glad to meet you.

248
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:43,558
Ethel's my wife, Jim. We're married.

249
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,174
You're married.

250
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:50,114
That- That's great.

251
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:53,699
Let me show you the guest room.

252
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:55,073
I mean, your room.

253
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,428
I hated business school.

254
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,856
Felt like I was wasting my time.

255
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:17,890
I'd done some acting in high school
and I loved it.

256
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:22,142
And more than anything,
I wanted to study acting.

257
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:25,061
Oh, Winnie. Oh, Winnie.

258
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:55,902
Acting?

259
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:58,044
Like in plays and movies?

260
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:01,954
Yes, sir.

261
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:10,237
How you planning on making a living?

262
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:12,897
Acting.

263
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:20,837
You are a dreamer.
Just like your mama.

264
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:25,088
That wasn't our understanding.

265
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,956
You stay in business school...

266
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:31,712
...and you can stay here.

267
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,557
But you study acting...

268
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:41,052
...you're on your own.

269
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,638
Next in is...

270
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,116
...Byron and/or James Dean?

271
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,267
Over here, kid.

272
00:22:53,286 --> 00:22:55,676
Which is your real name?
Byron or James?

273
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:57,376
Well...

274
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,605
What do you think is better
for an actor?

275
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,773
Go with your real name. Less confusing.

276
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:06,559
What can I do for you?

277
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:09,917
I want to study here...

278
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,313
...in your professional acting class,
Mr. Whitmore.

279
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:15,814
Are you any good?

280
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:23,008
Well, I did a couple plays
in high school...

281
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,857
...and people said
I was pretty good, but I...

282
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:29,504
Sir, I don't want to be just good.

283
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:31,197
I want to be great.

284
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,555
Got any money?

285
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,688
No.

286
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:40,510
I sure don't.

287
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:42,819
Great ones never do.

288
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:45,251
All right, kid. You're in.

289
00:24:06,182 --> 00:24:09,565
It's 12 a week, man. Cash, no checks.

290
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:20,960
I'll take it.

291
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,994
So how come you got a card
up at Whitmore's studio?

292
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:29,604
You an actor?

293
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,796
Next to Brando,
I'm the world's greatest actor.

294
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,006
Who's Brando?

295
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:38,332
Jimmy, Billy, up front.

296
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:41,251
Billy owns a watch repair shop.

297
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,065
Jimmy's picking up a watch
that he cleaned.

298
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,335
Billy, come here. Come here.

299
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:52,453
You know it's stolen,
you called the cops.

300
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:57,158
You gotta keep Jimmy here till they
arrive so you can collect the reward.

301
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:59,868
Don't let him go. Okay?

302
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:06,235
All right.

303
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:09,440
You have an appointment
in 15 minutes...

304
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,640
...to deliver this watch
across town to a buyer...

305
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,813
...for $2000 cash.

306
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,041
You want to get the watch fast.
You need the money, Jimmy.

307
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:22,273
- All right. You both got the setup?
- Yeah.

308
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:28,925
Whenever you're ready.

309
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:36,636
Hi.

310
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:40,411
I'm here to pick up that watch
right there in the case.

311
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,395
It's not ready yet.
Just give me a minute.

312
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,054
No, that's fine.

313
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:46,661
No, no, no. Stay cool.

314
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:47,869
Give me the watch, man!

315
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,510
Okay, give me a minute.

316
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:50,912
Hey!

317
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,598
- Hey! IKnock it off!
- Come on, you stinking black!

318
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:59,042
Jimmy, knock it off!

319
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:01,474
- IKnock it off, Jimmy!
- I'm gonna kill you!

320
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:04,417
Jimmy, knock it off. Jimmy!

321
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:08,094
Hey. Enough, enough.

322
00:26:09,223 --> 00:26:10,335
Enough.

323
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:23,835
Stanislavski, you're next. Come on in.

324
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,486
You get into a lot of fights?

325
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,564
No, not a lot.

326
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:39,866
You will...

327
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:43,296
...if you let yourself go
over the edge like you just did.

328
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:46,468
Jimmy, acting is acting.

329
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:50,404
You can't get confused.
You gotta know where to draw the line.

330
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:55,651
Yeah, I know. I know.

331
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,492
I mean, it was good, right?

332
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:01,444
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:03,492
Yes, it was good.

334
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:05,377
Wait, Mr. Whitmore.

335
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:07,932
I want to ask you something.

336
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,787
Do you think I got the goods
to be a real actor?

337
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,717
Yes, I do, Jimmy.

338
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:22,082
Yes, I do.

339
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,935
I decided to move to New York.

340
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:32,572
Every actor I cared about,
Brando, Clift, even Whitmore...

341
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:34,846
...all worked in New York.

342
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:37,346
New York was big and lonely...

343
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,004
...and I loved it.

344
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:43,099
Being a struggling actor in New York
in the 1950s was the best.

345
00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:44,928
The right place at the right time.

346
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,243
I stopped worrying about
my mother and father for a while.

347
00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:51,263
I was dead broke.

348
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:53,119
It didn't matter.

349
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:54,875
I was home.

350
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:59,203
Off the stage! Off the stage!
Let's go!

351
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,805
Next five numbers. 120 through 124.

352
00:28:04,422 --> 00:28:05,534
Shut up!

353
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:08,101
Shut up! I want to see those numbers!

354
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:10,016
I want to see them today!

355
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:13,660
123, 120, 124!

356
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:17,310
Today, today! Thank you.

357
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,984
Smoke?

358
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:23,197
Yeah.

359
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:26,433
- Thanks, man.
- No problem.

360
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,898
What's your name?

361
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,816
I can't decide.

362
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:32,964
What are your choices?

363
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:36,355
Well, I got James Dean, Jimmy Dean...

364
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:38,690
...or Byron Dean.

365
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,609
Which one's your real name?

366
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,490
James. Byron's my middle name.

367
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:45,989
Go with your real name.

368
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,155
- You think?
- I know.

369
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:52,927
Jimmy's an 8-year-old boy
and Byron's a dead poet with a clubfoot.

370
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,973
And James is king.

371
00:28:57,094 --> 00:28:58,043
What's your name?

372
00:28:58,246 --> 00:28:59,293
Martin Landau.

373
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:03,517
Where you from?

374
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:05,789
Why? You wanna come home
and meet my mom?

375
00:29:06,021 --> 00:29:07,166
Yeah, can she cook?

376
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:09,919
- You like matzo ball soup?
- My favorite.

377
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,931
You're invited.
Where you living?

378
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,613
Some dirt-hole rented room.

379
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:16,828
Let's go, fellas.

380
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:21,470
125 through 129, you're up!

381
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:22,943
What number you got?

382
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:24,865
231.

383
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:26,174
I'm 216.

384
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,343
Let's cut out, man.
Cattle calls are for losers.

385
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,468
Yeah?

386
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:32,964
Unless you got an agent sending you in,
you're kidding yourself.

387
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,271
All right.

388
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:45,470
Thanks.

389
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:47,806
You got an agent?

390
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:49,566
If I had an agent...

391
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:54,367
...would I be blowing my time
with a goof like you?

392
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:55,998
Come on.

393
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:59,133
Hey, who was Brando's agent
in New York?

394
00:29:59,877 --> 00:30:01,088
Louis.

395
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:02,308
What?

396
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,047
I'll take him on.
I have a hunch I can sell him.

397
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,800
To who? To The Ringling Brothers?

398
00:30:08,998 --> 00:30:11,137
Jane, he's too strange!

399
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:14,497
It's a "strange" people
won't get out of their minds.

400
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:19,035
I think he's a star.
Let me see what I can do with him.

401
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,830
All right. You do it on your own time,
not on my time.

402
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,876
What am I gonna do with you?

403
00:30:39,652 --> 00:30:40,700
Bring your chair over.

404
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,924
You put "Leads only. "
You can't just audition for leads.

405
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:54,653
Why not?

406
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:57,565
For one thing, you've got to eat.

407
00:30:58,342 --> 00:31:00,196
No, Miss Deacy...

408
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:05,117
Look, I only want to audition
for important parts.

409
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:08,128
I mean, parts that I care about.

410
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:10,588
Even if I have to starve.

411
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,991
Fine.

412
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:21,696
Thank you, Miss Deacy.

413
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:25,375
I'm a...

414
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:28,412
I'm a really lucky guy.

415
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:31,132
I've got the best agent in the world.

416
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:34,211
Get me those 8 x 10s.

417
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:46,687
Hi.

418
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:49,149
You work here?

419
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,130
I don't work here.

420
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:52,635
So...

421
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,166
...you're a writer or something?

422
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:56,576
You're an actor?

423
00:31:57,158 --> 00:31:58,783
Jane Deacy just signed me.

424
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,217
Well, congratulations.

425
00:32:02,277 --> 00:32:03,619
Are you an actor?

426
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:05,918
Actress. I'm an actress.

427
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,573
What are you writing,
Miss Actress?

428
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:10,236
Audition scene.

429
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,314
Yeah? Who wrote it?

430
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:14,306
That's what I'm trying to do.

431
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,093
Can I see it?

432
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:17,700
Yeah.

433
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:20,127
Well, this is the first page.

434
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:36,381
- So?
- Yeah, this is good.

435
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:38,717
What are you auditioning for?

436
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:39,866
The Studio.

437
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:43,391
Actors Studio?

438
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:44,832
Yeah.

439
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,776
Wow.

440
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:51,935
Brando's like some kind
of lifetime member there, right?

441
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,689
Yeah.

442
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,667
What's your name?

443
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:58,654
No, wait, don't, don't, don't.

444
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:01,697
- Why not?
- I don't know.

445
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:03,769
How about...

446
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:08,643
How about I take you out tonight?

447
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:11,364
I'll give you a ride on my motorcycle.

448
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:15,808
And then after I take you home
after the movie...

449
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,868
...when I lean in to kiss,
you can tell me then.

450
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:24,285
You got a scene partner?

451
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:26,651
I did.

452
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:28,766
Come on!

453
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:34,433
- I can't...
- Come on!

454
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:36,515
- Come on!
- Let's do it!

455
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:37,952
Let's go!

456
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:44,731
Oh, this is great.

457
00:33:57,925 --> 00:33:58,907
What's the matter?

458
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,318
White.

459
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:02,204
Christine White.

460
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,777
My name.

461
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,275
Good to meet you.

462
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:13,477
Okay, I need Morty Chase
and Stanley Rushton.

463
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,122
Yes, gentlemen, please. Thank you.

464
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:18,975
Ah, excuse me. Excuse me.

465
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:20,960
Who's watching the auditions?

466
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:24,092
Kazan, Lee Strasberg,
and Cheryl Crawford.

467
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:27,075
- They're all here.
- Who?

468
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,715
Strasberg, Elia Kazan
and Cheryl Crawford.

469
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,674
- Oh, my God.
- Good.

470
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,532
Hey, that's my prop! Don't drink it!

471
00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:45,474
Jimmy. Jimmy, stop! Come on.

472
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,769
You just drank my prop, Jimmy.

473
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:51,583
Okay, Christine White and James Dean?

474
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:52,795
Yes, that's us.

475
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:55,931
- You're on next. Are you ready?
- We're ready. Thank you.

476
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:57,626
Oh, my God.

477
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,900
Where are your glasses?

478
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:01,508
No, they're wrong for my character.

479
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,805
Wait, can you see anything
without your glasses?

480
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:06,338
Yeah, I see fine.
What do you think, man? How-

481
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,213
Yeah, very, very funny.
Put on your glasses.

482
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:11,584
I can't, Chris.
They're back at my place.

483
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:13,275
Why'd you leave them at your place?

484
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:16,379
They're wrong for my character.
I don't want to be tempted to use them.

485
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,403
Dean, White, let's go!

486
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:20,481
Oh, sorry. I didn't-

487
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:23,710
That's a chair.
You're apologizing to a chair.

488
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:26,590
I'm telling you, Jimmy, you never know.

489
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,643
Look at me when I auditioned
for Tennessee Williams.

490
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,430
I thought I was terrible.

491
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:33,537
You were terrible.
You didn't get the part.

492
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,521
It's just a detail.

493
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:37,625
Hi.

494
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,802
I'm Rogers Brackett.

495
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:42,530
Oh, God. The director?

496
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:47,776
A mutual friend tells me that
you're enormously talented.

497
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:51,838
Yeah, I guess.

498
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,026
I know of something that
you just might be right for.

499
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,635
A TV drama. It's a very good role.

500
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:03,684
So... would you like to audition?

501
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,858
Yeah, sure.

502
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:10,525
There's a party at my place tonight.
How would you feel about stopping by?

503
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,599
We could chat about the project.

504
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:16,285
There'll be some interesting men there.

505
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,727
Yeah, that sounds like a ball.

506
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,249
Here's my card.

507
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,387
Why don't you come by late?

508
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:29,628
Say midnight?

509
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:33,377
Yeah, midnight. That...

510
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:34,814
Perfect.

511
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:37,212
Good. See you later.

512
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:39,520
Right on.

513
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:44,580
That man's a class-A faygalah,
you know that, right?

514
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:49,370
Yeah, the man's a class-A faygalah
with a paying job.

515
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,231
Oh, Lord, you look like Hamlet!

516
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:13,058
Come in.

517
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:31,648
I'm drumming. Go to hell!

518
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:34,843
Come on, Jimmy. It's important!

519
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,914
Open up, open up! Come on!

520
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:40,319
Come on!

521
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,207
You want to break my door down?

522
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,979
- What's that?
- Actors Studio.

523
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,904
- Let me see.
- No.

524
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,302
Chris, let me see.

525
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,060
- Chris!
- Wait, wait!

526
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,626
- I'm gonna pour water on you.
- Wait, wait, wait!

527
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:57,211
You want to open it?

528
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:58,683
Or should I?

529
00:38:04,964 --> 00:38:06,012
Here, you do it.

530
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:10,393
Oh, God.

531
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,113
Come on!

532
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:29,752
What?

533
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:32,798
We're in.

534
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:35,842
Both of us?

535
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:39,646
Both of us. We are in!

536
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:47,290
Give me that Actors Studio butt!

537
00:38:57,444 --> 00:38:58,851
Dear Father...

538
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,306
...I hope you're well.
I think of you often.

539
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,893
My life in New York is a happy one.

540
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:07,326
I'm finding work as an actor.

541
00:39:07,523 --> 00:39:10,241
I'm in a TVplay
that will be broadcast live...

542
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:12,770
...all over the country
in two weeks' time.

543
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,852
I hope you can watch.

544
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:19,161
And he'd yell up to me:

545
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,641
"Yo, Joey.

546
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:27,521
Come on down and play, Joey.

547
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,050
Joey. "

548
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:32,866
I hate to be wrong, but you were right.

549
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:35,419
Thank you, Louie.

550
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,017
Jimmy, you were fantastic!
I'm so proud. We all watched.

551
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,682
Saw it, saw it.

552
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:51,586
Here, here, here. Double Black Label,
the nectar of the gods.

553
00:39:51,781 --> 00:39:55,162
- Jerry, give me two more of these.
- Thank you.

554
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:57,852
That's for me, man.
I was just on national TV.

555
00:39:58,052 --> 00:40:00,605
So you're on TV,
and too cheap to buy me a drink.

556
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:02,210
Raise your glasses, everybody.

557
00:40:02,404 --> 00:40:05,787
Raise your glasses.
I'd like to make a toast to James Dean...

558
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:09,851
...who's just achieved
what we all aspire to. Paid work!

559
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,546
Father, it's James.

560
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:21,152
Did you get a chance
to watch the play on TV?

561
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:29,119
It was tonight.
It was the one I wrote you about.

562
00:40:36,772 --> 00:40:39,586
No. No, I don't mind.

563
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:42,303
I understand.

564
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,947
Yes, sir.

565
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:29,402
Okay, James Dean is next. James Dean!

566
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:30,650
Yeah.

567
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:41,660
That's James Dean.

568
00:41:42,818 --> 00:41:46,049
Mr. Dean, you're reading
for an Arab, not a cowboy.

569
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:47,673
Would you mind removing your hat?

570
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,182
Sure.

571
00:41:58,595 --> 00:42:00,734
Can you read
with broken glasses?

572
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:03,291
No, not so well, but...

573
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:07,416
I'd like to give it a shot, if you
don't mind, Mr. Rose and Mr. Mann.

574
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:11,967
It's okay with me. Let's start from...

575
00:42:12,388 --> 00:42:15,966
...act two, scene one,
Bachir's entrance.

576
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:20,636
Okay, page 36. We're gonna
pick it up in the middle of the page.

577
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,496
Right there.

578
00:42:33,346 --> 00:42:36,381
"Sir, did that doctor tell you
anything about me, sir?"

579
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,718
"Why? Is there something to tell?"

580
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,077
"Uh, no, sir. "

581
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:46,144
"He's a- He's a good doctor. "

582
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:47,901
"Are you hungry?"

583
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,114
"No. "

584
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:52,733
Okay.

585
00:42:57,507 --> 00:42:59,417
I'm sorry, I...

586
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:03,327
I'm having trouble
seeing through the tape on my glasses.

587
00:43:03,524 --> 00:43:05,279
How long will it take to fix them?

588
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,767
It's not the time, it's...

589
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,370
It's the 10 bucks.

590
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,342
Hang on.

591
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,419
Come here, kid.

592
00:43:21,828 --> 00:43:23,202
Get your glasses fixed.

593
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:26,393
Come back this afternoon. Around 4:30?

594
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:31,135
Yeah, okay, 4:30's great.

595
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,060
- All right, thank you.
- Don't forget your hat.

596
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,536
All right.

597
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:41,214
That's a nice rose there.

598
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,521
Nice kid.

599
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:50,619
- You think?
- He's adorable.

600
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:56,893
Now, let's try it again, okay?
Let's do one more.

601
00:43:58,404 --> 00:43:59,648
We can get it this time.

602
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:01,243
Okay.

603
00:44:01,988 --> 00:44:04,921
Sir, did the doctor tell you
anything about me?

604
00:44:05,123 --> 00:44:07,676
No, no, no, no. That doctor.

605
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:11,230
There's another "sir" at the end.
See it?

606
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:13,118
Let's try it again.

607
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:18,265
Sir, did that doctor tell you
anything about me, sir?

608
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:20,223
Perfect!

609
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:23,138
All right, here.
You got change for a 10?

610
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:27,930
Sir...

611
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:32,701
...did that doctor tell you
anything about me, sir?

612
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,409
"Why? Is there something to tell?"

613
00:44:36,612 --> 00:44:39,612
Oh, no, sir. He's a good doctor.

614
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,385
Are you hungry?

615
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:51,102
"No. "

616
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:55,133
I brought it too soon.

617
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,661
What a shame.

618
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:00,732
That's enough.

619
00:45:01,347 --> 00:45:03,649
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Wait, wait, wait.

620
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:06,328
I really like him, Danny.

621
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:08,510
He's good.

622
00:45:08,866 --> 00:45:12,697
- A little too weird, though.
- I'd like to hear him read with Geri.

623
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,106
I'll try it.

624
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,298
Can you stick around
for a half-hour?

625
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,826
We'd like you to read
with Geraldine Page.

626
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:25,889
Yeah, sure, I'll...

627
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:29,344
I'm open. I'll be over there.

628
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:34,010
You took my 10 bucks
and didn't get your glasses fixed!

629
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,244
Yeah, I used it to eat.

630
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:41,529
But I memorized it
so I didn't have to read it.

631
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:43,296
Do you...

632
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:45,688
...forgive me?

633
00:45:46,883 --> 00:45:47,931
Sure.

634
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:51,583
We're very interested in you
for this part.

635
00:45:53,347 --> 00:45:54,524
Thanks.

636
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:05,239
Biskra is a confusing place.
Don't you think so, Michel?

637
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:06,584
No.

638
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:09,088
Well, perhaps not.

639
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:13,473
Perhaps I think so because
you've been in that awful hospital.

640
00:46:13,668 --> 00:46:16,798
Jimmy, come on, that's your cue.
Come on, get up.

641
00:46:21,506 --> 00:46:23,034
Ah, sorry.

642
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:25,379
Madame, I'm...

643
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:29,720
...so happy that my gentleman
came home that...

644
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:31,488
...I was too lively.

645
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:35,480
Hold it! Hold it!
Everybody, take 10.

646
00:46:35,747 --> 00:46:37,787
We're on 10, but let's stay close!

647
00:46:37,987 --> 00:46:40,473
Jimmy, come over here. Over here!

648
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:44,792
Come on! Clear the set,
but don't go too far.

649
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:52,540
Sit.

650
00:46:58,307 --> 00:47:00,762
Now, I've been saying this
40 ways to Christmas...

651
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:02,970
...but you don't seem to want
to get it through your head.

652
00:47:03,171 --> 00:47:04,731
- Thick head.
- What?

653
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:08,570
The expression is
"get it through your thick head. "

654
00:47:10,308 --> 00:47:14,301
I'm breaking my ass trying
to get this turkey off the ground.

655
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,084
I have no time for your games.

656
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:20,348
Now, the name of the play
is The Immoralist.

657
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,435
It's not
"Let's Hear James Dean Mumble. "

658
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,515
When will I have the privilege...

659
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,674
...of hearing you clearly?

660
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:34,559
I have been extremely patient thus far.

661
00:47:35,427 --> 00:47:38,426
But frankly, you cut my part down
so much, I don't even know...

662
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:40,481
...who I am playing anymore.

663
00:47:40,835 --> 00:47:42,297
And this upsets me.

664
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:45,406
If that means mumbling
through rehearsals...

665
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:48,156
...then you'll have
to be patient too.

666
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:49,884
Okay?

667
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:05,273
How'd you like that acting?

668
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:06,810
Could you hear me okay?

669
00:48:08,002 --> 00:48:09,824
It's very convincing.

670
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:19,100
While we were rehearsing
The Immoralist...

671
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:22,911
...I got a call from Jane Deacy
to audition for Elia Kazan...

672
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:24,863
...for East of Eden.

673
00:48:25,092 --> 00:48:28,124
Kazan had directed Brando
in Streetcar...

674
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:29,691
...and On the Waterfront.

675
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:42,967
Morning, Jimmy.

676
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:46,689
Have a seat.

677
00:49:02,146 --> 00:49:03,739
Tell us about yourself, Jimmy.

678
00:49:08,705 --> 00:49:09,720
Well...

679
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:15,354
You know, there's not much to tell.
I was born in Indiana...

680
00:49:16,642 --> 00:49:20,122
...and moved out to California
when I was about 5...

681
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:22,530
...till I was 9...

682
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,407
...when my mother died.

683
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:27,670
And then...

684
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:33,723
...I was sent back to Indiana to live
with my aunt and uncle on a farm.

685
00:49:34,468 --> 00:49:36,061
What was it like living on a farm?

686
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:42,815
I wasn't much of a farmer.

687
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:47,833
I rode my motorcycle.

688
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:50,840
I used to...

689
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:54,140
...chase the cows.

690
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:58,206
They'd run and their udders
would swing from side to side.

691
00:49:58,883 --> 00:49:59,995
How about your father?

692
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:05,664
Well, we don't...

693
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:08,540
We don't really talk much.

694
00:50:10,948 --> 00:50:12,955
We don't like each other.

695
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,137
In fact, we hate each other.

696
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:24,221
See, I'm an actor because...

697
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:26,327
...it's how I express myself.

698
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:29,345
I'm not very good with talking.

699
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,742
I think you can tell.

700
00:50:34,787 --> 00:50:36,511
When do you open in the Gide play?

701
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:38,779
Next Thursday.

702
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:41,760
Mr. Steinbeck and I
will be coming on-

703
00:50:42,241 --> 00:50:44,543
If you're coming, don't tell me when.

704
00:50:45,217 --> 00:50:46,494
It's better if I don't know.

705
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,204
You think you can handle Cal?

706
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,883
Yes, I do, sir.

707
00:50:54,242 --> 00:50:55,257
Good.

708
00:50:56,577 --> 00:50:59,295
We'll contact your agent.
Jane Deacy, right?

709
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:00,951
Right. Yeah.

710
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:03,926
Is that it?

711
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,660
That's it.

712
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:11,419
Thanks.

713
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:20,153
That's the kid I want
to go with for Cal.

714
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:24,604
What do you think?

715
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:28,601
Mr. Kazan, that young man is Cal.

716
00:51:29,442 --> 00:51:32,060
Five minutes, Miss Page.
Five minutes, Mr. Jourdan.

717
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:34,844
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know, Mr. Rose.

718
00:51:35,043 --> 00:51:36,797
Geri. Geri.

719
00:51:37,122 --> 00:51:39,129
Oh, my heart. Oh, my God.

720
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,184
- Can't catch my breath.
- You're the greatest actress.

721
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:43,166
Go enjoy yourself.

722
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:46,111
Louis! How are you?
Look how handsome you are.

723
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:48,162
- Merde!
- Merde!

724
00:51:48,962 --> 00:51:51,515
Look, five minutes. Five minutes!

725
00:51:51,714 --> 00:51:53,721
I want that understudy dressed.
We're going up in 10.

726
00:51:53,921 --> 00:51:56,255
It's already done.
We looked everywhere!

727
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:58,839
Get this kid on a leash.
Put him on a leash!

728
00:51:59,042 --> 00:52:00,732
How is this happening?

729
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:13,271
Are you crazy? You're on
in three minutes! Get dressed!

730
00:52:24,066 --> 00:52:24,927
Good job, Jimmy!

731
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:28,438
Jimmy! Come over here.
I'm so proud of you.

732
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:31,322
So proud of you.
You're gonna be a star!

733
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:33,114
I'll be right back.

734
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:39,164
You were better than I ever imagined.

735
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:40,824
- Thanks, beautiful.
- Ever!

736
00:52:41,026 --> 00:52:44,190
Louis, you're improving.
You raised both hands upstage.

737
00:52:44,386 --> 00:52:46,940
IKid, kid. You stole the show!

738
00:52:47,203 --> 00:52:50,431
We can run a year on your reviews.
Congratulations!

739
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,178
Congratulations. What's this?

740
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,320
My two-week notice. I'm quitting.

741
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:58,904
- Oh, very funny. Very funny!
- I'm not joking.

742
00:52:59,106 --> 00:53:02,073
I've got a movie.
I'm going to California in two weeks.

743
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,382
You're not kidding?

744
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:05,690
No.

745
00:53:10,946 --> 00:53:12,701
Good luck to you, kid.

746
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:20,184
Why'd I do it like that, Marty?

747
00:53:20,386 --> 00:53:24,761
He was nice to me. Why must I
make people reject me? Why?

748
00:53:24,962 --> 00:53:27,995
You're an ambitious,
selfish son of a bitch.

749
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:51,136
Mr. Kazan.

750
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:55,388
Can we make a stop near here?
There's somebody I want you to meet.

751
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:57,048
An actor?

752
00:53:58,082 --> 00:54:00,318
No, sir, it's my father.

753
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:06,200
I'd love to, but another time.
We really have to keep moving.

754
00:54:06,465 --> 00:54:07,839
Please, sir?

755
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:09,976
It's important.

756
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:13,371
- Driver.
- We can go?

757
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:14,618
Sure.

758
00:54:15,362 --> 00:54:16,922
Take a right, the next right.

759
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,374
Father.

760
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:23,864
Hello.

761
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:30,557
This is Mr. Elia Kazan.
He's directing the film that I'm doing.

762
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:33,400
- Happy to meet you, sir.
- Same here.

763
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:38,009
And you two will have to tell me when
this moving picture of yours comes out...

764
00:54:38,497 --> 00:54:39,991
...so Ethel and I can go see it.

765
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,686
Yeah, you'll be
the first person I tell.

766
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:44,506
Well, that's good.

767
00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:48,054
I'm sorry, but I can't invite you in.

768
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:51,159
Ethel and I are expecting guests.

769
00:54:52,962 --> 00:54:57,402
Thank you, sir, for taking Jim
into your moving picture.

770
00:54:59,457 --> 00:55:01,945
- Nice to see you, Father.
- Thanks for the time, Mr. Dean.

771
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:03,422
Yes, sir.

772
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:11,996
Winnie.

773
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:13,593
Winnie.

774
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,152
That must have hurt.

775
00:55:18,178 --> 00:55:19,606
We'll use it.

776
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,682
All your boy has to do is sign it.

777
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:31,736
Jane Deacy hooked me up
with Dick Clayton...

778
00:55:31,938 --> 00:55:34,326
...an agent to look
after me in Hollywood.

779
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,906
Here we go.
We're all signed, Mr. Warner.

780
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:43,195
Before we start shooting Eden,
I think I'm gonna send your boy off...

781
00:55:43,393 --> 00:55:46,044
...to Palm Springs
for a couple of weeks.

782
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,859
Have you lying out in the sun,
get a tan.

783
00:55:49,954 --> 00:55:51,896
Maybe we should
fatten him up a bit too.

784
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:54,208
You're too skinny. Way too skinny.

785
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:56,224
You look like a refugee.

786
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:59,164
You're never gonna get rich
unless you look rich.

787
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:00,409
Jack.

788
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:04,156
IKid's been seen around town
riding a motorcycle.

789
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,387
How much am I getting paid for this?

790
00:56:07,586 --> 00:56:10,367
Thousand a week,
10 weeks guaranteed.

791
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:14,362
This true?

792
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,250
You ride a motorcycle?

793
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:19,968
Oh, yeah. I...

794
00:56:20,225 --> 00:56:22,363
I just bought a Triumph 110.

795
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,431
You know, like they used
in The Wild Ones?

796
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:26,714
Get rid of it.

797
00:56:26,914 --> 00:56:29,761
The studio backs stars, not corpses.

798
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:31,872
You understand me, don't you?

799
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,287
Say yes.

800
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:39,355
Yeah.

801
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:41,047
Attaboy.

802
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:42,263
Thank you, Dick.

803
00:56:42,497 --> 00:56:45,792
What's wonderful about Massey
is that he's easy to get off guard.

804
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,320
He's so stiff and he's so wooden that...

805
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:52,343
...those quick moments are
the moments that I'm gonna use.

806
00:56:52,545 --> 00:56:53,919
Those are the wonderful moments.

807
00:56:54,113 --> 00:56:57,113
What I want you to do when
we're dealing with the Bible scene...

808
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:01,503
...just on his close-ups, is to swear
like never before...

809
00:57:01,697 --> 00:57:03,836
...because he hates that stuff.

810
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:07,295
He hates it. He's so wooden,
but it works for us. It's wonderful.

811
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:09,561
Who's that?

812
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:12,311
That's Caesar and that's Brutus.

813
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,626
No.

814
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:15,648
The girl.

815
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:20,283
It's Pier Angeli. She's working
opposite Newman in Silver Chalice.

816
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,125
Do me a favor.

817
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:27,354
Bring the guy in the skirt over here.

818
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:30,139
Come on, he looks more like your type.

819
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:34,395
Can I have a word with you?

820
00:57:36,961 --> 00:57:39,262
- Hello. What is your name?
- Stephan.

821
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,888
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

822
00:57:42,082 --> 00:57:45,179
Oh, my God, I have to ask.
Where did you find that dress?

823
00:57:45,377 --> 00:57:48,989
I've been looking everywhere
for something like this.

824
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:52,702
You may try it on
if you want.

825
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:56,985
I hear he's up against Paul Newman
for the big fight movie MGM's doing.

826
00:57:57,184 --> 00:57:59,640
Well, I'm sure he'd trade in
the movie for the girl.

827
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:02,230
- What girl?
- That girl.

828
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,035
He's gonna have a problem there.

829
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,575
What do you mean?

830
00:58:18,658 --> 00:58:20,032
And who is this?

831
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:24,481
Mama, this is James Dean.
He's an actor.

832
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:28,378
This is my mother, Mrs. Pierangeli.

833
00:58:29,633 --> 00:58:32,894
So, what do you want
with my daughter?

834
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:37,081
Nothing.

835
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,834
Good. You won't be disappointed.

836
00:59:08,896 --> 00:59:09,911
Hands up.

837
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:12,415
Go, go, go, go!

838
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,067
Her real name was
Anna Maria Pierangeli.

839
00:59:27,617 --> 00:59:30,813
I loved her like
I'd never loved anyone.

840
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:34,010
She was my reason for being alive.

841
00:59:34,336 --> 00:59:36,704
I used to wish that if she died...

842
00:59:36,897 --> 00:59:39,679
...that I would die
in the very same moment.

843
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:44,636
I borrowed a beach house in Malibu
where we could be totally alone.

844
00:59:57,056 --> 00:59:58,910
Higher, higher, higher, higher.

845
01:00:05,217 --> 01:00:06,678
One, two, three.

846
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:17,015
Come on in here, kid.

847
01:00:23,296 --> 01:00:27,388
I got an actress' mother telling me
that you're molesting her daughter.

848
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:30,968
It's lucky I've been watching your
dailies or you'd be out on your ass.

849
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:35,381
It's walnut.
You scratch that, it costs me $2000.

850
01:00:38,465 --> 01:00:39,872
That's more polite.

851
01:00:40,064 --> 01:00:41,177
You got anything else?

852
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:44,212
Yes, there's plenty else, wise guy.

853
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,303
If you're thinking
of marrying her, forget it.

854
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:50,075
You think 14- and 15-year-old girls
want their heartthrob married?

855
01:00:50,273 --> 01:00:52,640
On the other hand,
you want to marry Miss Ravioli?

856
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:54,906
Go ahead.
Find yourself another studio.

857
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:58,078
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

858
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:00,640
You got two weeks left on Eden.

859
01:01:00,832 --> 01:01:03,898
I know Nick Ray's been talking to you
about Rebel Without a Cause.

860
01:01:04,097 --> 01:01:07,292
And he wants you for it.
But you know what I told him?

861
01:01:07,487 --> 01:01:09,757
I told him I gotta think about it.

862
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,638
Is there anything else?

863
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,850
Don't play it smart with me, Jimmy.
I'm tougher than you.

864
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:21,627
A lot tougher.

865
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:24,380
Now get out of my car, please.

866
01:01:29,377 --> 01:01:30,457
Drive on.

867
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:34,526
Put your chin right there. That's good.

868
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,109
You know, because she's Catholic.

869
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:39,549
So she's not going to break us up
once we're married.

870
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,257
Jimmy, we just need to be married.

871
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,113
Put the cig in your mouth.

872
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,487
Eyes here.

873
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,430
- Can you understand me?
- Yes.

874
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:52,184
Yes?

875
01:01:52,577 --> 01:01:53,525
You do?

876
01:01:53,728 --> 01:01:55,320
Get over here.
I understand you.

877
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,294
We've gone over it cinquanta times.

878
01:01:59,551 --> 01:02:00,959
Go over there. Get right.

879
01:02:01,152 --> 01:02:03,257
Why do we have to wait?

880
01:02:03,456 --> 01:02:05,148
Oh, that's perfect.

881
01:02:05,441 --> 01:02:07,228
That's perfect.

882
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:08,634
Why do we have to wait?

883
01:02:09,056 --> 01:02:11,357
I'm making a movie right now.

884
01:02:11,552 --> 01:02:15,099
Oh, God, you look great.
You look like...

885
01:02:15,296 --> 01:02:17,271
You look like the Madonna.

886
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:20,726
We can elope.

887
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,613
We can elope.

888
01:02:22,816 --> 01:02:23,831
Yes!

889
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,237
Sure, that's crazy.

890
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:28,986
Hey, hey, look at me. All right.

891
01:02:29,185 --> 01:02:30,613
Come here. Look, look, look.

892
01:02:32,512 --> 01:02:35,326
Just let me finish making this movie...

893
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,430
...and then we'll get married.

894
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:39,515
- Yes.
- I promise.

895
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:43,067
Well, maybe my mother's right.

896
01:02:44,672 --> 01:02:47,901
Maybe you're just using me
to get into the papers.

897
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:49,501
How can you think that?

898
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:51,737
That's what my mother thinks.

899
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:53,398
That's your mother, not you.

900
01:02:53,952 --> 01:02:58,173
Okay? Can we just have
one night here, alone...

901
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:00,638
...without your mother in bed with us?

902
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,149
She wants me to marry Vic Damone.

903
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:10,484
She what?

904
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,265
She wants me to marry Vic Damone.
You know, he's Catholic.

905
01:03:14,464 --> 01:03:15,446
She likes him a lot.

906
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:17,567
So is the Pope.
Why don't you marry him?

907
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,069
I can't fight her!

908
01:03:19,264 --> 01:03:21,052
Why not? Don't you have
a will of your own?

909
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:23,893
- It's not about will!
- What is it?

910
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:27,228
It's a matter of family
and being Catholic!

911
01:03:27,425 --> 01:03:28,407
- Listen.
- What?

912
01:03:29,024 --> 01:03:31,740
You tell Vic Damone
and your crazy mother...

913
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:33,910
...to stay out of our lives,
all right?

914
01:03:34,112 --> 01:03:35,704
- You don't understand!
- I understand!

915
01:03:35,903 --> 01:03:38,556
- You're not listening!
- Stop yelling at me!

916
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,732
Open it.

917
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,830
I love Aron, I do.

918
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:10,911
Really, I do.

919
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,273
I do, I do.

920
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:19,581
Cut.

921
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:25,691
Jimmy, wonderful.
It was just wonderful.

922
01:04:26,432 --> 01:04:28,952
- Julie, you're beautiful. Beautiful.
- Thank you.

923
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:34,559
Ladies and gentlemen, that's a print,
a wrap, and we are finished!

924
01:04:40,064 --> 01:04:43,194
Have you seen Jimmy?
He's not in his trailer.

925
01:04:47,743 --> 01:04:48,692
Jimmy?

926
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:52,312
Come on up.

927
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:15,033
You okay?

928
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:22,644
It's over.

929
01:05:24,543 --> 01:05:28,090
I know, Jimmy.
It's so sad.

930
01:05:31,584 --> 01:05:34,650
You know, this is like my family.

931
01:05:38,176 --> 01:05:40,565
I can't just let that go.

932
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,613
Always knew I would get
an actor like you for Rebel.

933
01:06:00,479 --> 01:06:01,855
I think...

934
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,973
...divine fate calls the shots
for a director like me.

935
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:08,031
You know what I mean? Brando.

936
01:06:08,223 --> 01:06:11,835
What, are they kidding?
Brando is too old, man.

937
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:15,862
You are fresh.
You are perfect for this part. Perfect!

938
01:06:17,183 --> 01:06:18,460
We just gotta...

939
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:20,346
We gotta find somebody...

940
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,293
...somebody great for the girl.

941
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:28,475
What about Natalie Wood?

942
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:31,420
No, really, what do you think of her?

943
01:06:31,615 --> 01:06:34,103
I want to know.
I really want to know.

944
01:06:34,303 --> 01:06:37,271
Because, Jimmy, it's just you and I.

945
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:39,861
We are on this quest together, baby.

946
01:06:40,064 --> 01:06:43,226
All the way down the line.
What do you think?

947
01:06:43,486 --> 01:06:45,691
She's a child star, man.

948
01:06:45,888 --> 01:06:47,262
Child star, huh?

949
01:06:47,456 --> 01:06:50,522
Jimmy, this girl is 17 years old...

950
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,680
...and she is built like the Pieta.

951
01:06:55,007 --> 01:06:56,381
I know. She doesn't look it, right?

952
01:06:56,575 --> 01:07:00,219
But I'm telling you that
underneath those simple childish...

953
01:07:00,414 --> 01:07:04,692
...cotton frocks, she is built
like a marble masterpiece.

954
01:07:06,912 --> 01:07:07,860
Jimmy.

955
01:07:08,063 --> 01:07:09,918
- Jimmy, listen to me.
- What?

956
01:07:10,112 --> 01:07:11,356
You're young.

957
01:07:11,551 --> 01:07:13,145
You're wonderful and you're young...

958
01:07:13,344 --> 01:07:16,507
...but if you'd been there
for the start of Helen Hayes' career...

959
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:18,677
...you would know
what I see in this girl.

960
01:07:18,879 --> 01:07:21,661
Genius. Pure genius.

961
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,306
That's what I see in you, Jimmy.
Genius!

962
01:07:27,393 --> 01:07:30,588
Man, Rebel Without a Cause...

963
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:34,394
...is gonna be the first
visionary movie ever made...

964
01:07:34,591 --> 01:07:36,347
...about teenagers.

965
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:39,990
You mark my word. Mark my word!

966
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:43,773
- You like jazz?
- Yeah, I like jazz.

967
01:07:44,479 --> 01:07:46,268
Chet Baker mean anything to you?

968
01:07:46,527 --> 01:07:47,476
Yeah.

969
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:51,065
He's playing down on the beach
tonight. You want to go?

970
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,631
Yeah, I'd love to.

971
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,651
Solid, baby.

972
01:07:54,847 --> 01:07:55,992
Solid.

973
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:58,485
Pier!

974
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:01,531
Pier, listen, I have to go to New York.

975
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:05,247
I have to go to New York,
all right? Come here, look.

976
01:08:05,439 --> 01:08:06,387
What?

977
01:08:06,591 --> 01:08:09,493
Look, come to New York
with me, all right?

978
01:08:09,695 --> 01:08:12,313
I can't go to New York!
I can't leave my mother.

979
01:08:12,511 --> 01:08:13,625
Why?

980
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:15,253
You wouldn't understand.

981
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:17,112
- Look.
- What?

982
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,578
It'll be two weeks, okay?
Two weeks.

983
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:21,182
I have to be back to do Rebel.

984
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,448
I may not be here
when you come back.

985
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,719
- What?
- You heard me.

986
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,806
I may not be here when you come back.

987
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:29,308
What is that supposed to mean?

988
01:08:29,503 --> 01:08:32,023
I don't want to stay here anymore!
I want to go!

989
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,096
James, I'm gone!

990
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:36,859
Fine, go!

991
01:08:37,056 --> 01:08:38,431
I'm leaving! I'm gone!

992
01:08:38,688 --> 01:08:40,345
Hey, Pier!

993
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:44,159
You're breaking my heart

994
01:08:44,351 --> 01:08:46,838
Cause you're leaving

995
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:17,373
Hi, is my father here?
I want to talk to him.

996
01:09:17,599 --> 01:09:19,060
He's away for a while.

997
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:22,558
Is there something that
I can help you with, James?

998
01:09:22,751 --> 01:09:25,337
No, no. I need to talk to him.

999
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:28,478
I'll tell him that.

1000
01:09:29,534 --> 01:09:31,193
Are you all right, James?

1001
01:09:34,623 --> 01:09:35,605
Yeah.

1002
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:39,833
We follow you in the newspapers.

1003
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:43,194
Your father's very proud
of your success.

1004
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:45,751
He is?

1005
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:48,605
Of course he is, James.

1006
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:53,815
Thanks.

1007
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,232
Nice to see you, James.

1008
01:10:00,799 --> 01:10:03,067
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

1009
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:20,630
Can't you even talk
to the boy, Winnie?

1010
01:10:20,831 --> 01:10:22,238
I can't.

1011
01:10:35,455 --> 01:10:37,560
Her mother wants her
to marry Vic Damone.

1012
01:10:37,856 --> 01:10:40,572
Why?
Can't she just buy one of his records?

1013
01:10:41,055 --> 01:10:44,699
- She's driving me bananas, Marty.
- For you, bananas is not a long drive.

1014
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:47,191
Jimmy.

1015
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:50,620
You guys are meant for each other.
It's perfect casting.

1016
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:55,093
Pick up the phone, tell her
you love her, tell her you're sorry.

1017
01:10:55,295 --> 01:10:56,757
Tell her anything.

1018
01:10:56,959 --> 01:10:58,868
Go, call her. You got the nickels.

1019
01:11:01,982 --> 01:11:03,542
Pronto. Hello.

1020
01:11:04,638 --> 01:11:05,686
Is Pier there?

1021
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:07,219
Who is this?

1022
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,365
It's James Dean.

1023
01:11:11,455 --> 01:11:13,310
She does not want to talk.

1024
01:11:14,143 --> 01:11:15,866
Just put her on the phone, please!

1025
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:20,318
No, no, no. She's out there
choosing the flowers for her wedding.

1026
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,971
Goodbye.

1027
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:52,605
I don't know where he is.

1028
01:11:52,799 --> 01:11:56,181
He'll show, Jack. It's a benefit
for the studio. He'll show.

1029
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:58,041
I'll tell you something.

1030
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:00,180
He doesn't show,
I'm gonna ruin the bastard.

1031
01:12:00,383 --> 01:12:01,976
Even if I have to pull
the plug on Rebel.

1032
01:12:02,174 --> 01:12:04,541
- Jack, you look great!
- Nice to see you.

1033
01:12:05,055 --> 01:12:07,902
We should get going, guys.
We'll be late.

1034
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:09,753
All right, let me do it.

1035
01:12:16,382 --> 01:12:17,364
God!

1036
01:12:19,262 --> 01:12:21,564
- We're not going.
- What do you mean?

1037
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:25,141
I'm not even interested
in this glitzy glamour crap, all right?

1038
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:28,442
They want to wear monkey suits, fine!
Not me.

1039
01:12:28,638 --> 01:12:31,638
Jimmy, I spent $174 on this dress.
Come on.

1040
01:12:31,839 --> 01:12:32,951
This is my first tuxedo.

1041
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:36,184
Jerry, why don't you give
a round to everybody on me?

1042
01:12:36,414 --> 01:12:37,875
We're spending the night.

1043
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:43,292
Maybe he's laying dead somewhere.

1044
01:12:43,486 --> 01:12:45,275
That's no excuse.

1045
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:57,500
Jack, congratulations. Fantastic.

1046
01:13:14,142 --> 01:13:17,176
What did I tell you, Hedda?
What did I tell you?

1047
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:19,831
Oh, God.

1048
01:13:20,318 --> 01:13:23,515
It's an Academy Award performance.

1049
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:28,499
He is a great actor. God!

1050
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,960
I'm going to write that, Jack.

1051
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,507
I'm so pleased, Hedda.
I'm so truly pleased.

1052
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:39,606
Now, is he really as difficult...

1053
01:13:39,807 --> 01:13:41,595
...as everyone says he is?

1054
01:13:41,823 --> 01:13:44,790
- Difficult? Jimmy?
- Yes, everyone says it.

1055
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,776
Hedda, he's like a son to me.

1056
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,076
Oh, come on, Jack.

1057
01:13:49,277 --> 01:13:50,620
Come on.

1058
01:13:51,262 --> 01:13:53,269
He is a teensy bit difficult.

1059
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,706
But you mustn't write that.

1060
01:13:55,902 --> 01:13:57,812
You have to promise me
that you will not write that.

1061
01:13:58,014 --> 01:13:59,258
Please.

1062
01:14:00,255 --> 01:14:01,431
All right.

1063
01:14:01,983 --> 01:14:03,509
You'll owe me one.

1064
01:14:05,342 --> 01:14:06,836
Nothing for nothing, huh?

1065
01:14:07,038 --> 01:14:08,216
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.

1066
01:14:08,415 --> 01:14:10,749
- Great. You know what I'm gonna write?
- What?

1067
01:14:10,942 --> 01:14:15,198
I'm going to write
that he is America's...

1068
01:14:17,214 --> 01:14:18,458
...new...

1069
01:14:18,878 --> 01:14:21,267
...free spirit.

1070
01:14:22,078 --> 01:14:24,630
Hedda, Hedda, listen.

1071
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:28,889
Write he's America's newest rebel.

1072
01:14:30,014 --> 01:14:31,574
- Rebel?
- Yes, he's a rebel.

1073
01:14:32,254 --> 01:14:33,661
Like us.

1074
01:14:34,302 --> 01:14:37,171
I don't care about reviews
or about grosses.

1075
01:14:38,046 --> 01:14:40,151
There's gonna be no more crap
like you pulled on me in New York.

1076
01:14:42,015 --> 01:14:43,029
Shut up!

1077
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:47,604
Bernie Plotkin gave me this.

1078
01:14:47,965 --> 01:14:49,045
"Question:

1079
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:52,372
Are you a homosexual, Mr. Dean?

1080
01:14:52,574 --> 01:14:55,161
Answer: No, I'm not a homosexual...

1081
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:57,976
...but I won't go through life
with one hand tied behind my back. "

1082
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,312
Did you say that?
You said that to a fan magazine?

1083
01:15:01,566 --> 01:15:02,515
It's true.

1084
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:05,779
"It's true. " What are you,
a crazy person?

1085
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:08,987
You think homosexuals
sell tickets to teenagers?

1086
01:15:09,182 --> 01:15:11,864
I don't want you saying
any more crazy things to magazines.

1087
01:15:12,477 --> 01:15:15,261
You say,
because I'm making you a star...

1088
01:15:15,455 --> 01:15:18,389
...you say, "Thank you, Mr. Warner.
Thank you. "

1089
01:15:18,591 --> 01:15:21,209
You sided with Pier's mother against me.

1090
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:25,179
You should kiss my ass for that.
You'd be miserable with Pier Angeli.

1091
01:15:25,373 --> 01:15:28,821
Her mother would cut your balls off
and plant them on Mussolini's grave.

1092
01:15:29,054 --> 01:15:31,608
Let me tell you something.
Pier Angeli's gone.

1093
01:15:31,935 --> 01:15:33,211
She is really gone.

1094
01:15:33,535 --> 01:15:35,672
She's married. Forget her!

1095
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:40,307
You got such a wonderful talent...

1096
01:15:42,398 --> 01:15:45,048
...and a wonderful career
ahead of you.

1097
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,832
You should learn to trust me.

1098
01:15:49,788 --> 01:15:51,067
You're like a son to me.

1099
01:15:53,278 --> 01:15:54,325
What's funny?

1100
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,204
You just gotta trust me too.

1101
01:15:57,566 --> 01:15:59,321
Of course I trust you.

1102
01:15:59,549 --> 01:16:01,371
Oh, you gonna light my cigar?

1103
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,780
Smells good, huh?
You want to try it?

1104
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:37,877
All right, everybody, he's coming.
Roll sound!

1105
01:16:38,077 --> 01:16:39,801
76, take one.

1106
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:46,008
Shh! We're rolling!

1107
01:16:49,853 --> 01:16:50,802
All right, Jimmy.

1108
01:16:56,286 --> 01:16:59,863
Stop! You're killing him!
You want to kill your own father?

1109
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:03,928
And cut!

1110
01:17:07,646 --> 01:17:08,540
Jimmy.

1111
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,676
Jimmy, it's over. It's over, Jimmy!

1112
01:17:17,085 --> 01:17:18,460
How you doing, son?

1113
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:23,226
It's got 200 horsepower...

1114
01:17:23,325 --> 01:17:25,431
...1300cc engine.

1115
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:28,605
Right here, dual Solex carbs.

1116
01:17:28,798 --> 01:17:32,759
Whole body's made of aluminum
so it weighs about 1100 pounds.

1117
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:35,671
- Watch it, man.
- Oh, sorry.

1118
01:17:37,629 --> 01:17:40,663
You know that
car racing is for idiots.

1119
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:45,051
Well, you're working for me.

1120
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:47,667
And I say no racing cars.

1121
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:50,777
You find that funny, huh?

1122
01:17:50,974 --> 01:17:52,861
We're signing a deal that
will pay you a million dollars.

1123
01:17:53,054 --> 01:17:56,829
And for a million dollars,
I'm telling you, no more racing cars.

1124
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:00,596
- While I'm shooting.
- I beg your pardon?

1125
01:18:01,629 --> 01:18:04,500
When I'm not shooting,
I'm on my own, Jack.

1126
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,403
If you don't like that,
you can take your million bucks-

1127
01:18:08,606 --> 01:18:10,100
You're gonna say something
you're gonna regret.

1128
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:12,177
Smile, Jack.

1129
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:13,974
Why?

1130
01:18:19,582 --> 01:18:20,957
Get rid of it.

1131
01:18:22,685 --> 01:18:25,402
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention please?

1132
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:26,546
Please gather round.

1133
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,343
Everybody, come on in.

1134
01:18:28,702 --> 01:18:32,215
We're here today to celebrate
a great new Warner's movie star...

1135
01:18:32,414 --> 01:18:33,396
...James Dean.

1136
01:18:33,758 --> 01:18:35,349
Jimmy, come on up.

1137
01:18:39,454 --> 01:18:41,429
James Dean, who drives me crazy...

1138
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:44,663
...and a million-dollar contract
which proves me crazy.

1139
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:48,247
When the cork pops, the deal is done.

1140
01:18:49,085 --> 01:18:52,348
All right, but no deal
unless I get the cork out.

1141
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:55,127
Right. Watch out,
everybody, you know he's crazy.

1142
01:19:03,134 --> 01:19:04,661
Oh, you're crazy.

1143
01:19:04,894 --> 01:19:05,843
You are nuts.

1144
01:19:06,046 --> 01:19:07,901
Oh, you sweetheart.

1145
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:09,846
I love you and I hate you.

1146
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:12,823
I hate you and I hate you.

1147
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:21,747
When I started shooting Giant...

1148
01:19:22,269 --> 01:19:25,814
...nothing went right between
the director, George Stevens, and me.

1149
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:28,563
Maybe it was because I missed Pier.

1150
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:32,442
Or maybe it was because
Stevens reminded me of my father.

1151
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:39,991
Where the hell is he?

1152
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,077
I'm sorry, Mr. Stevens,
but he won't come to the set.

1153
01:19:42,206 --> 01:19:44,028
He said you kept him
waiting too long between takes.

1154
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:47,058
- What?
- He says he's done for the day.

1155
01:19:49,532 --> 01:19:50,907
Come on, we'll take care of it.

1156
01:19:58,589 --> 01:20:00,825
Jim, we're ready to shoot.

1157
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:03,868
Not me.

1158
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:05,171
Not today.

1159
01:20:05,374 --> 01:20:07,228
Come on, son, let's go.

1160
01:20:07,485 --> 01:20:11,062
The well's rigged, we're losing the light.
Let's get out on the set.

1161
01:20:14,045 --> 01:20:16,763
You keep me waiting hours
preparing for a scene...

1162
01:20:16,957 --> 01:20:18,713
...you never get around to shooting.

1163
01:20:19,678 --> 01:20:20,955
I ain't working today.

1164
01:20:21,629 --> 01:20:25,458
And you do it again, I'm gonna
take two days. And then three.

1165
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:32,019
All right. Put Dean's clothes on
his stand-in. We'll shoot it without him.

1166
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:35,761
Come on!

1167
01:20:35,965 --> 01:20:37,208
Come on!

1168
01:20:37,693 --> 01:20:41,370
You can push that mug Rock Hudson
around, but not me!

1169
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:44,629
You don't know what acting is,
you stupid son of a bitch!

1170
01:20:44,829 --> 01:20:46,105
Come on, old man!

1171
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:49,050
I guess that's a wrap for today.

1172
01:21:24,476 --> 01:21:26,418
Is that you?

1173
01:21:26,813 --> 01:21:28,854
- I need to talk to you.
- Ethel's waiting for me.

1174
01:21:29,214 --> 01:21:30,359
Why don't you let her wait?

1175
01:21:30,558 --> 01:21:33,426
Hold on, young man.
Don't take that attitude with me.

1176
01:21:33,629 --> 01:21:36,149
- I need to talk to you!
- I don't have to talk to you-

1177
01:21:36,348 --> 01:21:38,039
Everybody thinks I'm great except you!

1178
01:21:38,237 --> 01:21:39,863
- Fine, listen to them.
- Don't you read the papers?

1179
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,956
I'm in the papers! Everybody wants
to meet me except you. Why?

1180
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:45,912
- every stupid mistake
you've ever made.

1181
01:21:46,108 --> 01:21:47,964
Shut up! Listen to me!

1182
01:21:48,156 --> 01:21:50,545
Why don't you talk to me?
You're my father!

1183
01:21:50,749 --> 01:21:52,724
- Please!
- I deserve some damn respect.

1184
01:21:52,925 --> 01:21:54,835
Dad, I was 9 years old!

1185
01:21:55,197 --> 01:21:58,677
9 years old! Now open
your mouth and talk to me!

1186
01:21:59,036 --> 01:22:03,096
You talk to me! Dad, please. Please!

1187
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,787
- Hey, Winton.
- Talk to me, please!

1188
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:06,648
What's going on here?

1189
01:22:06,846 --> 01:22:08,667
This is my father.
Now get in your house!

1190
01:22:08,861 --> 01:22:11,479
- Is this your son?
- Yeah, this is my boy.

1191
01:22:13,469 --> 01:22:17,431
- You two all right?
- We'll be fine. We'll be fine.

1192
01:22:17,629 --> 01:22:20,443
Winton, you shouldn't be fighting
with him out here in public.

1193
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:22,360
I understand.

1194
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:28,349
Now, where do you want to go?
We gotta go somewhere else.

1195
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:30,906
- Okay?
- All right.

1196
01:22:36,509 --> 01:22:38,265
Beautiful view.

1197
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:45,906
This is where my house is gonna be.

1198
01:22:46,493 --> 01:22:49,078
And I own that land over there too.

1199
01:22:49,277 --> 01:22:50,706
Nice car.

1200
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:55,670
Yeah, it's aluminum.
They only made 30.

1201
01:22:55,868 --> 01:22:57,810
That must have cost a lot.

1202
01:22:58,684 --> 01:23:00,440
I got a lot.

1203
01:23:00,924 --> 01:23:05,148
Yeah, this town is yours, isn't it?

1204
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:08,058
I'm doing pretty good.

1205
01:23:10,205 --> 01:23:12,310
You like L.A., Father?

1206
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,381
Do I like L.A.?

1207
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:21,146
Well, I'll tell you something,
young man.

1208
01:23:21,532 --> 01:23:24,053
If I could find the edge
of this town...

1209
01:23:24,253 --> 01:23:25,780
...I'd leave it.

1210
01:23:26,365 --> 01:23:29,399
But you're the edge of this town now.

1211
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,889
And you are everywhere.

1212
01:23:36,156 --> 01:23:38,327
Why'd you do it, Father? Why-

1213
01:23:39,357 --> 01:23:41,976
Why'd you send me away?

1214
01:23:42,174 --> 01:23:44,726
Why didn't you come
to Mother's funeral?

1215
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:49,594
- Just talk to me.
- But I don't have to talk to you.

1216
01:23:49,788 --> 01:23:50,803
You're my father.

1217
01:23:51,165 --> 01:23:53,587
No, I'm not. I'm not your father.

1218
01:23:53,789 --> 01:23:56,471
And your mother told me that.

1219
01:23:59,165 --> 01:24:02,874
Your mother, my wife,
told me that I'm not-

1220
01:24:04,893 --> 01:24:07,859
Well, I might not be your dad.

1221
01:24:09,788 --> 01:24:13,203
Told me just before she died.

1222
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:17,266
She wanted to set
things straight, I guess.

1223
01:24:18,014 --> 01:24:21,941
When she was 18,
she started seeing this other guy.

1224
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:26,074
He was married with kids...

1225
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,614
...and she just couldn't
break it off, I guess.

1226
01:24:31,932 --> 01:24:34,582
A couple of weeks
after we were married...

1227
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,115
...she found out that
she was pregnant with you.

1228
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:42,450
And not knowing, I was
the happiest man alive...

1229
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:44,951
...for about nine years.

1230
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,831
But then, she just had
to tell me the truth.

1231
01:24:53,053 --> 01:24:56,697
And I just couldn't live with that.

1232
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,835
Yeah, you know,
your mother was brave.

1233
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,773
Telling me the truth like she did.

1234
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:13,172
And I was...

1235
01:25:15,005 --> 01:25:16,893
...too prideful.

1236
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:22,646
I couldn't find the damn courage...

1237
01:25:22,844 --> 01:25:25,015
...to forgive her.

1238
01:25:26,075 --> 01:25:28,946
And so I got cheated
out of my wife...

1239
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:32,758
...and I cheated myself...

1240
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:36,249
...out of having you as my son.

1241
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:39,610
And I'm proud of you, Jim.

1242
01:25:43,612 --> 01:25:47,735
And I'm sorry that I acted so bad
to you all these years.

1243
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:21,968
Mr. Stevens?

1244
01:26:23,835 --> 01:26:25,177
Ready to go to work, sir.

1245
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:27,988
Good, son.

1246
01:26:29,437 --> 01:26:30,384
Good.

1247
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,160
Ready? Let's go!

1248
01:26:43,643 --> 01:26:45,334
Let's go for picture, everybody!

1249
01:26:45,692 --> 01:26:48,791
Now, that's picture.
Here we go. Make it happen.

1250
01:26:49,628 --> 01:26:50,708
Effects, ready?

1251
01:26:51,677 --> 01:26:52,659
Ready!

1252
01:26:52,861 --> 01:26:54,289
Sound, ready?

1253
01:26:54,492 --> 01:26:55,354
Ready!

1254
01:26:55,484 --> 01:26:57,589
- Camera, ready?
- Ready!

1255
01:27:01,468 --> 01:27:03,159
Let's roll!

1256
01:27:03,964 --> 01:27:04,793
Speed!

1257
01:27:04,989 --> 01:27:07,258
Scene 253, take one!

1258
01:27:08,252 --> 01:27:09,910
And action!

1259
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:18,516
Blow!

1260
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,027
Looks good.

1261
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,321
Weird thing to name a car, man.

1262
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,978
I don't know.

1263
01:27:53,628 --> 01:27:54,805
Maybe.

1264
01:28:01,467 --> 01:28:03,858
My mechanic, Rolf Wutherich,
and I decided...

1265
01:28:04,061 --> 01:28:06,515
...to drive my car
to a race in Salinas.

1266
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,496
It was a beautiful, clear day.

1267
01:28:10,172 --> 01:28:13,074
The road seemed almost deserted.

1268
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:19,830
You got it.

1269
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:26,777
See that piece on you
in the L.A. Times?

1270
01:28:27,356 --> 01:28:28,470
No, why? I get hammered?

1271
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:33,364
Opposite. They said you're gonna get
bigger than Brando and Clift together.

1272
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:35,124
Can you believe it?

1273
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:46,770
Watch that Ford.

1274
01:28:52,539 --> 01:28:53,488
He's turning left.

1275
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:55,480
He's gotta see us.

1276
01:29:34,331 --> 01:29:36,404
There's been a terrible accident.

1277
01:29:42,268 --> 01:29:45,301
I took the train ride
back to Indiana again.

1278
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,401
This time my father came with me.
