1
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
A legend is sung

2
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,400
Of when England was young

3
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,080
And knights
were brave and bold

4
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,840
The good king had died

5
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,560
And no one could decide

6
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,440
Who was rightful heir
to the throne

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
It seemed that the land

8
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
Would be torn by war

9
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,190
Or saved by a miracle alone

10
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,680
And that miracle appeared

11
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
In London town

12
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,400
The sword

13
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,840
In the stone

14
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,400
And below the hilt
in letters of gold...

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,000
were written these words:

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,160
"Whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone and anvil...

17
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,600
is rightwise king
born of England."

18
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,680
Though many tried for the sword
with all their strength...

19
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,400
none could move the sword
nor stir it.

20
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,920
So the miracle
had not worked.

21
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,000
And England was still
without a king.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,280
And in time, the marvellous sword
was forgotten.

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,800
This was a dark age...

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,880
without law
and without order.

25
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,000
Men lived in fear
of one another...

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,280
for the strong
preyed upon the weak.

27
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,840
A dark age indeed!

28
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Age of inconvenience.

29
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,400
No plumbing...

30
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,720
no electricity...

31
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
no nothing!

32
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, hang it all!

33
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,640
Hang it all!

34
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,200
Oh, now what?
Now what?

35
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Leave, leave off!
Leave off!

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Oh, you, you, you
fiendish chain you!

37
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
Everything complicated.

38
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,560
One big medieval mess.

39
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,280
Now, uh, let me see.

40
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,600
He should be here in,
I'd say half an hour.

41
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,800
Who? Who? I'd like
to know who.

42
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,000
I told you, Archimedes.
I am not sure.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,840
All I know is that someone will
be coming. Someone very important.

44
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,720
Oh, pig feathers!

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
Fate will direct him to me
so that I, in turn...

46
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
may guide him to his rightful
place in the world.

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,760
Huh! And-And you say he will
arrive in half an hour?

48
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,120
Ha! Well, we'll just see.

49
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
And you will, Archimedes.
You will.

50
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,270
Ow!

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,600
He'll be, uh, a boy.

52
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,480
Small boy.

53
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Eleven, 12 years old.

54
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,200
And a scrawny little fellow.

55
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
Oh, no, no.
That can't be the one.

56
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,320
Surely not. Why, that big lad
must be close onto 20.

57
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,040
Ah. There he is.

58
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,920
The scrawny little
fellow about 12.

59
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,680
He's a regular
little grasshopper.

60
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,280
Look at him go.

61
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,160
And where-- where would you
guess he is at this very moment?

62
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,760
I am not guessing,
Archimedes!

63
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,560
I know where he is!

64
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,200
Less than a mile from here
just beyond the forest.

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,000
And right on schedule,
if-if all goes well.

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,200
- Quiet, Wart.
- I'm tryin' to be.

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,440
And nobody asked you to
come along in the first place.

68
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,360
- I'm not even movin'.
- Shut up.

69
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,080
Aha! Here we go.

70
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,280
Oh, what a set-up.

71
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,120
Right smack through
the old gizzard.

72
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
Whoa. What? Oh!

73
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,920
Why, you clumsy,
little fool!

74
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,680
Oh, Kay, please, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it. Please.

75
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,880
If I ever--

76
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,720
If I ever get my hands on,
on you, I'll, I'll ring...

77
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,440
your scrawny little neck,
so help me, I will.

78
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,160
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.

79
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,800
Don't tell me you're
going in there.

80
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,320
Why, it's swarming with wolves.

81
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm not afraid.

82
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,440
Well, go ahead.
It's your skin, not mine.

83
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,600
Go on, go on.

84
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
There it is.
Oh, there it is.

85
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,920
Whoa! What-- Oh!

86
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,080
Well.

87
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,240
So, you, you did drop in
for tea after all.

88
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,320
Oh, you are a bit late,
you know.

89
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,960
- Oh, l, I am?
- Yes.

90
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,800
Now, my name is Merlin.

91
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,120
Come, come,
who are you, my lad?

92
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,600
Oh, my name's Arthur,
but everyone calls me Wart.

93
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,030
Oh.

94
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
Oh, what a perfect
stuffed owl.

95
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,760
Stuff--
I, l, I beg your pardon!

96
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,160
He's alive and he talks.

97
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
And certainly a great deal
better than you do.

98
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
Oh, come, Archimedes.
Come, come now.

99
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
I, I want you
to meet the Wart.

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,960
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.

101
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,000
Boy? Boy?
Well, I see no boy.

102
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
- Oh, I'm sorry that l--
- That's all right.

103
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,960
He's much too sensitive.

104
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,680
Sensitive? Huh?
Who? What? What?

105
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,800
- Oh, well.
- How did you know that I was--

106
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,240
Oh, th-that you would
be dropping in?

107
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,720
Well, I happen to be
a wizard. A soothsayer.

108
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,360
A prognosticator. I have
the power to see into the future.

109
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,400
Centuries into the future!

110
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,440
I, I've even been there, lad.
And I've seen all these things.

111
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,640
They're, they're only plans and
small models, of course, you know.

112
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,280
Now, this for instance
is a steam locomotive.

113
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,200
There she goes.
Pretty good, eh?

114
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,520
Now, that won't be invented
for hundreds of years!

115
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,840
Oh. You mean you can see
everything before it happens?

116
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Yes, everything.

117
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,400
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Everything, Merlin?

118
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,160
Uh-- No, no,
not everything.

119
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,400
I, uh, I admit I didn't know
whom to expect for tea.

120
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
But as you can see...

121
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I've figured the exact place.

122
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,760
You're very clever, sir.

123
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,560
Yes. Well, never mind
the, the, the sir.

124
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,800
Just, uh, plain Merlin will do.

125
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
Now, would, would you
care for sugar?

126
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
Oh, yes I would, please.

127
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,160
All right. Sugar. Sugar?

128
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,200
No, no, manners, manners, manners!
Guests first, you know that!

129
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
All right.
Say when, lad.

130
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,890
When!

131
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,840
- Have you had any schooling?
- Oh, yes!

132
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm training to be a squire. I'm learning
the rules of combat and swordsmanship and...

133
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
and jousting
and horsemanship.

134
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,040
Oh, yes, yes, very good.
That's, that's--

135
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,480
No, no, no, l--
I mean a, a, a real education.

136
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,360
Mathematics. History.
Biology. Natural science.

137
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
English. Latin. French.

138
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,600
No. When! When!
Blast it all! When!

139
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,240
Impudent piece of crockery.

140
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,600
Boy, now, you can't--

141
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,760
You can't grow up without
a decent education, you know.

142
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, I suppose not, sir--
Merlin.

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So, I am going to be
your tutor.

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,320
But I've got to get back to the castle.
They'll want me in the kitchen.

145
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800
Oh, well.
Then very well.

146
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,280
We'll pack and
be on our way.

147
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,040
You-- You watch now.
You'll like this.

148
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,920
Higitus figitus
zumba ka zing.

149
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,240
I want your attention,
everything.

150
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,520
We're packing to leave.
Come on. Let's go.

151
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,520
No, no, not you. Books are
always first, you know.

152
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,920
Hockety pockety wockety whack
Abra abra dabra nack

153
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,760

We've got to save enough room for all

154
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,720
Higitus figitus migitus mum

156
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,560
Hockety pockety wockety--
Whoa!

157
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,000
Now, stop, stop, stop, stop!

158
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,480
See here, sugar bowl. You're getting rough.
That poor old tea set is cracked enough.

159
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,080
Now. Now, all right.
Let's start again.

160
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,680
Ah, let's start-- Eh--
Oh. Where was l, boy?

161
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,720
- Uh, hock-hockety pockety?
- Oh, yes, yes, that's right.

162
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,040
Hockety pockety wockety wack
Odds and ends and bric-a-brac

163
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,000
Be with you in just a minute,
son. Packing's almost done.

164
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,680
You, you, you
bungling blockhead!

165
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,400
Hey, easy there.
No, no, go ahead.

166
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,600
Dum doodly doodly doodly dum
This is the best part now.

167
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,800
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Prestidigitonium

168
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,360
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Prestidigitoni--

169
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,400
- Ha, ha!
- What a way to pack.

170
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,000
Well-- Well, now,
just a minute, boy.

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,320
How else would you get all this stuff
into one suitcase, I'd like to know?

172
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,560
- Oh, but I think it's wonderful!
- Oh.

173
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,720
Yes, it is rather.
Now, well...

174
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,760
don't, don't you get any foolish ideas
that magic will solve all your problems.

175
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,240
- Because it won't!
- But, sir, I don't have any problems.

176
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,680
Oh, bah, everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.

177
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,920
Oh, blast it all!
There, now. You see what I mean?

178
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,800
See, that's the trouble
with the world today.

179
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,080
Everybody butting their heads against a
brick wall. All muscle and no mentality.

180
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,640
Do you want to be
all muscle and no brain?

181
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,400
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't? Well, how do you move about?

182
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,600
Oh, I suppose l,
I do have a little.

183
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,840
Aha. There, you see. Well, that's
enough. Now, develop your brain.

184
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,680
Knowledge, wisdom. There's
the real power. Higher learning.

185
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,600
That's the thing.

186
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,800
So, first thing tomorrow morning,
we'll start a full schedule.

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,920
Eight hours a day. We'll have six hours
for schoolroom and two for study period.

188
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,080
But l-- I don't have the time.
I have page duties.

189
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,200
Uh, page duties? Ha!

190
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Ah, well, we'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.

191
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,240
Well, yes, sir.
I, I suppose so.

192
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,080
How do you ever expect to amount to anything
without an education, I'd like to know?

193
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,200
Even in these bungling,
backward, medieval times...

194
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,840
you have got to know
where you're going, don't you?

195
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,600
Ye-- Yes, sir.

196
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,040
Yes, of course. So, you must
plan for the future, boy.

197
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,920
You've got to find a direction.
And you've--

198
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,040
Now, by the by, what direction
is this castle of yours?

199
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,120
I think it's north.
The other way.

200
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,960
Oh, oh.

201
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,680
All right, then we better get a move on. Come
on, come on, lad. Pick up the pace. Pick it up.

202
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

203
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,040
Yo-ho, the devil take it!
No, the devil take it.

204
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,840
Anyone's got better sense than to go
barging off in that infernal forest alone.

205
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,600
You had no business
letting him go.

206
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,920
Look, Dad, I'm not
the Wart's keeper.

207
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,280
Well, blast it all, I am.

208
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,480
After all, l, I took him in,
adopted the lad, you might say.

209
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
Being his foster father,
well, I'm responsible.

210
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,200
Whoop.

211
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,840
Tiger! Talbot! Off with you.
Now, look here, Wart.

212
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,200
What's the big idea of
gallivanting off in the woods...

213
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,920
and worrying the living
daylights out of everybody?

214
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,280
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Well, sorry's not enough.

215
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,760
That's four demerits.
Four hours extra kitchen duty.

216
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,160
Eh, report to the cook!

217
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,440
- But, sir, I'd like you to meet--
- Go on, hop it, boy, hop, hop, hop it!

218
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,200
Well, yes, you've got to keep a tight
schedule to run a big place like this.

219
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,040
Need strict rules.
Especially for small boys.

220
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,080
And I most certainly agree.

221
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,880
Who are you and--
Oh. I mean, uh, you?

222
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,040
Uh, my name is Merlin.
Uh, this is Archimedes.

223
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,040
A highly educated owl.

224
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,320
Educated owl?
Say, that's a good one.

225
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,120
Say. Hey, I know.

226
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,480
You've got him under a spell,
Marvin. You're a magician.

227
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,040
The name is Merlin.

228
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,800
And I happen to be the world's
most powerful wizard.

229
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,560
Come off it, man.
Gadzooks!

230
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,480
All right.
I shall demonstrate.

231
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,320
Higitus figitus migitus moe...

232
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
wind and snow
swirl and blow!

233
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,320
What the devil
are you up to?

234
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,400
And that is what I call
a "wizard blizzard."

235
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,960
Hey, Kay, would
you look at this?

236
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,560
An indoor blizzard.
And in the month of July.

237
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,520
So what?

238
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,560
All right, Marvin. Turn her off.
I'm convinced.

239
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,920
Alakazam!

240
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,200
I, uh-- I hope you don't go in
for any of that black magic.

241
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,120
Oh, no, no, no, no.

242
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,280
Never touch the stuff. No.

243
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,200
My magic is used mainly
for educational purposes.

244
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,040
In fact, that is why
I am here.

245
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,360
I have come
to educate the Wart.

246
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,320
Oh, no you don't.

247
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm running this place. And if you think
you're gonna fiddle with my schedule...

248
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,800
you'd better pack up your bag
of tricks and be gone.

249
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,720
Wha-- Well, by Jove.

250
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,600
Hey, he's gone.

251
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,840
Hm-mmm. Good riddance.

252
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm gone, but then,
I'm not gone.

253
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,040
So, if I do leave...

254
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,760
you could never be sure
that I am gone, can you?

255
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,680
Well, uh--

256
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,400
Well, I must say, you--
you got me there, Marvin.

257
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,920
Yes. Well, you win. You're
welcome to stay if you like.

258
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,560
Thank you.
You're very kind.

259
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,440
Very generous, I must say.

260
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,480
Well, uh, all we can offer
is room and board.

261
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,880
Hard times,
you know, Marvin.

262
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,440
We'll put you up
in the northwest tower.

263
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,080
That's the guest room.
It's a bit drafty in the winter...

264
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,640
but in this blazing hot weather,
it's the best room in the house.

265
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,720
Oh, yes.
Very lovely indeed.

266
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,440
So just make yourself
at home, Marvin.

267
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,400
Marvin, Marvin,
Marvin, Marvin.

268
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,520
Best room in the house!

269
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,480
Guest room!
Unwelcome-guest room!

270
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,760
But if he thinks that he can get rid of
me, I've got news for that old walrus.

271
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,800
- I'm sticking it out.
- And I say we go back to the woods.

272
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,160
No, not on your life.

273
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,880
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.

274
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Well, you may be right.

275
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,520
A skinny kid like that would make
a cracking good chimney sweep.

276
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,760
Something tells me that
you're all wet, Archimedes.

277
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
- Who goes there?
- Pelinore!

278
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,400
It's Pelinore, dash it all!

279
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,560
I've got big news from London.
Big news!

280
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,800
Come on, man.
Drop the bridge.

281
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,200
Oh, big news, eh?

282
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,720
They can't wait for the London Times. First
edition won't be out for at least, uh...

283
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,000
1200 years.

284
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Archimedes, would you mind
sailing down there and, and--

285
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,160
Not interested!

286
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,760
Oh, come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.

287
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,040
No! No, no, no!

288
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,800
Archimedes! I'll turn you
into a human.

289
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,400
- Hmph! You wouldn't dare!
- I will. So help me, I will.

290
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Well, all right, all right.
All right!

291
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,680
All right.
It works every time.

292
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,760
Just like magic.

293
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,680
Pelinore!

294
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,920
Pelinore.

295
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,080
Greetings, old boy. And what's
all the noise about London, hmm?

296
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,440
Big news. Really big news.

297
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,200
Sit down, man,
and let's hear all about it.

298
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,800
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.

299
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,320
Oh, that's not news,
dash it all. They always do.

300
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,480
Yeah, but, Ector-- Ector, here's
where all the excitement comes in.

301
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,920
To the winner of this tournament
goes the crown.

302
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,800
You mean-- You mean
he'll be King of all England?

303
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,240
King of all England.

304
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,240
- Kay, lad, did you hear that?
- Pretty fair prize, I'd say.

305
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,040
Yes, and you can win it, boy,
if you knuckle down to your training.

306
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,920
And we'll have you knighted by Christmas
and off to London. What do you say?

307
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,800
Sure. Why not? Why not?

308
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,880
Wart, lad, how'd you
like to go to London?

309
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,160
- Oh, Sir Ector, you mean it?
- If you stick to your duties, you can be Kay's squire.

310
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,360
Oh, I will, sir.
I will.

311
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,040
I don't want the Wart
for my squire.

312
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,240
Here's to London!
And to here's to Kay.

313
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,480
And here's to the banner
of the Castle of the Forest Suavage.

314
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,840
- Cheers!
- Cheers, cheers. - Cheers.

315
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,960
Charge!

316
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,360
Weight forward!
Lean into him!

317
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,320
Steady, boy. Steady!

318
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,400
Steady with the lance!
Grip her tight!

319
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,600
Hit him clean!

320
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,520
No, no, no!

321
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,960
Heads up!

322
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,840
Ar-Ar-Archimedes. Archimedes,
wh-where, where, where are we?

323
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,000
In a tumble-down old tower...

324
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,240
in the most miserable old castle
in all Christendom, that's where.

325
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,880
C-Castle? Castle?

326
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
Don't you even
remember the boy?

327
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,880
Uh, the boy?

328
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,760
Can't you remember
one blasted thing?

329
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,840
- Oh, now, just a moment. I--
- Tight grip on the lance.

330
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,880
- Oh.
- Loosen the saddle, knees in tight.

331
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,760
Weight forward
and stay on target.

332
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
You keep losing your grip.

333
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,280
It's not a mere matter
of muscle, sir.

334
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,320
Jousting is, uh, uh,
a fine skill.

335
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,360
It-- It's a highly
developed science.

336
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,280
Science, indeed.

337
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,240
One dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick.

338
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
And the Wart's just as hot
for it as the rest of them.

339
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,080
He certainly is. That boy's
got real spark. Lots of spirit.

340
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,560
Throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does.

341
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,600
That's really worth something if it can
only be turned in the right direction.

342
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,840
Ha-ha.
Fat chance of that.

343
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,880
Oh, I plan to cheat,
of course.

344
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Use magic. Every last trick
in the trade if I have to.

345
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,240
I'd give anything to go riding
about on a great white charger...

346
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,600
slaying dragons and griffins
and man-eating giants.

347
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,720
Well, won't you?

348
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,080
Oh. No. You see.

349
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm an orphan, and a knight
must be of proper birth.

350
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,240
I only hope I'm worthy
to be Kay's squire.

351
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,560
That's a big job too,
you know.

352
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,280
Oh, indeed, yes, yes.
I would say almost impossible. Yes.

353
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,840
Well, now then. When I said
that I could swim like a fish...

354
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,280
I really meant as a fish.

355
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,720
You mean you can turn
yourself into a fish?

356
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,760
After all, I happen
to be a wizard.

357
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,120
- Could you turn me into a fish?
- Well, do you have any imagination?

358
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,520
Can you imagine yourself
as a fish?

359
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
Oh, that's easy.
I've done that lots of times.

360
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Oh. Well, good. Then I think
that my magic can do the rest.

361
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,680
Archimedes, what, what
is that fish formula?

362
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,680
- Who? Who? What? What? What?
- You know, that, that, that Latin business.

363
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,200
Hmm? Fish? Latin?

364
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,240
Oh, uh.

365
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,360
Aquarius aquaticus aqualitus.

366
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,440
And-And now if you don't mind...

367
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,680
I say good day to the both
of you if you please.

368
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,720
When he stays out all night...

369
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,800
he's always grumpy
the next morning.

370
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,920
- Then he must stay out every night.
- Yes.

371
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,520
Oh. Oh, yes. Oh, I say,
that's very good, boy. Very.

372
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,880
Who? What? What?

373
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,520
All right, boy. All set.
Here we go.

374
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,480
Aquarius aquaticus
aqualitus quum.

375
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
Aqua digi tarium.

376
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,200
Merlin, am I a fish?
Am I a fish?

377
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,720
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes,
you are a fish...

378
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,440
but if you don't stop that
flippity-flopping around...

379
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,320
and get in the water,
you won't last long.

380
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,800
Now, now, stay right here in the tules
and I'll-- I'll be with you in a minute.

381
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,470
Oh.

382
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,800
So you thought you could take
right off like a shot, did you?

383
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,280
Well, I am a fish,
aren't l?

384
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,520
You merely look
like a fish.

385
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,000
That doesn't mean that you can swim like
one. You, you don't have the instinct.

386
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,160
So, you'll have to use your,
your brain for a change.

387
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,880
You are living between
two planes now.

388
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,600
Somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor.

389
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
Now, there, there's lots
of ups and downs...

390
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,600
Like-like, uh,
like a helicopter.

391
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,160
- Helicopter?
- Yes--

392
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh. No, never mind.

393
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,160
Every flick of a fin
creates movement.

394
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,400
So, first we'll start
with a caudal fin.

395
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,840
No, no, boy.
Your tail. Tail.

396
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,720
Now, now, that gives you
the forward thrust now.

397
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,760
Come on, let's get a rhythm.
Right, left.

398
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,360
Right, left. One, two.

399
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,000
Left and right
Like day and night

400
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,320
That's what makes
the world go 'round

401
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,040
In and out
Thin and stout

402
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,880
That's what makes
the world go 'round

403
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,880
For every up
there is a down

404
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,120
- For every square
- There is a round?

405
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,040
Yes.
For every high

406
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,840
- There is a low?
- Uh-huh.

407
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,920
- And for every to
-- - There is a-- - Fro. - Fro.

408
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes, fro.
To and fro, Stop and go

409
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,640
That's what makes
the world go 'round

410
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,640
In and out
Thin and stout

411
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,280
- Merlin! Merlin!
- Oh!

412
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,120
- I swallowed a bug!
- Oh. What's wrong with that?

413
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,240
After all, ah, boy, you are
a fish. I-instinct, you know.

414
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,320
- But you said I had no instinct.
- Yes, of--

415
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,480
Oh. Oh, I did. Well, th-that's
neither here nor there.

416
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,360
But the main thing
is you must--

417
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,320
Set your sights
upon the heights

418
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,840
Don't be a mediocrity

419
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.

420
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,880
Don't just wait
and trust to fate

421
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,920
And say that's how
it's meant to be

422
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,080
It's up to you
how far you go

423
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,000
If you don't try
you'll never know

424
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,040
And so, my lad
as I've explained

425
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,200
Nothing ventured
nothing gained

426
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,600
Let's, let's swim through that
tall grass again. It tickles.

427
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,600
Oh. Oh,
I beg your pardon.

428
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,360
Me too.
For every to there is a fro

429
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,800
For every stop
there is a go

430
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,560
And that's what makes
the world go 'round

431
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,480
Oh, let go,
let go, let go!

432
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,040
Oh, you big,
bug-eyed bully, you!

433
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,960
Who, me?

434
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,160
Oh, here, here, here,
here, here, now, boy.

435
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,440
There's no sense in going
around insulting bullfrogs.

436
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,600
A fish has plenty of other
problems without that.

437
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,520
The water world has its
forests and its jungles too.

438
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,080
So it has its tigers and
its wolves. And that, eh, ah--

439
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,880
That's what makes
the world go 'round

440
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,480
You see, my boy
it's nature's way

441
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,880
Upon the weak
the strong ones prey

442
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,800
The human life
it's also true

443
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,800
The strong will try
to conquer you

444
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,360
And that is what
you must expect

445
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,080
Unless you use
your intellect

446
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,160
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong

447
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,920
- Help, Merlin! Help! Help!
- That's what makes the wor--

448
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,280
Jehoshaphat!

449
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,030
Oh!

450
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,640
- Quick, Merlin, the magic!
- No, no.

451
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,240
You're on your own, lad.
Now's your chance to prove my point.

452
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,320
Wha-What point?

453
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,840
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Oh, now, don't, don't, don't panic!

454
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,040
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.

455
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,520
Smart move, lad!
That's using the old intellect.

456
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,560
- Bravo, boy! Great strategy!
- Is the lesson about over?

457
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,800
D-D-Did you get the point?

458
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,080
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.

459
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,480
Okay, lad, I'll fix the big
brute. Higgeldy piggeldy--

460
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,000
No, no. Hocus pocus--
Now, what in blaze-- Eh--

461
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,920
Merlin!

462
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,200
Now what? Oh, it's,
it's that, that boy!

463
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,960
- Wh-Wh-What in b-blazes!
- Help! Help! Help!

464
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,570
Ouch!

465
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,770
Help!

466
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,520
Archimedes!

467
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,480
Help!

468
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,360
What in thunder is a monster
like that doing in the moat?

469
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,640
By George, l-l-l-- I'll, I'll--
I'll turn him into a minnow.

470
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,120
- Merlin!
- Oh! Oh, there you are, boy.

471
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,560
Snick snack snorum!

472
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,120
How in the world did you ever
get out of that mess?

473
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,160
That, that big fish almost swallowed me
and, and Archimedes, he, he saved me.

474
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,840
Well, by George.
Oh, what do you know about that?

475
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,320
I did nothing of the sort!

476
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,280
I intended to eat him.

477
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,600
Young perch is my favourite dish.
You know that!

478
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,350
Oh.

479
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, l--

480
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,720
Wart. Wart!

481
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,800
I've gotta go. Thank you,
Merlin. It was so much fun.

482
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,000
- And, Archimedes, l, l--
- Pinfeathers, boy!

483
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,360
Wart! Where are you, Wart?

484
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,440
Coming!
I'm coming.

485
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,240
Now, Archimedes.

486
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,800
Why would you half-drown
yourself for a tidbit of fish?

487
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,360
And after such
a big breakfast?

488
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,600
Pinfeathers and gully fluff!

489
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,600
We were doing fine
until we got in deep water.

490
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,920
Then along comes this huge pike
with big jaws and sharp, jagged teeth.

491
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,840
Oh, turn him off, Dad.

492
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,720
He was a monster!
The biggest fish I ever saw.

493
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,000
- And, boy, that's the biggest fish story I ever heard.
- But it's true, sir.

494
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,920
That's three demerits for being late
and three more for the fish story.

495
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,440
Now, hop into the kitchen!

496
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,200
I told you the Wart
was loony.

497
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,720
Yes, well, he's either
out of his head or, uh....

498
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,640
there's something mighty
fishy going on around here.

499
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,560
For every high
there is a low

500
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,120
For every to
there is a fro

501
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,320
To and fro
Stop and go

502
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,680
That's what makes
the world go round

503
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,480
- Oh, it's you, Merlin, sir.
- Uh, yes, my lad.

504
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,920
Now, have you ever
considered being a squirrel?

505
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
Well, no, I don't suppose.

506
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,920
Well, now, there is
a tiny creature...

507
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,560
with enormous problems.

508
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,800
How he has survived
throughout the ages...

509
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,720
is one of nature's
big mysteries.

510
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,320
His life is hazardous.

511
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,480
Downright dangerous.

512
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,200
Uh, would you
like to try it?

513
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,200
- Oh, no, I'd better not.
- Oh-ho.

514
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,960
It's, uh, too dangerous
for you, eh?

515
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,880
Oh, no, it's not that.

516
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,120
It's just that I've got six
demerits. All this work to do.

517
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,840
What a mess!

518
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,760
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.

519
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,240
Start an assembly-line system.

520
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,320
All right now. One and a-two
and a-three and a-four!

521
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,000
Higitus figitus migitus mum
Skitun de bitun de batun de dum

522
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,560
- But I'm supposed to do it.
- No one will know the difference, son.

523
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,400
Who cares as long
as the work gets done?

524
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,960
Rubbedy scrubbedy

525
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,680
Sweepety flow

526
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,960
Come on, son.
Let's go, let's go.

527
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,840
Wart. Wart!

528
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,040
Wart. Now, take it easy.
Take it easy, boy.

529
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,880
What? Oh, no, boy!
No, no!

530
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,440
- Wart!
- Whoa. Oh!

531
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,080
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.

532
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,960
Well, I made it,
didn't I?

533
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,400
Yes, yes, you made it. You made it, but
you, you can't always trust to luck, boy.

534
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,360
Now, first thing...

535
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,840
you start with
the short jumps.

536
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,440
Gauge the distance carefully.

537
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,520
And-- Oh!

538
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,200
Now, there, you see?
Even, even, even then you can miss.

539
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,360
So, don't take gravity too lightly
or it'll catch up with you.

540
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,880
- What's gravity?
- Gravity is what causes you to fall.

541
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,280
Oh, like a stumble
or, or a trip?

542
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,640
Yes, it's like a stumble or a
-- No, no, no, no, no. It's the force that pulls you downward.

543
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,320
The, the phenomenon that any two
material particles or bodies...

544
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,520
if free to move, will be
accelerated toward each other.

545
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,120
- Merlin, how will we get by?
- Hmm?

546
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Oh. Oh, well, l, I suppose we
better go back to a side track.

547
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,680
Go on, go on.
You got lots of room.

548
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,640
Well, l-- I, l, I guess
she can't be sidetracked.

549
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,880
That's a girl squirrel, that,
and a redhead at that.

550
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,160
- She sure acts funny.
- Well, she likes you.

551
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Why?

552
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,320
Yes, well, well, well,
that's nature again.

553
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,040
But I'm afraid there's
no time to explain.

554
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,200
Here, here, now.
You better leave me out of it.

555
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,880
Yeah, me too.

556
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,440
Merlin! Merlin!

557
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,000
You're on your own, lad. I'm afraid
magic can't solve this problem.

558
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,520
Look, I'm, I'm not a boy.
I mean--

559
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,360
I'm not a squirrel.
I'm a boy.

560
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,000
A human boy.
Not a real sq--

561
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,320
Oh, leave me alone!

562
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,720
Merlin, what'll I do?
She won't leave me--

563
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
Well, I'm, I'm afraid
you're stuck, lad.

564
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,440
Well, when a girl squirrel
chooses a mate, it's for life.

565
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,480
- But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.
- But she doesn't know that.

566
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,240
She only knows one simple fact.
That you're a him and she's a her.

567
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,240
- That's a natural phenomenon.
- Phenomenon-menum?

568
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,360
Well, it's the, the, uh--

569
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,760
It's a state of being
A frame of mind

570
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,760
It's a most
befuddling thing

571
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,320
And to every being of every kind
it is discombooberating

572
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,400
You're wasting time
resisting

573
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,320
You'll find
the more you do

574
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,080
The more
she'll keep insisting

575
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,800
Her him has got to be you

576
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Now leave me alone!
I mean it!

577
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,440
It's a rough game
Anyone knows

578
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,400
Go away!

579
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,360
There are no rules
Anything goes

580
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,080
There's no logical
explanation

581
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,120
For this discombooberation

582
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,080
It's a most bemuddling
Most befuddling thing

583
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh! Who? Who? What-- What--

584
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Now, go on. Shoo!
Get a tree of your own.

585
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,920
Skedaddle!

586
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,840
You-- You-- You-- You--
Oh, you squirrelly squirrels!

587
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,520
She's gaining on you, Wart.

588
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,160
There's no sensible
explanation

589
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,960
For this discombooberation

590
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,960
It's a most hodge-podgical
Most illogical

591
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,600
Most confusiling
Most bamboozling

592
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,560
Most bemuddling
Most be-befu-fuddling

593
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,680
Thing

594
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,040
Really, now, Miss, uh--
Madam. I, uh--

595
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,080
You, you, you've made a mistake.
Now, now, now, please.

596
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,160
Please, you--
Oh! Madam! Madam!

597
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,640
Now, look here.
I am not a boy.

598
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,520
I, I mean, I'm--
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a b--

599
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,800
No, that's not what-- No!

600
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,880
No. I'm, I'm,
I'm a stupid old--

601
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,630
No!

602
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,720
I'm an old man.

603
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,240
An old human.

604
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,880
Understand?

605
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Oh, hang it all.
Now, go away.

606
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,680
Shoo, shoo.

607
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,320
Impossible. Impossible!

608
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,360
Ooh, confound it!

609
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,600
Confound it all!

610
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,880
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.

611
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,840
Oh, you've got trouble?
Look at my-- Look back there!

612
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,960
One side, lad.

613
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,400
Whoa, what--
Help, Merlin!

614
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,650
Help!

615
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,640
Oh, no!

616
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,760
By George!

617
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,800
I've had enough
of this nonsense!

618
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,240
Alakazam!

619
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,240
There. You see? I'm an ugly,
horrible, grouchy old man!

620
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,680
- Merlin!
- Oh.

621
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,000
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.

622
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,320
Snick snack snorum.

623
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,520
There. Now you see?
I'm not a squirrel. I'm a boy.

624
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,880
I tried to tell you.
I'm a boy.

625
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,840
A human boy.

626
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,840
Oh, if you could only understand.

627
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,640
Ah, you know, lad...

628
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,800
that love business
is a powerful thing.

629
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,320
Greater than gravity?

630
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,720
Well, yes, boy,
in its way, I'd, uh--

631
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,360
Yes, I'd say it's
the greatest force on Earth.

632
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,400
Oh, Ector!

633
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,560
Ector! Sir Ector! The kitchen!

634
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,760
- Hold it, son! Hold it.
- Black magic all over the place!

635
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,200
Kay! Hold on, I say!

636
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,120
Stop!

637
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,400
Oh. Now, what's
all the commotion, hmm?

638
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,160
Oh, the kitchen,
it's under an evil spell!

639
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
- Huh?
- It's bewitched.

640
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,920
Oh, I bet it's
that old goat Marvin.

641
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Come on, son.
I-l knew he'd give us trouble.

642
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,960
Gadzooks!

643
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,920
Black magic
of the worst kind!

644
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,400
Come on, Kay!
To the attack!

645
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
Wha-- Oh!

646
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,000
Hold it!

647
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,840
Heaven preserve us!

648
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,520
Kay!

649
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,880
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hoptoads!

650
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,000
Alakazam!

651
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,640
So there you are,
you old goat.

652
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,640
Well, what's the idea of flinging
your evil spells all over the place?

653
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,440
Oh, oh,
lend me a hand, boy.

654
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,120
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself, hmm?

655
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,360
You call washing dishes and
sweeping floors a work of evil?

656
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,720
I'll decide what's right
and wrong around here.

657
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,600
Besides, that's the Wart's job.
One of his duties.

658
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,520
Uh, and look here, boy.

659
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,840
If you want to make that trip
to London, you'd better tow the mark.

660
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,520
You old goat! lf I ever catch you
in my kitchen again, I'll--

661
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,400
Madam, you won't.

662
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,560
Oh, dear. He's gone.

663
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,520
Well, by Jove.

664
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,160
We ought to run the old geezer
right out of the castle.

665
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,040
Oh, no, no,
no, no, Kay. No.

666
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,800
He might cast an evil spell
on the lot of us.

667
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,960
Turn us all to stone.

668
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,880
No. There's no telling
what the old devil might do.

669
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,560
He's not an old devil!
He-- He's good!

670
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,640
And, and his magic
is good too.

671
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,760
If, if you'd just
leave him alone!

672
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,920
Now, look here, Wart.
That's three more demerits.

673
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,720
- Box his ears, Dad.
- Just because you can't understand something...

674
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,080
- it, it doesn't mean it's wrong.
- Ten more demerits!

675
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,320
You make all the rules and, and
nobody else can say anything.

676
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,840
You said a plenty, boy! All that
popping off just cooked your goose.

677
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,040
Kay, from now on,
young Hobbs is your squire.

678
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,160
Did you hear that, Wart?
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.

679
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,640
- Ye
-- Ye-- Yes, sir. - Now that'll teach you to pop off, you little pipsqueak.

680
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,680
Oh, I'm sorry, lad.

681
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,400
I'm sorry.
I spoiled everything.

682
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,520
I know that trip to London
means a great deal to you.

683
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,920
Oh, it's,
it's not your fault.

684
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,800
I shouldn't have popped off.
Now I'm really done for.

685
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,640
No, no, you're in
a great spot, boy.

686
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,520
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.

687
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,880
- I'd like to know how.
- Use your head.

688
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,840
An education, lad.

689
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,920
What good will that do?

690
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,680
Get it first. Then who knows?
Are you willing to try?

691
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,280
Well, what have
I got to lose?

692
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,920
That's the spirit!
We'll start tomorrow!

693
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,160
We'll show 'em.
Won't we, boy?

694
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
We sure will.

695
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,840
Now, first of all, lad...

696
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,720
we've got to get all these
medieval ideas out of your head.

697
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,080
Clear the way for new ideas.

698
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,920
Knowledge of man's
fabulous discoveries...

699
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,280
in the centuries ahead.

700
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,040
- Now that'll be a great advantage, boy.
- Advantage, indeed!

701
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,040
If the boy goes about saying the world
is round, they'll take him for a lunatic.

702
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,960
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

703
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,720
And it also goes around.

704
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,520
- You mean it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no.

705
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,640
It's round now. Man will discover this
in centuries to come.

706
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,160
And he will also find that
the world is merely...

707
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,280
a tiny speck
in the universe.

708
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,360
- Universe?
- Oh, you're only confusing the boy.

709
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,200
Before you're through, he'll be so mixed up,
he'll, he'll be wearing his shoes on his head.

710
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,560
Man has always learned from the past. After
all, you can't learn history in reverse.

711
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,840
It's, it's, it's confusing
enough, for heaven sakes.

712
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,240
All right! All right.
Have it your way, Archimedes.

713
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,480
You're in charge.
You're the headmaster now.

714
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,000
So from now on,
he's your pupil.

715
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,920
So, from now on, boy...

716
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,120
you do as I say.

717
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,960
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

718
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,920
Now to start off, I want you
to read these books.

719
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,520
- All of them?
- That, my boy, is a mountain of knowledge.

720
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,240
- But l, but I can't read.
- What, what? What? Then I don't suppose you know how to write?

721
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,600
- No, sir.
- What do you know?

722
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,240
- Well, l--
- Well, never mind. Never mind.

723
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,840
We'll start at the bottom.
The ABC's.

724
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,640
First the A,
and now the B.

725
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,160
Loop and around
and there's the C.

726
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,080
Merlin. Look.
I can write.

727
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,800
Oh. Yes, yes.
That's very good, boy. Very--

728
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,120
Henscratch, that's all.
Henscratch. Now, come on.

729
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,360
D, E, F,
and now the G.

730
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,840
You see, it's as simple as--
No, no, no! No, boy!

731
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,000
Now, use your head. Use your head, will you?
How do you ever expect to learn anything?

732
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,240
Archimedes!
Have you seen that, uh...

733
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,440
flying machine model?

734
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,720
I have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.

735
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,520
- What's that thing up there?
- Hmm? Oh, yes, of course.

736
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,840
- Here we are.
- You mean man will fly in one of those someday?

737
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,040
If man were meant to fly,
he'd have been born with wings.

738
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,520
I am about to prove
otherwise, Archimedes...

739
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,920
if you care to watch.

740
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,880
Here she goes.

741
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,960
No, no, no, no, no--

742
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,880
Man'll fly all right.
Just like a rock.

743
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,520
It would have worked if, if,
if, if it weren't for...

744
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,160
this infernal beard!

745
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,720
I never, never
in my whole--

746
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,080
Man will fly someday,
I tell you.

747
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,840
I have been there.
I have seen it.

748
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,080
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying--

749
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,760
that I was a bird and that I could go sailing
all over the sky high above everything.

750
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,800
Prestadigitonium.

751
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,280
It's my favourite dream.

752
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,520
Oh, but then I suppose
everybody dreams about flying.

753
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,000
I'm a bird! I'm a bird!
I'm a bird!

754
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,200
Hold it, boy.
Not so fast. Not so fast.

755
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,200
First, l-- I'd better explain
the mechanics of a bird's wing.

756
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,640
Now, these large feathers...

757
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,360
are called the primaries.

758
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,400
- And, uh--
- And, uh, since when...

759
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,560
do you know all about
bird's wings?

760
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,280
I have made an extensive study
of birds in flight. And l--

761
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,240
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.

762
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,280
All right, Mr Know-lt-All,
he's your pupil.

763
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,720
- Ouch!
- Now, boy...

764
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,360
flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process.

765
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,280
It is a delicate art.
Purely aesthetic.

766
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,200
Poetry of motion.

767
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,600
And the best way to learn it
is to do it.

768
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,360
Now, since we're pretty far up,
we'll start with a glide.

769
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,720
Spread your wings way out,
way out. That's it. That's it.

770
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,960
Now, fan your tail.

771
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,720
Tippity-toe, tippity-toe,
and off we go.

772
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,720
Now, tuck your feet under,
like me. That's it. That's the idea!

773
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,440
- Whoa! What? Oh!
- And don't fight the air currents.

774
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,560
Use them.

775
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,120
Well, say, boy!

776
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,440
That's pretty good.

777
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,040
Well, boy,
you're a natural!

778
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,720
Are you sure this is
the first time that you've--

779
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,280
Wart! Wart!
Hawk! Hawk!

780
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,560
Look out, boy!
Heads up! Wart!

781
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,880
Archimedes! Help!

782
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,240
Wart! Wart!

783
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,080
Whoa! What? Oh!

784
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,480
Sounds like someone's sick.
How lov--

785
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,960
Oh, bat gizzards.
It's nothing but...

786
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,280
a scrawny little sparrow
with a beak full of soot.

787
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,560
Oh, I-I'm not really a sparrow.
I'm a boy.

788
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,240
- A boy?
- Merlin changed me with his magic.

789
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,360
He's the world's
most powerful wizard.

790
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,400
Merlin. Ho-ho!

791
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,920
Merlin, the world's
most powerful bungler.

792
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,800
Why, boy, I've got more magic
in one little finger.

793
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,280
Now, don't tell me you've never
heard of the marvellous Madam Mim?

794
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,840
Well, no, I don't guess so.

795
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,800
Madam Mim? Oh! Good heavens,
good heavens, good heavens!

796
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,800
My boy, I'm the greatest.
I'm truly marvellous!

797
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,960
With only a touch
I have the power

798
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,040
Zim zab rim bim
To whither a flower

799
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,440
I find delight
in the gruesome and grim

800
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,960
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.

801
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,920
But that's nothing,
nothing for me.

802
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,840
No! 'Cause I'm the magnificent...

803
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,400
marvellous, mad Madam Mim.

804
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,960
You know what?
I can even change size.

805
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,640
I can be huge!
Ooh! Fill the whole house.

806
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,600
I can be teeny
Small as a mouse

807
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,120
Black sorcery
is my dish of tea

808
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,760
Uh, it comes easy to me.
'Cause I'm the magnificent...

809
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,000
marvellous, mad Madam Mim.

810
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,000
Marvellous, boy!
Marvellous, I'm marvellous!

811
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,560
Say, lad, did you know that
I can make myself uglier yet?

812
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,880
Well, that would be some trick.
Er, um, ah, I mean, uh--

813
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,120
Want to bet? Boo!

814
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,640
You see? I win, I win!

815
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,720
Aren't I hideous, boy?
Perfectly revolting?

816
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,880
- Well, uh, yes, ma'am.
- But you ain't seen nothin' yet.

817
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,680
Watch this.

818
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,800
I can be beautiful
lovely and fair

819
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,000
Silvery voice
long purple hair

820
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:48,080
But it's only skin deep
for zim zaberim zim

821
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,720
I'm an ugly, old creep!
The magnificent, marvellous...

822
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,680
mad, mad, mad,
mad Madam Mim.

823
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,200
Now what do you think, boy?
Who's the greatest?

824
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,200
Well, uh, Merlin's magic
is always, um, well, useful...

825
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,480
uh, for something good.

826
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,880
- And he must see something good in you.
- Oh, I suppose so.

827
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,120
Yes, and in my book,
that's bad!

828
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,400
So, my boy, I'm afraid
I'll have to destroy you.

829
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,480
De-Destroy me?

830
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,080
Yeah, I-I'll give you
a sporting chance.

831
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,440
I'm mad about games,
you know.

832
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,880
Yeah, well come on,
get going, boy.

833
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,600
You gotta keep on your toes
in this game.

834
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,240
I win, I win!

835
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,640
Oh, the game's over.

836
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,360
Why, you little devil, you! I'll
wring your scrawny little neck!

837
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,920
Mim! Mim! Wha-Wha-What--
Eh, what was you up to?

838
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,760
Uh! Me-Me-- Oh, Merlin!
Well, you're just in time.

839
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,680
- We were playing a little game.
- She was gonna destroy me.

840
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,840
And just what are you
gonna do about it?

841
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,640
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizard's duel?

842
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,160
- As you wish, madam.
- Well, come on, step outside.

843
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,680
After you, madam.

844
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,360
They're havin' a wizard's duel.
What's that mean?

845
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,280
Oh, it's a battle of wits.
The players change themselves...

846
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,320
to different things and, and attempt to,
uh, to destroy one another.

847
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,080
De-Des-De-Destroy?

848
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,160
But just watch, boy, just watch.
You'll get the idea.

849
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,480
Now, first of all, if you
don't mind, I'll make the rules.

850
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,400
Rules indeed!

851
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,800
Why, she only wants rules
so she can break 'em!

852
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,040
I'll take care of you later,
featherbrain.

853
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,280
Now, rule one,
no mineral or vegetable.

854
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,960
Only animal. Rule two,
no make-believe things...

855
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,400
Like, uh, oh,
pink dragons and stuff.

856
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,320
Now, rule three,
no disappearing.

857
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,560
- Rule four, no cheating.
- All right, all right.

858
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,600
Now, pace off ten.

859
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,280
One, two, three, four--

860
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,400
- Merlin! She disappeared!
- Huh? Ah-- Duh-- Bah-- Mim!

861
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,760
Now, you made the rules!

862
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,680
Ouch!

863
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,520
- Change to somethin' else, Merlin.
- Ah-- Buh-- Y-Yes...

864
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,240
yes, yes, yes,
give me time to think.

865
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,080
- Ah, higgety-piggety. Ah, duh
-- No, no, no, no, no. - Quick, Merlin, hurry!

866
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,200
Ah-- Duh-- Hoppity-hip-hip.

867
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:58,920
Ha-ha!

868
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,840
Got me tail, now!
Madam, just a minute.

869
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,240
Ah-- D-D--
This is not the-the-the-the--

870
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,960
- Come on! Something bigger!
- Something smaller!

871
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,840
Mi-Mi-Mim, Mi-Mim,
Mi-Mim Mi-Mi--

872
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
Ooh!

873
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,160
Merlin! No disappearing.

874
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,080
Whoo!

875
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,960
Ouch!

876
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,960
Mim? Mim?
Are-Are-Are you--

877
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,840
Now-- Gah-- What-What--
W-W-What's going on here?

878
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,880
You, you-- You big blimp!

879
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,320
Squash me, will ya?

880
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,120
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Merlin!

881
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,800
- Ouch! Ooh!
- Bravo!

882
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,640
Oh, just you wait!
Just you wait! You're gonna pay!

883
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,760
So you want to play rough,
do ya?

884
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:52,840
All right, Merlin. I'll
smash you good, you old crab!

885
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,960
Jehoshaphat!

886
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,000
Here I come, Mim,
ready or not.

887
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,560
Merlin, you wouldn't dare!

888
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,520
Now, now, Mim, Mim!
No-No dragons, remember?

889
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,400
Did I say no purple dragons?
Did l?

890
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,760
I win, I win!

891
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,480
Oh, that horrible old witch!
I'll, I'll peck her eyes out!

892
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,600
Huh, no, no.
No, no, no.

893
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,880
- He's gone!
- Disappeared.

894
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:54,280
Madam, I have not disappeared.
I am very tiny.

895
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,320
I'm a germ. A rare disease.

896
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,160
I'm called "malagolintomontorosis"...

897
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,680
and you caught me, Mim!

898
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,930
What?

899
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,840
First, you break out
into spots.

900
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Followed by hot
and cold flashes.

901
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,520
Then violent sneezing.

902
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,680
Huh! Watch it, boy!

903
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,080
Oh! Er-- You-You-You-You
sneaky old scoundrel!

904
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,640
Oh, it's not too serious, madam.
Ah, you should recover...

905
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,080
in a few weeks and be as good, uh--
Ah, heh-heh-- I-l mean as bad as ever.

906
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,520
But, ah, I would suggest
plenty of rest...

907
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,160
and lots and lots
of sunshine!

908
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,560
I hate sunshine!

909
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,240
I hate horrible,
wholesome sunshine!

910
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,840
I hate it, I hate it!
I hate, hate, hate, hate--

911
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,760
You were really great, Merlin,
but-but you could've been killed.

912
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,800
It was worth it, lad, if you
learned something from it.

913
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,320
Knowledge and wisdom
is the real power.

914
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,800
Right you are, Wart,
so stick to your schooling, boy.

915
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,640
Oh-Oh, don't worry, I will, sir.
I will, oh, I really will.

916
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,520
We will sing all night
and all day we will fight

917
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,760
For the blue oak tree
on the field of white

918
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,880
For the blue oak tree
on the fie-ie-ie-ie-ield

919
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,840
Of white

920
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,560
Here's to victory in London
for my son, Kay!

921
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,920
Sir Kay. I've been knighted,
don't forget.

922
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,040
No-o, of course, son,
of course.

923
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,240
Ah, here's to Sir Kay.
And who knows?

924
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,400
The future king
of all England!

925
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,920
- Watch it, will ya?
- Kay the king?

926
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,440
What a dreadful thought.

927
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,680
Sir Ector! Sir Ector!

928
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,000
Hobbs has come down
with the mumps!

929
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,440
Face all-all-all
puffed up like a toad!

930
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,880
Then Kay'll need another squire,
hang it all.

931
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,680
- Hmm. Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?

932
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,000
Kay's squire.
You're going to London, boy.

933
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,920
Oh, Sir Ector!
Whoa! What? Whoa!

934
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,960
Merlin! Archimedes! Merlin!

935
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,360
Merlin, look!
I'm a squire!

936
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,360
Hah!

937
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,880
Oh. Uh, very nice, boy.

938
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:46,600
Yes, indeed. A fine monkey suit
for polishing boots.

939
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,000
It's-it's what
all the squires wear.

940
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,920
And I thought you were
going to amount to something!

941
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,720
I thought you had
a few brains!

942
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,440
Great future. Hah!

943
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,120
A stooge for that
big lunk, Kay.

944
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,320
Congratulations, boy!

945
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,480
What do y-- What do you want
me to be? I'm nobody.

946
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,240
You-- You don't know a thing
about what's goin' on today.

947
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,040
I-I-I-I'm lucky
to be Kay's squire.

948
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,040
D-- Oh! D--
Of all the idiotic--

949
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,720
Y-Y-Y-- I--
Blow me to Bermuda!

950
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,280
Where-- Uh, where did he go?

951
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,240
- To Bermuda, I suppose.
- Where's that?

952
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,040
Oh, an island way off somewhere
that hasn't been discovered yet.

953
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,000
Will he ever come back?

954
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,920
Who knows?
Who knows anything?

955
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,440
For the crown
of all England...

956
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,040
let the tournament begin.

957
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh, Kay, now
it's up to the swords.

958
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,960
Swords? Swords?
Ah-- Oh, no! Kay?

959
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,400
What? What?

960
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,760
I, eh--
I-l-l forgot your sword.

961
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,320
Forgot my sword?

962
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,040
I-- I-l left it
back at the inn.

963
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,920
Why, you bungling little fool!
I'll-- Oof!

964
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,480
You better get it!
Or don't you dare come back!

965
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,680
Let me in! Let me in!

966
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,560
Somebody please!
Please let me in!

967
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,360
It's no use, boy.
They've all gone to the tournament.

968
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,360
Oh, what'll I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.

969
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,120
Look, boy! Look!
There in the churchyard.

970
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,240
A sword!
Oh, Archimedes, a sword!

971
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,160
You're gonna have a time
pullin' it out.

972
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,760
Huh! Watch it, boy!

973
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,080
Better leave it alone!

974
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,240
But Kay's got to have
a sword.

975
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,840
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here!

976
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,120
Y-You're up next, son.
Uh, better get ready.

977
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,320
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.

978
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,960
This is not my sword!

979
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,840
Hold on, Kay!
Wait a minute.

980
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,720
"Whoso pulleth out
this sword--"

981
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,560
Ooh, eh-- It's the sword
in the stone!

982
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,200
- The sword in the stone? It can't be.
- But look. It is!

983
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,600
- It's the marvellous sword.
- Hold everything.

984
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,760
Someone's pulled the sword
from the stone.

985
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,760
Where did you get it, Wart?

986
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,000
I, l-l pulled it out of an anvil
that was on a stone...

987
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,720
i-in, in a churchyard.

988
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,040
- That's funny!
- The lad's a young Samson!

989
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,960
You're making a fool of us, boy.
Now tell the truth.

990
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,200
- But I did, sir. Ow! Ooh!
- Then come on, prove it.

991
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,600
- Ouch!
- Back to the stone with you.

992
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,600
- Yes, prove it.
- Come on, prove it.

993
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,480
All right, boy,
let's have the miracle.

994
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,960
Now, wait a minute!

995
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,280
Anyone can pull it
once it's been pulled.

996
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,800
Go to it, Kay.
Give it all you got.

997
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,760
Put your back into it!

998
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,960
- Here now!
- Here, here, here!

999
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,120
- Push him and see.
- It's my turn. One side!

1000
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,040
- Pull this thing.
- Hold on, that's not fair.

1001
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,440
I say we let
the boy try it.

1002
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,840
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.

1003
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,760
Go ahead, son.

1004
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,600
It's a miracle
ordained by heaven.

1005
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,680
This boy is our king.

1006
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,800
Well, by Jove.

1007
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,560
- What's the lad's name?
- Eh, Wart.

1008
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,840
Oh, uh, I mean Arthur.

1009
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,240
- Hail King Arthur!
- Hail King Arthur! Long live the king!

1010
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,560
- Long live King Arthur! Long live the king.
- I can't believe it!

1011
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,000
- Ooh, forgive me, son.
- Hail King Arthur.

1012
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,320
- Long live the king. Long live...
- Forgive me.

1013
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,680
- King Arthur. Long live the king.
- Oh, please don't, sir.

1014
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,120
- Kay, bow down to your king.
- Hail King Arthur.

1015
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,040
Long live the king.

1016
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,600
- Hail King Arthur.
- So at last, the miracle...

1017
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,880
had come to pass in that
far off time upon New Year's Day...

1018
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,680
and the glorious rein
of King Arthur was begun.

1019
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,880
I can't be a king, Archimedes. I don't
know anything about ruling a country.

1020
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,720
I told you to leave the thing
in the stone, boy.

1021
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,600
I'll, I'll run away,
that's what I'll do.

1022
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,920
They'll just have to get
somebody else.

1023
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,160
Better take the side door, Wart.
Out the side door.

1024
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,760
Hail King Arthur!
Long live the King!

1025
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,400
There's another door. Over there,
over there! Come on, come on!

1026
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,760
Long live King Arthur!
Long li--

1027
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,640
Looks-Looks like
we're surrounded, boy.

1028
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,200
Oh, Archimedes,
I wish Merlin was here.

1029
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,320
Merlin! Merlin!

1030
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,040
Oh, Merlin, you're back
from Ber-Ber-Ber--

1031
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,320
Bermuda?
Yes, back from Bermuda...

1032
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,360
and the 20th century.

1033
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,400
And believe me,
you can have it.

1034
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,520
One big modern mess!
Alakazam!

1035
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,440
I'm in an awful pickle.
I'm king.

1036
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,000
Ooh, he pulled the sword
from the stone.

1037
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,520
Ha-ha!
Of course, of course!

1038
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,360
King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table.

1039
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,960
- Round table?
- Oh, uh, w-would you rather have a square one?

1040
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,200
Oh, no. Round'll be fine.

1041
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,960
Boy, boy, boy.

1042
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,960
You'll become
a great legend.

1043
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,080
They'll be writing books
about you for centuries to come.

1044
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,920
Why, they might even make
a motion picture about you.

1045
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,440
- Motion picture?
- Oh.

1046
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,720
Uh, well, um-- Uh, that's
something like television...

1047
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,640
without commercials.

1048
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,000
Hail King Arthur
Long live the King

1049
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
