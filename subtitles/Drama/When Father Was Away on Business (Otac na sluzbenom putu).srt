SARAJEVO JUNE 1950

2
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:26,892
WHEN FATHER WAS AWAY ON BUSINESS

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,828
AN HISTORICAL LOVE FILM

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,860
<i>Chiquita</i>

5
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:42,670
<i>Spanish land, flowers of May</i>

6
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,711
<i>Every child loves you</i>

7
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,944
<i>While listening to castanets</i>

8
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:56,250
<i>I have a sombrero</i>

9
00:00:56,322 --> 00:01:01,783
<i>You're</i> a <i>darling girl</i>

10
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,092
<i>Chiquita</i>

11
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,158
<i>You're the woman of my dreams</i>

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,170
<i>You 're my new love</i>

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:17,232
<i>But you give yours to another</i>

14
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:22,842
<i>I have a sombrero</i>

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:28,445
<i>You're my darling girl</i>

16
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,184
<i>Carmelita</i>

17
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,754
<i>Lead me to Barcelona</i>

18
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,823
<i>So 9 can see my love</i>

19
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,703
<i>Chiquita</i>

20
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,906
<i>9 thought 9 was the first to come</i>

21
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,506
<i>9 am a stranger</i>

22
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,280
<i>But, Chiquita</i>

23
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,753
<i>H! be yours</i>

24
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:09,893
<i>I have a sombrero</i>

25
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:15,128
<i>You're</i> a <i>darling girl</i>

26
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,327
Franjo!

27
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,761
Franjo!

28
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,266
What are you lads up to'?

29
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,370
Are you Working
or messing around'?

30
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,881
When you work,
you don't mess around.

31
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,383
- Understood?
- Understood.

32
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,114
Come on, comrades!

33
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,051
<i>My name is Mafik Malkoc,</i>

34
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:44,256
<i>but everybody calls me
"Maffky Sticky-icky.</i> ”"

35
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,960
<i>I was born November 2, 1944,</i>

36
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,163
<i>but Mama wrote I was born</i>

37
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,671
<i>on October 29,</i>

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,866
<i>because the war was on</i>

39
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,672
<i>and we were poor</i>

40
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:04,206
<i>so she could get
an extra months allowance.</i>

41
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,252
<i>My best friend is Joza.</i>

42
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,779
<i>His full name
is Serjoza Petrovic.</i>

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,088
<i>He doesn't mind
being called Joza,</i>

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,119
<i>but if someone
calls him “fatso,</i> “

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,063
<i>he gets mad.</i>

46
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,866
WE BUY HERBS AND MUSHROOMS

47
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:31,866
<i>Franjo the janitor
sings Mexican songs.</i>

48
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,176
<i>When my dad asked him,
"Why Mexican?"</i>

49
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:39,912
<i>he said, "Comrade Mesa,
nowadays, it's the safest.</i>

50
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,318
<i>Such are the times.“</i>

51
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,948
<i>Mama always tells him,</i>

52
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,685
<i>“Franjo, don? drink.</i>

53
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,227
<i>You'll ruin your health.</i> “

54
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,627
<i>He smiles and says,</i>

55
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,960
<i>"When I'm drunk,"</i>

56
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,626
<i>“my reflexes are quicker.</i>

57
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,260
<i>“Who knows what would happened</i>

58
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,066
<i>if I were sober?“</i>

59
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,806
<i>He drinks up all the money
he makes from the herbs</i>

60
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,678
<i>because he loves
90-proof, plum brandy.</i>

61
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,081
<i>But we're saving up our money</i>

62
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:16,884
<i>to buy a genuine, leather football.</i>

63
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,871
They're going too far now.

64
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,192
You're a swine, Mesa.

65
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,904
You know that?

66
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,274
Why'?

67
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,408
You don't know?
You really don't know?

68
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,880
I told you I had no idea
I'd be promoted.

69
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,184
What's the Party got to do
with the divorce?

70
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,658
Shut up.

71
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,196
You tell me to shut up'?

72
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,232
You've been telling me that
for two years.

73
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,395
What am I, a Whore?

74
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,497
Shut up, you stupid bitch!

75
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,384
- Got a light?
- I've got nicer things.

76
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,793
A nice girl,
but a bit hot-tempered.

77
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,731
I've got just the cure for her.

78
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,861
You can't even
get these in Paris.

79
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,428
La Baiser,
the queen of lipsticks.

80
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,804
How much'?

81
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,644
Cheaper than a muzzle.

82
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,047
How much'?

83
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,086
In view of the situation,

84
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,587
only four dinars.

85
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,213
Give me two.

86
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,497
Leave me alone.

87
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,806
Leave me alone!

88
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,617
You don't love me anymore.

89
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:39,283
- You don't!
- Just be patient!

90
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,986
When will you get a divorce?

91
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,222
When'? Never!

92
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,868
Say something, for God's sake!

93
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,205
You don't love me.

94
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,180
Who loves anybody
in this madhouse'?

95
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,401
I'll go to a rest home
and bathe when it suits me.

96
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,839
You only take one bath a year.

97
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,778
There, they'd make you
take two a week.

98
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,509
While others fuck about,
I have to bathe.

99
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,817
<i>Mama has ordered a big clean-up.</i>

100
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,155
<i>My brother Mirza and I
are to be circumcised.</i>

101
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,162
<i>I asked Mirza
what “circumcisecf means.</i>

102
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,959
<i>He says we're done for.</i>

103
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:32,130
<i>They grab your prick
and cut half of it off.</i>

104
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,037
<i>Jam's dad, Viado Petrovic,</i>

105
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,803
<i>was taken away
by the men in leather coats.</i>

106
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,209
<i>He shouted so that everybody
could hear:</i>

107
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,615
<i>"I'd rather have Russian shit
than American cake!“"</i>

108
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,644
<i>Later they took away
their radio and telephone.</i>

109
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,816
<i>I asked Joza why they did it.</i>

110
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,384
<i>He said it was
something to do with Stalin.</i>

111
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,693
<i>We took all of Stalin's pictures
out of the house.</i>

112
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,201
<i>We recognized him
by his moustache.</i>

113
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,901
<i>Since then, Joza's mom
first waits for the postman every day,</i>

114
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,535
<i>then tells Joza
she's going to the market</i>

115
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,479
<i>and goes off to the council
to ask about his dad.</i>

116
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,613
- How's my little Communist?
- He's great, comrade.

117
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,519
Here you are...

118
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,591
Comrades.

119
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,967
You've got no right.

120
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,598
Give it...

121
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,073
Give it here.

122
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,278
<i>Radio</i> Sarajevo...

123
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,683
<i>We inform all citizens</i>

124
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,450
<i>that vegetables
will be available...</i>

125
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,418
Where have you been'?

126
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,522
For the lady of the house.

127
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,272
Mirza!

128
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,176
Look in my pocket.

129
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,418
50 <i>mm.</i>

130
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,697
Chalk in the right hand,
slate in the left.

131
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,009
And for the mangy, old freeloader...

132
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,957
I hoped you'd be gone
when I returned.

133
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,392
So did I, dear son-in-law.

134
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,433
When will you leave
and never return?

135
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,900
You'll have a bloody, long wait.

136
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,937
I know.

137
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,805
Scram.

138
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,613
You heard me!

139
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,446
Go on, you pest. Get down!

140
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,990
You shouldn't have.

141
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,120
The latest craze in Zagreb.

142
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,001
The slate indoors,
the rattle outdoors, okay?

143
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,834
Okay, dad.

144
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,408
What are you waiting for'?

145
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,911
The movie.

146
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,443
You can't Watch it in daylight.

147
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,094
Harder, harder.

148
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,333
Our people must be prepared
for anything.

149
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,607
The danger of being
thrown off-balance

150
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,170
is a constant threat.

151
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,481
Every individual must use
maximum concentration

152
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,784
and always make sure
he has control

153
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,949
over every part of his body.

154
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,722
In order to perform
his jump correctly.

155
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,735
Any hasty move

156
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,936
can lead him into
a perilous situation.

157
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:16,277
An incorrect position in flight

158
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,283
can cost an individual his life

159
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,411
or leave him maimed for life.

160
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,447
Don't swing your arms
when you Walk.

161
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,620
You can tell if someone's clever
by the Way he Walks.

162
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,046
How, Dad'?

163
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,524
The feet should be parallel.

164
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,494
Whoever twists them this Way is a fool.

165
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,625
I don't understand, Dad.

166
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,860
You will when you grow up.

167
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,835
Communists have an inborn
aesthetic sense.

168
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,427
It's a fact.

169
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:51,033
If you don't know that, you're a...

170
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,374
Fool, dolt, nitwit, dumbbell.

171
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,517
Comrades!

172
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,925
Our physical, cultural movement,

173
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,523
despite the present
anti-Yugoslavian campaign,

174
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,661
is growing stronger day by day.

175
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,899
However,

176
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,874
the attacks of Coninform
have had its effects

177
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:03,278
on the development
of physical culture.

178
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,543
In our country.

179
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:10,281
Since their resolution,
our physical culture

180
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,724
has been subject
to blatant discrimination

181
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,160
by socialite countries.

182
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,289
- Hello.
- Hi, big brother.

183
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,696
Are you taking care
of my sister?

184
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,740
No complaints.

185
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,832
- How are you'?
- Fine.

186
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:37,481
Let us welcome the first Woman

187
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,780
in this part
of the Balkan Peninsula...

188
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,192
who is going to fly
a Hawk Glider:

189
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,990
Ankica Vidmar.

190
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,362
Stop by for a drink tonight.

191
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,825
I'm busy.

192
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:03,035
She came here to help develop
our physical culture.

193
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,008
A date, eh'?

194
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,042
Yes.

195
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,751
And you're not afraid?

196
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,993
No, it doesn't take
much courage.

197
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,494
I come from a family of fliers.

198
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,506
I just love flying.

199
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,440
No doubt about it.

200
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,240
She's modest and brave.

201
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,941
A model, young Communist.

202
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,830
Witty, isn't it'?

203
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,861
Don't you think?

204
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,438
Some people wouldn't agree.

205
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,939
With What'?

206
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,669
They don't think it's witty.

207
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,139
Who doesn't think it's Witty?

208
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,714
You know him very well.

209
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,376
Who'?

210
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,977
Your own brother-in-law.

211
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,853
And what does he think?

212
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:13,931
I don't know...
That they're going too far.

213
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,365
<i>Three minutes left in the game.</i>

214
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,496
<i>Vukas passes the ball
from the left side.</i>

215
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,508
<i>Mitic gets it,
the Danish half in front of him.</i>

216
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:28,672
<i>Mific evades his opponent.</i>

217
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,078
<i>A powerful shot!</i>

218
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,878
<i>The fifth goal for our team!</i>

219
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,511
<i>Ifs 5-0, Yugoslavia!</i>

220
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,613
We showed them, Comrade Mesa.

221
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,714
- Damn good.
- Huh?

222
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,418
- Damn good.
- Damn good.

223
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,334
Come on, Muzafer, have one.

224
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,364
- Come on.
- No.

225
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,639
Mrkusic, Horvat, Stankovic,
Cajkovski, Jovanovic...

226
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,653
Dazjic, Ognajanov, Mitic,
Hocevar, Bobek, Vukas.

227
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,248
<i>Vukas broke through on the left</i>

228
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:18,660
<i>and passed to the edge
of the penalty area.</i>

229
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,496
<i>Hocevar coolly put the ball
into the net.</i>

230
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,161
<i>That made it 2-0, Yugoslavia.</i>

231
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,675
<i>In the second half,
our team played very well,</i>

232
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,178
<i>led by Mitic,
who scored three goals.</i>

233
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,748
Hello, brother-in-law.

234
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,515
Hello.

235
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,466
You scared the hell out of me.

236
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,231
Don't worry about it.

237
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,036
Sit down.

238
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:12,877
Sit down.

239
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,606
Tell me first.

240
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,815
Make yourself comfortable.

241
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,196
I've no one to inform on.

242
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,269
No, I can't.

243
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,140
Come on, drink.

244
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,407
I really can't.

245
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,869
How's the job'?

246
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,600
Traveling'?

247
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,369
Too much.

248
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,442
Twice a month.

249
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,109
Everythings okay'?

250
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,120
As far as I know.

251
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,613
And as far as you don't know?

252
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,627
- Others know?
- I'll say they do.

253
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,129
You thought things
could be kept hidden'?

254
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,530
No, it's like they say:

255
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,502
"The State Security
knows everything."

256
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,963
Sit down.

257
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:05,685
Listen, she was mine,
now she's yours. That's all.

258
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,123
We don't arrest people for screwing.

259
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,354
- What?
- You heard.

260
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,196
You mean, I'm...

261
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,707
Not yet.

262
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,936
But God, himself, Won't save you.

263

<i>“</i> DJ-Uro! _ Yes?

00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,894
I'm clean as a Whistle.

266

Zijo...

267
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,002
I'm having the children
circumcised tomorrow.

268
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,648
The old man's arranged it all.

I don't know. A mistake.

287
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,128
Get back there. They'll notice.

Beg your pardon, ladies.

292

When they circumcised me,
Mrs. Petrovic,

there was enough skin left
to make you a coat.

Well done. Congratulations.

00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,726
He's asleep.

330
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,864
Would you like to come in'?
Come in.

331
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,675
What did you bring us'?

332
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,942
My pain, that's What.

333
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,994
Can you sleep, brother?

334
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,708
You see I can, sister.

335
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,794
Well'?

336
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,623
I've been waiting
for you to tell me.

337
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,692
I thought you'd drop in.

338
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,903
You used to come
and visit your father.

339
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,548
Where is he'?

340
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,175
Why doesn't he write?

341
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,286
Listen, Sena. I'm serious.

342
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,656
He'll write when he can.

343
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:20,356
My brotherly advice is
mind your own business.

344
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,626
Don't ask anyone anything.

345
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,534
Don't even come
to see me anymore.

346
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,098
Mind the children
and your business.

347
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,147
- He's your brother-in-law.
- So what'?

348
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,018
I'm a soldier of the Party, understand?

349
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,523
Understand what I'm saying?

350
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,185
What's this'?

351
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,098
Some underwear.

352
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:01,703
He went in thin socks,
without a vest.

353
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,040
Take it home.

354
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,645
Can't you even
slip him a parcel?

355
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,228
You could when the Ustashas
caught him.

356
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,434
Leave it.

357
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,272
Take this to Malik.

358
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:52,882
<i>The ball is on the goal line.</i>

359
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,084
<i>A big chance for our team!</i>

360
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,057
Don't be an alcoholic like me.

361
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:05,601
I've made my Wife and child miserable,

362
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:10,265
And my house was sold by other...

363
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,274
other elements.

364
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,169
My life is stormy...

365
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,680
ruined.

366
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,316
Someone else killed me.

367
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,219
I'm still a man.

368
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,780
I Won't let anyone crush me.

369
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,138
What are you doing'?

370
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,842
What's it to you'?

371
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,579
Wait!

372
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,858
- It's not your money!
- It's not yours either!

373
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,862
- I earned it.
- So what?

374
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,129
- Give it back!
- Get lost!

375
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,828
Give it back.

376
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,395
I'll hit you.

377
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,974
Give it back!

378
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,176
" Get up!
- No!"

379
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:31,119
- Get up!
- No, I want a football.

380
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,883
Why are you hitting him'?

381
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,483
- What do you want'?
- What do you want'?

382
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,859
Give me the money!

383
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:00,907
We thought...

384
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,479
Fahro!

385
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,900
Is Father dead'?

386
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,172
They've taken Mesa away.

387
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,958
Look who's here.

388
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,232
Uncle!

389
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,343
Uncle!

390
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,851
- Can we go to a movie'?
- If you sleep.

391
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,289
- Go to sleep.
- Okay.

392
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,426
What movie will we see'?

393
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,467
"The Cow Jumped Over the Moon."

394
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,195
Now, go to sleep.

395
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:16,802
Look at the recruit!
Look at the recruit!

396
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,041
Recruit, Dad'?
I'm an old soldier.

397
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:24,019
Sit down, son.
Where are your wounds'?

398
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,219
I see you've had it pretty easy.

399
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,622
Come on, talk.

400
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,783
Do the kids know?

401
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,259
No.

402
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:09,132
Zijo made it look like a business trip.

403
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,657
- They even said goodbye.
- Zijo arranged it'?

404
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,331
He was here at the boys' circumcision.

405
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,274
- There was singing...
- The neighbors too'?

406
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,153
If you think you're going to waste
Natasha's time...

407
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,420
Does Zivka know about the letters?

408
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,526
I didn't tell her.

409
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,688
No one knows?

410
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,066
Everyone knows.

411
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,625
- What do they know?
- What I saw.

412
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,669
What did you see'?

413
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:52,367
A oar and two men down below.

414
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,369
Not that.
I was thinking about Natasha.

415
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,675
They shoved him in like a thief.

416
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,082
What do you think, Dad'?

417
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,157
I saw nothing. I heard nothing.

418
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,291
They were sitting here
like normal people...

419
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:21,131
and he left with Zijo
like it was a business trip.

420
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,865
Did you talk to Zijo'?

421
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:23,939
No.

422
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,607
Why not?

423
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,374
It's best just to forget about it.

424
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,651
Attention!

425
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,727
At ease.

426
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,228
Attention!

427
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,497
Right turn.

428
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,104
Forward march!

429
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,780
- Any word from your father'?
- No.

430
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,115
- Is he dead'?
- No.

431
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,347
What are you wearing?

432
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,584
Nobody wants to tell us Where he is.

433
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,558
I Wear it to spite them.

434
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:25,161
<i>Sarajevo again hosts a grand army parade.</i>

435
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,762
<i>A review of the strength of our republic.</i>

436
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,609
- What are you doing, boy'?
- Nothing.

437
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,122
Sit down! Sit down!

438
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,357
Bimbo! The spray!

439
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,563
Any film'?

440
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,404
Wait a second.

441
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:50,676
What do you do with it all'?
Eat it?

442
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,281
That's enough for this month.

443
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,386
Do you want a poster?

444
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,987
Off you go.
That'll do for this month.

445
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,239
Kiss me.

446
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,605
- Why?
- Just kiss me.

447
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,773
- What is it?
- A kiss!

448
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,173
He's alive!

449
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,919
<i>Dear Daddy,</i>

450
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:03,390
<i>We're all so glad you've written.</i>

451
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,485
<i>And that you are well,</i>

452
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:12,331
<i>but I am sorry that you have to do
voluntary work in that mine.</i>

453
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,894
<i>Fm writing this on the slate you brought me</i>

454
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:19,533
<i>and Mama will copy it out on paper for you.</i>

455
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:22,237
<i>We raised the money to visit you</i>

456
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:27,045
<i>by selling the carpet from the living room.</i>

457
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,018
<i>Only Franjo misses the carpet.</i>

458
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,646
<i>He said, "What shall I beat now?"</i>

459
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,747
<i>But later he whispered to me,</i>

460
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:38,817
<i>“I'll be beating other
carpets of Mesa 's.</i> “

461
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:43,696
<i>I gave Mama the money
Pd saved for a football.</i>

462
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,235
<i>So don? worry. We're coming.</i>

463
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:51,569
<i>You can expect us for sure on April 1st.</i>

464
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,802
<i>Lots of love, Malik.</i>

465
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,721
Everybody out!

466
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,923
Fall in! Pick up your tools!

467
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:52,399
Right face! Forward march!

468
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:38,269
- What have they done'?
- I'm just getting old.

469
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:02,092
You're not any taller or fatter.

470
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:05,464
I told you to bring Malik,
not a crybaby.

471
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,594
What are you, a girl'?

472
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,002
He's just happy to see you.

473
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,761
Well, good night.

474
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,868
What's this'?

475
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,371
He started sleepwalking.

476
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,419
I checked on him,
and he was gone.

477
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,989
- Why the bell?
- Just to be safe.

478
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,018
Have you found out Why you're here'?

479
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,728
Ask your brother.

480
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,766
I have.

481
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,436
What did he say'?

482
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:56,203
He told me to mind my own business.

483
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,907
- He married the gym teacher.
- Ankica'?

484
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:02,246
Yes, she walks around the house naked.

485
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,786
You could ask her of course.

486
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:07,584
No, you'd better not. Forget it.

487
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,791
When will they release you'?

488
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,957
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

489
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,833
- Talk about something else.
- Such as'?

490
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,340
How are things in Sarajevo?

491
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,403
Is Sarajevo still Where it used to be'?

492
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:02,334
What's Wrong?
Why aren't you asleep?

493
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,374
You're talking, but I have to be quiet.

494
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,409
Come on, close your eyes.

495
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,375
Can I come in with you'?

496
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:16,818
I'll stay with you until you fall asleep.

497
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,878
Come on, settle down.

498
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,976
Mama, why did we come here'?

499
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,743
We have to talk to this lady.

500
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,525
Good. Take a break.

501
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:54,272
How are you, young man'?
My, how you've grown!

502
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,402
Would you like some candy?

503
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,740
Come and sit over here.

504
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,084
- How are you'?
- I'm all right.

505
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,023
I went to see Mesa.

506
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:17,129
How is he'?

507
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,196
When is he coming home?

508
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,762
He told me to ask you.

509
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:30,844
Me'? How would I know'?

510
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:32,904
You don't know?

511
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,507
You do know, you whore!

512
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:08,374
You'll pay when we get home.
You know why.

513
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,655
I know.

514
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:29,588
<i>9 was very sad when Joza's dad died.</i>

515
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,428
<i>It reminded me of my dad.</i>

516
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,369
<i>But I stopped being sad
when I saw no one was crying.</i>

517
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:41,933
<i>Joza told me his daddy
hadn't actually died</i>

518
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,275
<i>and his mom told mine,</i>

519
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:48,373
<i>“My Wade's dead.
I'm sick of their lies.</i> “

520
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:53,888
<i>She said, "I'll bury him
just to spite them."</i>

521
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,789
<i>And the priest with the beard said,</i>

522
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:01,455
<i>“We'll perform the service,
but we won't record it.</i> “

523
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,067
Is anyone in the coffin?

524
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,673
<i>I know that when someone dies</i>

525
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:19,612
<i>he is no more,
but he can't just vanish.</i>

526
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:24,119
<i>When Mama told me to shut up,
I understood everything.</i>

527
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,987
<i>I didn't even know Zvornik existed,</i>

528
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:34,963
<i>till Dad sent us a letter
saying he'd finished his work at the mine</i>

529
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,863
<i>where Mom and I had visited him.</i>

530
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:43,769
<i>Mirza showed it to me on the map,</i>

531
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:48,708
<i>where they're building
a hydroelectric station.</i>

532
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,480
<i>I didn't feel like going to Zvornik,</i>

533
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:55,984
<i>sol asked Mama
why Dad couldn't come here</i>

534
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,451
<i>instead of us going there.</i>

535
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,421
<i>She said it was</i> a <i>cheaper place to live</i>

536
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,685
<i>and would give us a fresh start.</i>

537
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:07,957
<i>Grandpa said,
“They're shoving him off again.</i> “

538
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:12,023
<i>Mama said they call it “resocia/izing.</i> “

539
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,796
<i>I just kept quiet.</i>

540
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,337
<i>9 was sorry to go,</i>

541
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:20,034
<i>but glad we'd be together with Dad again.</i>

542
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:31,046
- Here, take this.
- I've got enough.

543
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,816
Take it. There are better days ahead.

544
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,823
Mesa will be angry, Hamdo.

545
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,553
Then let him send it back.

546
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,618
Right, boy'? Come on, take it.

547
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:42,220
Take it, Sena.

548
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:46,231
Give my regards to Mesa.

549
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,903
- Have you told Grandpa?
- Just a minute.

550
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,769
Dad. Come here.

551
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,205
What now'?

552
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,410
Fahrds letters.
Give them to Natasha.

553
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,381
Oh, I see.
Those two are planning to...

554
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:08,246
Oh, who's this I see'?

555
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,882
The generaPs up early.

556
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,984
Don't make fun of me.

557
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,498
Lucky you, dear girl.

558
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,868
Be a good boy now.

559
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,538
Let's get going.

560
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:34,309
Good luck, and, God Willing,
I'll come visit you.

561
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,147
I'll write as soon as We're settled.

562
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:05,773
<i>You father was buried long ago</i>

563
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:14,815
<i>Buried in the damp earth</i>

564
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:23,424
<i>Your brother went to Siberia long ago</i>

565
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:32,664
<i>Long ago, clanging in shackles</i>

566
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:40,273
<i>The Baikal vagabond went back</i>

567
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:48,349
<i>To his mother</i>

568
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:56,991
<i>Greetings, Mama</i>

569
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:05,805
<i>Are Father and Brother well?</i>

570
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:13,874
<i>Your brother went to Siberia long ago</i>

571
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:21,353
<i>Long ago, clanging in shackles</i>

572
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,891
<i>In the wild...</i>

573
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,495
- Where are you going'?
- To Zvornik.

574
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,163
The roads closed.
Wait for the ferry.

575
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,968
I drove here yesterday.

576
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,508
Ah, my friend.

577
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:45,109
Yesterday was yesterday
and today is today.

578
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,909
Got a cigarette?

579
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,167
Dad!

580
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,937
Doctor, this is my Wife.

581
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,409
This is the doctor, a great man.

582
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,474
Evgeni Alexandrovich Liakhov.

583
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,277
Your wife's lovely.

584
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,613
So what's wrong with me'?

585
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:01,816
Glad to meet you.
Welcome to Wetland.

586
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,599
You're Russian?

587
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:22,941
Yes, but I always say I'm
a native of Zvornik.

588
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:25,343
See'? I'm a Yugoslav.

589
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,247
I was just asking.

590
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:32,981
My mother, rest her soul,

591
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:37,651
like all Russian emigres,
used to say,

592
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,889
"Ubi bene, ibi patria."

593
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,864
Really?

594
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,526
Isn't it so'?

595
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,001
Yes.

596
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:03,449
You two ride inside.

597
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,486
I'll stay with the children.

598
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,751
Ride with your Wife.
She's so scared.

599
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,918
That's Why a doctor should be with her.

600
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,859
Come on. Hurry up.

601
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,581
We'll capsize, Dad.

602
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,651
No, we won't. The Drina's calm.

603
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:53,327
<i>In our new economic and social system</i>

604
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:58,999
<i>tourism has been opened up
to working people.</i>

605
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,186
Take that end.

606
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,591
Vvhafll we do with this'?

607
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:23,153
Throw it into the Drina.

608
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,461
Gentleman from Sarajevo.

609
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,765
That's right, boy from Sarajevo.

610
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,041
Get washed.

611
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,689
Dad, was your school big'?

612
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:48,814
Yes.

613
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:52,656
- What color was it'?
- Yellow.

614
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,762
- What color is my school?
- Pink.

615
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,930
Good morning.

616
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,697
You're up early, doctor.

617
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,298
Malik, this is Masa.
Shake hands.

618
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:07,807
Shake hands.

619
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:12,407
- I'm late.
- For what?

620
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,914
For work.

621
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,486
<i>We should popularize our tourism abroad.</i>

622
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:25,356
<i>It could play a much greater role
than before the War.</i>

623
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,223
Lift your arm.

624
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:32,997
That's right. Excuse me, again.

625
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,401
I can never get the Waist
right the first time.

626
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,632
What? It's fine.

627
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,706
<i>It was quite a job to
organize resin collecting,</i>

628
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,578
<i>to train the workers</i>

629
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:50,482
<i>to get the most resin</i>

630
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:56,218
<i>without impairing the quality
of the Wood.</i>

631
01:19:56,291 --> 01:20:01,319
<i>Many workers have mastered the job.</i>

632
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,365
Good bye.

633
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,371
Hello, hello.

634
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,244
How are you'?

635
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:54,976
Fine. And you'?

636
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,610
No rest during the reconstruction.

637
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:58,980
Jole, bring me a tablecloth!

638
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:00,578
Private room'?

639
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:03,715
- Your idea?
- Yes, the Union committee.

640
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,056
We'll find a room later.

641
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,686
Not bad.

642
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:13,523
We'll make a report on it.

643
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,194
Shall we knock one back'?

644
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,433
- During work hours'?
- I'll take responsibility.

645
01:22:55,403 --> 01:23:00,932
<i>I fell in love on September 2nd, 1951.</i>

646
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:05,378
<i>That day, we beat Sweden 2-1.</i>

647
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,939
<i>The goals were scored
by Bobek and Ognajanov.</i>

648
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:13,716
<i>9 love doing homework with Mesa.</i>

649
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,586
<i>I would love it to last forever.</i>

650
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:20,719
<i>Not the homework...
I hardly know what I'm writing...</i>

651
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:24,060
<i>But to rest my head on her shoulder.</i>

652
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:29,429
<i>I make a move,
my heart starts beating wildly.</i>

653
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:34,339
<i>I quickly put on a straight face
and go on writing.</i>

654
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:38,072
<i>If she noticed something,
Pd be embarrassed.</i>

655
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:55,623
Get Daddy.

656
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,701
Doctor! Doctor!

657
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,169
Quick!

658
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:18,709
Mesa!

659
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:24,591
Hello, Doctor.

660
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:27,261
Come on up.

661
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:33,322
Come and have a drink with us.

662
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,097
I can't Ostoja. I'm in a hurry.

663
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,176
Have a drink.

664
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,181
I'd rather get going.

665
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,050
Micko, is the car ready?

666
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,610
Ready an hour ago.

667
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,679
- She hasn't a chance.
- The girl'?

668
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:27,710
They're changing her blood.
She Won't last long.

669
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,051
Why him'?

670
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,555
It serves him right,
having a child at 50.

671
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,727
He lost his country.
Let him at least have a child.

672
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,130
- You know what?
- What?

673
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,463
You're a bullshitter.

674
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,302
I just thought...

675
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:48,468
If you'd been thinking,
you wouldn't be here.

676
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:18,464
I never heard of any boss
who does the purchasing.

677
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:21,737
Neither did I, but this one does.

678
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:26,613
He does.

679
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:31,176
You think I'd give money to those fools'?

680
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:35,053
Don't lose your hanky.

681
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:39,951
What does it say here'?

682
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,395
Just read it.
Is that whoring around'?

683
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:47,263
Three oases of rum, 70 kilos of lamb,

684
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:48,893
500 eggs.

685
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,598
Is that whoring around'?

686
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:54,799
Yes, it is.

687
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,710
All of Zvornik goes whoring at Koviljaca.

688
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,510
Malik, get ready!
You're going with me.

689
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:09,788
If you don't believe me, ask your son.

690
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:15,890
<i>Three vvhoremongers
three vvhoremongers.</i> ..

691
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:27,166
- Don't tip us over.
- I Won't.

692
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,403
Just drive. We'll do the singing.

693
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,623
He was only joking.

694
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:19,105
All's well that ends well, right'?

695
01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:50,027
Comrade Mesa!

696
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:56,097
Malik's gone, Comrade Mesa!

697
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,776
Malik's gone.

698
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:22,251
- What's all the shouting?
- Malik's gone.

699
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,592
Find him, you idiot!

700
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,903
Where's my son, you half-Wit'?

701
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,531
- I fell asleep.
- You fell asleep!

702
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,239
How did it happen'?

703
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:40,542
I just turned around and he was gone.

704
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:15,734
Nothing stops you, does it'?

705
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:17,395
I'd never go whoring with Micko.

706
01:36:17,471 --> 01:36:20,065
Yes, you would.
He's no different.

707
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:22,541
He'd sell out his own mother.

708
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,170
Don't play the saint,
you bastard!

709
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:29,277
Do you take me for a fool'?

710
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:32,547
Cekic was with you.
Micko Won't give you away.

711
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:43,990
Here, see'? No hanky!

712
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:48,160
You can't lie to me anymore, damn you!

713
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:50,226
Don't go through my pockets.

714
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:52,670
What have hankies got to do with it'?

715
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:53,740
Shut up.

716
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:56,800
Did I spend two years crying for this'?

717
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:59,471
Did I leave my job for this'?

718
01:37:02,383 --> 01:37:06,979
I sew like mad to give us a decent life...

719
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:08,783
a normal life.

720
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:11,957
And for who'?

721
01:37:12,026 --> 01:37:15,518
For a shameless whore-chaser and a drunk.

722
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:21,697
What's happening to me'?

723
01:37:23,404 --> 01:37:25,929
What have I done to deserve this'?

724
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:32,069
It'd be better if you hadn't been
released from jail.

725
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:34,307
Shut up, you bitch.

726
01:37:34,381 --> 01:37:37,248
You should've killed yourself like Vladol

727
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:41,953
- Shut up, bitch.
- You scum!

728
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:44,354
Fuck you!

729
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:47,223
Screw you!

730
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:48,962
Leave me alone!

731
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,691
Leave Vlado out of this!

732
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,898
Shut up, you dumb bitch!

733
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:04,235
Leave Vlado out of this!

734
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:30,906
Take them off.

735
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:38,444
You'll get them wet,
and you'll have to wear mine.

736
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:11,541
My friend Joza can put a stone in it.

737
01:43:18,225 --> 01:43:19,658
I can't.

738
01:43:21,962 --> 01:43:24,021
My <i>amid/a</i> circumcised me.

739
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:25,587
I know.

740
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,866
Jews do it, too.

741
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:34,503
What's an amid/a?

742
01:43:34,575 --> 01:43:36,406
He's my dad's brother. A barber.

743
01:43:36,476 --> 01:43:40,003
A doctor can do it, too.
It's all the same.

744
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,638
It's not.

745
01:43:42,749 --> 01:43:45,582
It's better if a doctor does it.

746
01:43:58,332 --> 01:44:01,392
<i>To reward me for my excellent grades,</i>

747
01:44:01,468 --> 01:44:04,631
<i>Dad took me to a bakery and said,</i>

748
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:06,502
<i>“Order what you like.</i> “

749
01:44:06,573 --> 01:44:11,408
<i>9 had four pies and was almost sick.</i>

750
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:13,639
<i>Dad laughed and said,</i>

751
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:17,206
<i>“You see, it doesn't pay to be excellent.“</i>

752
01:44:17,284 --> 01:44:21,414
<i>9 knew he was only joking.</i>

753
01:44:21,488 --> 01:44:24,753
<i>When 9 told him 9 was picked</i>

754
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:28,625
<i>to hand the Pioneers' Baton
to the mayor,</i>

755
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:31,061
<i>Dad stopped joking.</i>

756
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:34,567
<i>He stopped going on purchasing trips.</i>

757
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:37,570
<i>He kept pacing around the house, repeating,</i>

758
01:44:37,638 --> 01:44:41,540
<i>"I hope to Goo' he doesn't mess it up.</i> ”

759
01:44:43,543 --> 01:44:45,511
Dear Mayor,

760
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:50,846
I present to you this baton
with a thousand greetings from Zvornik...

761
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:53,215
with a thousand cordial greetings
from Zvornik.

762
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:54,777
Louder.

763
01:44:54,855 --> 01:44:56,914
Dear Mayor,

764
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:03,088
I present to you this baton
with a thousand cordial greetings.

765
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:06,155
Is your son a bit...'?

766
01:45:06,233 --> 01:45:10,897
No, he's not.
He's going to present the baton.

767
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:14,338
The Pioneers of Zvornik vow again

768
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:16,740
to study and work diligently

769
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,678
and acquire new knowledge.

770
01:45:20,747 --> 01:45:22,442
New knowledge...

771
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:26,517
For the benefit and prosperity of our...

772
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:28,611
Our...

773
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:30,850
socialist community

774
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:33,791
and keep Walking

775
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,760
on the...

776
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:39,424
On the revolutionary path.

777
01:45:40,033 --> 01:45:41,762
Path...

778
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:46,431
that our nation is following...

779
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:51,107
led by Comrade Tito

780
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:53,703
and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.

781
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:58,012
Good. More tomorrow.
Now, off to bed.

782
01:45:58,085 --> 01:45:59,552
Take it off.

783
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:02,515
When's the fitting?

784
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:04,921
Right after the holidays.

785
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:14,233
Tomorrow, when you're with the mayor,

786
01:46:15,235 --> 01:46:19,296
the words should roll off your tongue.

787
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:23,036
And don't start fidgeting.

788
01:46:23,744 --> 01:46:27,976
When you run up to him, stand proudly.

789
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,642
Don't be shy.

790
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:34,244
Let your gestures suit your words.

791
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:40,924
But don't overdo it.

792
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:43,155
- You know'?
- I know, Dad.

793
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:45,122
Go to sleep.

794
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:58,128
Dear Mayor,

795
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:03,572
I present to you this baton...

796
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:06,578
Mesa, let's go play a game of chess.

797
01:48:07,914 --> 01:48:10,542
Don't be provocative, Cekic.

798
01:48:10,617 --> 01:48:12,949
What would Nikola say if he heard you'?

799
01:48:13,019 --> 01:48:15,510
You'd go if it weren't for your son.

800
01:48:15,589 --> 01:48:18,285
Let me hear him.

801
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:36,304
We, the Pioneers of Zvornik
vow again to diligently...

802
01:48:39,446 --> 01:48:41,880
study and work...

803
01:48:43,049 --> 01:48:46,644
and acquire new knowledge...

804
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:50,482
and keep Walking on the path...

805
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:51,785
followed by...

806
01:48:54,794 --> 01:48:56,386
Tito...

807
01:48:57,731 --> 01:48:59,665
led by the Party.

808
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:13,838
Comrades,

809
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:16,781
today, on this festive day,

810
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:20,081
the people of our district

811
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:23,020
join in a day of great national joy.

812
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:27,788
We have gathered here
to welcome the baton

813
01:49:27,861 --> 01:49:30,091
through which the people of Bosnia

814
01:49:30,163 --> 01:49:35,897
send their love to their greatest teacher.

815
01:50:17,844 --> 01:50:20,210
It was the pin, Dad.

816
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:28,947
The pin's to blame for everything.

817
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:31,654
What pin'?

818
01:50:35,328 --> 01:50:37,523
It slipped out.

819
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:47,265
- Shall I repeat it for you'?
- No.

820
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:55,442
Will you be my little Communist?

821
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:04,918
Comrade Cekic wants you to come at once.

822
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:12,061
Who wrote this speech?

823
01:51:13,466 --> 01:51:15,957
You know very well who wrote it.

824
01:51:18,905 --> 01:51:22,136
You didn't, by chance, change anything?

825
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:24,403
Do you think I'm crazy?

826
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:29,344
Is the Party leading Tito
or Tito the Party'?

827
01:51:29,416 --> 01:51:31,247
It makes no difference.

828
01:51:36,456 --> 01:51:39,823
But how would you put it'?

829
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:43,855
I believe it makes no difference.

830
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:47,496
The Party teaches us...

831
01:51:50,403 --> 01:51:52,997
Tito is the Party,

832
01:51:53,073 --> 01:51:55,041
the party is Tito

833
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:57,099
and Tito is all of us.

834
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:01,772
Sounds great.
Would you like a drink'?

835
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,545
I've got this French shit.

836
01:52:21,267 --> 01:52:24,464
Well, brother, congratulations.

837
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:28,340
Are you making fun of me, Cekic'?

838
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:33,273
Congratulations for what?

839
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:36,441
Your Zvornik mandate has expired.

840
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:41,850
- It's over.
- Over.

841
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:45,652
You can go to Sarajevo
or wherever you like.

842
01:52:55,168 --> 01:52:56,931
Calm down.

843
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:00,428
Sit down.

844
01:53:02,175 --> 01:53:04,643
You'll play one last game with me.

845
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,680
Masai

846
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:53,354
I knew you'd come.

847
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:56,318
I brought the bell.

848
01:54:19,986 --> 01:54:22,318
But you mustn't read it here.

849
01:54:25,091 --> 01:54:26,683
Why, Mesa'?

850
01:54:26,759 --> 01:54:29,421
You mustn't, that's all.
Do you promise?

851
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:32,824
Whatever you say.

852
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:35,899
Say, "I promise."

853
01:54:39,138 --> 01:54:40,901
Now you're crying.

854
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:44,966
How do you know'?

855
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:49,610
Sometimes I know everything.
Your mom cries too.

856
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:51,912
Yes, she does.

857
01:54:51,985 --> 01:54:54,215
She shouldn't.

858
01:54:54,287 --> 01:54:56,755
That's what I keep telling her.

859
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:02,018
Give me your hand.

860
01:55:08,167 --> 01:55:09,634
Do you love me'?

861
01:55:12,338 --> 01:55:14,636
More than anyone in the world.

862
01:55:15,608 --> 01:55:17,439
More than myself.

863
01:55:34,294 --> 01:55:35,921
Stand back, son.

864
01:55:41,567 --> 01:55:44,092
<i>Masa never came back.</i>

865
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:47,537
<i>The doctor came to our house</i>

866
01:55:47,607 --> 01:55:50,735
<i>wearing a black armband
on his White coat.</i>

867
01:55:50,810 --> 01:55:54,246
<i>9 was under the quilt and 9 heard</i>

868
01:55:54,314 --> 01:55:57,875
<i>the doctor say to Mama in Russian,</i>

869
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:01,478
<i>“Sister, what's the point of life?</i> “

870
01:56:31,284 --> 01:56:33,514
Thank God your troubles are over.

871
01:56:35,722 --> 01:56:38,987
What do you expect from a democracy?

872
01:56:39,058 --> 01:56:42,516
Don't talk about democracy.
The coffers are empty.

873
01:56:47,333 --> 01:56:50,097
Don't worry. We'll make money.

874
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:52,433
We'll print our own.

875
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:55,133
Money has nothing to do with democracy.

876
01:56:55,208 --> 01:56:57,403
Some politician you are.

877
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:01,771
Everything on Earth has to do with money.

878
01:57:02,548 --> 01:57:04,448
I'm telling you,

879
01:57:04,517 --> 01:57:08,715
if the coffers are empty,
there's no democracy.

880
01:57:32,912 --> 01:57:34,174
What's that?

881
01:57:37,984 --> 01:57:40,043
What about your uncle?

882
01:58:40,313 --> 01:58:42,144
Have you forgiven me'?

883
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:49,316
I can forget. But forgive...

884
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:01,689
Why did you invite me then?

885
01:59:02,802 --> 01:59:04,667
To talk, like two adults.

886
01:59:06,772 --> 01:59:09,206
Do you still think the same'?

887
01:59:12,411 --> 01:59:14,174
About what?

888
01:59:16,382 --> 01:59:18,145
That I was guilty?

889
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:23,782
What I think doesn't matter anymore.

890
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:31,827
It did then.

891
01:59:33,232 --> 01:59:37,532
Did you put me away for my words
or my thoughts?

892
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:41,039
- I didn't put you away.
- So who did'?

893
01:59:41,107 --> 01:59:42,870
Your own tongue.

894
01:59:42,942 --> 01:59:46,241
My own brother-in-law did.

895
01:59:46,879 --> 01:59:50,576
During that craziness,
it was brother against brother.

896
01:59:58,824 --> 02:00:01,952
You should make up with your sister.

897
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:04,496
She's your flesh and blood.

898
02:00:06,299 --> 02:00:09,826
- The Pope's drinking'?
- Indeed he is!

899
02:00:25,184 --> 02:00:26,947
Come over here.

900
02:00:27,019 --> 02:00:28,919
- What'?
- Sit down.

901
02:00:28,988 --> 02:00:30,853
Why'? I'm busy.

902
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:37,862
- What?
- You go outside.

903
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:40,592
Sit beside Zijo

904
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:44,796
and talk to him as if nothing happened.

905
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,360
Never.

906
02:00:47,673 --> 02:00:50,198
You'll do as I say.

907
02:00:50,276 --> 02:00:52,141
Never, Mesa.

908
02:00:53,279 --> 02:00:54,837
Don't make me angry.

909
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:56,814
I'll die first.

910
02:01:56,609 --> 02:01:59,043
Can't you sleep, brother?

911
02:01:59,912 --> 02:02:01,504
Not well, sister.

912
02:02:05,851 --> 02:02:07,842
Where are the parcels?

913
02:02:09,789 --> 02:02:11,381
In the pantry.

914
02:02:13,025 --> 02:02:14,424
Ask Ankica.

915
02:02:17,496 --> 02:02:19,760
So, you're not sleeping well, brother'?

916
02:02:22,368 --> 02:02:24,393
Hardly at all, sister.

917
02:02:25,771 --> 02:02:27,932
What do the doctors say'?

918
02:02:29,442 --> 02:02:32,570
That you can live to 100 with diabetes.

919
02:02:51,564 --> 02:02:53,327
Does the brandy help?

920
02:02:56,335 --> 02:02:57,427
Temporarily.

921
02:03:01,073 --> 02:03:03,041
It's not easy for you.

922
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:07,301
I understand you perfectly.

923
02:05:12,705 --> 02:05:16,368
Oh, Zijo, you and your fucking brandy.

924
02:05:17,443 --> 02:05:20,276
Why don't you out yourself up

925
02:05:20,346 --> 02:05:23,076
at your own wedding?

926
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:56,039
Mirza, come here.

927
02:06:00,185 --> 02:06:02,483
My suitcase is in the pantry.

928
02:06:03,522 --> 02:06:06,491
Go take it down for me.

929
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:08,891
Are you going somewhere?

930
02:06:08,961 --> 02:06:12,556
Just take it down and wait for me.

931
02:06:16,001 --> 02:06:20,938
<i>The game against the Soviet Union
has begun...</i>

932
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:37,411
It wasn't my fault, Mesa.

933
02:06:37,489 --> 02:06:40,014
I just said you said,

934
02:06:40,092 --> 02:06:42,993
"Who loves anybody in this madhouse."

935
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:57,575
I didn't know he'd arrest you,
his own brother-in-law.

936
02:07:03,048 --> 02:07:04,675
I just said...

937
02:07:06,685 --> 02:07:10,519
that you said that cartoon was overdone.

938
02:07:24,203 --> 02:07:26,398
I love you, Mesa.

939
02:07:32,044 --> 02:07:35,411
I couldn't Wait for you, Mesa.

940
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:13,542
Why are you crying?

941
02:09:15,714 --> 02:09:17,272
I don't know.

942
02:09:22,187 --> 02:09:24,587
All I need is you crying

943
02:09:24,656 --> 02:09:26,886
and I'll give birth right here.

944
02:11:42,594 --> 02:11:45,995
<i>My grandfather Muzafer left our house</i>

945
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:50,433
<i>for a nursing home on July 22, 1952.</i>

946
02:11:50,502 --> 02:11:53,198
<i>I don? know if it was because</i>

947
02:11:53,272 --> 02:11:56,400
<i>he wouldn't bathe or some other reason.</i>

948
02:11:56,475 --> 02:11:58,841
<i>9 only know he told Mirza,</i>

949
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:04,281
<i>"Tell them I said I'm sick and tired
of their politics."</i>

950
02:12:04,349 --> 02:12:07,113
<i>I'm too old for that crap.</i> “

951
02:12:07,185 --> 02:12:12,953
<i>"And he added," If you want to visit,
Travnik isn't very far.</i>

952
02:12:13,025 --> 02:12:16,256
<i>It's all over! We've Won!</i>

953
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:20,128
<i>In its second attempt,
the Yugoslav team</i>

954
02:12:20,198 --> 02:12:22,223
<i>has succeeded in qualifying</i>

955
02:12:22,301 --> 02:12:26,169
<i>for the quarter-finals
of the Olympic competition.</i>

956
02:12:26,238 --> 02:12:29,765
<i>Two days ago, we tied the Russians 5-5,</i>

957
02:12:29,841 --> 02:12:33,607
<i>but today we surpassed them
in every aspect.</i>

958
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:36,671
<i>A richly deserved 3-1 victory.</i>

959
02:12:36,748 --> 02:12:42,584
<i>Those names will be forever remembered
in the history of Yugoslav sport.</i>

960
02:12:42,654 --> 02:12:45,714
<i>Beara, Stankovic, Crnkovic,
Cajkovski, Horvat,</i>
