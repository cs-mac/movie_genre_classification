1
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,930
<i>If you should walk down
to the waterfront</i>

2
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:18,665
<i>in the coastal town of Braddock
in the state of North Carolina,</i>

3
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,141
<i>you'd probably hear a story
told about one of the skippers</i>

4
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:25,077
<i>in the fishing fleet
that makes this port its home...</i>

5
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:29,380
<i>for this skipper is a woman...
a strange, gaunt woman...</i>

6
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:32,147
<i>and you can tell
even at first glance</i>

7
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,654
<i>that she is living
somewhere in the past,</i>

8
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,386
<i>as if even now, she were
suffering in atonement</i>

9
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,088
<i>for all the tragic consequences
of her willful acts.</i>

10
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:45,066
<i>There was a time when
Ruby was beautiful and alive,</i>

11
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,967
<i>and I believe it was
this spirit of life and love</i>

12
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:50,370
<i>that caused so much
envy and resentment</i>

13
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:52,305
<i>to be voiced against her
by the narrow,</i>

14
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,844
<i>class-conscious citizens
of our town.</i>

15
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:58,006
<i>For Ruby was born on
the wrong side of the tracks,</i>

16
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,051
<i>and though she struggled valiantly
to overcome this stigma,</i>

17
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,144
<i>the townspeople
never let her forget it.</i>

18
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:09,924
<i>I'd been in Braddock over a year
and was still an outsider.</i>

19
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:12,656
<i>They called me
the new Yankee doctor.</i>

20
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:16,031
<i>And then I met Jim Gentry,
Braddock's richest man.</i>

21
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,763
<i>Jim's wife was an invalid.</i>

22
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:20,635
<i>I guess he'd tried 50 doctors
before he got to me.</i>

23
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:25,541
<i>And somehow, right away,
Jim Gentry and I became friends.</i>

24
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:27,203
<i>On that bright
September evening,</i>

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,043
<i>Jim was taking me out
to a hunting party</i>

26
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,776
<i>at Jud Corey's hunting lodge.</i>

27
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,012
<i>To a young
and ambitious doctor,</i>

28
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,714
<i>that should have been
the main thing on my mind.</i>

29
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,848
<i>But strangely enough,
it wasn't.</i>

30
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,447
Does Jud's daughter
live at the lodge?

31
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,894
Oh? You know Ruby?

32
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,727
Well, no, I've seen her in town.

33
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,199
You couldn't miss seeing Ruby
if she's anywhere above the horizon.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,568
Trouble was, I couldn't figure
any way to meet her.

35
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,267
This is gonna be a mighty
lively hunting party

36
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,468
with you all set to launch
a campaign for Ruby,

37
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,843
and Boake Tackman
just home from South America.

38
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:03,640
Ruby used to be
real gone on him.

39
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,660
Sounds like they've
already got a head start

40
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:23,672
on Jud's sour mash whiskey.

41
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,582
Don't let it shake you, Doc.
It's just anatomy.

42
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:40,112
I never saw anything
like it in dissection lab.

43
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:51,027
Oh, Jim, it's you.

44
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:54,594
Don't butter me, honey.
I know you're disappointed.

45
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,165
You're blushing, sugar puss.

46
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:00,767
Mr. Ginter sent your gun.

47
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:03,441
Oh, boy... finished it real soon.

48
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,110
Ginter's usually slow as tar.

49
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:08,746
This gun's a
hand-me-down from Pop.

50
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:11,688
I had Ginter make me
this new stock.

51
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,056
Oh, Ruby, this is Dr. Manfred.

52
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:17,961
Only he'll like it better
if you call him Saul.

53
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:20,465
- Hello there, Saul.
- Hello.

54
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:23,332
Saul took one look
at you and got that... look...

55
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:25,304
that glazed codfish stare.

56
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:26,930
I told him it was just anatomy.

57
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:30,107
- And what did he say?
- Oh, nothing much.

58
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:31,644
It was all good, Ruby.

59
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,805
He thinks you're cuter
than a speckled pup.

60
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,749
Here, Mrs. Gentry
sent you some sachets.

61
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,152
Oh, bless her heart.

62
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:42,713
- How is she?
- Oh, about the same.

63
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,690
Sachets!

64
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,097
Did you ever!

65
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,897
My wife set her heart
on making a lady of Ruby.

66
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,699
She didn't hold with the saying

67
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:58,468
about making a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

68
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,372
Honey, if you're a sow's ear...

69
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:03,004
When you come
right down to it,

70
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,274
what would anybody want
with a silk purse, huh?

71
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,645
Mr. Gentry, sir!

72
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,378
We've been expecting you.

73
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:10,147
- This is Dr. Manfred, Jud.
- How do, Doctor?

74
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,984
- Hello, Jud.
- You're real welcome.

75
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:14,149
Leave those things right there.
I'll take care of them.

76
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:15,886
Come in, come in.

77
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,721
Jewel!

78
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,889
Yeah, Pa?

79
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,093
Fetch those things
off the porch.

80
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,965
- Corner room suit you.
- Fine. Hello, Jewel.

81
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:27,198
I have to put you in
one of the rooms outside,

82
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:29,137
but it'll save you five dollars.

83
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:30,367
Ma Corey!

84
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:34,139
Best cook in Carolina, Saul...
her food's pure sin.

85
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:35,338
Hello, Ma.

86
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:36,711
Get some glasses and ice.

87
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,147
Tell Jewel to bring in
some more liquor.

88
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:41,084
Gentlemen, this is Dr. Manfred.

89
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,281
Doc, the big moose
is Clyde Pratt.

90
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:44,880
- Hi, Doc.
- Neil Fallgren over here.

91
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:45,947
And Cullen McAuliffe.

92
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:49,825
Any money you put in Cullen's bank, you can
kiss good-bye.

93
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,228
Jim's been doing a lot
of bragging about you, Doctor.

94
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:53,357
Oh, that's real nice.

95
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,698
I want you to see this stock
Ruby's got on her thirty-thirty.

96
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,327
Isn't that a dandy?

97
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:59,872
Burled walnut... a beautiful
hunk of wood, Ruby.

98
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,842
I got it off the gatepost
at the old Tackman plantation.

99
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:05,776
I figured finders keepers.

100
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:08,406
Must be the only thing out there
that isn't underwater.

101
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,507
Why, I'd give my
eye teeth for this stock.

102
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,618
- Looks like everybody's here.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,917
Go ahead, Dad.
I'll take the rest of this stuff.

104
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,394
All right.

105
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:37,913
Ruby?

106
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,017
Where are you?

107
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,223
Hi, stranger.

108
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,561
You look just about
the same to me.

109
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,795
You have me at a disadvantage.

110
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:01,669
I can't see what you look like.

111
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:04,975
But I can imagine.

112
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,945
Give me that light.

113
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,606
Let's see what
I've been missing.

114
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,617
- Keep away.
- You grown any?

115
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:19,118
I'll bet you filled out some.

116
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:20,489
Keep your hands off.

117
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:23,423
Keep your hands off me.

118
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,465
You little devil!

119
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,504
That's what Boake tells me,
especially when he uses

120
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,134
a bullet developed by Brenneke.

121
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:40,806
That's that ballistic man
from Leipzig, Germany.

122
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,371
That's right.

123
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,386
Here's our guest of honor!

124
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:49,390
- How are you?
- Just like old times.

125
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,154
Jud's been telling me some
grand things about you, Boake.

126
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,024
Somebody get Boake a drink.

127
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:56,155
- Let's see that cartridge belt.
- I got that in Brazil.

128
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:57,755
Dr. Manfred, Boake Tackman.

129
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:58,925
- How are you, Boake?
- Doctor.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,297
Home for good
or just visiting?

131
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:03,533
I'm home for good this time.
I'm going to trump on your heels.

132
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:05,074
Got yourself some notion?

133
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,472
Real harebrained one.

134
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:08,976
Claims he's gonna drain
our old plantation.

135
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,706
Well, why not?

136
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,749
Wet or dry,
it's not worth a nickel.

137
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,976
- It's full of salt.
- Salt's no problem.

138
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:17,850
300 acres of bottom land
is a fair start.

139
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,012
That's more than you had.

140
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,182
I started out with
two hands and a tough hide.

141
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:22,316
Gonna raise cotton?

142
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:25,725
I'm gonna produce quick cash crops,
produce I can ship north,

143
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,423
because the plantation's
only the beginning.

144
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:31,366
Like you started out
repairing tin lizzies.

145
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:35,304
You got too much energy
for a Carolina boy.

146
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:37,637
Wears me out
just listening to you.

147
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:42,075
In South America, did those
señoritas stir up your bloodstream?

148
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,582
Yeah, how about it, Boake?

149
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,084
I hear they're real hospitable.

150
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:50,782
I can't say they exactly
cold-shouldered me.

151
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,420
Dinner! Dinner!
Come on!

152
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,485
But I never found
one of them who could cook.

153
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,030
That's why I came home.

154
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:04,726
I saw a lot of it
in South America, Dad.

155
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:07,397
After they drain the swamps,
they plow in chemicals.

156
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:10,273
You can't eat this rich food
without whiskey to cut it.

157
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:11,709
Nitrates.

158
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,076
I've been shipping
plenty to Panama.

159
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:16,514
I figure I'm getting it from you.

160
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:18,381
Might have to get
some of it on credit.

161
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,715
I suppose we can
work that out.

162
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:23,154
Jim starts out by selling you
something on credit,

163
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,249
and before you know it,

164
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,590
you're running another
Gentry enterprise.

165
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:28,357
Mmm. Smell that.

166
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,556
Ma turns out
the best there is.

167
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,327
No doubt about it.

168
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,972
First time I've seen you
waiting on a table, Ruby.

169
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:43,501
Maybe the last time,
so take a real good look.

170
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,673
I do that anyhow.

171
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:48,273
Ma said it was time she was
learning to do a woman's work.

172
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:50,114
And maybe you'll sell me
your thirty-thirty.

173
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:51,517
You got no more use for it.

174
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:55,319
Don't you just wish?
It's bagging me a deer tomorrow.

175
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,129
Dad doesn't seem to think
this plan's gonna work, though, Jim.

176
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:01,494
I can't sell him on it.

177
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,658
I raised Ruby
like she was a boy.

178
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:06,465
Something sure must have
got out of hand.

179
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:08,937
Look at her, except for
those pants she wears.

180
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,496
Hear that, sugar?

181
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,907
Mr. Pratt wants you
all over fluffs.

182
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,139
Boake's got
a sound enough plan.

183
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,046
Once the land's drained,
he'll have collateral.

184
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:20,312
But he'll need capital to buy
the pumps and equipment.

185
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,286
Boake's already talked to Cullen
about getting a loan from the bank.

186
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:26,052
Oh, he did.
Cullen go for your notion?

187
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:27,182
He seems to.

188
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,421
He said to drop in
any time next week.

189
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,894
We could talk
the whole plan over.

190
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,297
- You little...
- Trying to brand him, Ruby?

191
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,996
Sprinkle some hair on her
and she'd pass for a bobcat!

192
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,595
- Ruby!
- I'm in your corner, Ruby!

193
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,141
Ruby! What's going on?

194
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,941
Huh? Nothing, Pop.

195
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:52,016
You're chasing after
Boake Tackman again, ain't you?

196
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,576
Inviting damnation
for your soul.

197
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:57,420
- Dry up.
- Hell leave you flat!

198
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,959
Same as before.

199
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,154
I learned a few things
in five years.

200
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:03,163
Don't you think
he's learned plenty, too?

201
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:04,698
He ain't no kid no more,

202
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:08,203
and he won't be satisfied
just holding hands.

203
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,998
That's my business.

204
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,743
You're courtin' hellfire!

205
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:20,204
- Hire yourself a church!
- You watch your tongue, missy!

206
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:23,217
You're leaving the hour
of reckoning out of your judgment...

207
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:27,414
then the wicked shall be judged
for the sins of the flesh...

208
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:30,555
and condemned to eternal
and everlasting fire.

209
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:40,636
Don't let him
rile you, honey.

210
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:43,105
Can't you leave
those things?

211
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,665
Come and sit down
and talk to Jim and me.

212
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:50,078
No... Pop's getting you up
before daylight.

213
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:53,311
- You'd better get some sleep.
- We'll turn in pretty soon.

214
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:00,647
So far, I'm not doing too well.

215
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:03,884
No woman like her.

216
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:08,189
One minute
fighting, scratching,

217
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,964
next minute, she's as sweet
and soft as any woman alive.

218
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:17,735
Guess I like her wild side best.

219
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,677
Can't help being glad that
Lettie didn't really tame her.

220
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:24,514
You didn't know... Ruby lived with
Lettie and me for a couple of years.

221
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:25,984
When was that?

222
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,954
While she was
going to high school.

223
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,926
Should have seen her the day
Jud brought her over to the house.

224
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:34,551
<i>She was nearly 16...</i>

225
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,861
<i>Thin, wild, all eyes.</i>

226
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:42,527
<i>Jud thought I was a good enough
friend to come to in time of trouble.</i>

227
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:44,595
<i>That pleased me.</i>

228
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:47,140
<i>There had been a beach party
given the night before</i>

229
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,607
<i>for the high school
football team.</i>

230
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:50,769
<i>Boake was the
star fullback on the team,</i>

231
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:53,041
<i>and one of the most popular
young men in the county,</i>

232
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:54,980
<i>which is why, I suppose,
he always seemed to think that</i>

233
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,643
<i>Ruby should be his
for the asking.</i>

234
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,779
<i>But Ruby resented his
taking her for granted,</i>

235
00:12:58,855 --> 00:13:01,152
<i>and so that night,
when he tried to get fresh with her,</i>

236
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,317
<i>she jabbed him
with her oyster knife.</i>

237
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:22,200
<i>Even though she never let on,
Ruby was scared.</i>

238
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,078
<i>She knew somehow
that she was in real trouble.</i>

239
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:41,991
<i>Then, when Ruby suddenly
appeared in Lettie's bedroom door,</i>

240
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,535
<i>Lettie was surprised.</i>

241
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,867
<i>She called Ruby
over to her bed...</i>

242
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,767
<i>... and Ruby told her
the whole story.</i>

243
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:52,970
<i>How she was glad she'd hurt
Boake because he deserved it,</i>

244
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,037
<i>but she was sorry
she'd hurt him so bad,</i>

245
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:59,415
<i>and, well, Lettie
was shocked down to her toes,</i>

246
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,284
<i>deeply concerned for Ruby.</i>

247
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,585
<i>She rang the emergency bell
while she told Ruby</i>

248
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:04,681
<i>that everything
would be all right.</i>

249
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,453
<i>I came pounding in
to Lettie's room,</i>

250
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,552
<i>afraid that something
had happened to her.</i>

251
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:14,131
<i>She said Ruby
was gonna stay with us,</i>

252
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:15,794
<i>and no ifs or buts,</i>

253
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:19,034
<i>so she could have protection
and care a young girl needs.</i>

254
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:20,631
<i>Not having any
children of her own,</i>

255
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,939
<i>Lettie set even
greater store by Ruby.</i>

256
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:27,141
<i>Taught her how to dress,
how to act toward the servants,</i>

257
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:29,513
<i>how to manage a big house,</i>

258
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:31,883
taught her all sorts of nonsense.

259
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,388
Then Ruby finished high school,
and Jud needed help,

260
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:38,018
so he fetched her back to this.

261
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:41,122
So maybe we weren't
as kind as we meant to be...

262
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:42,892
training her for a life
she can't have.

263
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,835
You see... Ruby doesn't belong.

264
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:48,930
You mean socially?

265
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:51,999
She's from the
wrong side of the tracks.

266
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,067
You mean to say
in this day and age...

267
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,702
You're forgetting
where you are, Doctor.

268
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,271
- But that's absurd!
- It's worse than that.

269
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,978
These fools are so
full of pride about who they are,

270
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,924
about their
fine old family names,

271
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:11,257
so blind with conceit over nothing,
they can't see what she is!

272
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,853
How wonderful...

273
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,466
She is indeed.

274
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,831
Good night, Doctor.

275
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:24,274
Good night, Jim.

276
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:41,489
- Ruby.
- Go away, Boake. I mean it.

277
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:42,790
I'll bet.

278
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:46,093
I saw how you looked at me.

279
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,656
When?

280
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:51,228
Before you turned wildcat
and marked me up.

281
00:15:55,143 --> 00:16:00,011
If your face hurts, there's some
stuff in Pop's medicine box.

282
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,879
Go away, Boake.

283
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,046
Ruby, who'll you be
hunting with tomorrow?

284
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:10,024
Hmm? The doctor, I suppose.

285
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,152
Take him up toward the ridge.

286
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:16,927
When you get him
to our place, get rid of him.

287
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,193
Ruby? Will you?

288
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,067
Maybe.

289
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,905
Maybe I will...

290
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,106
...maybe I won't.

291
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:36,379
Ruby...

292
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,491
Hold it!

293
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:49,965
Always put your gun through
ahead of you.

294
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,525
Oh, thanks.

295
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,195
The other way,
you're liable to get shot.

296
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:56,706
Just a second.

297
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,843
You sorry you're stuck
with a greenhorn?

298
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:03,381
Pop always pairs off
experienced hunters

299
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,144
with the ones
who are raw at it.

300
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,708
You'll catch on.

301
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,390
That's the trail
to the swamp.

302
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:19,756
Good place
if we were after birds.

303
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,631
They come there to feed.

304
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,228
But you want to shoot them when
they're flying toward high ground.

305
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:25,329
Why is that?

306
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:28,034
Try getting a bird
out of that muck, it'll swallow you.

307
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,634
It's tree deep
and soft as pudding.

308
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:32,111
Beautiful.

309
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,978
Not good for anything.

310
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,813
But I guess it is beautiful.

311
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:46,923
That hollow's
a likely place for deer.

312
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:48,827
You go on up the trail.

313
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:51,423
When you get to the top,
cut across the ridge.

314
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,366
They'll smell you
and come this way.

315
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:54,698
Won't they smell you?

316
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:59,732
- Wind's blowing my way.
- Oh, sorry.

317
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:01,973
That's all right, Doc.

318
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:04,173
If I tried to do your job,

319
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:06,579
I'd be as dumb as a dog
that doesn't know "sick 'em."

320
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,585
What do I do
when I get to the ridge?

321
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:11,883
If you hear me shooting,
we've got a deer.

322
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:14,584
If you don't, wait up there
and I'll find you.

323
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:15,751
Thanks.

324
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,754
You were a long time
getting rid of him.

325
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,791
Maybe I like the doctor.

326
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,652
Like!

327
00:18:56,804 --> 00:19:00,536
You can like who you want,
but I won't be kept waiting.

328
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,837
I've done some waiting.

329
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,142
Boake, you don't know.

330
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:11,276
You can have South America.
You can have the whole world.

331
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:13,183
This is for me.

332
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:15,017
What, Boake?

333
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:19,389
Hill country liquor, tidewater
cooking, and North Carolina women.

334
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:22,726
Like I always said,
there's nothing like a dame.

335
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,787
That's the best shot
I ever made.

336
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,456
Naturally, I missed.

337
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:56,399
He was shot twice...
couple inches apart.

338
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:02,265
Five-pointer.

339
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:05,275
He's a beauty.

340
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:08,846
So are you.

341
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:13,080
- No, Boake.
- And no more games, Ruby.

342
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:15,985
You're gonna get it straight
in your head, Boake Tackman.

343
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:19,547
You can't come back here and
treat me like part of the scenery.

344
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,186
I'm not just
a North Carolina dame!

345
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,526
You know I'm crazy about you.

346
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,999
Along with devilled crab
and moonshine whiskey?

347
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:34,130
I remember the way
your hair smelled...

348
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,904
how it felt to put
my arms around you...

349
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:40,208
what a crazy,
beautiful kid you were.

350
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,615
Do you remember all the lies
they told about you and me?

351
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,846
How your family
and all those snobs

352
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:48,412
were so dead sure
they knew what was going on.

353
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:51,954
They were wrong then,
and they're still wrong.

354
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:54,291
You're so pretty when
you lose your temper

355
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:55,954
and your eyes start blazing.

356
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:58,296
Why don't you give up, Ruby?

357
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,858
You know you can't hold out
the way you feel.

358
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:02,029
Get out of here!

359
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:05,339
I swear if you
don't get out of my sight,

360
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:08,333
I'll blow your head off!

361
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,008
Oh, Miss McAuliffe!

362
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,449
Jud, please tell Daddy I'm here.

363
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,387
Hello, Tracy.
Come on in, honey.

364
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,725
He was about 20 yards
up the slope...

365
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:06,534
then, just as I fired,
the wind came up.

366
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:08,938
- That old alibi.
- So help me.

367
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,705
I didn't even
see the one Ruby got.

368
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:12,871
- Hello, Clyde.
- Tracy, honey.

369
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:16,280
My goodness, Neil,
you look like a bear.

370
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,080
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, honey.

371
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:20,087
Heavens, you
don't have to stand.

372
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,280
Sit down.

373
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:23,221
- Oh, Tracy, this is...
- Oh, hello, Rube.

374
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:26,085
Hi, Tracy.

375
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,254
This is my daughter,
Tracy, Doctor.

376
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,888
- Dr. Manfred, honey.
- How do you do?

377
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,195
Vorgie's told me
all about you, Doctor.

378
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,429
Our cook...
you delivered her grandson,

379
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:36,062
and she says you're wonderful.

380
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:38,073
Thank you, Miss McAuliffe.

381
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:40,871
- Ready, Boake?
- All set. Here's yours, Dad.

382
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:41,932
Thanks, Boake.

383
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:45,207
My, you smell
awful woodsy, darling.

384
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,806
I came to fetch my men early.

385
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:50,149
I knew they'd be dirty
from head to foot,

386
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,188
and I want them
to look nice for my party.

387
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,156
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Tracy.

388
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:56,089
The rest of you
can take your time.

389
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,718
If you're there by nine,
I'll forgive you.

390
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:58,853
We'll be there!

391
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,954
Oh, Dr. Manfred.

392
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,226
It's a little supper dance
at the country club...

393
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,359
sort of a welcome home
party for Boake.

394
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:06,461
Please come.

395
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:07,698
Well, l...

396
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:09,933
It's not as dull
as it sounds, Doctor.

397
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,373
If Braddock's
the same old town,

398
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:14,139
come sunup, you'll be riding home
with nothing but a head.

399
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:18,010
I'm sorry, I'd like to,
but I have an engagement.

400
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,313
Oh, well, another time.

401
00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:23,481
- So long.
- Take care.

402
00:23:23,556 --> 00:23:24,648
Pleasant trip, fellows.

403
00:23:24,723 --> 00:23:26,021
Sorry, Tracy.

404
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,227
- Good-bye!
- Bye!

405
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:34,655
Well, nice girl, Tracy.

406
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:38,568
- Got brains and breeding.
- Yeah, brains and breeding.

407
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:41,198
Nothing has been said yet
about them getting engaged,

408
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:43,174
but Cullen and I are all for it.

409
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:04,493
Sowing the seeds
of a tarnished name...

410
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,397
Cut that!

411
00:24:06,468 --> 00:24:11,337
Sowing the seeds
of eternal shame...

412
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:15,935
Oh, what will the harvest be...

413
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,513
I said to cut that!

414
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:24,914
I ought to kill you for that.

415
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:26,888
What's stopping you?

416
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,984
You ain't suffered enough yet.

417
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:37,333
Just wait till Boake Tackman
marries that girl.

418
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:38,697
He won't.

419
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,563
And they'll live together
fat and easy.

420
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:44,609
He'll put his arms around her,

421
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:47,770
and she'll feel as good
to him as you ever did.

422
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:51,646
Better likely, because
of the fine life that goes with her.

423
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,441
She and him'll have kids.

424
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,316
No, he's mine.

425
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:58,823
It seems he don't know that.

426
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,086
They can throw Tracy McAuliffe
at him all they want...

427
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:06,461
Boake's mine.

428
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,375
Why so quiet, sugar?

429
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:23,746
We're going fishing.

430
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:25,682
What's the use?
They're not biting.

431
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:26,980
Not biting?

432
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:29,917
Come on, honey,
give me a hand

433
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:32,051
cleaning up this tacklebox.

434
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:35,119
Ruby, there ain't a fish
in the world won't bite

435
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:36,424
if you go at it right.

436
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:37,486
Not for me, they won't.

437
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,465
You got to figure it
like your old man.

438
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:42,025
All these little fish
that hang around near the shore,

439
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:43,263
they're not for you and me.

440
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,566
We're after the big ones.

441
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,767
The big ones you gotta go after.

442
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:50,574
Out there,
where the water's deep.

443
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:54,343
When we get way out yonder,
you'll see old Mr. Fish...

444
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,010
he'll come wiggling along
fat and sassy.

445
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,111
He's at the pick of the lot
down there, see?

446
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:03,091
All of a sudden, he looks up
and sees something different.

447
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,821
Pretty soon, old Mr. Fish
can't stand it any longer.

448
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:07,294
He's gotta have a sniff.

449
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,663
And then... kerplunk!

450
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,669
You wheels in your reel right fast...
you got him hooked.

451
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,462
Yes, sir, that's all
there is to it, baby.

452
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,601
The right time,
give him the right bait.

453
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,770
I hate leaving here.

454
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,446
Every time, I hate it more.

455
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,375
Kiss me again.

456
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,227
Oh, I left my sweater.

457
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:11,231
I can pick it up tomorrow
or the day after if you don't need it.

458
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:14,359
What if your father
should stop by?

459
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:15,869
Not a chance.

460
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:18,997
The Judge is as dependable
as an ocean tide.

461
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:21,065
Moves out here
the first Monday in June,

462
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:23,703
and goes back to town
the morning after Labor Day.

463
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,374
I hope you noticed you got a gal
that can open a door all by herself.

464
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:38,592
Listen.

465
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:46,303
That's the new pump.
The big one.

466
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,999
Salt marsh for 50 years.

467
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,976
Now there's
a hundred acres planted,

468
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:55,478
and a hundred more
almost ready to plant.

469
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:57,776
You'd think nothing
would ever grow.

470
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:58,907
Wait and see.

471
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:01,076
When I get the pump
and the nitrates paid for,

472
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,348
that land's gonna grow
fleets of trucks,

473
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:05,514
barges, canning factory.

474
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,389
Boake Tackman... empire builder.

475
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,995
Sounds like a big heart beating.

476
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,663
It is.
It's my heart.

477
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,196
Oh. What about me?

478
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:25,141
Do you really think you can
compete with a man's work?

479
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:27,338
Come on.

480
00:28:30,216 --> 00:28:33,913
It's nearly morning.
The stars are fading.

481
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:37,048
Boake, drive me back
along the beach.

482
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,260
- Love me?
- Sure thing.

483
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:49,394
Tell me.

484
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:51,802
I love you, baby.

485
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:54,569
Tell me like you mean it.

486
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:57,771
Stop trying to put words
in my mouth, Ruby.

487
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:01,749
Let me say what I want to say
when I'm ready to say it.

488
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:08,982
Relax, honey.
You've got your throttle wide open.

489
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:11,821
But you're always holding back.

490
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:14,124
You think I'll wait and wait

491
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:16,223
while you take
your own sweet time.

492
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,028
Don't push me, Ruby.

493
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:24,001
Who's pushing?

494
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:27,305
You and that
one-track mind of yours.

495
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:41,255
Two can play
at that game!

496
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:43,783
It's all right. I got it.

497
00:29:56,976 --> 00:30:02,915
Because I love you!

498
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,881
Because I love you!

499
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:24,199
Come on, the five o'clock ferry's
about to leave for the mainland!

500
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:36,180
Now all the South Shore folks'll
be getting their backs up

501
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,016
because of Tracy McAuliffe.

502
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,021
The whole fishing fleet's
already talking...

503
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,819
and everybody down
to the meeting house

504
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:44,586
scandalizing about you and him.

505
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,925
Those hypocrites... let 'em talk.

506
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:49,487
I'm ashamed
we got the same name.

507
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,230
I'll be changing mine
pretty soon.

508
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:55,534
You fool.
You wanton fool.

509
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,541
You think Boake Tackman
will marry you?

510
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,270
I don't think.
I know.

511
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:01,834
He's ashamed of you...

512
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:04,745
sneaking out to meet you
at some joint on the highway,

513
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:07,545
where he don't
run into his fine friends.

514
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,382
Even if he did
want to marry you,

515
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:11,717
Boake Tackman's
tied hand and foot.

516
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,282
Let him try to break away.
They'll stop him.

517
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:17,989
They got their ways.

518
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,964
Joe, send in a couple
of bourbons with water!

519
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:27,505
I got par on eight holes
and two birdies,

520
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:29,234
and then I miss
a putt that long.

521
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:32,334
- Cost me 40 bucks.
- Come on, pay up.

522
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:33,810
What's the matter, George?

523
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:37,315
Did our big amphibious engineer
take you to the cleaners?

524
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:38,441
You said it!

525
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:41,681
That cold dip in the ocean
must have put Boake in shape!

526
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,086
Yeah!

527
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,123
How'd it happen?
Or shall I take a guess?

528
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:50,391
When Boake hit that water,
I bet he fairly sizzled.

529
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:54,067
Next time you're out romancing,

530
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:56,102
don't forget to take
your water wings.

531
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:57,501
Or a couple of oars!

532
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:00,542
- Sour grapes.
- Okay, I admit it!

533
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:06,206
Sure, the rest of us
are either too old or too tired.

534
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:11,149
Say, Boake, Cullen told me
about your plantation...

535
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,050
how you want to spread out,

536
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:15,750
and I've got that
old cotton warehouse.

537
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:18,988
- You want to sell or lease?
- Gotta think about it.

538
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,495
You and Tracy coming
to the barbecue tonight?

539
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,590
Yeah.
Sure, I guess so.

540
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:25,895
Fine.

541
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:29,405
After dinner, when our women
are having themselves a hen talk,

542
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:31,338
we'll get together, okay?

543
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,203
Yeah.

544
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:53,056
I read in the paper where you
went to a party at the McAuliffe's.

545
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,496
Yes.

546
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,829
I thought about you
dancing with Tracy,

547
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:59,426
and honestly, Boake,
I had to pity you.

548
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:00,834
She's so bony.

549
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:03,397
Ruby, I wanted
to tell you about Tracy.

550
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,379
That's all right, darling.

551
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,779
I know you have
to be sweet to Tracy.

552
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:12,749
After all, when her father's
lending you all that money...

553
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:15,117
It's gonna be
announced Sunday.

554
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:18,885
I know you'd want me
to tell you first.

555
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:21,723
Tracy and I are going
to be married.

556
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,410
Our families have more or less
planned it since we were kids.

557
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,976
And are you gonna use
your lying mouth

558
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,517
to tell me you love
that weak, giddy head?

559
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:48,181
Ruby, with you,
it's been so sweet

560
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:50,953
and wild and crazy...

561
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:54,325
but when it comes to settling down
for the rest of my life...

562
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:58,390
You see, I like the little corner
of the world I was born in.

563
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,833
I like everything about it.

564
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:03,463
Including
Cullen McAuliffe's money?

565
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,972
The money's part of it...

566
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:08,374
so I can do the work
I want to do.

567
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:11,380
You can get a job!
And I can work!

568
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:12,710
We don't need
the McAuliffe's money!

569
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,275
Ruby, I'm not talking
about earning a living.

570
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,551
For a hundred years, the Tackmans
have been sliding downhill.

571
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:23,561
Ever since the tides
swallowed our plantation,

572
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:27,029
not one of them lifted a finger
to do anything about it.

573
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,192
Sitting out their lives
on verandas,

574
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,795
sopping up
bourbon whiskey, like my dad.

575
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,972
I'm not going to
end up like him.

576
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,534
I'm gonna do things that
will shake this whole town awake!

577
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,080
Change the whole Tidewater!

578
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,048
Things I can be proud of.

579
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:46,516
Like marrying somebody
you don't love?

580
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:50,654
There's all kinds of love, Ruby.

581
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:56,023
I've known Tracy so many years.

582
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,860
It's not like you and me, no...

583
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:04,235
but Tracy's gentle,
and she's bright as a dollar.

584
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,736
Yeah, I know.

585
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:11,370
She's got brains and breeding.

586
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:12,435
Both of you!

587
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,948
Like a pair
of pedigreed hounds!

588
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:24,388
Ruby, listen!

589
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,587
It's not the end of the world.

590
00:35:26,662 --> 00:35:29,494
I'll still be around.
I won't be tied hand and foot.

591
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:31,532
We can still see each other.

592
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,932
You'd do that?

593
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:35,731
You'd come to me on the sly?

594
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:38,399
- You'd try to make me your...
- Ruby, I didn't say that!

595
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:45,672
Ruby!

596
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:48,580
Marry her! And rot!

597
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:50,449
And don't ever come
sneaking back here!

598
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,080
- Stop, you!
- Let him go!

599
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:56,216
If anybody's
gonna kill him, I am!

600
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:08,998
"Last Wednesday afternoon,
a surprise shower was given

601
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:12,702
"for Miss Tracy McAuliffe,
who will marry Mr. Boake Tackman,

602
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:14,803
"son of Judge Henshel Tackman.

603
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,507
The Tackman and McAuliffe..."

604
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:19,317
Hello, Doctor.

605
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,649
Hello.
Hello, Lettie.

606
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,721
I declare, Dr. Saul,

607
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,487
I'm beginning to think
you have a case on me,

608
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,893
the way you're
always popping in here.

609
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:33,057
- Do you mind?
- Mercy, no.

610
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:34,964
I'm partial to doctors.

611
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,503
One of my beaus was a doctor.

612
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,970
Miss Drucker's making me
a new dress for the wedding.

613
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,874
She's a spinster lady,
poor thing.

614
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:49,145
Got no idea
what catches a man's eye.

615
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:54,479
I wouldn't worry
if Ruby were here.

616
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:57,818
Nasty old needle.

617
00:36:57,893 --> 00:36:59,621
I'm a brute.

618
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:03,564
I was just talking.
I don't really mind.

619
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:08,229
Whatever that medicine is,
it makes me feel lovely.

620
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:10,370
Dr. Saul?

621
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:14,304
Tell Jim to drive out
and get Ruby.

622
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:16,674
Tell him it's doctor's orders.

623
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:20,478
- He'll pay you some mind.
- All right, Lettie.

624
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,009
- I'll talk to him right now.
- Thank you, Doctor.

625
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:34,394
- Hello, Saul.
- Jim.

626
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:37,458
Haven't you noticed a change
in Lettie the last couple of weeks?

627
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:39,331
In what way?

628
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:41,895
Well, seems to me
she's a lot livelier,

629
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:44,100
more interested
in what's going on.

630
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:47,542
She's even planning on getting up
to go to Tracy and Boake's wedding.

631
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:49,671
Yeah, she told me.

632
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:52,274
She wants you to drive out
and bring Ruby here.

633
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:55,582
I know, she asked me,
but it'd be torture for Ruby

634
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:57,678
with all that talk
about the wedding.

635
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,349
Letitia's dying, Jim.

636
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,625
This change you've noticed
is something that often happens

637
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:09,794
just before the end...
a sudden resurgence of energy,

638
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,998
like a dying tree sometimes
has a final burst of bloom.

639
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:16,068
If you want
another doctor's opinion...

640
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,008
No, no.

641
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,143
How soon?

642
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:24,446
Two weeks, maybe less.

643
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,882
I only hope and pray
she doesn't suffer.

644
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,820
It'll help if Ruby's here.

645
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,294
No doubt about that.

646
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:41,059
It's the kind of dress
that bowls men over!

647
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:43,401
It makes all the women
green with envy!

648
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:47,966
Letitia, I swear you've
got the figure of a girl.

649
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:52,180
May I have this dance?

650
00:38:57,822 --> 00:38:59,618
You're light
as a feather, Letitia!

651
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:04,556
Miss Lettie!

652
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:07,493
Miss Lettie.

653
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:08,929
Lie down.

654
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:15,906
Please... give me the button.

655
00:39:28,854 --> 00:39:33,622
When it got dark,
I was frightened.

656
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:38,988
Papa gave me a button
and told me to hold on,

657
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:42,592
then nothing
could happen to me.

658
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,796
Hold on tight, he's...

659
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:47,135
Miss Lettie.

660
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:55,609
Did you notify Mrs. Gentry's
cousins up in Raleigh?

661
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:58,480
Cousins, aunts,
nephews, nieces.

662
00:39:58,552 --> 00:40:00,953
Anything else I should do?

663
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,081
Are you going
to order the flowers?

664
00:40:03,757 --> 00:40:05,487
Then everything's
taken care of.

665
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,290
I just realized again
how extraordinary you are.

666
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:09,796
Thank you, Doctor.

667
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:13,391
Not only because you're beautiful,
you're so unpretentious and honest.

668
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:16,326
You mustn't pay
any attention to these people.

669
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:18,566
This is a stuffy,
snobbish town.

670
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:20,164
It's the only place I know.

671
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:22,802
Someday, somebody will
take you out of it, and you'll see...

672
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,311
Ruby, I...

673
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:31,276
...I think you're wonderful.

674
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,087
Thank you, Saul.

675
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:37,293
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

676
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,441
I'm going downtown.

677
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:57,481
Here, take my car.

678
00:40:57,548 --> 00:40:59,448
- Thanks.
- Has Saul left?

679
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:01,179
He had to go to the hospital.

680
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:06,150
You know, I think
he started to propose to me.

681
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,920
Saul?

682
00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:13,160
He lost his nerve.

683
00:41:13,232 --> 00:41:15,201
Is there anything
I can bring you?

684
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:16,859
No.

685
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:19,063
I won't be long.

686
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:22,665
<i>Jim wasn't jealous of me,
I'm sure of that.</i>

687
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:27,702
<i>But he must have realized then
how Lettie's death had set him free.</i>

688
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,840
<i>And now, each faced
a painful loss...</i>

689
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:33,750
<i>- Yes?
...and a Ionely tomorrow.</i>

690
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:37,490
Martha says you're packing.

691
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:39,048
Everything's taken care of,

692
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:42,527
so I'm going out
to stay with my folks.

693
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:44,621
I'll be back early
Wednesday morning.

694
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:46,632
Why not stay on here?

695
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,692
And give them
something more to talk about?

696
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,863
I don't see them.

697
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,909
What's wrong with your being here...
the years I've known you?

698
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:55,965
Why, you'd...

699
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,240
Now, Jim, don't tell me
that I'm just like a daughter.

700
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:06,046
You still planning
to go to New York?

701
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:07,782
I suppose so.

702
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:10,918
Maybe you're planning
to get married.

703
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:13,258
Whatever put that
in your head?

704
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,697
It's been in Saul's head since
the first day he laid eyes on you.

705
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,099
Saul's sweet.

706
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:24,534
Martha's fixing supper early
so I can eat before I go.

707
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,734
Ruby?

708
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,746
Heaven knows what you'll do,

709
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,080
running off, getting yourself
tangled up with somebody.

710
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,382
Don't worry about me, Jim.

711
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,784
I don't want to lose you.

712
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,327
You and me are
the same kind of people.

713
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,659
As far as this town
is concerned, we're mongrels.

714
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:48,199
Even Lettie
was out of my class.

715
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:49,860
Lettie was sick
for eight and a half years.

716
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:51,800
For eight and a half years,
I didn't have a marriage,

717
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,269
but I stuck it out.

718
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,332
And I was gonna
wait a while before I asked you.

719
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,377
I'm asking you now.

720
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:02,976
Mrs. James Gentry.

721
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:06,685
That would really give them
something to talk about.

722
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,152
Forget them!

723
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:11,816
They'd say Boake Tackman
wouldn't have me,

724
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:14,793
so I hooked you
to get your money.

725
00:43:15,597 --> 00:43:18,031
Anybody talk about my wife,
I'd break them in two.

726
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,897
They'd wonder if
I was still mooning over Boake,

727
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:23,164
and they'd talk about it.

728
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:27,800
And after a while,
maybe you'd start wondering, too.

729
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:30,071
I've seen you hunt and fish, Ruby,

730
00:43:30,145 --> 00:43:32,910
and I never saw you cry
about the ones that got away.

731
00:43:32,982 --> 00:43:35,347
Go up to New York
if you want to.

732
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:38,318
I gotta be there
on business next month.

733
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:40,117
We can be married then.

734
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,451
All right, Ruby?

735
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:46,894
All right, Jim.

736
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:52,427
<i>Boake and Tracy were married
in the traditional manner</i>

737
00:43:52,503 --> 00:43:54,299
<i>to which Braddock was accustomed.</i>

738
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,771
<i>And without telling
his secret to another soul,</i>

739
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:00,606
<i>Jim went to New York, and there
made Ruby Corey his wife.</i>

740
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:20,460
Shall I carry you to the office?

741
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,056
No.

742
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:27,496
Yes?

743
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:29,598
<i>Mr. Fallgren
and Mr. Biffle are here.</i>

744
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:30,732
Fine, send them in.

745
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,136
They got here so fast, you'd think
they were working for you.

746
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:35,373
In a way, they are.

747
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:37,474
- Good to see you, Jim.
- Thank you.

748
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:38,950
Howdy.
What's your big news?

749
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:40,646
I'll lay odds
it's that assembly plant.

750
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,744
It's bigger than that.

751
00:44:41,822 --> 00:44:45,553
Gentlemen... I want you
to meet Mrs. Gentry.

752
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,490
Ruby?

753
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,995
Ruby and I were married
last Thursday in New York.

754
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:53,397
Congratulations, Jim.
I mean it.

755
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:54,799
I'm sure you do.

756
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:57,099
Yes, it's not good
for a man to live alone.

757
00:44:57,171 --> 00:44:59,969
I'll run it front page
tonight if you say so, Jim.

758
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:01,440
That's why I called you over.

759
00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:04,535
Any sort of statement
you want to make?

760
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:07,209
You can say we're
both very happy,

761
00:45:07,282 --> 00:45:08,716
and we're glad to be home.

762
00:45:08,785 --> 00:45:11,378
And we can sure say
the bride's a beauty.

763
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:13,444
Let me tell you, Ru...
Mrs. Gentry,

764
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:15,183
you look like a million dollars.

765
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:18,417
I've seen a million dollars
and believe me,

766
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:21,486
Ruby looks a whole lot better.

767
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:23,229
Yeah.

768
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:26,826
I'd better hop back to my office
before they run off the paper.

769
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:29,599
- I'll run along, too.
- One more item.

770
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:32,938
You might want to say we're
going to give a party real soon.

771
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:34,772
End of next week.

772
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:38,143
So that all my friends
can meet Mrs. Gentry.

773
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:41,177
You two gentlemen
are invited.

774
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:42,378
And your wives.

775
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:45,651
That's nice of you.
Right, Shug?

776
00:45:45,724 --> 00:45:47,191
Very nice.

777
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:48,589
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Gentry.

778
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:50,126
We'll sure be there.

779
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:52,390
Couldn't keep us away.

780
00:45:57,436 --> 00:45:59,961
<i>It was unbelievable how many
prominent families stayed away.</i>

781
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:02,200
<i>Their excuses were
convincing enough,</i>

782
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,743
<i>but it seemed as if
some secret conspiracy</i>

783
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,835
<i>had been
successfully executed.</i>

784
00:46:09,882 --> 00:46:13,181
Well, I have an early
operation in the morning.

785
00:46:15,122 --> 00:46:16,953
Ate too much.

786
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,584
Takes a Yankee
to appreciate this Tidewater food.

787
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,322
Takes a Yankee
to show some manners.

788
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:25,826
Oh, no.

789
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:28,935
Frank.

790
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,937
Tell them that'll be all
for tonight.

791
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:33,166
And they're welcome
to eat before they go.

792
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,004
Good night, Jim.
Thanks for inviting me.

793
00:46:35,076 --> 00:46:36,543
Thanks for showing up.

794
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:38,874
- Good night, Ruby.
- Good night, Saul.

795
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,951
Forget it, Jim.

796
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:51,522
The ones who did come
had a good time.

797
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:55,122
The rest of them don't matter.
Not to me.

798
00:46:55,197 --> 00:46:57,028
They underrated me.

799
00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:00,900
They'll find out they've
been tempting Providence.

800
00:47:00,971 --> 00:47:03,064
They'll never accept me.

801
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:07,405
No? We'll see about that.

802
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,019
Jim Gentry!

803
00:47:17,088 --> 00:47:19,522
How long is it you've been
a member of this country club?

804
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,820
- Nearly ten years.
- Ten years?

805
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:24,986
Blamed if I ever saw you before
at one of our Saturday night brawls!

806
00:47:25,063 --> 00:47:28,054
The penalty and reward
of having a young wife, gentlemen.

807
00:47:30,568 --> 00:47:32,867
There's the next dance.
I'd better get out there.

808
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:34,701
- Tab.
- Yes, sir.

809
00:47:34,774 --> 00:47:37,207
Ruby said if she was stuck
with Grandpappy Stafford

810
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:40,369
for more than one dance,
she'd scalp whatever hair I had left.

811
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:43,142
- And that I want to keep.
- Thanks for the drink, Jim.

812
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:44,615
- Hello, Doctor.
- Neil, how are you?

813
00:47:44,684 --> 00:47:45,708
Good to see you.

814
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:21,109
What's the matter, Jim?
Somebody snatch her away?

815
00:49:22,956 --> 00:49:24,218
Jim?

816
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:28,751
Yes, sir?

817
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,757
- Same as before.
- Okay.

818
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:57,552
Jim?

819
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:31,824
Doctor, can I
ask you a question?

820
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:32,885
Yeah, go ahead.

821
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,727
This business
they always hand you

822
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:36,528
about not being able
to mix your drinks...

823
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,227
I've often wondered about that.

824
00:50:38,303 --> 00:50:40,270
Do you think that...

825
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,242
- Give me a double brandy, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

826
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:54,074
And please put
some ice in a towel.

827
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:03,359
I'll take that.

828
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:23,413
Here, drink this.

829
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:32,292
I don't want this!

830
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:36,161
Come on, honey,
let's go home.

831
00:51:36,232 --> 00:51:39,428
Not till I finish with that scum!
That filthy...

832
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:40,833
Where did he go?

833
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:42,427
Jim, don't be a fool!

834
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:44,131
Take your hands off me!

835
00:51:44,206 --> 00:51:47,835
Jim, what's got in to you?
I've never seen you like this.

836
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:52,280
Why, you little tramp!

837
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:53,815
You're dressed up
to look like a lady.

838
00:51:53,883 --> 00:51:56,647
It's a pity you can't behave like one.
None of this would have happened!

839
00:52:03,693 --> 00:52:05,559
Ruby!

840
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:23,712
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, Doc.

841
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:40,926
Ruby?

842
00:54:06,395 --> 00:54:10,831
I... had no business
saying what I did.

843
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:12,491
I'm sorry.

844
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:15,461
Why...

845
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:18,803
Jim, I... We...

846
00:54:18,874 --> 00:54:20,102
No, not now.

847
00:54:21,443 --> 00:54:24,413
Tomorrow's another day.

848
00:54:36,326 --> 00:54:37,987
Wind's shifting.

849
00:54:39,596 --> 00:54:42,964
Jim, when are we
going to talk?

850
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:46,868
- About what?
- About last night.

851
00:54:46,938 --> 00:54:49,099
Isn't that what
we came out here for?

852
00:54:49,174 --> 00:54:50,868
I wanted to be alone with you.

853
00:54:50,942 --> 00:54:52,239
That's all.

854
00:54:52,744 --> 00:54:55,974
But how can you forgive me
if I don't tell you?

855
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:57,844
I don't want to hear.

856
00:54:57,916 --> 00:54:59,907
I didn't mean to hurt you.

857
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:01,782
I didn't even think
until afterwards.

858
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:03,446
I don't want to hear anything...

859
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:06,251
if you saw him first,
or if he saw you,

860
00:55:06,325 --> 00:55:08,418
or if he asked you to dance.

861
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:10,223
I don't know how it happened.

862
00:55:10,295 --> 00:55:12,764
All of a sudden, Boake was there
and we were dancing and...

863
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,532
it seemed like we both
forgot there was anybody else.

864
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:17,796
Don't, Ruby!

865
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,999
When I married you,
I knew all about Boake.

866
00:55:21,074 --> 00:55:24,009
I would have been crazy to think he
still didn't mean something to you.

867
00:55:26,113 --> 00:55:28,343
Jim, what is love?

868
00:55:28,415 --> 00:55:30,246
I've been so happy with you.

869
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,151
Don't talk.

870
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:40,093
I don' t mind
being second best.

871
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:42,595
Oh, Jim, I do love you.

872
00:55:42,665 --> 00:55:44,962
I do, I do!

873
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:47,001
How could I help it?

874
00:56:01,718 --> 00:56:03,810
- Are you cold?
- A little bit.

875
00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:06,184
- I'll get you something to drink.
- Thanks.

876
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:21,733
Jim! Jim!

877
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:29,542
Jim!

878
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:34,074
Jim!

879
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:36,214
Jim, answer me!

880
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,588
Jim!

881
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:49,831
Answer me!

882
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:55,135
Jim, where are you?

883
00:56:56,442 --> 00:56:58,240
Can you hear me?

884
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:06,952
Jim!

885
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,818
Jim, where are you?

886
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:25,365
I keep seeing Jim's face
just before it happened.

887
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,272
And then afterwards...

888
00:57:30,846 --> 00:57:32,813
He was gone so quickly.

889
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:37,819
It doesn't seem
possible that he...

890
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,980
...just swallowed up
by the waves...

891
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,085
How could he
be gone so quickly?

892
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:51,900
Maybe if I hadn't called out,
he would have stayed below.

893
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:56,529
Or if I'd called out
something else besides his name.

894
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,870
You've got to stop
blaming yourself.

895
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:01,774
Without him, I...

896
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,244
What's that?

897
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:10,819
What are they doing?

898
00:58:10,888 --> 00:58:12,822
Just making a racket.

899
00:58:12,891 --> 00:58:15,222
Probably worked up
about Jim.

900
00:58:16,695 --> 00:58:19,425
- Worked up?
- I'll close the window.

901
00:58:32,947 --> 00:58:35,176
<i>- Hello?
- Murderer.</i>

902
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:40,249
<i>- Who is this?
- Murderer! Murderer!</i>

903
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:45,817
Somebody calling me
a murderer!

904
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:49,755
<i>- Murderer! Murderer!
- Who is this?</i>

905
00:58:49,831 --> 00:58:51,856
I'm gonna have you
reported to...

906
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:57,965
They think I... killed Jim?

907
00:59:10,652 --> 00:59:14,089
"Sheriff Anderson,
after questioning Mrs. Gentry,

908
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:17,023
"did not dismiss
the possibilities of suicide

909
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:18,286
"or of foul play.

910
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,263
"He said he was forced
to accept Mrs. Gentry's story,

911
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:23,731
"since there were no other
witnesses to the tragedy.

912
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,291
"However, he mentioned reports
of domestic difficulties

913
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:29,271
"in the Gentry home,
and said that Mr. Gentry,

914
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:31,967
"only the night before,
engaged in a fistfight

915
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:34,737
because of Mrs. Gentry's
attentions to another man."

916
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,914
Stay away from
that window, honey.

917
00:59:43,988 --> 00:59:46,080
Don't pay them no mind!

918
00:59:46,157 --> 00:59:47,988
Somebody's got to stop them!

919
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:02,264
<i>Braddock Times?</i>

920
01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:05,072
This is Mrs. James Gentry.

921
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:07,339
I want to speak
to Mr. Neil Fallgren.

922
01:00:09,282 --> 01:00:11,011
Hello, Neil?

923
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:16,389
Neil, you don't really think
that Jim killed himself?

924
01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:19,118
Or that I could possibly...

925
01:00:20,226 --> 01:00:23,127
Everything I told
the sheriff was true!

926
01:00:23,196 --> 01:00:25,495
It was all lies,
that story you wrote!

927
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:29,024
After the brazen show you
made of yourself the other night,

928
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:30,696
I'd say you're getting off easy!

929
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:33,569
Sure, sure I was Jim's friend!

930
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:35,768
Let me tell you
something, Ruby!

931
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,606
When you sashayed in
from the swamps

932
01:00:37,678 --> 01:00:39,236
thinking you was
good as anybody,

933
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:42,715
his friends should have sent you
packing before you could hook him!

934
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:45,117
And if we had,
he'd still be alive!

935
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,117
Tearing through the driveway!

936
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:52,660
That's trespassing
on private property!

937
01:00:58,002 --> 01:00:59,662
I'll stop them!

938
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:02,765
No, Judge, that will
just make things worse!

939
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:04,637
- She's took enough!
- Don't you understand...

940
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:07,643
- Get out of my way, Doctor!
- Judge, you've got to stop!

941
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:13,449
Get out of here!

942
01:01:19,256 --> 01:01:22,590
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right, Doctor.

943
01:01:24,029 --> 01:01:26,054
A lot of people in this town
are gonna be sick!

944
01:01:27,365 --> 01:01:30,027
<i>Jim had always used
his money wisely,</i>

945
01:01:30,101 --> 01:01:32,263
<i>but Ruby was out for blood.</i>

946
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:35,102
The Wayne Trucking Company's
missed a lot of payments,

947
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:37,369
and they owe a lot of interest.

948
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,536
How do I take over
their trucks?

949
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,773
If you want the trucks,
since the loan's delinquent,

950
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:43,212
you could demand
payment in full.

951
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,581
I want payment in full.

952
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:49,744
Now, this note on Perry Duncan,
or what did you call it?

953
01:01:49,823 --> 01:01:51,084
A demand note.

954
01:01:51,158 --> 01:01:52,352
If you intend to collect on that,

955
01:01:52,426 --> 01:01:54,188
it's customary
to give 30 days notice.

956
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:55,727
It says here 24 hours.

957
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:58,629
- That's the minimum notice.
- Give them the minimum.

958
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:00,064
First thing tomorrow morning.

959
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:06,898
How did this get here?

960
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:10,708
Didn't Cullen McAuliffe
loan money for this?

961
01:02:10,778 --> 01:02:12,643
Boake Tackman's note.

962
01:02:12,714 --> 01:02:15,444
The County bank did make
the original note,

963
01:02:15,516 --> 01:02:17,382
but Mr. Gentry
took it over from them.

964
01:02:17,453 --> 01:02:20,786
Mr. Gentry thought it
a very promising project.

965
01:02:20,856 --> 01:02:23,381
Do you want to demand
payment on that, Mrs. Gentry?

966
01:02:27,629 --> 01:02:29,790
Neil Fallgren.

967
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:32,232
<i>Can I take over
the Braddock Times?</i>

968
01:02:32,301 --> 01:02:34,361
With a writ of attachment.

969
01:02:34,437 --> 01:02:37,270
Well, from a business standpoint,
I'd advise against it.

970
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:40,538
<i>Can I take over
the Braddock Times?</i>

971
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:42,977
Naturally, you can,
Mrs. Gentry.

972
01:02:43,046 --> 01:02:46,107
You can also take a million dollars
and make a bonfire out of it.

973
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,878
Have that note or writ
or whatever you call it

974
01:02:48,952 --> 01:02:51,945
served on Mr. Fallgren
first thing tomorrow morning.

975
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:13,273
All the boats are tied up
at the docks because of you.

976
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:16,975
Packing plant's closed,
all those folks out of work,

977
01:03:17,048 --> 01:03:19,141
and they're hating me
because I'm your brother!

978
01:03:19,217 --> 01:03:21,151
They're hating me
for your sins!

979
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:23,416
And I told Pa he had to
come and fetch you home

980
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,980
to make you stop
what you're doing.

981
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:27,618
- But he wouldn't listen.
- Pop's got more sense.

982
01:03:27,694 --> 01:03:31,060
Sister, you've got to pray,
pray for forgiveness.

983
01:03:31,131 --> 01:03:32,621
You gone crazy, Jewel?

984
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:35,190
No, kneel with me.
Tell how you sinned,

985
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,430
so's I can go to the meeting
with a joyful heart and say,

986
01:03:37,504 --> 01:03:39,837
"Yes, yes, she sinned,
but on her knees,

987
01:03:39,908 --> 01:03:41,000
she said she was sorry."

988
01:03:41,075 --> 01:03:42,508
Sorry?

989
01:03:42,577 --> 01:03:45,569
For getting back at people who
gave me a rough time all my life?

990
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:47,672
You're plowing iniquity
and sowing wickedness.

991
01:03:47,749 --> 01:03:49,649
Go home! Get out!

992
01:03:49,717 --> 01:03:51,082
There'll be a reckoning.

993
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,087
Whatsoever you sow,
that shall you also reap.

994
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:59,387
So far, I've reaped
nothing but pleasure.

995
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,622
Go to your meeting
and tell them that!

996
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:07,700
Evil... evil spawn of the devil.

997
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,262
And tell them
this is just the beginning.

998
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,832
You've sown the wind,
and you'll reap the whirlwind!

999
01:04:56,289 --> 01:05:00,726
Well, Boake, I expected you
a couple of days ago.

1000
01:05:00,794 --> 01:05:03,193
I've been staying out
of the project.

1001
01:05:03,263 --> 01:05:05,391
I didn't get your letter
till this morning.

1002
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:07,228
I got here as quick as I could.

1003
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,599
Didn't even stop to dress
for the occasion.

1004
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,729
What occasion?

1005
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:13,705
Calling on a beautiful woman.

1006
01:05:17,779 --> 01:05:20,304
- Would you like a drink?
- Sure.

1007
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:24,783
I was hoping you'd come
to see me without being asked.

1008
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:26,376
Well, I thought of it.

1009
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:29,382
Well?

1010
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:33,724
I was afraid you might have
blood dripping off your clothes.

1011
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,432
- I haven't hurt you.
- I know.

1012
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,404
And I could.

1013
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:56,513
You know why I asked you
to come here?

1014
01:05:56,585 --> 01:06:00,214
Probably it's my turn,
and you want to see if I'll crawl.

1015
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,058
For old times' sake.

1016
01:06:13,404 --> 01:06:17,170
How much?
What's the price?

1017
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:19,140
It's all yours.

1018
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:23,147
I'm giving it back to you.
You don't owe me a cent.

1019
01:06:25,217 --> 01:06:27,651
Tell me, why do I rate this?

1020
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,450
You trying to buy off
your conscience?

1021
01:06:31,323 --> 01:06:33,450
You think I'm sorry
for what I've done to them?

1022
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:35,050
Those foul-mouthed,
whiskey-soaked

1023
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:36,789
Carolina gentlemen?

1024
01:06:36,863 --> 01:06:39,297
I've got them on their knees
begging for mercy!

1025
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:40,458
And I'm glad!

1026
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,798
Nobody's ever
harmed you enough to...

1027
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:43,995
Not enough?

1028
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,935
The way they tramp
back and forth over my life,

1029
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:47,633
treating me like I was trash?

1030
01:06:47,707 --> 01:06:49,368
They never let up.

1031
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:53,436
When I married Jim,
when he died...

1032
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:55,812
and you know
if it wasn't for them

1033
01:06:55,883 --> 01:06:57,043
that you and l...

1034
01:06:59,187 --> 01:07:01,747
Boake, now I've got money.

1035
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:06,187
I can give you
anything... everything.

1036
01:07:07,363 --> 01:07:09,991
Forget your pride.

1037
01:07:10,066 --> 01:07:13,865
I don't care now if you were wrong
or right when you married Tracy.

1038
01:07:13,935 --> 01:07:16,200
I'll never talk about it.

1039
01:07:17,707 --> 01:07:21,164
You're worried about
what people will say.

1040
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:22,905
We can leave.

1041
01:07:22,978 --> 01:07:25,414
We can go
anywhere in the world.

1042
01:07:25,482 --> 01:07:27,278
Oh, Boake.

1043
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:32,309
And they lived
happily ever after.

1044
01:07:34,857 --> 01:07:36,381
Kiss me, Boake.

1045
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,761
- You still feel the same!
- That's right.

1046
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:51,202
Exactly the same.

1047
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,711
There are things
you can change with money, Ruby...

1048
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:04,653
the way you fix your hair,
the way you dress.

1049
01:08:04,722 --> 01:08:10,025
You can buy houses,
dogs, guns, cars.

1050
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,126
You could even
buy some people.

1051
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,102
You can buy a lot of things
with Jim's money, Mrs. Gentry.

1052
01:08:18,105 --> 01:08:20,938
But you can't buy
your way out of the swamp,

1053
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:22,975
and you can't buy me.

1054
01:08:28,683 --> 01:08:30,116
Boake!

1055
01:09:00,618 --> 01:09:05,317
<i>Boake had told her how the land
had been salt marsh for 50 years.</i>

1056
01:09:05,388 --> 01:09:09,688
<i>And now, as hundreds of acres
were drained, plowed, and planted,</i>

1057
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,785
<i>all his hopes and ambitions
were growing there.</i>

1058
01:09:33,986 --> 01:09:36,783
Will you be putting up
your own sign, Mrs. Gentry?

1059
01:09:36,855 --> 01:09:38,585
No.

1060
01:09:40,126 --> 01:09:42,287
That stretch yonder
where nothing's planted

1061
01:09:42,361 --> 01:09:44,192
still has a lot of salt water in it.

1062
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,628
We're clearing it up
as fast as we can.

1063
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:49,157
Turn off the pumps.

1064
01:09:50,136 --> 01:09:52,002
But high tide'll flood it again,

1065
01:09:52,072 --> 01:09:54,472
and you'll be right back
where you started.

1066
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:57,237
I said turn off the pumps.

1067
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:01,111
I can't do it, Mrs. Gentry,
unless I know for sure that...

1068
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,246
Walt!

1069
01:10:10,558 --> 01:10:13,220
He doesn't seem to think
I own this property.

1070
01:10:14,195 --> 01:10:16,163
She owns it, all right.

1071
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:18,756
If I turn off those pumps,

1072
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:20,893
the part that's planted
will get flooded, too!

1073
01:10:20,969 --> 01:10:22,561
In a couple of weeks,
all of the...

1074
01:10:22,638 --> 01:10:24,299
Turn off the pumps.

1075
01:10:24,373 --> 01:10:27,001
And have your men
dig through that dyke.

1076
01:10:27,076 --> 01:10:28,873
Dig through?

1077
01:10:28,944 --> 01:10:31,879
A good, wide ditch.

1078
01:10:31,947 --> 01:10:34,279
I don't want to wait
a couple of weeks.

1079
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:38,316
<i>It was almost as though
Ruby were jealous of the land.</i>

1080
01:10:38,388 --> 01:10:41,983
<i>As though she finally realized
that her only real rival</i>

1081
01:10:42,057 --> 01:10:44,116
<i>for Boake's love was his ambition,</i>

1082
01:10:44,194 --> 01:10:47,459
<i>his determination to be
more than just a Tackman.</i>

1083
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:50,897
<i>And so, almost as if
it was another woman</i>

1084
01:10:50,967 --> 01:10:53,801
<i>who stood between her
and the man she loved,</i>

1085
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:56,499
<i>Ruby attacked the land
and destroyed it...</i>

1086
01:10:56,574 --> 01:11:00,010
<i>and watching,
felt a bitter satisfaction.</i>

1087
01:11:01,379 --> 01:11:06,078
<i>What Ruby had never understood
was that a man and his dreams,</i>

1088
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,746
<i>a man and his work,
are one and the same.</i>

1089
01:11:09,822 --> 01:11:11,721
<i>Boake had tramped
those fields,</i>

1090
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,655
<i>had dug in the muck
with his own hands,</i>

1091
01:11:13,725 --> 01:11:16,023
<i>and put all his strength
and mind and will</i>

1092
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:19,222
<i>into making those
frail plants grow.</i>

1093
01:11:39,819 --> 01:11:41,378
Got a cigarette?

1094
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:47,485
Match?

1095
01:11:59,307 --> 01:12:01,400
Let's get out of here.

1096
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:15,989
A long way from home...

1097
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,755
A long way...

1098
01:12:36,547 --> 01:12:40,005
Ruby, baby,
sure glad to see you.

1099
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:42,917
Couldn't start duck season
without my sugar.

1100
01:12:42,986 --> 01:12:45,012
- Hi, Pop.
- Hello, honey.

1101
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:48,256
You got some gun
you can loan me, Jud?

1102
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:52,228
Sure, I got that sixteen-gauge
with a full choke.

1103
01:12:52,297 --> 01:12:53,423
Fine.

1104
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,830
Only thing is the muzzle blast.

1105
01:12:55,901 --> 01:12:56,890
I got this compensator.

1106
01:12:56,969 --> 01:12:59,460
Let me see that gun, Cullen.
I've always wanted it.

1107
01:12:59,538 --> 01:13:00,869
Ruby.

1108
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:04,267
Mrs. Gentry.

1109
01:13:04,344 --> 01:13:06,437
Jud didn't say
he was expecting you.

1110
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:07,844
We heard a car
drive up, but...

1111
01:13:07,914 --> 01:13:11,111
You didn't say you were planning
on hunting with us today, Boake.

1112
01:13:11,184 --> 01:13:14,313
I didn't know I was going to
till just a little while ago.

1113
01:13:15,555 --> 01:13:17,352
Sit down, gentlemen.

1114
01:13:20,928 --> 01:13:23,090
- New gun?
- Yes, it is.

1115
01:13:24,065 --> 01:13:25,224
English.

1116
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:27,028
I ordered it through Ginter.

1117
01:13:27,935 --> 01:13:32,031
- I read an ad for this gun.
- Yeah, in a gun and rod journal.

1118
01:13:32,106 --> 01:13:35,008
It's listed at nearly $2,000.

1119
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,503
You must be feeling prosperous.

1120
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:41,447
I ordered it last summer.
That was back in the palmy days.

1121
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,653
I made up my mind
I was gonna hunt with it once

1122
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,244
before I put it up for sale.

1123
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,756
Yes, these are
mighty lean times.

1124
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:51,317
I was just thinking
it's a lucky thing for us

1125
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:54,056
that there's a limit
on ducks, Mrs. Gentry.

1126
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,361
You limiting me to the limit?

1127
01:13:56,433 --> 01:14:01,496
No, we're just hoping you'll
be generous and leave us a few.

1128
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,172
To better times, gentlemen.

1129
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:09,710
It's bound to come.
We've weathered worse than this.

1130
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:13,682
Droughts and floods
and Yankee invasion.

1131
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:14,877
You didn't drink.

1132
01:14:14,953 --> 01:14:16,978
To better times.

1133
01:14:17,055 --> 01:14:20,751
When the swamp trotters
take over and turn the whole world

1134
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:23,488
into a stinking swamp.

1135
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:21,481
Let's go back.

1136
01:16:21,555 --> 01:16:23,580
What's the matter?

1137
01:16:23,657 --> 01:16:25,591
Don't you like it here?

1138
01:16:27,326 --> 01:16:30,922
- Maybe you're afraid.
- Of what?

1139
01:16:30,998 --> 01:16:32,364
Me...

1140
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:35,026
of the kind of man I am now.

1141
01:16:36,437 --> 01:16:38,700
Boake, you're hurting me.

1142
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:42,737
You finally got me, Ruby.

1143
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:45,437
You got me
where you want me.

1144
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:48,505
But you don't like it, do you?

1145
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:50,950
I don't mind you
taking the land,

1146
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:53,853
but why did you
have to scuttle it?

1147
01:16:53,922 --> 01:16:56,914
Why do you have
to ruin everything you touch?

1148
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:59,460
Boake, I loved you so much!

1149
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:02,895
Ruby, it's good
to see you afraid.

1150
01:17:09,472 --> 01:17:12,839
Go on, kill me.

1151
01:17:12,909 --> 01:17:18,142
I was wrong...
I didn't know...

1152
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:21,647
Boake, I didn't want this.

1153
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:23,380
Oh, Ruby.

1154
01:17:23,454 --> 01:17:27,618
When I think
what it could have been...

1155
01:17:39,604 --> 01:17:42,004
They shall be bound together,

1156
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,601
and thrown into a fiery pit.

1157
01:17:47,145 --> 01:17:49,046
It's Jewel.

1158
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:52,714
Woe unto her
in her iniquity.

1159
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:55,746
Get over there.
Behind there.

1160
01:17:57,356 --> 01:18:01,919
Incense she burned,
and she decked herself with pearls.

1161
01:18:01,994 --> 01:18:05,191
I can't tell where he is.

1162
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:09,226
Come on! Through here!

1163
01:18:17,312 --> 01:18:19,280
Over there! Keep low!

1164
01:18:23,451 --> 01:18:24,544
Down there!

1165
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:28,286
Under there!

1166
01:18:37,165 --> 01:18:41,227
Woman is the very root
of wickedness.

1167
01:18:41,304 --> 01:18:44,432
In her beauty, a snare.

1168
01:18:44,508 --> 01:18:47,534
The Lord strengthens
the hand of the righteous

1169
01:18:47,611 --> 01:18:49,579
to strike down the sinner.

1170
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:51,671
Jewel! Have you gone crazy?

1171
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
Come on.

1172
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:25,983
Get up that bank!

1173
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:48,575
Say you love me.

1174
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:50,870
Boake, say you love me.

1175
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,768
The wages of sin is death!

1176
01:21:13,733 --> 01:21:16,530
Boake...

1177
01:21:16,603 --> 01:21:17,968
What have I done?

1178
01:21:19,272 --> 01:21:21,103
What have I done?

1179
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:44,929
<i>Yes, Ruby Gentry was born
on the wrong side of the tracks,</i>

1180
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,026
<i>and the people of Braddock
never let her forget it.</i>
