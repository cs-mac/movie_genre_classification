1
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:46,005
Hey, don't let the
heat out, boy!

2
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,508
I didn't expect
to find you here. What happened?

3
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,512
Her dad caught us
in the parlor.

4
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,015
You need lessons, son.

5
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,019
Sally's a nice girl, though.

6
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,021
Nice and common.

7
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,024
Common as dirt, like me.

8
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,527
My dear wife spent the
evening writing home.

9
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,921
Morning, Miss Drury.

10
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,427
That stupid boy's got
them all soaked, Mr. Lewis.

11
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,429
That's mine, I think, Mr. Lewis.

12
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,824
A little read before church.

13
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,350
I'll pluck your ears off.

14
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:25,352
Jimmy, I'm trying to better myself.
Now let em get on with it, you horrible man.

15
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,857
Jimmy, gimme that paper!

16
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:29,859
Give it to him,
for Heaven's sake.

17
00:08:29,894 --> 00:08:31,861
Jimmy, I can't think.

18
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:32,862
She can't think.

19
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:34,480
You've never thought
in years, have you?

20
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:36,983
At why don't you leave all th

21
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,484
and sit down for a bit?

22
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,986
You look tired.

23
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,988
Oh, I won't be much longer.

24
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,992
Yeah. She's a beautiful girl, isn't she?

25
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,494
That's what they all tell me.

26
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,021
Wrap it up, will you?

27
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,522
Stop ringing those bells!

28
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,908
There's somebody going mad in here!

29
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:19,909
I don't want to hear them!

30
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,912
miss Drury will be up in a minute.

31
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:23,913
I don't give a damn
for miss Drury!

32
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:25,915
In any case, she's
probably in church by now

33
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,416
swinging on those
bloody bells.

34
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,418
Why sneer at people
who go to church?

35
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,820
Listen, that nice
old gentlewoman doesn't fool me,

36
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:33,923
even if she takes in you.

37
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:37,426
She's a foul-minded robber.

38
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,929
She bleeds us white
for this place as it is.

39
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,436
What about mummy?

40
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:49,939
How does mummy spend
her day of rest?

41
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,442
We usually go...

42
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,945
"Thank you, dear vicar,
for the nice, cozy sermon."

43
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,846
And then she tramples off
over better men's graves,

44
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,951
home to an orgy of curry.

45
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:06,453
Mummy and daddy, and brother Nigel
if he's up from town.

46
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:09,959
You know her brother Nigel?

47
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:11,460
No, I don't.

48
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,963
Well, you've never heard so
many well-bred commonplaces

49
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:16,465
come from beneath
the same bowler hat.

50
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,968
The platitude from outer space...

51
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:20,469
that's brother Nigel.

52
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:22,471
Why don't you dry up, boy?

53
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,596
Wouldn't you say that
was her private property?

54
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,099
I like to know when
I'm being betrayed.

55
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,102
Letters from her mother,

56
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:39,603
letters in which I'm not mentioned,
because my name is just a dirty word.

57
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,610
And what does she do?

58
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,612
She writes long letters back to mummy

59
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,114
and doesn't mention me at all,

60
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,616
because my name is just
a dirty word to her, too.

61
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,968
The little woman's family.

62
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,970
God help m e, I'll go out of my mind

63
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:11,971
if he doesn't stop
in a minute.

64
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,472
Why don't you?

65
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,475
That would be
something, anyway.

66
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,478
Don't let the Marquess of
queensberry manner fool you.

67
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,479
They'll kick you in the groin

68
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,981
while you're handing
your hat to the maid.

69
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,983
Jimmy, please don't go on.

70
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,985
they're either militant,
like her mummy and daddy,

71
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,987
militant, arrogant, and full of malice,

72
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,990
or else they're vague, like Nigel...

73
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:31,991
and her.

74
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,495
Nigel and Alison.

75
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,497
They're what they sound like:

76
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,500
sycophantic, phlegmatic, and pusillanimous.

77
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,501
Big words.

78
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,502
Would you like to hear what they mean?

79
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,504
No, not interested.

80
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,008
Soapy, stodgy, and dim.

81
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,509
Sounds like
a musical act.

82
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,012
Ladies and gentlemen,
those old favorites,

83
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,514
your friends and mine,
soapy, stodgy, and dim.

84
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,516
bringing quips
and strips for you,

85
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,521
Ladies and gentlemen,

86
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,522
as I was coming to the theater tonight,

87
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,024
a man comes up to me and he says...

88
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,525
Have you seen nobody?

89
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,527
Have I seen who?
ave you seen nobody?

90
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,528
Of course I haven't seen nobody.

91
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,030
Kindly, don't waste my time.

92
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,531
Ladies and gentlemen, a
little recitation entitled

93
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:16,033
"She was only a gravedigger's daughter
but she loved lying under the sod."

94
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,536
Are you quite sure you haven't
seen nobody?

95
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,038
Of course I haven't seen nobody.

96
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,539
Will you kindly go away?

97
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,042
Can't you see I'm trying to
entertain this lady here?

98
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,544
The lady pusillanimous.

99
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,049
I can't find nobody
anywhere. See...

100
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,051
Well, then, shall we dance?

101
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,054
Come here often, do you?

102
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,555
Only in the mating season.

103
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,556
All right. Very funny. Very funny.

104
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,558
not until you apologize
for being nasty to everyone.

105
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,461
Do you think bosoms
will be in or out this year, my dear?

106
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,065
Your teeth will be out
in a minute.

107
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,566
We'll see about that.

108
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,568
Look out, for Heaven's sake!

109
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,570
This place gets more like a zoo every day.

110
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,572
Proper coward, he is. See?

111
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,577
Are you all right?

112
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,579
Well, does it look like it?

113
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,081
She's burned her arm.

114
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,090
You think I did it on purpose?

115
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,475
Clear out of my sight!

116
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,322
Here, come and sit down, eh?

117
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,830
Now, let's have a look.

118
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,833
That's gonna be painful.

119
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:39,335
What shall I do with it?

120
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,338
It's nothing much.
A bit of soap on it will do.

121
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:44,340
There's some in the kitchen.

122
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,848
Now, give us your arm.

123
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,351
I'm gonna do it
ever so gently.

124
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:02,358
That better?

125
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:05,361
You're a brave girl.

126
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:07,863
I don't feel very brave.

127
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:10,866
I really don't
care for...

128
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:13,369
I don't think I can take much more.

129
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,872
I think I feel rather sick.

130
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,874
All over now.

131
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,891
I don't think I could
live on my own again,

132
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,893
in spite of everything.

133
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,898
Pretty rough and pretty
ordinary, really.

134
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,900
I'd seem worse on my own.

135
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,405
And you get fond
of people, too.

136
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,407
Worse luck.

137
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:54,908
I don't think I want anything more
to do with love.

138
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,413
Not anymore,
I can't take it on

139
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:00,416
You're too young to start giving up.

140
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,419
Too young and too lovely.

141
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,925
I keep looking back
as far as I remember,

142
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:13,427
and I can't think
what it was like to feel young...

143
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,431
really young.

144
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,433
Jimmy said the same
thing to me the other day,

145
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,435
and I pretended not to be listening,

146
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,438
because I thought it would
hurt him, I suppose...

147
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,940
but I knew just what he meant.

148
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:26,942
Oh, I suppose it would
have been so easy to say,

149
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:29,945
"Yes, darling,
I know what you mean,

150
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,947
I know how you're feeling."

151
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,951
it's those easy things that seem to be

152
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,953
so impossible with us.

153
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,957
I'm wondering how much
longer I can go on...

154
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:45,961
watching you two tearing the
insides out of each other.

155
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:48,964
You wouldn't seriously
think of leaving us?

156
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:50,966
What is it, lovely?

157
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,471
I'm frightened.

158
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,976
How's things?

159
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:51,977
Lousy.

160
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,488
I got the lot here, boyo.

161
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,990
Humbugs, mint lumps, jelly babies.

162
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,492
14 pounds of jelly babies.

163
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,993
What do you want to
get all those for?

164
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,294
Kids have got a craze on.

165
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,996
They'd better have.

166
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,013
What's this?

167
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,517
You know the regulations.
All foodstuffs 18 inches off the ground.

168
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,655
He was just unloading.

169
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,657
These sweets is human food.

170
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,661
I could have your license for that.

171
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,165
Porter... easy, isn't it?

172
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,668
I should be more careful
in future, if I was you...

173
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,170
not so cocky.

174
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,177
Comrade Hurst...

175
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:00,679
Commissar of the Kinley
Urban District Council.

176
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,182
I'd like to kick him in the teeth.

177
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,686
Mister, six pen's worth
of jelly babies, please.

178
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,193
You see, Cliff, you gotta study the market.

179
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,205
I hope she didn't make
a mess of your nice coat.

180
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,207
No, it's all right.

181
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,208
How old is she?

182
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,210
Only 15 months.

183
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,711
But she's that big...

184
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:38,217
Are you going in, Miss?

185
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,720
She doesn't take to 'er?

186
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,722
Funny how they know about people.

187
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,228
just relax a minute.

188
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:51,230
I'll put something on that burn.

189
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,733
- How did you do it?
- On the iron. I was careless.

190
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,739
Does your husband know about the baby?

191
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,244
In the next few months,
you're going to depend

192
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,248
a great deal on his
help and consideration.

193
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:13,249
- What's his profession?
- He has a sweet stall in the market.

194
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,256
I thought you told me once
he was a university graduate.

195
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,764
Is it too late to do anything?

196
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,768
I didn't hear
that question.

197
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,275
I hope you won't ask it again
- of anyone.

198
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,277
Or try to do
anything foolish.

199
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:45,784
I'm getting hungry.

200
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,786
You're a bloody pig.

201
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,289
I'm not a pig. I just like food,
that's all.

202
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,291
Like it? You're like a sexual maniac,

203
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:53,792
only, with you,
it's food.

204
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,294
You'll end up in
the news of the world, you wait.

205
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,299
"James Porter, age 25,
was bound over last week

206
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:31,800
after pleading guilty to interfering
with a small cabbage and tins of beans.

207
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,304
The accused said he hadn't been
feeling well for some time

208
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,806
and had been
having blackouts."

209
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,808
Hey, there's ma Tanner.

210
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,315
It's good to see you.

211
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,317
You look wonderful, ma.

212
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,319
Hello, son.
How are you?

213
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:21,320
Keepin' well?

214
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,323
You have got it nice.

215
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:25,824
- You approve?
- Yes.

216
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,826
Does you justice?
You bet.

217
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:30,328
- How long do you got, ma?
- Well, I'm only up for the day.

218
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:31,830
I came up to see me old man's grave.

219
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,332
Well, let's go and have a drink.

220
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,333
Oh, can you leave?

221
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:35,334
Yeah, and a bite to eat.

222
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,335
He's hungry.

223
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:39,838
He's runnin' off with me.

224
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,340
You want to watch him.

225
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,842
Who's the old girl, there?

226
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,344
She was his landlady,

227
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,346
set him up in this stall.

228
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,858
Oh, I do love a
port and lemon...

229
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,477
proper charlady's
tipple, isn't it?

230
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,983
Well, how's everything going, jim?

231
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:10,485
The stall is doing fine.

232
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,987
I know that, son.

233
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,488
You'll have paid
me off soon,

234
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:16,491
and I shall be able to
retire to the south of france.

235
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,995
I owe you a lot, ma.

236
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,997
You don't owe me
nothing, son.

237
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:29,504
Sometimes I've wondered
whether I did the right thing.

238
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,010
Oh, look who's here.

239
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,512
We was just
talking about you.

240
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,904
Jimmy, I wanted to talk to you.

241
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,906
Let me get you a little something.

242
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,411
Your hubby's been
doing the honors up to now

243
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:53,912
Come on, dear. It'll buck you up.

244
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,414
I don't want a drink, really.

245
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,173
That's whatshe's used to.

246
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:11,179
you're rig ht on for m, aren't you?

247
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,180
Look down your nose at her again and I'll-

248
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:15,183
l just couldn't bear to be touched

249
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:16,685
you made that
perfectly plain.

250
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,186
Did I?

251
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,188
She's only here
for a few hours.

252
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:24,189
Why don't you go ahead
and really spoil them for her?

253
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:31,814
- What about you, ma? Not taking anything?
- No, better not. This will do me.

254
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,825
I was just going to have a
look at me husband's grave,

255
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,326
make sure it's
been kept nice.

256
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:43,829
You know, if you don't
keep your eye on things,

257
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,831
people pinch the flower vases,

258
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,333
and the grass grows
all over the place.

259
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,836
I wouldn't like him to
think I neglected him.

260
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,838
That's quite a walk to the cemetery

261
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:53,839
up that steep hill.

262
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:57,843
Yes, especially
with my feet, dear.

263
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,845
Blimey, look at the time.
I'd better be goin' along.

264
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,346
Good thing you
reminded me.

265
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,848
There's no need
to go yet, ma.

266
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:03,849
There's plenty of time.

267
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,350
But I've got to buy me flowers yet,

268
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,853
and I promised my sister
I wouldn't be late back.

269
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,855
You sit still, dear,
and finish your drink.

270
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,356
Well, I've
- she's signing the pledge, ma.

271
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,862
I wish I'd done that years ago.

272
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,363
This way, ma.

273
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:41,636
now, who's got nice flowers?

274
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,637
I'll get 'em for you, ma.

275
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,139
No, I got to buy 'em.

276
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,281
I'll see you in a minute, ma.

277
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:55,400
I went to the doctor this morning.

278
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,402
So I see.

279
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,405
did you tell him
what happened?

280
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,907
But I didn't go.

281
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,408
did you te ll him I did it deliberately

282
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,910
"I'm terrified
of him, doctor.

283
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,411
Can't you think of a nice,
quiet asylum

284
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,413
where we can safely
lock him up?"

285
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,916
But it needs
doctors to certify a person.

286
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,418
Better get another before
that heals up.

287
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:18,924
what is it, lovely?

288
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,926
Nothing.

289
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,928
I said "what is it?"

290
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:24,930
you see,

291
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,933
I'm pregnant.

292
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,935
Two choc ices, please.

293
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:34,439
We don't sell them. Try down there.

294
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,442
Have you told Jimmy yet?

295
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,444
I tried to just now.

296
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,949
Hey, lovely, you've g ot to tell him.

297
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,471
Oh, you've done wonders with it, son.

298
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,726
Now, what's the time?

299
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,728
You've got plenty of time yet.

300
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:20,735
Oh, we had lots of fun, him and me,

301
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,238
bein' alive, you know,

302
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,739
just being alive.

303
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:30,245
That's enough for an
old girl like me,

304
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,749
chewin' the cud and havin'
a nip of what you fancy.

305
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,253
Wouldn't do if we was all
like that, would it, mate, eh?

306
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,257
Would it, mate?

307
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:53,268
What do you
really want, Jimmy?

308
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,533
There, now, it's
going to rain.

309
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,535
Look at me keeping you
out here in all this.

310
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,040
Upsy-daisy.

311
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,042
He was quite happy

312
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,544
in his own little way, you know.

313
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,546
He was doing
what he wanted

314
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,048
mind you, I don't reckon

315
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,550
he'd ever been a Henry Irving,

316
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,552
but you know what I mean.

317
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,942
Helena?

318
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,945
Yes, that will be
perfectly all right.

319
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:39,447
Yes, come along in about half an hour.

320
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,951
Thank you, Miss Drury.

321
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:46,454
If Mr. Lewis doesn't
mind giving up his room.

322
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,956
Oh, no. It's all right by me.

323
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:49,457
But no one seems to care about

324
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:51,459
Poor Arnold's supper. Do they, darling?

325
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:52,460
come along.

326
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:53,962
That was good
of you, Cliff.

327
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:57,463
Forget it, darling.
Always wanted to sleep on the landing.

328
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,466
Who is this Helena?

329
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:02,470
She's going to be working at the theatre

330
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:03,972
for the next couple of weeks.

331
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:04,973
Actress, is she?

332
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,475
Yes. So, when she telephoned...

333
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,980
I needed someone to talk to

334
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:14,482
do you understand, Cliff?

335
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:16,484
All right, darling.

336
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,990
Hey, lovely, does Jimmy know this Helena?

337
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:23,491
Yes. He hates her.

338
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,616
I took up a lot
of your time.

339
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,357
Oh, can you manage?

340
00:27:55,392 --> 00:27:56,358
fine.

341
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,864
I better shift the
ladies, I suppose.

342
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:04,866
I mean, if she's a bit proper.

343
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,449
How's it feeling now?

344
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:57,919
It wasn't anything.

345
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,876
There's no need.

346
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,377
I mean it.

347
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,886
I did do it on purpose.

348
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,396
There's hardly a moment

349
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,399
when I'm not watching and wanting you.

350
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,401
Nearly years of being
in the same room with you,

351
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,403
and I still can't stop
my sweat breaking out

352
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,406
when I see you doing
something as ordinary as

353
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,408
leaning over an ironing board.

354
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,920
Trouble is you get used to people.

355
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:52,421
Even their trivialities
become indispensable to you.

356
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,926
Indispensable.

357
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,929
And a little mysterious.

358
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,940
I think I must have a lot of old stock.

359
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,942
And nobody wants it.

360
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,961
What shall we do tonight?

361
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,462
What would you like to do?

362
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:32,847
Drink?

363
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:34,349
No, I know what I'd like to do now.

364
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:36,351
Well, you'll have to
wait till the proper time.

365
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:38,353
There's no such thing

366
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,856
you're very beautiful.

367
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,478
Beautiful great-eyed squirrel
hoarding, nut-munching squirrel,

368
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,984
with highly-polished,
gleaming fur

369
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,485
And an ostrich feather of a tail.

370
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,988
How I envy you.

371
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,495
Bears and squirrels are marvelous.

372
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,998
Marvelous and cute.

373
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,499
What the hell's that?

374
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,501
That's a dance squirrels
do when they're happy.

375
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,504
What makes you think that you are happy?

376
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:30,655
you know, there was something
I was meaning to tell you.

377
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,156
Alison.

378
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,660
Your friend...
she's arrived.

379
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,164
Downstairs.

380
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,668
What friend?

381
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:46,170
Helena charles. I... I meant to explain.

382
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,673
She telephoned.

383
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,676
She's going to play at
the theatre next week.

384
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,177
I see.

385
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,680
She said, "Can I come over?"

386
00:31:55,715 --> 00:32:00,582
and you said, "My husband, Jimmy,
if you'll pardon my using such a dirty word,

387
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,186
will be delighted to see you.
He'll kick your teeth in!"

388
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,690
- I asked her to stay.
- You did what?

389
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,193
Well, she couldn't find
anywhere else to stay.

390
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:09,694
That I don't believe.

391
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,195
So I said she could come here

392
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,697
until she fixes
somewhere else.

393
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,198
Did you tell her to wear her armor?

394
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,199
She's going to need it.

395
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,201
Why don't you
shut up, please?

396
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,203
My dear wife,

397
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:21,205
you have so much to learn.

398
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,707
If only something...

399
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,208
something would happen to waken you

400
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,710
From your beauty sleep

401
00:32:25,745 --> 00:32:29,712
if you could have a child
and it would die.

402
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,715
Let it grow.

403
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:36,217
Let a recognizable human face emerge from this
little mass of India rubber and wrinkles.

404
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:39,724
Oh, please, if only
I could see you face that.

405
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,728
You know, I've never had
the great pleasure of lovemaking.

406
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:47,231
When I didn't desire it myself.

407
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,733
It's not that she doesn't have
her own kind of passion, she does.

408
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,738
She just devours me whole every time,
as if I was so me over-large rabbit.

409
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:59,242
and then lies back,
like a puffed-out python to sleep it off.

410
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,746
That's me
- that bulge around the navel there.

411
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:03,748
It's me, if you're wondering what it is.

412
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:06,750
You'd think this indigestible mass
would stir up some kind of tremor,

413
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:10,253
from those distended, overfed tripes
but not her!

414
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,257
She'll go on sleeping and devouring
until there's nothing left of me!

415
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:36,948
Good evening.

416
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:38,449
Evening, Miss Charles.

417
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:46,207
Did you manage all right?

418
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:47,709
I'm quite enjoying it.

419
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,711
I don't think I shall ever get used to

420
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:50,712
having go down
to the bathroom

421
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:52,213
every time I want water for something.

422
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:53,715
It is primitive, isn't it?

423
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,720
Oh, God, I wish he'd
lose that damned trumpet.

424
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,722
Well, I imagine it's
for my benefit.

425
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:02,223
Miss Drury will ask us to go soon.

426
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:05,226
I know she will.
Listen to him.

427
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:07,729
Do you know she was
actual ly taking that dog

428
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:09,731
Into the bathroom?
I think she was going to bathe it.

429
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:11,733
You mean Arnold!

430
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,737
Oh, that's better.

431
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,241
Does he drink?

432
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:24,745
Oh, he's not an alcoholic,
if that's what yuo mean.

433
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:27,749
Oh, that trumpet!

434
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:29,250
It's almost as if he wanted

435
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,651
to kill someone with it,
and me, in particular

436
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:34,254
never seen such hatred
in somebody's eyes before.

437
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,757
It's slightly
horrifying.

438
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:37,258
These go here?

439
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,762
Horrifying.

440
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:43,264
Oddly exciting.

441
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:50,269
- Why did you?
- Marry him?

442
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,274
There must be about
six different answers.

443
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:58,278
I met him at a party.
He'd come there on his bicycle,

444
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,282
and there was oil all over his jacket.

445
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:03,785
It had been such
a lovely day.

446
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,788
Everything about him
seemed to burn.

447
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:11,793
His face, the edges of his hair glistened,

448
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:14,912
and his eyes were so
blue and full of the sun.

449
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,048
So you took him on.

450
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,550
There never seemed to be any choice.

451
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,552
Did he love you?

452
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,556
A howl of outrage went up from my family.

453
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,058
Well, you can see their point.

454
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:28,559
And that did it.

455
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,562
He made up his mind to marry me,

456
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:35,066
went into battle with the
ax swinging round his head,

457
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:36,567
frail and so full of fire.

458
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,069
I've never seen
anything like it.

459
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,570
A knight in shining armor.

460
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,074
Except that his armor really
didn't shine very much.

461
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,578
Oh, God, now he's
started her up.

462
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,700
Mr. Porter!

463
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:53,701
Arnold's having a heart attack!

464
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,705
Stuff that flamin' thing
away somewhere, will you?

465
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,211
You like it, all right.

466
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:07,113
Anybody who doesn't like jazz
has no real feeling for music or for people.

467
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,349
Rubbish.

468
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,351
See what I mean?

469
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:12,854
I thought of the title of a new song.

470
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:14,355
It's called...

471
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,857
"You can quit hanging
around my counter, Mildred,

472
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:18,860
'cause you'll find my position is closed."

473
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:21,362
Very good.

474
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:22,864
Glad you like it.

475
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:24,866
If I can slip in
a religious angle,

476
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,368
it might be a big hit.
Don't you think so?

477
00:36:27,403 --> 00:36:29,370
Why do you try so
hard to be unpleasant?

478
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:32,373
Do you have to be so offensive?

479
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,876
You think I'm being offensive?
Now?

480
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,379
She underestimates me, doesn't she?

481
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,381
I think you're a very tiresome young man.

482
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:45,584
"Oh, dear, oh, dear, my wife's friends.
Pass lady bracknell the cucumber sandwiches."

483
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:50,390
I'm going out to the jazz club.
You want to come?

484
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:52,393
Chris barber's
second night.

485
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:53,394
What about you?
You want to come?

486
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:55,396
I'm going out with Helena.

487
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:58,399
That's not a direction.
That's an affliction.

488
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,272
I feel so tired.

489
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:08,276
I dread him coming
into the room.

490
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:11,279
Listen, darling, you've got to tell him.

491
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,781
Either he learns to behave
like everyone else or...

492
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,785
Or you've got to get out
of this menagerie.

493
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:20,288
He doesn't know what love
or anything else means.

494
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,790
You see that bear and that squirrel?

495
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:26,928
Well, that's him,
and that's me.

496
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:28,929
You mean to tell me he's a bit fey
as well as everything else?

497
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:32,433
There's nothing fey about Jimmy.

498
00:37:32,468 --> 00:37:35,436
It's the one way we have
of escaping from everything.

499
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,940
A sort of a silly symphony for people

500
00:37:38,975 --> 00:37:41,943
who can't bear the pain of
being human beings any longer.

501
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,947
Won't it work?

502
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:47,949
Only if you blow it, dear.

503
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:49,951
Why don't you get in there
and liven things up a bit?

504
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:51,953
Is the funny thing

505
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:52,453
I think I can understand, for instance,

506
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:55,955
how Alison's daddy felt
when he came back from India.

507
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:57,959
The old edwardian brigade made

508
00:37:57,994 --> 00:38:00,461
their brief little world
look pretty tempting.

509
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:07,468
High summer, long days in the sun,

510
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:13,972
slim volumes of verse,
bright ideas, bright uniform.

511
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,147
A romantic picture.
Phony, too, of course.

512
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,650
It must have rained sometimes.

513
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:27,915
I must say, it's
pretty dreary

514
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,917
living in the American age.

515
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:32,920
Unless, of course, you're an American,

516
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,423
perhaps all our children will be Americans.

517
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:37,425
That's a thought, isn't it?

518
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:39,927
I said, "That's a thought!"

519
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,434
forget about Helena.

520
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,436
She's only trying to help.

521
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:52,656
That unmarried
mother superior.

522
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:55,558
Black-hearted, evil-minded,
and vicious.

523
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,683
Oh, you've done it all.
I shouldn't have let you.

524
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,186
You've got to take
care of yourself now.

525
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,189
Everything seems
very different

526
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:26,690
with you here now.

527
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,192
Does it?

528
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,194
Before, I was on my own.

529
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,199
Now you've got me.

530
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:38,202
You're not sorry you asked me to stay?

531
00:40:38,237 --> 00:40:39,703
No, of course not.

532
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,708
Cheer up, boyo.

533
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:47,211
You look like a laxative commercial...

534
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:48,712
before.

535
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,717
Up early today, aren't we?

536
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:54,718
I wanted to get everything done

537
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,720
before I had to go to rehearsal.

538
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:59,723
Alison mustn't tire herself.

539
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,225
Looking after one man is enough,

540
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,726
but two is quite an undertaking.

541
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:05,229
Cliff looks after himself.

542
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:08,796
Well, I can't say I've noticed it

543
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:10,298
let's put you in your
place, you welsh trash.

544
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:17,305
Are you a good actress?

545
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:20,308
Since we're going
to be stuck with you

546
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:22,810
for two solid weeks, I
only hope it's worthwhile,

547
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:25,313
that it adds to the sum of human happiness.

548
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:29,817
My egg's hard. Is yours?

549
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:30,818
I haven't seen yet.

550
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:33,321
Can't cook, either, can you?

551
00:41:34,822 --> 00:41:36,324
what's this play of yours called?

552
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:37,825
"The forgotten heart".

553
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:41,329
Yes, I remember.

554
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,331
"A penetrating examination of love

555
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:44,832
and personal relationships."

556
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:47,334
Ran for two years in the West End.
Could you do that?

557
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:50,836
The bloke who wrote that
was never in a woman's bedroom...

558
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:52,340
not even his mother's when she found out

559
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,342
the truth about him.

560
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:56,844
Coming to rehearsal this morning, Alison?

561
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:59,346
Well, I've got things to do
they'll keep.

562
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:01,849
What are you two plotting?

563
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:04,850
Don't you think we've had enough
of the heavy villain?

564
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:06,854
Are you going to let yourself be taken in

565
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:10,358
by this saint in Dior's clothing?

566
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:12,360
Shall I tell you the
simple truth about her?

567
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,363
She is a cow.

568
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:17,865
I wouldn't mind that so much,
but she's in danger of becoming

569
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,367
a sacred cow, as well.

570
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:24,372
I'll help you wash up before I go.

571
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,877
Your slip is
showing, dear.

572
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:34,882
Behold the ball
that ben hogan lost.

573
00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:48,145
My name is Johnny Kapoor.

574
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,647
My name is Jimmy porter.
This is Cliff Lewis.

575
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:53,150
Nice market here.

576
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:56,153
I applied for a license.

577
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,155
Let's see your stock

578
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,162
they'll sell a
t these prices?

579
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:09,166
Cheap stuff, eh?

580
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:10,668
Where'd you get it?

581
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:12,169
From a warehouse?

582
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:14,922
It is not stolen.

583
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:19,927
There's yo ur license. Fill it in.

584
00:43:19,962 --> 00:43:22,930
And just keep your nose clean, that's all.

585
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:25,933
I've got my eye on some of you smart boys

586
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:28,436
that's right, Porter

587
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:31,439
One of these days...

588
00:43:32,975 --> 00:43:34,825
let's see what
you've got here.

589
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,827
Look, Jimmy, what about this red shirt?

590
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:37,829
Match your eyes.

591
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:41,332
Hello, lovely.

592
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:42,333
Can I have some money, Jimmy?

593
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:43,834
What for?

594
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:44,835
I'm meeting Helena for lunch.

595
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,337
Well, let her pay.

596
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:49,340
don't make me feel like a pauper.

597
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,841
I want you to meet a n ew friend of mine

598
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:53,344
this is Mr. Kapoor. My wife.

599
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:55,346
Her family spent many years in India

600
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:57,348
grew to love the country and the people

601
00:43:57,383 --> 00:43:58,849
Then I am most delighted.

602
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,351
How do you do?

603
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,353
You two should have a lot
to talk about sometime

604
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,855
Yes, perhaps.

605
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,857
Still the master race.

606
00:44:06,892 --> 00:44:10,361
Here. Take memsahib out for tiffin

607
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:16,367
how about this one, then?

608
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:18,369
Cliff, how's your heart this morning?

609
00:44:18,404 --> 00:44:19,870
what do you mean?

610
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:21,872
You fancy watching dame
Helena fl og herself to death

611
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:26,877
Take sight of my pitch, for me, will you?

612
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:27,878
Yes, sir.

613
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:29,380
See you, Johnny.

614
00:44:29,415 --> 00:44:32,383
Look at this, then. Hey,
hey, come and look at this

615
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:32,883
real cheap.

616
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:35,386
Do you want to buy?

617
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:36,387
There are other stalls here,

618
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:37,888
same line of business.

619
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:39,890
But you sit in that great, beautiful,

620
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:41,892
impossible house of yours in somerset

621
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:43,894
buried in your trollope.

622
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:46,897
Who wrote this filthy thing?

623
00:44:46,932 --> 00:44:49,900
Jimmy, what are you here for?

624
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:53,404
But, Ann, I've tried to understand.

625
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:56,407
We could be doing something
useful together, Ann.

626
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:57,908
Won't you come back?

627
00:44:57,943 --> 00:44:59,410
Go on, Annie girl, have a go.

628
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,413
Oh, Jimmy, please don't interrupt again.

629
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:05,916
You'd better go, Henry.

630
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,801
Cut.

631
00:45:24,836 --> 00:45:27,086
Ladies and gentlemen,
as I was on my way to the theater tonight,

632
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:29,056
passing the stage door,
a man comes up to me.

633
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:30,558
I say... here.

634
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:32,560
Have you seen nobody?
Have I seen who?

635
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:34,562
What's going on?
Who are you?

636
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:37,565
Ladies and gentlemen, a
little recitation entitled

637
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:41,567
"She was only a monkey's daughter,
but my, how she handled her nuts." Thank you.

638
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,071
Will you kindly go away?

639
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:46,900
I can't find nobody anywhere,
and I'm supposed to give him this case.

640
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,975
- Nobody?
- Yes.

641
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,077
Jimmy, get out of here!

642
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,466
Now let me get this straight,
sonny boy...

643
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:01,972
Nobody, nobody, came.

644
00:46:06,512 --> 00:46:07,344
Who's that down there?

645
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:09,346
Nobody.

646
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:11,348
Then give
him his bloody case.

647
00:46:11,383 --> 00:46:12,850
Who do you think you're?

648
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,602
I'll deal with this.
What do you mean by this?

649
00:46:14,637 --> 00:46:17,203
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm her landlord, guy.

650
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,607
Yeah, she promised
us an audition...

651
00:46:21,143 --> 00:46:22,109
Is he your landlord?

652
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:23,611
No. Yeah. I'm
staying with them.

653
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:25,112
Now, keep out of this.

654
00:46:25,147 --> 00:46:26,614
Instead of paying rent,
she promised an audition.

655
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:28,616
Joke over, boyo,
let's go.

656
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:29,617
No, of course, if you
want to pay rent instead,

657
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:31,619
after all, I mean, it's up to you.

658
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:33,120
I know they don't pay
you much in this place,

659
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:34,121
but fair is fair.

660
00:46:34,156 --> 00:46:35,623
It's not funny
any more, eh?

661
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:42,129
I demand my right!
I want my lolly!

662
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:44,131
As a member of the
delinquent classes,

663
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:45,633
I want my money!

664
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:48,135
You impertinent little phoney.

665
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:49,637
Messing in people's lives,

666
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:51,889
and you don't know
what any of it's about.

667
00:46:51,924 --> 00:46:53,891
For your own sake,
don't ever do that again.

668
00:46:53,926 --> 00:46:56,393
I've no public-school
scruples about hitting girls.

669
00:46:56,428 --> 00:46:57,895
If you slap my face,
by God, I'll lay you out.

670
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,396
You would. You're the type.

671
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:00,898
You bet I'm the type.

672
00:47:00,933 --> 00:47:03,400
I'm the type that
detests physical violence.

673
00:47:03,435 --> 00:47:05,402
Jimmy, come out
of it, quick.

674
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:10,407
One of these days,

675
00:47:10,442 --> 00:47:11,408
I may write a book about us all.

676
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:13,410
it's all here,
and it'll be written

677
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:14,912
in flames a mile high,

678
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:16,413
and it won't
be recollected

679
00:47:16,448 --> 00:47:19,414
in tranquility, either,
picking daffodils with auntie wordsworth

680
00:47:19,451 --> 00:47:21,919
it'll be written
in fire and blood.

681
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,982
Going out?

682
00:48:58,017 --> 00:48:59,483
That's right.

683
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:00,985
On a Sunday evening in this town?

684
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,486
Where on Earth have you got to go?

685
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:04,855
She's coming
with me to church.

686
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:08,859
You're doing what?

687
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:13,864
when I think of what I did,

688
00:49:13,899 --> 00:49:15,249
what I had to endure...

689
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:17,751
Yes, we all know what
you did for me.

690
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:19,753
You rescued me from the
clutches of my family

691
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:21,372
and all my friends.

692
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,874
From the clutches of mummy, at least

693
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:28,879
you know, mummy and I

694
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,882
took one quick look at each other,

695
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,884
and from then on, the
age of chivalry was dead.

696
00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:35,886
Don't let's brawl, boyo.
It won't do any good.

697
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:36,887
Why not?

698
00:49:36,922 --> 00:49:38,889
It's the only thing left
I'm any good at.

699
00:49:38,924 --> 00:49:39,890
Jimmy boy.

700
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:41,392
There is nothing, no limit,

701
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,394
to what the middle-class mother will do

702
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:45,895
in the holy crusade
against ruffians like me.

703
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:46,897
She's probably
in that cistern by now,

704
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:48,899
taking down every
word we say.

705
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:50,901
Can you hear me, mother?

706
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:52,903
Just about fit
her in there.

707
00:49:52,938 --> 00:49:54,405
You're an old cow,

708
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,289
and you ought
to be dead!

709
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:56,290
Shut up!
You've no right

710
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,908
to talk about her
mother like that.

711
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:00,411
I've every right,
haven't I?

712
00:50:00,446 --> 00:50:01,912
She's an old cow

713
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:02,913
and she should be dead.

714
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,918
Well, what's the matter with you?

715
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:09,420
Why don't you spring to her defense?

716
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:10,921
Jimmy, don't.

717
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:12,923
if someone said that about me, she'd react.

718
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:15,926
She'd spring into her well-known
lethargy and say nothing.

719
00:50:19,465 --> 00:50:20,931
and what's the matter with you

720
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,436
I just feel quite
sick, that's all,

721
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:27,438
sick with contempt
and loathing.

722
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:31,942
We'd better go.
I'll get my things.

723
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:42,453
What are you
trying to do to me?

724
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:44,955
Trying to twist my arm
off with your silence?

725
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,959
I've given you just everything.

726
00:50:48,994 --> 00:50:52,963
You... you judas.
You phlegm.

727
00:50:52,998 --> 00:50:54,465
She's taking you with her,

728
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,967
and you're so bloody
wet, you let her do it.

729
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:04,975
All I want is
a little peace.

730
00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:10,230
She wants peace.

731
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:13,734
One of us is crazy...

732
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:16,737
mean and stupid
and crazy.

733
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:17,738
Which is it?
Is it me?

734
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:19,239
Standing like an
hysterical girl,

735
00:51:19,274 --> 00:51:21,241
hardly able to
get my words out?

736
00:51:21,742 --> 00:51:22,743
Or is it her,

737
00:51:22,778 --> 00:51:23,744
sitting there, putting on her shoes,

738
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:26,246
to go out with that... that... aah!

739
00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:31,752
One of these days,
you may want to come back.

740
00:51:31,787 --> 00:51:33,253
I want to be there that day.

741
00:51:33,288 --> 00:51:34,755
I want to stand
up in your tears

742
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:37,257
and splash about
in them and sing.

743
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:38,759
I want to be there
when you grovel.

744
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:40,260
I want to be there, I want to
watch it. I want the front seat.

745
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:41,762
I want to be
there when you...

746
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:43,263
when your face is
rubbed in the mud.

747
00:51:43,298 --> 00:51:44,765
There's nothing
else I can hope for.

748
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,268
There's nothing
else I want any more.

749
00:51:48,303 --> 00:51:51,271
There's a call
for you downstairs.

750
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:58,779
it can't be anything good, can it?

751
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:07,287
God, what's the matter with him now?

752
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:10,791
It's as if you've
done him wrong...

753
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:15,796
and you just sit there
and do nothing!

754
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,298
That's right. I just sit here.

755
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,800
What sort of a man are you?

756
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,187
I'm not the district
commissioner...

757
00:52:23,222 --> 00:52:24,688
Listen, Helena,

758
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:26,690
this has always been a battlefield

759
00:52:26,725 --> 00:52:29,193
and I'm pretty certain
that if I hadn't been here

760
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:32,194
everything would have been over
between these two long ago.

761
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:37,201
I love these two people very much.

762
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:40,704
and I pity all of us.

763
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:43,707
I don't understand
you or him or any of it.

764
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:47,510
Listen, Allison, I'm going to
call your father.

765
00:52:47,746 --> 00:52:49,712
I'm going to ask him
to come up and fetch you home.

766
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,717
Now, you'l l go when he
comes for you, won't you

767
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:56,720
Yes, I'll go.

768
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:59,723
I expect he should
be here by 4:00.

769
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:02,226
Perhaps, after
you've gone...

770
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:06,728
Jimmy will come to his senses
and face up to things.

771
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:11,735
We'll be late
if we don't hurry.

772
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,771
Ma Tanner.

773
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:52,276
She's had a stroke.

774
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:56,780
How bad is she?

775
00:53:56,815 --> 00:53:58,782
They didn't say much.

776
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:02,786
I think she's dying.

777
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,792
You ever seen anybody die?

778
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:11,295
No, I haven't.

779
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:15,299
For 12 months, I
watched my father die

780
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:17,801
when I was ten years old.

781
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:21,305
He'd come back from the
war in spain, you see.

782
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,307
All my mother could think
was that she was married

783
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,808
to somebody who
was on the...

784
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:27,811
on the wrong side
in all things.

785
00:54:27,846 --> 00:54:29,813
Perhaps she pitied him.

786
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,183
I was the only
one who cared.

787
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:37,187
Hour upon hour...

788
00:54:39,189 --> 00:54:41,692
I sat in that little room.

789
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:43,193
And he would talk, you know.

790
00:54:43,228 --> 00:54:46,695
Pour out all that was left of his life
to a small, frightened boy

791
00:54:46,732 --> 00:54:49,199
who could barely understand
half of what he said.

792
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:51,702
All I could feel was the despair,

793
00:54:51,737 --> 00:54:56,203
and the bitterness,
the sweet, sickly smell of a dying man.

794
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,212
See, I learned at an early age

795
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:05,716
what it is to be angry... angry.

796
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:10,721
Helpless.

797
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:19,229
The train leaves
in half an hour.

798
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:23,233
You're coming with
me, aren't you?

799
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:39,249
I need you to
come with me.

800
00:55:56,516 --> 00:55:57,517
Let's go.

801
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,925
I brought you these.

802
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,927
You know
what done this?

803
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,435
Too many...

804
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:37,939
port and lemon...

805
00:56:41,096 --> 00:56:44,564
You know, you're not
supposed to talk, you know.

806
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:51,067
You've got to do things...

807
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:58,827
That's what you're
made of.

808
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:01,832
Nurse!

809
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,334
Don't...

810
00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:11,338
...let yourself down.

811
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:15,095
Nurse. Come quick! Quick!

812
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:21,098
Don't let yourself down!

813
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:30,494
Wait outside,
please.

814
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:43,006
Staff nurse.

815
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,190
Hell!

816
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:25,715
My? Know what he said about mum

817
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,716
he said she was an overfed

818
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:28,718
overprivileged,
old cow.

819
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:35,225
And what did he say about me?

820
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,726
He doesn't seem to mind you so much.

821
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:39,229
In fact, I think h
e rather likes you.

822
00:58:39,264 --> 00:58:40,730
"Poor old daddy

823
00:58:40,765 --> 00:58:43,233
just one of those sturdy, old plants

824
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:44,734
left over from t
he edwardian wilderness

825
00:58:45,235 --> 00:58:46,736
that can't understand

826
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:49,739
Why the sun isn't shining anymore?

827
00:58:49,774 --> 00:58:52,242
Why did you ever have
to meet this young man?

828
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:56,246
Daddy, please don't
put me on trial now.

829
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:58,748
I've been on trial every
day and night of my life

830
00:58:58,783 --> 00:59:00,750
For the past two years,

831
00:59:00,785 --> 00:59:02,252
but why should he
have married you,

832
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:04,754
feeling as he did
about everything?

833
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:06,256
Perhaps it
was revenge.

834
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:07,757
But why you...

835
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:10,260
my daughter?

836
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:17,267
What is it?

837
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:20,770
"An old plant left over from
the edwardian wilderness."

838
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:26,776
I think the last time the sun shone

839
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:29,279
was when that
dirty little train

840
00:59:29,314 --> 00:59:32,782
steamed out of that crowded,
suffocating indian station,

841
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:38,788
and the battalion band
playing for all it was worth.

842
00:59:38,823 --> 00:59:43,293
I knew in my heart it was all over then
- everything.

843
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:49,299
You're hurt because everything is changed,

844
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,301
and Jimmy's hurt because

845
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:55,305
everything is the same.

846
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,808
Something's gone wrong
somewhere, hasn't it?

847
00:59:58,843 --> 01:00:00,810
It looks like it, my dear.

848
01:00:09,854 --> 01:00:11,821
This is a
big step you're taking

849
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:14,824
Is it really what you want?

850
01:00:19,364 --> 01:00:22,332
I was going to come
and help you pack, but...

851
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:25,335
Well, it looks as though
you've done it all.

852
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:31,341
Well, Helena,
we may as well go.

853
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:33,343
Alison's mother will
be worried, I know.

854
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:34,844
She's not very well.

855
01:00:35,345 --> 01:00:36,846
I'm so sorry. I hope
I didn't upset her

856
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:37,847
with my telephone call

857
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:42,350
- We were very grateful that you did.
- Do be careful of of the second step.

858
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:46,356
Helena, what about your case?

859
01:00:46,391 --> 01:00:47,857
Oh, she isn't coming with us.

860
01:00:47,892 --> 01:00:49,359
She's still playing at the theater.

861
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:51,361
Can't get into my new digs till tomorrow.

862
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:13,883
Well, I'd better
put this in the car.

863
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:22,392
Oh, look.
They're coming

864
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:28,898
so you're really going then?

865
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:34,404
Should think Jimmy'll
be back pretty soon.

866
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:36,406
You won't wait?

867
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:41,411
Who's going to tell him?

868
01:01:42,912 --> 01:01:45,915
Don't you think you ought
to tell him yourself?

869
01:01:52,422 --> 01:01:54,924
Bit conventional, isn't it?

870
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:57,427
I'm a conventional girl.

871
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,433
This place is gonna be really
cockeyed now, you know that?

872
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,937
Look after him
for me, please.

873
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:23,953
Don't worry about anything
at all. Everything'll be fine.

874
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,461
I hope you're right, that's all.

875
01:02:31,496 --> 01:02:33,463
what do you mean, I'm right?

876
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:46,593
It was Jimmy.

877
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:05,745
Here. You give it to him.

878
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:07,747
He's all yours. Oh, no, Cliff.

879
01:03:07,782 --> 01:03:10,250
And I hope he rams it up your nostrils!

880
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,093
One of those, is it?

881
01:04:21,604 --> 01:04:24,107
How could she be
so bloody wet?

882
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:28,611
Deep loving need of me...

883
01:04:28,646 --> 01:04:30,613
she couldn't say, "rotten
swine, I hate your guts.

884
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:33,116
"I'm going away,
and I hope you rot."

885
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:37,620
What are you
doing here, anyway?

886
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:39,122
You'd better keep
out of my sight,

887
01:04:39,157 --> 01:04:41,124
Or I'll kick your head in.

888
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:44,127
If you'd stop thinking about
yourself for just one moment,

889
01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:47,630
I'll tell you something
I think you ought to know.

890
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:49,632
Your wife is going
to have a baby.

891
01:04:53,386 --> 01:04:55,888
Well, doesn't that
mean anything?

892
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:58,274
Even to you?

893
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,283
If you'll permit me
to interrupt your...

894
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:09,285
female wisdom,

895
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,288
there's something
perhaps you ought to know.

896
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:19,295
I don't care if she's
going to have a baby.

897
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,798
I don't care if
it has two heads.

898
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:26,302
Well, do I
disgust you?

899
01:05:26,337 --> 01:05:27,804
Go on. Slap my face.

900
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:32,308
I've just come back from
seeing somebody I love very much

901
01:05:32,343 --> 01:05:34,811
go through the sordid
process of dying.

902
01:05:34,846 --> 01:05:39,814
And you expect me to be overcome with awe because
some stupid, cruel girl is going to have a baby?

903
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,822
Well, now the
performance is over.

904
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:49,325
Now, you leave me
alone, and get out,

905
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,828
you evil-minded
little virgin!

906
01:08:43,449 --> 01:08:45,451
Kill the lights.
That's all.

907
01:08:49,455 --> 01:08:51,457
Thank you, darling,
have a nice weekend.

908
01:09:18,618 --> 01:09:20,119
How was it?

909
01:09:22,622 --> 01:09:24,123
It was a funeral...

910
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:42,637
no flowers, no word, no sign.

911
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:48,147
What do you mean?

912
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:51,517
I mean Alison.

913
01:10:00,026 --> 01:10:02,528
The injustice of it
is almost perfect.

914
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:07,533
The wrong people going hungry,

915
01:10:08,034 --> 01:10:09,535
the wrong people...

916
01:10:11,037 --> 01:10:12,538
being loved.

917
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:17,043
The wrong people dying.

918
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:22,048
I shan't be long.

919
01:10:28,589 --> 01:10:33,057
Why does one spend half of Sunday
reading the newspapers?

920
01:10:38,064 --> 01:10:39,065
Have you read about
the grotesque

921
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:41,567
And evil practices
going on in the midlands?

922
01:10:41,602 --> 01:10:43,569
About the what?

923
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:45,071
"...and last week, a well-known debutante

924
01:10:45,106 --> 01:10:48,074
related how, during an
evil orgy at market harbor,

925
01:10:48,109 --> 01:10:50,576
she killed and drank the
blood of a white cockerel."

926
01:10:52,578 --> 01:10:55,581
I bet fortnum's are doing a
roaring trade in sacrificial cocks.

927
01:10:55,616 --> 01:10:57,333
Sounds madly depraved.

928
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,336
Yes. Terribly "us", isn't it?

929
01:11:00,371 --> 01:11:01,837
Do you ever go in for that kind of thing?

930
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:03,589
Not lately.

931
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:08,092
Oh, it sounds like your cup of tea...
Cup of blood, I should say.

932
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:10,096
Well, we could try it if you like.

933
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:12,098
Yes, for a start, we could
roast him over the gas fire.

934
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:14,100
After all, the whole point
of a sacrifice is that you

935
01:11:14,135 --> 01:11:16,602
get rid of something you
never really had any use for.

936
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:18,604
You'd make an admirable sacrifice.

937
01:11:18,639 --> 01:11:22,608
Afterwards, we could have
a loving cup of his blood.

938
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:24,610
Can't say I fancy it much. I've seen it.

939
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:27,113
It's like tomato sauce
- ever so common.

940
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:29,115
Now, yours would be
much better, wouldn't it?

941
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:32,118
Sort of a pale cambridge blue.

942
01:11:33,654 --> 01:11:36,122
What are you laughing at?

943
01:11:36,157 --> 01:11:38,624
Nothing. I never
used to be sure

944
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:40,626
when he was being
serious or when he wasn't.

945
01:11:40,661 --> 01:11:43,629
I don't think he knows himself
half the time.

946
01:11:43,664 --> 01:11:46,632
when in doubt, mark it down as an insult.

947
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:50,136
Hey, I thought of the
title of a new song today.

948
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:53,139
It's called, my mother's in the madhouse,

949
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:55,641
that's why I'm in love with you.

950
01:11:57,276 --> 01:11:59,779
Come on, maestro. Take it away.

951
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:01,280
There's a certain little lady,

952
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:03,282
now, you all know
who I mean,

953
01:12:03,317 --> 01:12:04,784
she may have
been to rodean,

954
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:09,288
but to me she's still a queen.

955
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:13,292
Someday, I'm
going to marry her.

956
01:12:13,327 --> 01:12:17,296
When times
are not so bad,

957
01:12:17,331 --> 01:12:20,800
Her mother doesn't care for me.

958
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:22,802
So I'll have to
ask her dad.

959
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:28,808
Don't be afraid to
sleep with your sweetheart.

960
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:31,310
Just because she's
better than you.

961
01:12:31,345 --> 01:12:33,312
Those forgotten
middle classes,

962
01:12:33,813 --> 01:12:36,315
May have fallen
on their noses.

963
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:38,317
But a girl
who's true blue?

964
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,323
The angels up above

965
01:12:44,358 --> 01:12:46,826
Will know that
you're in love?

966
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:49,829
So don't be afraid to
sleep with your sweetheart.

967
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:51,831
Because she's better than you.

968
01:12:51,866 --> 01:12:55,334
They call me Sydney! Just
because she's better than you.

969
01:12:57,837 --> 01:12:59,338
Hey, be careful now.

970
01:12:59,373 --> 01:13:01,841
I'll show you terrible destruction!

971
01:13:13,469 --> 01:13:15,971
I'm sending some
of her things on.

972
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:20,976
"My dear Alison,

973
01:13:21,477 --> 01:13:24,980
I hope that what I wrote
before didn't hurt you too much.

974
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:28,484
I know now it's
true, in spite of myself.

975
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,491
I do love him."

976
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:52,508
She was a jolly, super puppy,

977
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:54,009
weren't you, Dinah?

978
01:13:54,044 --> 01:13:55,010
She's 15.

979
01:13:55,511 --> 01:13:57,012
We ought to have
her put down.

980
01:13:57,047 --> 01:13:59,515
Nonsense, my dear. There's
nothing the matter with her.

981
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,517
All she needs is a walk.

982
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:03,519
Feel like coming?

983
01:14:03,554 --> 01:14:07,523
Better not. I don't
want to upset Dr. Blair.

984
01:14:07,558 --> 01:14:10,526
He seemed happier
the last time you saw him.

985
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:15,531
The usual... lecture about
taking care of myself,

986
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:18,033
but I don't think they'll
be any more trouble.

987
01:14:18,068 --> 01:14:20,035
He's been kicking
like mad today.

988
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,287
He?

989
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:23,789
Yes, I always say he.

990
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,793
I wonder if it will be like its father.

991
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:31,297
Would mummy hate it?

992
01:14:33,834 --> 01:14:36,802
I've often thoug ht your
mother went too far over Jimmy

993
01:14:36,837 --> 01:14:38,304
but you didn't
approve of him.

994
01:14:38,339 --> 01:14:39,805
Of course not.

995
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:47,813
I think you take after me,
my dear.

996
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:49,315
you like to sit
on the fence

997
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,318
because it's comfortable and more peaceful.

998
01:14:52,353 --> 01:14:54,320
Sitting on the fence...

999
01:14:55,821 --> 01:14:57,823
I married him, didn't I?

1000
01:15:17,259 --> 01:15:18,761
Are they strong?

1001
01:15:18,796 --> 01:15:21,062
They're cough drops, you know,
not a miracle drug.

1002
01:15:21,298 --> 01:15:24,266
And you're no flaming
faith healer, either.

1003
01:15:25,803 --> 01:15:28,270
Jimmy, can I have a bit of
money to finish shopping?

1004
01:15:28,305 --> 01:15:29,271
But of course

1005
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:30,773
business slack today?

1006
01:15:30,808 --> 01:15:32,274
There's nothing much doing

1007
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:33,776
want to go to the pictures?

1008
01:15:33,811 --> 01:15:36,779
Well, Cliff will look after
the shop. Won't you, Cliff?

1009
01:15:36,814 --> 01:15:38,781
Why not?

1010
01:15:40,282 --> 01:15:42,785
Meet you there in 10 minutes?

1011
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,791
They wouldn't take these
jelly babies back, you know?

1012
01:15:48,826 --> 01:15:50,292
Got too many.

1013
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:52,294
The kids had a craze on.

1014
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,302
You don't like
Helena, do you?

1015
01:16:01,303 --> 01:16:03,806
you didn't seem very
keen yourself once.

1016
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:08,811
It's not the
same, is it?

1017
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:11,313
Of course it isn't
the same, you idiot.

1018
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:14,316
Today's meal is always
different from yesterday's.

1019
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:16,819
The last woman is never
the same as the one before.

1020
01:16:18,605 --> 01:16:22,074
Nylons, he calls them.
Look at that, inspector.

1021
01:16:22,109 --> 01:16:24,576
There's no foot in it. Never has been.

1022
01:16:24,611 --> 01:16:27,079
Inspector, I have not
seen this lady before.

1023
01:16:27,114 --> 01:16:28,330
These are
not my nylons.

1024
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:31,834
Give me your license.

1025
01:16:33,871 --> 01:16:35,337
Shut up, you. Let's
hear what he's gotta say.

1026
01:16:35,372 --> 01:16:37,840
Keep out of th is! Let's hear his side!

1027
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:39,341
Are you sure you bought them from him?

1028
01:16:39,376 --> 01:16:40,342
Yes. When?

1029
01:16:40,843 --> 01:16:41,343
When did you buy them?

1030
01:16:41,844 --> 01:16:43,345
Two weeks ago, market day.

1031
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,098
Two weeks ago? But I was sick
that time. Do you remember?

1032
01:16:46,598 --> 01:16:47,599
What's he trying to say

1033
01:16:47,634 --> 01:16:50,102
that he wasn't here to sell them.

1034
01:16:50,137 --> 01:16:53,105
Look it up in your record book.
Go on.

1035
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:01,246
Well, if it wasn't him,
it was one of his friends.

1036
01:17:01,281 --> 01:17:03,248
They're all the same.

1037
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:11,256
Here. Take it.

1038
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:20,766
Stupid clod.

1039
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:23,769
Letting him walk all
over him like that.

1040
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:26,271
What do you want?

1041
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:28,273
Penny ranger bar, mister.

1042
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:41,787
I don't think I shall
stay here much longer.

1043
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:44,289
Why not?

1044
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:48,794
I don't know.

1045
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:52,297
The sweet stall's all right,

1046
01:17:53,298 --> 01:17:55,300
but I'd like to
try something else.

1047
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,803
Well, you're highly
educated and it suits you,

1048
01:17:57,838 --> 01:18:00,305
but I need something a bit better.

1049
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,808
Well, it's your business, I suppose

1050
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:05,811
and another thing...

1051
01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:08,313
be easier for Helena,
just the two of you.

1052
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,822
You'd better go,
hadn't you?

1053
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:18,323
She'll be waiting.

1054
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:26,330
I'll come back later
to help you clear up.

1055
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:29,334
We'll talk about it then.

1056
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:53,108
Anything wrong?

1057
01:18:53,143 --> 01:18:55,110
Cliff tells
me he's leaving us.

1058
01:18:55,145 --> 01:18:58,113
Yes, I know. He told me last night.

1059
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:03,517
I always seem to be at the end of the
queue when they're passing out information.

1060
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,621
Sorry he's going.

1061
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:15,130
He's sloppy and irritating,
but he's got a big heart.

1062
01:19:15,165 --> 01:19:17,132
You can forgive somebody
almost anything for that.

1063
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,141
Perhaps you do,

1064
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:32,147
perhaps it means something to have your...

1065
01:19:32,182 --> 01:19:34,650
general lie back
in your arms,

1066
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:36,652
even though
he's heartily sick

1067
01:19:36,687 --> 01:19:38,654
of the whole
campaign...

1068
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:41,156
tired and
hungry and dry

1069
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,167
Don't let anything go wrong.

1070
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:58,173
You're either with me
or against me.

1071
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:00,175
I've always wanted you...

1072
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:24,066
Tell her majesty to send a gunboat.

1073
01:20:28,605 --> 01:20:30,572
Look, if you don't want to
watch the film,

1074
01:20:30,607 --> 01:20:32,574
don't spoil it
for those that do.

1075
01:20:34,611 --> 01:20:38,080
Don't like this country, why
the hell don't they get out?

1076
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:02,738
God, Jimmy, what's
going to become of us?

1077
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:04,239
I don't know.

1078
01:21:06,742 --> 01:21:09,244
Do you know what Alison once said?

1079
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:11,747
You were born out of your time.

1080
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:15,250
I think I know what she means

1081
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:18,253
sometimes I think you feel

1082
01:21:18,288 --> 01:21:21,256
You're still in the
middle of the French revolution.

1083
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:25,260
Jimmy, can't you give
up that damn sweet stall

1084
01:21:25,295 --> 01:21:26,762
and do something else?

1085
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:30,766
I don't know. There are so
many things that you could do.

1086
01:21:30,801 --> 01:21:31,767
Such as being a
literary gent?

1087
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,268
Porter, the lion
of the pen club?

1088
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:35,270
Laughing Porter,
the tv panelist?

1089
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,773
Lord Porter,
leaving number 10?

1090
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:41,777
The personality cult of Porter.

1091
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:45,280
Let's examine it, that
glittering, meteoric cause.

1092
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:47,282
While the rest of the world
is blown to bits about us,

1093
01:21:47,317 --> 01:21:48,784
what's the only thing that matters?

1094
01:21:48,819 --> 01:21:50,486
Me! Me!

1095
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:10,305
What's the matter with you?

1096
01:22:11,842 --> 01:22:14,810
He's been chucked
out of the market.

1097
01:22:14,845 --> 01:22:15,811
We've got
to fight them.

1098
01:22:15,846 --> 01:22:17,312
Pinch-bottom hurst,
the town clerk,

1099
01:22:17,347 --> 01:22:19,431
the mayor himself
- the whole fascist gang.

1100
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:21,433
Why? There are plenty of other towns.

1101
01:22:21,468 --> 01:22:23,435
Damn it, man, don't you
want to see justice done?

1102
01:22:23,935 --> 01:22:25,437
I am most interested in justice,

1103
01:22:25,472 --> 01:22:29,939
but I am not in the habit
of expecting it to apply to me.

1104
01:22:29,976 --> 01:22:32,194
Now, listen, Hurst got
you on a pure technicality.

1105
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:34,196
He tried this afternoon and failed and-

1106
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,836
Go on. What
did Hurst do?

1107
01:22:40,871 --> 01:22:43,839
You took his license away from
him without any real reason.

1108
01:22:43,874 --> 01:22:47,843
Ever since he landed here, he's been
at the sticky end of your personal spite

1109
01:22:47,878 --> 01:22:49,845
now, listen, sir.
I watched it!

1110
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,348
Before you make a bigger
fool of yourself,

1111
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:55,851
there's something
you ought to know.

1112
01:22:55,886 --> 01:22:57,853
This time, it was
their complaint-

1113
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:00,856
some of your
friends there.

1114
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:05,360
They informed on him?

1115
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:17,372
Why? What's the idea?

1116
01:23:17,407 --> 01:23:18,874
You don't want
him here.

1117
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:20,375
What's he done?

1118
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,377
Seen his prices, son? We've got to eat.

1119
01:23:22,412 --> 01:23:25,380
You're lucky, lad. He
might have sold sweets.

1120
01:23:30,921 --> 01:23:32,888
Kapoor.

1121
01:23:32,923 --> 01:23:36,391
Mr. Hurst, come and h ave a drink with us.

1122
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:39,144
What'll you have?
You'll have a shot?

1123
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:50,655
I should move on now.
As I said, goodbye.

1124
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:53,158
What made you come to this
bloody country, anyway?

1125
01:23:53,193 --> 01:23:57,162
I came, because in india I was an outcast...

1126
01:23:57,197 --> 01:23:58,663
an untouchable.

1127
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:33,448
Any idea what
you're going to do?

1128
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:37,953
Not much.

1129
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:39,955
Sounds just
like you.

1130
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:42,958
Shouldn't think you'll last
five minutes

1131
01:24:42,993 --> 01:24:45,961
without me to explain the score to you.

1132
01:24:45,996 --> 01:24:47,963
Right, shouldn't
think so.

1133
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:50,966
You're such a
scruffy beast.

1134
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:54,469
I bet some respectable
little madame will...

1135
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,472
gobble you up in 6 months,
marry you, send you to work,

1136
01:24:57,507 --> 01:24:59,474
and you'll end up
clean as a new pin.

1137
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:03,094
I'm stupid enough for that, too.

1138
01:25:08,099 --> 01:25:10,602
I seem to spend my
life saying goodbye.

1139
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:20,111
My feet hurt.

1140
01:25:21,613 --> 01:25:23,615
Try washing your socks.

1141
01:25:37,629 --> 01:25:39,130
Here's your train.

1142
01:25:45,136 --> 01:25:48,139
funny thing is

1143
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:51,643
you've been loyal, generous, a good friend.

1144
01:25:51,678 --> 01:25:53,144
I'm quite prepared to see you go off

1145
01:25:53,179 --> 01:25:55,146
and make a home
for your own and...

1146
01:25:55,181 --> 01:25:57,649
all because I want...
I want something.

1147
01:25:57,684 --> 01:26:00,652
Something from that girl
which i... I know in my heart

1148
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:02,654
she's incapable
of giving.

1149
01:26:04,155 --> 01:26:09,160
You're worth half a dozen
Helenas to me, you know that?

1150
01:26:09,661 --> 01:26:13,665
If you were in my place, you'd do
the same thing, wouldn't you? Right?

1151
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:18,169
Oh, thanks, Helena.
Very decent of you.

1152
01:26:29,215 --> 01:26:32,183
Write now and again, and not
jus t dirty postcards, eh?

1153
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:33,685
Give Miss Drury
a kick somehow, eh?

1154
01:26:43,695 --> 01:26:46,197
darling, what do you say
we get out of this business

1155
01:26:46,698 --> 01:26:48,199
and start from scratch? What do you say?

1156
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:49,701
I'd say that's
wonderful.

1157
01:26:50,201 --> 01:26:52,203
We'll do that. Let's
go and have a drink.

1158
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:54,706
We'll get pleasantly tiddly,
then I'll take you home

1159
01:26:54,741 --> 01:26:57,208
And make such love to you
you'll forg et about anything at all.

1160
01:27:08,386 --> 01:27:09,387
Why not champagne?

1161
01:27:09,888 --> 01:27:11,890
British railways
special cuvee.

1162
01:27:17,896 --> 01:27:19,898
Two double scotch, please.

1163
01:27:34,412 --> 01:27:36,414
Friend of yours
to see you.

1164
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:42,921
Watch where you're going.

1165
01:27:47,676 --> 01:27:49,678
Miss, do you want
these drinks?

1166
01:27:54,683 --> 01:27:56,685
Ten shillings. Ta.

1167
01:28:00,689 --> 01:28:02,691
I think this is what
you need, what we both need!

1168
01:28:05,694 --> 01:28:08,196
How long have you been here?

1169
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:11,199
An hour or two.

1170
01:28:11,234 --> 01:28:13,201
I must be mad,
coming here like this

1171
01:28:13,236 --> 01:28:15,203
I'm sorry, Helena.

1172
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,711
So many times, I managed
to stop myself coming here

1173
01:28:22,746 --> 01:28:24,713
right at the
last minute.

1174
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:27,716
Even today, when
I got on the train,

1175
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:31,720
I panicked. I felt like a criminal.

1176
01:28:31,755 --> 01:28:34,723
I told myself
that when...

1177
01:28:34,758 --> 01:28:37,726
when I got here, I'd turn
round and go straight back.

1178
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:40,729
Alison, what's happened?

1179
01:28:42,731 --> 01:28:44,232
I lost the child.

1180
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:55,243
I feel so ashamed.

1181
01:28:55,278 --> 01:28:57,746
Helena, don't bring
out the book of rules.

1182
01:28:57,781 --> 01:29:00,248
You're his wife,
aren't you?

1183
01:29:00,283 --> 01:29:03,752
Please don't make me
feel like a blackmailer.

1184
01:29:03,787 --> 01:29:05,754
Whatever made me come here,

1185
01:29:06,755 --> 01:29:10,256
I never intended to make a breach
between you and Jimmy.

1186
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:12,761
You must believe that.

1187
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:15,263
I believe it, all right.
That's why everything seems

1188
01:29:15,298 --> 01:29:17,265
more wrong and
terrible than ever.

1189
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,768
You talk as though you'd
swindled him out of me.

1190
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:21,269
You talk as though
he were a book

1191
01:29:21,304 --> 01:29:24,272
you pass to whoever
wants it for five minutes.

1192
01:29:24,307 --> 01:29:26,274
you loved him, didn't you?

1193
01:29:26,775 --> 01:29:28,276
You wrote and told me.

1194
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:31,279
And it was true.

1195
01:29:36,701 --> 01:29:38,703
Helena, it's no use.

1196
01:29:40,205 --> 01:29:42,207
You must go back to him.

1197
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:48,713
I'll catch the
next train.

1198
01:29:48,748 --> 01:29:50,715
Kitty, have the next one with us

1199
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:52,717
Go away.
And your friend.

1200
01:30:00,725 --> 01:30:03,228
Alison, I don't like
to leav e you like this.

1201
01:30:03,263 --> 01:30:05,730
I'll be all right. Goodbye.

1202
01:30:19,494 --> 01:30:21,496
Alison, are you...

1203
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,503
you didn't have a return ticket.

1204
01:30:29,003 --> 01:30:31,005
I forgot. I meant to get one.

1205
01:30:39,013 --> 01:30:41,015
Alison, it's all over.

1206
01:31:12,046 --> 01:31:13,548
I'm leaving.

1207
01:31:17,552 --> 01:31:19,554
I've just come
to get my things.

1208
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:27,812
She's persuaded
you this time?

1209
01:31:28,313 --> 01:31:29,814
Not at all.

1210
01:31:32,283 --> 01:31:34,786
She's been very ill, Jimmy.
She's lost...

1211
01:31:34,821 --> 01:31:36,788
my child, too, you know.

1212
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:43,294
I suppose none of this could
ever really have worked.

1213
01:31:45,747 --> 01:31:47,749
But I do love you, Jimmy.

1214
01:31:50,752 --> 01:31:53,755
I shall never love anyone
as I've loved you...

1215
01:31:56,174 --> 01:31:58,176
But I can't go on.

1216
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,183
I can't take part in
all this suffering.

1217
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:23,084
It's no good fooling
about with love, you know.

1218
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,086
You can't fall into
it like a soft job

1219
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:27,589
without dirtying
up your hands.

1220
01:32:27,624 --> 01:32:29,591
It takes
muscle and guts.

1221
01:32:31,092 --> 01:32:33,094
If you can't bear the thought of

1222
01:32:33,595 --> 01:32:35,597
messing up your nice, tidy soul,

1223
01:32:35,632 --> 01:32:38,099
you'd better g ive up the whole
idea of life and become a saint,

1224
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:42,553
because you'll never
make it as a human being.

1225
01:32:50,096 --> 01:32:54,063
It's either this world
or the next.

1226
01:34:36,753 --> 01:34:38,720
I didn't know about the baby.

1227
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:43,224
I don't exactly
relish the idea

1228
01:34:43,259 --> 01:34:46,227
of pain and
suffering, but...

1229
01:34:46,262 --> 01:34:48,730
it wasn't my first loss, you know.

1230
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:52,233
It was mine.

1231
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:07,248
Remember that time we first met...

1232
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:09,250
At that grisly party?

1233
01:35:11,252 --> 01:35:13,254
You didn't really notice me at all.

1234
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:17,759
I couldn't take my eyes
off you all evening.

1235
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,762
You seemed to have such a...

1236
01:35:21,797 --> 01:35:24,265
wonderful relaxation of spirit.

1237
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,768
I knew that was
what I wanted.

1238
01:35:28,269 --> 01:35:32,273
Then after we were married, I discovered
it wasn't relaxation, after all.

1239
01:35:32,308 --> 01:35:35,777
To relax, you've got to
sweat your guts out first.

1240
01:35:37,313 --> 01:35:40,281
You never had a hair out of
place or a bead of sweat anywhere.

1241
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:51,292
I know I'm
a lost cause,

1242
01:35:51,327 --> 01:35:52,293
but I thought if you loved
me it didn't really matter.

1243
01:35:52,328 --> 01:35:54,295
It does matter!

1244
01:35:54,330 --> 01:35:55,797
I was wrong.

1245
01:35:56,798 --> 01:35:59,300
I don't want
to be neutral.

1246
01:35:59,335 --> 01:36:01,302
I want to be
a lost cause.

1247
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:05,306
Nd?
Don't you understa

1248
01:36:05,341 --> 01:36:08,810
it's gone- that helpl
ess human being inside my body

1249
01:36:10,311 --> 01:36:13,314
re, I thought it was so
safe and secure in the

1250
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:15,817
but it's lost.

1251
01:36:15,852 --> 01:36:17,819
All I wanted
was to die.

1252
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,822
I was in pain,

1253
01:36:20,857 --> 01:36:24,325
And all I could think
of was you and what I'd lost.

1254
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:27,829
I thought if...

1255
01:36:27,864 --> 01:36:29,831
if only he could
see me now...

1256
01:36:31,332 --> 01:36:34,335
so ugly and stupid
and ridiculous.

1257
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:37,338
I thought "this is what
he's wanted from me,

1258
01:36:37,373 --> 01:36:40,341
"this is what he wants
to splash about in.

1259
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:43,845
I'm in the fire,
and I'm burning,

1260
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,847
and all I want is to die.

1261
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,349
It's cost
him his child

1262
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:51,352
and any others
I might have had."

1263
01:36:52,388 --> 01:36:53,855
No, don't.

1264
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:55,357
No, please don't.

1265
01:37:16,913 --> 01:37:20,882
You'll be
all right.

1266
01:37:30,892 --> 01:37:33,895
We'll be together
in our bear's cave,

1267
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,898
our squirrel's drey,

1268
01:37:36,933 --> 01:37:40,902
and we'll live on honey and nuts
- lots and lots of nuts.

1269
01:37:42,403 --> 01:37:43,905
You'll keep those
big eyes on my fur

1270
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,907
and help me to keep
my claws in order,

1271
01:37:45,942 --> 01:37:50,411
because I'm a bit of a
soppy, scruffy sort of bear.

1272
01:37:51,913 --> 01:37:54,415
And I'll see that you
keep that sleek, bushy tail

1273
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:55,917
gleaming as it should,
because you're...

1274
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:58,920
you're a very
beautiful squirrel.

1275
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:03,925
But you know, you're none too bright,
either, so we'll have to be careful.

1276
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,928
Cruel steel traps
everywhere,

1277
01:38:06,963 --> 01:38:10,932
just waiting for rather
mad, slightly satanic,

1278
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:13,935
very timid
little bears.

1279
01:38:22,944 --> 01:38:24,445
Poor squirrels.

1280
01:38:25,947 --> 01:38:29,949
Poor bears.
