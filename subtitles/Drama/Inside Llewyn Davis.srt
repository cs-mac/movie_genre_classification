1
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,515
Hang me, oh, hang me

2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,140
<i>PH be dead and gone</i>

3
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,187
<i>Hang me, oh, hang me</i>

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,270
<i>PH be dead and gone</i>

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,528
<i>I wouldn't mind the hanging</i>

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,530
<i>But the laying in the grave so long
Poor boy</i>

7
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:16,328
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

8
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,045
<i>Been all around Cape Girardeau</i>

9
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,178
<i>Parts of Arkansas</i>

10
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,309
<i>All around Cape Girardeau</i>

11
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,562
<i>Parts of Arkansas</i>

12
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,729
<i>I got so goddamn hungry</i>

13
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,738
<i>I could hide behind a straw
Poor boy</i>

14
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:49,276
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

15
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,079
<i>Went up on the mountain</i>

16
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,254
<i>There I made my stand</i>

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,175
<i>Went up on the mountain</i>

18
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:09,180
<i>There I made my stand</i>

19
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,968
<i>A riﬂe on my shoulder</i>

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,264
<i>And a dagger in my hand
Poor boy</i>

21
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,732
<i>I been all around this world</i>

22
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,608
<i>Put the rope around my neck</i>

23
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,533
<i>Hang me up so high</i>

24
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,410
<i>Put the rope around my neck</i>

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,875
<i>They hung me up so high</i>

26
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,884
<i>The last words I heard 'em say:</i>

27
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,263
<i>"Won't be long now 'fore you die
Poor boy"</i>

28
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,518
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

29
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,934
<i>So hang me, oh, hang me</i>

30
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,321
<i>And H! be dead and gone</i>

31
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,901
<i>Hang me, oh, hang me</i>

32
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,573
<i>And H! be dead and gone</i>

33
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,872
<i>Wouldn't mind the hanging</i>

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,414
<i>But the laying in the grave so long
Poor boy</i>

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,302
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

36
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,977
You probably heard that one before.

37
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,947
If it was never new and it never
gets old, then it's a folk song.

38
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,407
- You and Mikey used to do that song.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,451
Boy, you were some mess last night.

40
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,120
Yeah, sorry, Pappi. I'm an asshole.

41
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,587
I don't give a shit. It's just music.

42
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,093
Your friend is out back.

43
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,460
My friend?

44
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,473
Said he was a friend of yours.
Guy in a suit.

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,397
You a funny boy, huh?

46
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,526
What?

47
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,910
Had to open your big mouth,
huh, funny boy?

48
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,869
I had to... What?

49
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,499
That's what I do for a living.
Who-? Who are you?

50
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,663
What you do.

51
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,004
What you do.

52
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,171
I'm sorry, what-? What did I-?

53
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:01,060
You sit there in the audience last night,
yelling your crap.

54
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,767
Oh, for christssake.
You yell stuff, man. It's a show.

55
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,191
It wasn't your show.

56
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,570
It's not the opera, jackass.
It's a fucking basket hou- Unh!

57
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,608
We're leaving this fucking
cesspool. You can have it.

58
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,652
What you do.

59
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,938
Hello?

60
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,773
No, no-

61
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,521
Shit.

62
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,822
Goddamn it.

63
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,340
Hello?

64
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,549
Hi.

65
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,718
Could you, um...?

66
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,431
Could I leave this cat with you?

67
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,351
- With me?
- Yeah, it's, um...

68
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,858
It's the Gorfeins' cat.
Just till one of them gets back?

69
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,147
With me?

70
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,232
It slipped out
and I don't have the key.

71
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,238
Could you just keep it
till they get back?

72
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,820
I have to run the elevator.

73
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,330
I mean, that's not a problem, is it?
It's the Gorfeins' cat.

74
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,990
I have to run the elevator.

75
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,918
Sociology.
- Professor Gorfein, please.

76
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,203
<i>WOMAN".
He's in a lecture now.</i>

77
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,963
<i>- Could I take a message?
- Uh...</i>

78
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,753
Yeah, could you-?
Could you just tell him:

79
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,089
"Don't worry, Llewyn has the cat"?

80
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,300
<i>"Llewyn is the cat. "</i>

81
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,137
No, Llewyn "has" the cat.
I'm Llewyn. I have his cat.

82
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,528
Oh, shit.

83
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,704
- Hey, Nunzio.
- Yeah. They ain't home, though.

84
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,868
Yeah, I know.
Can I use your fire escape?

85
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,816
Hi.

86
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,985
- How we doing?
- We're doing great.

87
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,369
Really?

88
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,075
The new record's doing well?

89
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,583
Uh, how "we" doing.
Not so hot, I gotta be honest.

90
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,460
- Ginny, where's Cincinnati?
What?

91
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,793
- Cincinnati, it's not in here.
It should be in there.

92
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,300
It's not in here, I'm telling you.

93
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,584
- Is it-?
Cincinnati?

94
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,674
Yeah.
- I got it.

95
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:11,963
What?

96
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,758
- I got it.
- You got Cincinnati?

97
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,176
Yeah, you want it?

98
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,219
- Could I have it?
Should I bring it in?

99
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,639
- Yeah.
- Do you owe me something?

100
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,307
You have to owe me something.

101
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,725
I wish.

102
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,735
People need time, you know.

103
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,898
Get to know you,
buy you as a solo act.

104
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,441
Even know you're a solo act.

105
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,361
- Cincinnati is not good.
- That's it, right?

106
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,200
Yeah, this is it, God help me.

107
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,035
Nobody knew us
when we were a duo.

108
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,417
It's not like me and Mike
were ever a big act.

109
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,919
It's not a big reeducation

110
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,579
for the public.

111
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,460
Mel?

112
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,210
Mel.

113
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,466
How you doing, kid?

114
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,758
Mel, there was no advance
on my solo record.

115
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,552
There's gotta be some royalty.

116
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,972
Fucking christssake, it's cold out.
I don't even have a winter coat.

117
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,517
Jesus Christ. You're kidding me.

118
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,067
- Take this, kid.
- Mel, no.

119
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,281
I insist. I insist.

120
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,616
I don't want your fucking coat.
What'll you wear?

121
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,623
- Kid, I'll get by.
- It won't even fit me. This is-

122
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,250
It's bullshit, Mel.

123
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,127
It's just a big fat fucking bluff.

124
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,458
Bluff?

125
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,426
Kid, what are you ta-? Bluff?
I offer you this?

126
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,884
Get the fuck out of my office.

127
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,716
- All right, thanks for the coat.
- What?

128
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,509
All right, well, wait.

129
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,311
Aw, shit.

130
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,682
Let me give you 40 bucks.

131
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,660
- Explain the cat.
- Yeah, sorry.

132
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,576
It's, uh- It's the Gorfeins' cat.

133
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,370
- I crashed there last night.
- What's its name?

134
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,507
Uh, I don't know.
He snuck out the door when-

135
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,508
Do you think
you're staying here tonight?

136
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,135
"Do you think-?" Um...

137
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,180
- I was hoping to. Is Jim around?
- Jim's not here.

138
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,386
We told Troy he could crash here.

139
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,017
Troy Nelson. How are you?

140
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,269
- How you doing? Llewyn Davis.
Oh.

141
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,522
Hello. I've heard your music,

142
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,526
and heard many nice things about you
from Jim and Jean and from others.

143
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,734
Ha-ha-ha. You have not heard
one nice thing about me from Jean,

144
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,318
ever, have you, Troy?

145
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,483
You tell the Gorfeins
you'll take care of their cat,

146
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,323
then bring him here
for us to take care of.

147
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,364
I've heard nice things from Jim
and Jean and others.

148
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,328
I didn't... It just happened.

149
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,118
It's a peaceful cat.
It's very contented.

150
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,209
So I can't stay here tonight?

151
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,339
Look, we told Troy he could stay.

152
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,921
We don't keep the couch free
on the chance you'll show up.

153
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,757
If this is awkward,

154
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,217
I could hitch back to Fort Dix
after I perform tonight.

155
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,223
Don't be silly.
We offered you the couch.

156
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,804
You're gigging somewhere?

157
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,220
Troy is playing at the Gaslight.
We're meeting Jim there.

158
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,107
Well, I could sleep on the ﬂoor here,
and Llewyn could have the couch.

159
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,484
I'm certainly not a man of comforts.

160
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,065
Alternately, I could hitch back
to Fort Dix after the show.

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,774
Llewyn can sleep on the floor
with his cat.

162
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,738
It's the Gorfeins' cat.

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,531
What the fuck?

164
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,546
<i>It's a lesson too late
For the learner</i>

165
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:37,879
<i>Made of sand, made of sand</i>

166
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:43,968
<i>in the wink of an eye
My soul is turning</i>

167
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:49,765
<i>In your hand, in your hand</i>

168
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:55,984
<i>Are you going away
With no word of farewell?</i>

169
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:02,528
<i>Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, Icould've loved you better</i>

170
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,740
- Llewyn.
- Hey.

171
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,405
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

172
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,744
<i>I didn't mean to be unkind</i>

173
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,913
<i>You know that was
The last thing on my mind</i>

174
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,882
<i>You've got reasons aplenty
For going</i>

175
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,844
- What do you think?
- What?

176
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,258
Him, Troy.

177
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,553
Wonderful performer.

178
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,722
- Is he?
- Wonderful.

179
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,731
<i>Please don't go</i>

180
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,690
- Does he have a higher function?
Shh!

181
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,730
<i>Are you going away</i>

182
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,943
I need a drink.

183
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,859
<i>With no word of farewell?</i>

184
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,072
<i>Will there be not a change</i>

185
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,203
Look, Jim,
I didn't wanna mention this

186
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,410
in front of Jean.
You know how she gets.

187
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,419
- What do you mean?
- Just, uh, you know...

188
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,505
I need to...
I need to borrow some money.

189
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,837
I can pay you back really soon,
that and the last loan.

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,469
There's a girl I know who's in trouble
and needs to get fixed.

191
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,255
- Not again.
- This is a different girl.

192
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,390
Don't tell Jean.

193
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,849
I can't get the money
without Jean knowing.

194
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,230
- It's okay. We can-
- No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

195
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,516
I'll find it somewhere else.

196
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,934
Thank you very much.

197
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,898
Thank you.

198
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,949
There's someone special
in the audience tonight

199
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,905
who'll maybe get up
and help me out here

200
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,411
- if you give a round of applause.
- I don't have my guitar.

201
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,368
I know that you folks know them
and love them.

202
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jim and Jean.

203
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,044
Oh.

204
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,525
<i>If you miss the train I'm on</i>

205
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,658
<i>You will know that I am gone</i>

206
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,571
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

207
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,833
<i>A hundred mites</i>

208
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,916
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

209
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,334
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

210
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,221
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

211
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,225
<i>A hundred mites</i>

212
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,808
<i>Lord, Pm one, Lord, I'm two</i>

213
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,851
<i>Lord, Fm three, Lord, Fm four</i>

214
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,071
<i>Lord, Pm 500 miles</i>

215
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:47,234
<i>Away from home</i>

216
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:55,785
<i>Away from home, away from home</i>

217
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,705
<i>Lord, Pm 500 miles</i>

218
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,716
<i>Away from home</i>

219
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,634
<i>Not a shirt on my back</i>

220
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,346
<i>Not a penny to my name</i>

221
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:18,140
<i>Lord, I can't go back home
This a-way</i>

222
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,353
<i>What?</i>

223
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:28,701
<i>This a-way, this a-way</i>

224
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,988
<i>Lord, I can'! go back home</i>

225
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,704
This a-way

226
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,246
<i>if you miss the train I'm on</i>

227
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,540
<i>You will know that I am gone</i>

228
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,333
Boy, they're not bad.

229
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,716
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

230
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,549
Uh-huh.

231
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,467
That Jean,

232
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,473
<i>A hundred miles</i>

233
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,929
I'd like to fuck her.

234
00:18:54,091 --> 00:19:02,567
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

235
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:07,526
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

236
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,943
<i>A hundred mites</i>

237
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,054
Mm.

238
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,847
Sorry.

239
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,516
It's early. I tried not to wake anyone.

240
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,775
Mm-hm.

241
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,126
Well, that was very good.

242
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,963
What's next?

243
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,504
What do you mean?

244
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,592
Do you plug yourself in somewhere?

245
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,558
No.

246
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,819
Well,

247
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,275
report for duty.

248
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,281
Back to Fort Dix.

249
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,985
They making you a killing machine?

250
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,830
No, it's probably different
from what you imagine.

251
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,583
There's the discipline,
which is what you're referring to.

252
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,868
I thrive on that.

253
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,036
Weaponry is part of the job.

254
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,628
Armaments are not my thing.
I don't even approve of war toys.

255
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,462
- Is it a career?
- No, no. I get out in a few months.

256
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,261
Bud Grossman has expressed interest
in representing me.

257
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,759
Bud Grossman?

258
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,848
What's he like?

259
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,940
Mr. Grossman is a wonderful man.
He's been very supportive.

260
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,939
I played at his club in Chicago
on my last furlough,

261
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,979
right after I got back from Germany.

262
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,648
Did you meet Elvis?

263
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,408
No. Everyone asks that.

264
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,492
No, I did not meet Private Presley.

265
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,281
So you played at the Gate of Horn.

266
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,791
Yes.

267
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,919
Mr. Grossman liked what he saw,
I guess.

268
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,829
He thinks I can have a career.

269
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,915
<i>Hm.</i>

270
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,215
Thank Jim and Jean for me.

271
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,970
Mm-hm.

272
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,176
So long.

273
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,891
What's your name again?

274
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,316
Oh, shit.

275
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,103
No. No.

276
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,569
Fuck. Goddamn it. Oh, shit.

277
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,326
Fuck.

278
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,454
Shit. Cat.

279
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,136
Fuck. Kitty?

280
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,467
Fuck. Fuck.

281
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,944
Thanks for keeping quiet, asshole.

282
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,784
I'm freezing. Can we talk'?

283
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,368
Not here. Fuck you.

284
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,496
I'm sorry, which?
"Out" or "fuck you"?

285
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,832
Let's go out.
Can I borrow Jim's coat?

286
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,338
<i>f don't know.</i>

287
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,418
- You don't know if it's mine?
- No. How would I know?

288
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,260
- So it could be Jim's.
- Yes, asshole.

289
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,767
Wait, you don't want it either way?
To be clear.

290
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,020
To be clear, asshole,
you fucking asshole,

291
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,808
I want very much to have it if it's Jim's.
That's what I want.

292
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,022
But since I don't know,
you not only fucked things up

293
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,061
by fucking me
and maybe making me pregnant,

294
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,026
but even if it's not yours,
I can't know that.

295
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,613
So I have to get rid of what might be
a perfectly fine baby, a baby I want,

296
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,949
because everything you touch
turns to shit.

297
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,615
Like King Midas's idiot brother.

298
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,499
Well, okay.

299
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,998
I see.

300
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,460
You know a doctor, right'?

301
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,840
Yes.

302
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,376
From when?

303
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,794
Whatever, Diane?

304
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,507
Yes.

305
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,764
- And you'll pay for it?
- Yes.

306
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,727
Don't tell Jim, obviously.

307
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,350
I should've had you wear
double condoms.

308
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,901
Well, we shouldn't have done it in the
first place, but if you ever do it again,

309
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,863
which as a favor to women
everywhere, you should not,

310
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,744
but if you do, you should be wearing
condom on condom,

311
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,746
and then wrap it in electrical tape.

312
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,624
You should just walk around always
inside a great big condom

313
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,660
- because you are shit.
- Okay.

314
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,329
You should not be in contact
with any living thing, being shit.

315
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,626
Have you ever heard the expression,
"it takes two to tango"?

316
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,884
Fuck you.

317
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,677
Well, I could say we should talk
about this when you're less angry,

318
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,183
but that would be...

319
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,185
That would be...

320
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,314
- When would that be?
- Fuck you.

321
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,114
I miss Mike.

322
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,700
Can I ask you for a favor?

323
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,491
You're joking.

324
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,156
It's not for me, it's for the Gorfeins.

325
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,578
Their cat got out. Could you leave
the fire-escape window open?

326
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,250
It's winter.

327
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,086
Just enough for the cat
to squeeze back in'?

328
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,295
It could come back.

329
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,006
To our apartment?
It was there, like, six hours.

330
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,385
Why would it come back there?

331
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,422
I don't know, I'm not a fucking cat.

332
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,013
Think about it. I lost their fucking cat.
I feel bad about it.

333
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,019
That's what you feel bad about?

334
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,491
Hello.

335
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,701
Where's your coat?

336
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,621
- It's not that cold.
- You out of your mind?

337
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,796
So how's the music going?

338
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,508
Uh, pretty good. Pretty good.

339
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,464
Oh, good. So you don't need
to borrow money.

340
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,973
- Actually, I was wondering...
- Uh-huh.

341
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,179
Is it sold?

342
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,184
- The house?
- Yeah.

343
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,936
Yeah. Uh-huh.

344
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,682
- I mean, it's in escrow.
- How much?

345
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,646
Eleven-five. But why?

346
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,402
- It's not our house.
- Not our house?

347
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,314
Well, yeah.
It's Mom and Dad's house.

348
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,657
Llewyn, it goes to his upkeep.
We don't get any.

349
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,865
Good thing your music's going good.

350
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,917
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, well, what the fuck?

351
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,498
- Llewyn.
- What?

352
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,913
- The language.
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

353
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,208
I am not one
of your Greenwich Village friends.

354
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,625
Okay, yeah, yeah.

355
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,466
- You still got your seaman's papers?
- Yeah, why?

356
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,054
- Well, if the music's not-
- What? Quit?

357
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,639
Merchant Marine again?

358
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,141
Just exist?

359
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,896
Heh, exist?

360
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,898
Is that what we do
outside of show business?

361
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,604
It's not so bad, existing.

362
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,269
- Like Dad?
- Llewyn.

363
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,233
- What?
- You say that about your own father?

364
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,487
- What?
- That he exists?

365
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,366
- I didn't say- You said it. Forget it.
- That he exists? Like that?

366
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,903
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

367
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,620
- Seen him?
- Yeah.

368
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,247
What?

369
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,333
- Should I?
- You tell me, he's your father.

370
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,168
Yeah, he sure is.

371
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,339
Oh, I got- Wait, I got-
You got a minute?

372
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:09,588
Well, they want me back
for rehearsals.

373
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,676
<i>Sullivan Show.</i>

374
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,308
I've got autographs to sign.

375
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,929
- Champagne reception.
- Don't go away.

376
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,097
I cleaned it out, the house.

377
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,234
There's some stuff.
I put your stuff in a box.

378
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,232
What I thought you might want.

379
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,277
I don't know, Joy.

380
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,986
Just stick it out at the curb.

381
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,869
Llewyn, are you kidding?
Look at this.

382
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,529
You know what this is?

383
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,532
This is when you recorded
"Shoals of Herring" for Morn and Dad.

384
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,703
You- Whatever, you're
like 8 years old. It's so cute.

385
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:46,215
Well, see, Joy,
in the entertainment business,

386
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,297
you're not supposed to let
your practice shit out.

387
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,678
It ruins the mystique.

388
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,590
I'm sorry. I don't know a lot about
the entertainment business.

389
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,970
Yeah, well...

390
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,723
Don't be sorry.

391
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,898
No, no, no, I'll bring the cat up.
It's fine. I just, uh...

392
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,151
<i>I can't today, as it turns out.
I can't bring her today.</i>

393
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,937
Him.
- Him, him, yeah.

394
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,902
<i>But I can get down there.
- He's hanging out at Jim and Jean's.</i>

395
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,111
He's- He likes it there.

396
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,868
<i>- He's fine. Believe me, he's fine.
Okay. But it's easy for me-</i>

397
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,529
- No, no, no. They're not home.
Okay.

398
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,493
- They're never home.
All right.

399
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,498
Uh, so- Anyway,
I couldn't ask you to do that.

400
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,409
All the way down to the Village,
Mitch.

401
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,828
No, I'll bring her up tomorrow.

402
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,917
<i>- Him. Him up tomorrow.
Right. Okay, good.</i>

403
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,832
<i>And remember to call Jim.
He said it was urgent.</i>

404
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,172
Yeah, I doubt if it's urgent,
but I'll call him. Thanks.

405
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,461
<i>No, no, he said it's urgent.</i>

406
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,006
<i>It's a session this afternoon
at Columbia.</i>

407
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,766
<i>Somebody got sick and dropped out.
He thought you'd like the work.</i>

408
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,348
What? What?

409
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,184
<i>- Did he say that I need my guitar?
I think he mentioned a guitar.</i>

410
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,396
Do I need my guitar? Hello?

411
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,030
Hi, I'm here for Mr. Cromartie's
session. Llewyn Davis.

412
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,442
Have a seat.
I'll let him know you're here.

413
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,576
Llewyn.

414
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,747
Mr. Cromartie,
it's an honor to meet you.

415
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,212
Heh. Where's your guitar?

416
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,800
Hey.

417
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,215
- Hey, man, you made it.
- Yeah.

418
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,009
- You'll play a Gibson, right?
- Yours? Sure, yeah.

419
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,928
- You playing, uh-?
- Triple-O 21. Do you know Al Cody?

420
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,642
- Hey, man. Hey.
- Hi.

421
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,478
Can you read a chart, Llewyn?

422
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,687
I, uh...

423
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,193
I can stare at a chart and fake it, sir.

424
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,071
All right.
Jim and Al will teach you the song.

425
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,732
Take your time.
We're here to have fun.

426
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,070
All right.

427
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,530
So we're, uh...?

428
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,286
We're the what?
The John Glenn Singers?

429
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,197
It's not the most serious music
we've recorded at this studio.

430
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,707
Uh...

431
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,208
It's a thing.

432
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,293

434
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,839
Yeah, but we wanna go to-
Let's still do the "p-p-please" into the...

435
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,219
- Into the verse.
- Really?

436
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,425
- Yeah.

<i>Don't send me off into outer-
P- p-p-p-please</i>

438
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,352
What? No, I ca- Because then it gets
all muddled up into the verse.

439
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,727
- No, no, no.
Shoot.

440
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,355
No, you just do the p-p-p's
into the ver- If you do two p-p's.

441
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,687
- P-p, then the "sweat when they-"
- Yep.

442
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,147

- Yep.

00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,219
I did.

Yeah.

I'll get my vaccinations. Sign where?

You don't have a label?

Uh, I do. Legacy.

Oh, you're exclusive to Mel?

512
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,655
I'll need a permission.
He'll give you one.

Shit, man, I need the money now.

516
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,791
You wanna just be
an independent contractor,

517
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,543
Accounting will give you
a check today.

518
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,296
Just bill us for services, $200.
That's more than a session fee

519
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,379
- because you don't get royalties.
- Okay, that's fine. And I can cash it?

520
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,793
Sure, right around the corner.

521
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,428
<i>But you don't go on a session
sheet then, so no royalties.</i>

522
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,306
That's okay, that's fine.
Hey, where do you live, Al?

523
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,180
- Downing Street.
- Yeah, nice place?

524
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,980
- It's a dump.
- Uh-huh. Got a couch?

525
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,321
- Where's Mel?
- Mel's at a funeral.

526
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,031
Boy, that man goes
to a lot of funerals.

527
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,492
- He likes people.
- Fewer and fewer.

528
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,747
This is family.

529
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:56,376
His nephew, Georgie, is engaged
to a girl whose motherjust passed.

530
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,707
I don't know if that's family.

531
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,338
He likes funerals.
I don't know what to tell you.

532
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,252
I forgot to pick up my mail yesterday.
I was so pissed at Mel.

533
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,010
You didn't forget
to pick up your mail.

534
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,342
- Yeah, I did.
- You don't have any mail.

535
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,424
Oh.

536
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,642
Shit.

537
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,262
I didn't get anything
from Bud Grossman in Chicago?

538
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,476
You were supposed to get something
from Bud Grossman?

539
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,892
Yeah, I had Mel send him
my solo record when it came out.

540
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,436
- Whenever, more than a month ago.
- Oh.

541
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,321
No, you didn't get anything.

542
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,195
But we were making space
in the stock room

543
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,111
and dumped the rest
of the old records.

544
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,952
All the remainders.

545
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,790
Yours and Mikey's.

546
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,628
Mel set one box aside.

547
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,760
Thought you might wanna
keep some copies.

548
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,673
What am I gonna do with them?

549
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,682
Should I throw them out?

550
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,356
- Oh, good.
- Hey.

551
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,188
Here's a key.

552
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,899
Just going out to Jersey
to pick up my mom's car.

553
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,905
- Okay. Oh! Sorry. okay.
- Ha-ha-ha.

554
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,504
Mm-hm.

555
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,880
Yeah?
- Hey, it's me, Llewyn.

556
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,383
Yeah?
- Can I come up?

557
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,384
No.

Well-

560
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,716
Well, can I have my stuff?

561
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,056
<i>JEAN". H! bring it down.
H! meet you at the Reggie.</i>

562
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,726
Hey.

563
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,565
Thank you.

564
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,482
- Who won the lottery tonight?
- Huh?

565
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,578
Oh. I'm staying at Al Cody's.

566
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,037
So when do you wanna do the...?

567
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,042
- Have the-?
- The abortion?

568
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,211
The sooner the better.

569
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,964
Okay. I'll see when
the guy can do it then.

570
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,797
"The guy"? I hope it's a doctor.

571
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,586
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a doctor.

572
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,301
- You got the money?
- Yes, I have the money, don't worry.

573
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,340
- With you, I worry.
- Well, you shouldn't.

574
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,884
Yes, I should.

575
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,347
God knows you never do.

576
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,184
You just let other people,
like your method of birth control.

577
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,599
Oh, please don't start
with the double condoms again.

578
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,393
Do you ever think
about the future at all?

579
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,195
The future?

580
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,402
You mean, like flying cars?

581
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,613
Hotels on the moon?

582
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,618
- Tang?
- And this is why you're fucked.

583
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,324
No, it's why you're fucked.

584
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,115
You're just trying
to blueprint a future.

585
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,126
Move to the suburbs with Jim,
have kids.

586
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,379
- That's bad?
- If that's what music is for you,

587
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,711
a way to get to that place,
then, yeah, it's a little careerist,

588
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,047
and it's a little square,

589
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,049
- and it's a little sad.
- I'm sad?

590
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,010
You're the one
who's not getting anywhere.

591
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,175
You don't wanna get anywhere.
Me and Jim try.

592
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,470
- I do. I wanna-
- We try, you sleep on the couch.

593
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,189
- That's a bad thing to throw in my face.
- You don't wanna go anywhere.

594
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,692
That's why all the same shit
is gonna keep happening to you,

595
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,398
- because you want it to.
- Is that why?

596
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,734
Yes, and also
because you're an asshole

597
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,616
who sleeps with other people's women.
Let's not forget that.

598
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,823
You're being pretty kind
to yourself now, aren't you?

599
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,285
- Whose couch are you on tonight?
- I told you. Al Cody's. You don't listen.

600
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,080
You just spout vitriol.

601
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,244
Keep an eye on my shit.

602
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,428
Hey.

603
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,811
Hey. Hey, hey.

604
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,027
Oh, goddamn it.
I am one lucky bastard.

605
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,109
Thanks for suggesting this place.

606
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,286
Poor thing couldn't have eaten
since yesterday.

607
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,288
It's a damn house cat.
There you go.

608
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,417
You know its name?
I can't remember his name.

609
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,248
I don't know its name.

610
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,912
I don't hang out with the Gorfeins.

611
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,207
Oh, good kitty. Jesus, thank God.

612
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,092
Well, where were we?

613
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,926
You were calling me a careerist,
and I was calling you a loser.

614
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,511
Right, well,
those are your categories.

615
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,176
No, those are your categories.

616
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,719
You know, in my experience,

617
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,933
the world's divided
into two kinds of people.

618
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,144
Those who divide the world
into two kinds of people-

619
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,353
And losers?

620
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,606
- Hey'-
- Hey'-

621
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,321
Uh, can you bring this up for me?
This ain't a spot.

622
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,236
- I just brought some stuff from home.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

623
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,701
Hey, you don't need to- Meow.

624
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,242
You don't need to crash for more
than a couple days, do you?

625
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,410
My girlfriend's coming down
from Boston on Tuesday.

626
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:33,922
Uh- Yeah, no, that's... Yeah, it's fine.
That's okay. Yeah, thanks.

627
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,003
You don't wanna go to Chicago,
do you?

628
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,339
- Why would I wanna go to Chicago?
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

629
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,301
This car's going to Chicago Tuesday.
A friend of mine is taking someone

630
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,012
to a gig and they're looking
for someone to help pay for gas.

631
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,391
I prefer New York.

632
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,845
Who's "Arthur Milgram"?

633
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,434
Oh, that's me.

634
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,816
I'm gonna change it legally,
at some point.

635
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,996
Mr. Davis?

636
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,830
No, no, no,
she won't want me with her.

637
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,835
Oh, okay. Well, she should
have a friend though.

638
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,166
Someone who can help her home.

639
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,299
- Okay, I'll let her know.
- It'll have to be on a Saturday.

640
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,050
Hey, I could do it this Saturday.

641
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,712
Okay. I'll, uh, pay you now
since I won't see you. Cash.

642
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,257
Oh! No, no, no. Heh.

643
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,843
- No charge.
- Huh?

644
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,432
You know, from last time.

645
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,523
From last time? You mean Diane?

646
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,275
Yeah, I didn't have a number
or an address for you.

647
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,937
- Where do you live anyway?
- Wait, what?

648
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,276
- I didn't have a-
- Why...?

649
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,067
- Why is there no charge this time?
- Huh?

650
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,115
Why...?

651
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,405
Well, you know.

652
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,699
Well, no, I don't know, man.
You working pro bono now?

653
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,368
Well, no,
since it didn't happen last time.

654
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,625
What didn't happen?

655
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,088
Diane didn't tell you?

656
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,806
Diane did not terminate
the pregnancy.

657
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,311
She came in to tell me she decided

658
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,308
to go to term.

659
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,599
She didn't tell you?

660
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,476
Uh, no.

661
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,563
She, uh...

662
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,528
Geez, she asked me to refer her
to a doctor in Akron.

663
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,695
- In Akron?
- To deliver the, uh...

664
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,957
No, I knew she was, uh, going to Akron.
She's from Akron.

665
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,709
Yes.

666
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,292
- I'm sorry, I thought-
- Her parents are in Akron.

667
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,711
The kid would be about 2 now?

668
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,005
Yeah, I guess.

669
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,423
Yes.

670
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,181
I'm sorry, I didn't know how
to get the money back to you.

671
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,766
I never see you at the hoots
anymore.

672
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,129
- Oh, there's the cat.
- Yeah.

673
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,378
Home from the hill.
Hey, Llewyn, welcome. Come on in.

674
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,964
Lillian's in the kitchen.
She's making her famous moussaka.

675
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,129
No, I can't barge in for dinner.
I just wanted to-

676
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,300
- No, no. Come on. One more person?
- No, no, no. No, I can't.

677
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,969
Moussaka? Come on.

678
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,605
Do you know, uh-? You know
Marty Green and Janet Fung?

679
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,979
Hello, nice to meet you.
Llewyn Davis.

680
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,394
Oh, uh, Mitch and Lillian's, uh,
folk song friend.

681
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,607
You crashing with us?

682
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,068
Oh, no, no, no.
I hadn't even planned on dinner.

683
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,983
Llewyn's not an Upper West Side guy.
We only get to see him when-

684
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,902
When I've rotated through
my Village friends.

685
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,912
Yeah, we're the last resort.

686
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,415
Marty's in my department.
And, uh, Joe's a musician.

687
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,622
This is Joe Flom.
He plays in Musica Anticha with Lillian.

688
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,538
Oh, hello. How you doing?

689
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,923
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

690
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,300
What's your instrument?

691
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,214
Well, anything with a keyboard.
I play celeste and harpsichord in MA.

692
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,347
I'm a piano instructor most days.

693
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,134
- Hey, bum a cigarette?
- Oh, sure.

694
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,768
Glass of wine, Llewyn'?

695
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,474
- A little dago red?
- Yeah.

696
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,398
I should've brought something.

697
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,229
Hey, don't be silly,
you brought the cat.

698
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,563
Yeah, right.

699
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,524
You know, uh,

700
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,861
I used to, uh, take piano lessons
when I was a kid

701
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,573
from, uh, Mrs. Sieglestein.

702
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,156
You don't know Mrs. Sieglestein,
do you?

703
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:41,537
Very, very big calves,
orthopedic shoes,

704
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,376
lives in Far Rockaway,
upstairs from the Kurlands?

705
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,384
Does she play early music?

706
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,762
Um...

707
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,219
Harry James on the radio.

708
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,805
On the piano, um.

709
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,729
"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes. "

710
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,231
Uh-huh.

711
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,607
She was not a swinger.

712
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,939
Well, Harry James.

713
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,231
Okay, yeah, well, her playing that
was pretty on the beat.

714
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,529
He's adorable.

715
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,613
- How old is he?
- Just turned 2 in April.

716
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,997
He's with my mother now.

717
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,830
Grandmas come in handy, right?

718
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,915
What's his name?
Howie.

719
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,296
He already calls him Howie.
It's Howard.

720
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,081
Howie Greenfung.

721
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,884
What? Like...?

722
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,678
Like, "Green-fung"? Hyphenated?

723
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,589
No, no, one word, Greenfung.

724
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,428
Howard Greenfung.

725
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,390
You're kidding, right?

726
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,388
- No.
- Llewyn, why don't you-?

727
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,807
Why don't you give us a song?

728
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,192
Oh, yes, please. He's very good.

729
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,567
- Joe should hear you.
- No.

730
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,900
And Marty and Janet.
Of course.

731
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,986
I'm getting my Silvertone.
You get to play it if and only if you sing.

732
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:56,323
Right, yeah, okay, I can tell this is one
of those things where I keep saying no

733
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,283
and you think I'm just asking you
to beg more.

734
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,119
Yeah, that's right.

735
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,079
Hey, look, I'm not a trained poodle.

736
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,836
I thought singing was a joyous
expression of the soul.

737
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,380
Yeah.

738
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,760
All right. Um...

739
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,017
This is...

740
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,899
This one's early. Joe should like it.

741
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:38,198
<i>If I had wings</i>

742
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:41,365
<i>Like Norah's dove</i>

743
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,283
<i>I'd ﬂy up the river</i>

744
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:49,957
<i>To the one I love</i>

745
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,423
<i>- Fare thee well
- Well</i>

746
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,258
- Oh, honey-
- Oh, honey-

747
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,967
- What are you doing?
- What?

748
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,677
What is that? What are you doing?

749
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,889
- Well, it's Mike's part.
- Don't do that.

750
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:07,273
- It's Mike's part.
- I know what it is. Don't do that.

751
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,441
Oh, you know what? This is bullshit.

752
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,735
I'm sorry, this is-
I don't do this, okay?

753
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,826
I do this for a living. It's not a-
it's not a fucking parlor game.

754
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,991
Llewyn, please, that's unfair to Lillian.

755
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,080
This is bullshit.
I don't ask you over for dinner

756
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:30,087
and then suggest you give a lecture
on the peoples of Mesoamerica.

757
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,839
Or whatever
your pre-Columbian shit is.

758
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,585
This is my job.
This is how I pay the fucking rent.

759
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,253
Llewyn, that's not...

760
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,717
This is a loving home.

761
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,677
I'm a fucking professional.
And you know what?

762
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,217
- Fuck Mike's part!
- Ah!

763
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,977
- It's okay, Lillian.
- This is just a- This is...

764
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,640
I can't stay in this room.
I can't stay in this room.

765
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,774
Well, she-

766
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,816
She doesn't have to leave.
I'm leaving, obviously.

767
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,278
Sorry I fucked up your evening.

768
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,909
- Thank you for the moussaka.
Aah!

769
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,124
This is not our cat.

770
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,173
What? Of course that's your cat.

771
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,835
Oh, my God.
- It's not even male.

772
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,134
Where's its scrotum, Llewyn?

773
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:23,596
- Wh... it's-
- Where's its scrotum?

774
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,332
My stuff.

775
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,446
Hello.

776
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,120
Yeah, hey.

777
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,656
What's this?

778
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,362
It's my guitar.

779
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:08,113
Sure, move in. Don't mind me.

780
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,997
Make yourself at home.

781
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,207
What are you, a ﬂamenco dancer?

782
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,587
What's your name? Pablo?

783
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,172
Llewyn Davis.

784
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,423
I am Roland Turner.

785
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,559
This is my valet, Johnny Five.

786
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,430
Johnny Five.

787
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,519
And that was the last time
I was in Murfreesboro.

788
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,279
Gave me to understand
I would not be welcome back.

789
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,987
I said, "That's okay, brother.
I might have managed on my own

790
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:49,950
not to make it back
to your little flyspeck horseshit town. "

791
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,906
What the N stand for?

792
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,419
- What?
- What's the N stand for?

793
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,046
- Lou N. Davis.
- "Llewyn. "

794
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,924
Llewyn, L-L-E-W-Y-N. It's Welsh.

795
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,382
Well, it would have to be something,
stupid fucking name like that.

796
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,467
- You don't look Welsh-
- My mother was Italian-

797
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,802
Here, this would interest you.

798
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,934
Johnny and I were in Seattle
playing the High Spot.

799
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,139
Remember this, Johnny?

800
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:17,398
And I became indisposed after eating
a toasted cheese sandwich,

801
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,810
and found myself purging
from every orifice,

802
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,774
one of them like a fire hose.

803
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,406
I said to the manager:

804
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,492
"What do you call that thing
I just ate?"

805
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:32,076
He said, "Welsh rarebit. "

806
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,868
I says, "Okay, does everything
from Wales make you shit yourself,

807
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,376
or just this piece of toast?"

808
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,246
He said- Holy Jesus.
What is that thing?

809
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,961
It's- It's my cat.
Well, it's not my cat, it's-

810
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,921
Grown man with a cat.

811
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,303
- Is that part of your act?
- No.

812
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,010
- What'd you say you played?
- Folk songs.

813
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,767
Folk songs. Thought you said
you were a musician.

814
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,770
Folk singer with a cat. You queer?

815
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,267
L- It's not my cat.
I just didn't know what to do with it.

816
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,561
Really? So did you bring
your dick along too?

817
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,946
Johnny, hold up.

818
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,358
There's a service station.

819
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,698
Your turn to pay for gas, Elwin.

820
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,840
He still in there?

821
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,087
You're a friend of Al's?

822
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,720
Yeah.

823
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:34,198
<i>When Igo back

824

825
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,199
<i>Come along and follow me</i>

826
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,203

827
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,205

831
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,630

00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,560
Nice.

834
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,946
There was a sign that said,
"No massé shots, no coins on cloth. "

835
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:22,788
I said, "Am I allowed to bank the ball
off the cushions or is that too fancy?"

836
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,796
The guy says, "You're a hustler. "
I say, "You're a fucking idiot.

837
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,457
A hustler pretends
he's out of his depth.

838
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,467
I'm telling you I'm an adept.
Maybe you're the hustler

839
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:36,256
pretending to be a lunkhead.
Got me fooled. "

840
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,850
"No massé shots, no coins on cloth. "

841
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,852
Don't give me rules.
You play what you play.

842
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,481
Well, you don't, but in jazz,
you know, we play all the notes.

843
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,567
Twelve notes in a scale, dipshit,
not three chords on a ukulele.

844
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:55,450
G, G, C, G'

845

<i>C,D,G</i>

00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,248
Well, if you make a living at it,
more power to you.

847
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,666
Solo act?

848
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,078
- Yeah, now.
- Now?

849
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,463
Used to, what, work with the cat'?

850
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,625
Every time you play a C major,
he'd puke a hair ball?

851
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,418
I used to have a partner.

852
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,508
What happened?

853
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,637
He threw himself off
the George Washington Bridge.

854
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,186
Well, shit, I don't blame him.

855
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,814
I couldn't take it either, having to play
"Jimmy Cracked Corn" every night.

856
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,772
Oh, pardon me for saying so,
that's pretty fucking stupid, isn't it?

857
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,902
George Washington Bridge?

858
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,861
You throw yourself off
the Brooklyn Bridge, traditionally.

859
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,822
George Washington Bridge?

860
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,702
Who does that?

861
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,159
What was he, a dumbbell?

862
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,496
Not really.

863
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,002
And that's when
you picked up the cat?

864
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,457
Here, Cowboy Chords,
this would interest you.

865
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,921
There's this act I saw
in Montreux, Switzerland.

866
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,303
- A bass, a piano and a sound tree-
- Hey, Mr. Turner, I'm wondering.

867
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,089
- Huh?
- Would that cane

868
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,757
fit all the way up your ass

869
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,268
or would a little bit stay sticking out?

870
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,978
OK8)'-

871
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,851
OK8)'-

872
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,355
Except threats and intimidation
won't work with me.

873
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,741
You wanna know why?
This would interest you.

874
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,617
I studied Santeria

875
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,996
and certain other things that squares
like you would call the black arts

876
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,704
due to lack of understanding,
from Chano Pozo in New Orleans.

877
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,083
You say you'll mess me up?

878
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,371
I don't have to make
those childish threats.

879
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:34,211
I do my thing, and one day
you wake up wondering:

880
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,796
"Why do I have this pain
in my side?"

881
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,883
Or maybe it won't even be
that specific.

882
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,639
Maybe it's,
"Why is nothing going right for me?

883
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,143
My life is a big bowl of shit.

884
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,976
I don't remember making
this big bowl of shit. "

885
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,611
Meantime, Roland Turner
is a thousand miles away,

886
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,613
laughing his ass off.

887
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,817
Think about that, Elwin.

888
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:05,864
In this car, bad manners won't work.

889
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,967
Bum a cigarette?

890
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,425
I'm out.

891
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,993
"Clean Asshole Poems,"

892
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,670
Orlovs Ky.

893
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,090
Then,

894
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,293
acted.

895
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,136

Could've been more.

898
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,522
Cops closed it.

899
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,529
How come'?

900
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,822

00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,277
Hi.

914
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,037
How far are we from Chicago?

915
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,699
About three hours,
a little more with the weather.

916
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,806
Should I go call an ambulance?

917
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,140
No, he's all right.

918
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,527
<i>Grab his sticks.</i>

919
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:04,874
What are you doing?

920
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,334
- I'm just, uh-
- You can't stop here.

921
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,633
I just pulled over to rest a little bit.

922
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,420
You inebriated?

923
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,885
- He's not drunk.
- I wasn't talking to you.

924
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,888
You, get out of the car.

925
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,724
- Me?
- You. Out of the car.

926
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,275
Come here, I want you to walk-

927
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,188
Hands off the merchandise.
Don't play games, kid.

928
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,737
Son of a bitch.

929
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,200
Let's go.
Yeah.

930
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,287
I've been in your jails-
That's not gonna work.

931
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,590
Shit.

932
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,762
Oh, sh...

933
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,822
Number two.

934
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,086
- More coffee?
- Yeah.

935
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:08,872
We're switching over.
Could you pay the ticket?

936
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,049
What train are you waiting for?

937
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,269
Hello?

938

- No.

Because I'm a Communist.

- That's another way of putting it.
- Is that a nautical term?

You ain't current on your dues.

01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:15,833
You put in some hard years, yeah,
but eventually you get to kick back,

1098
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:19,291
your food's brought to you,
don't even have to get up to shit.

1099
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,548
- Llewyn, Danny's sitting right here.
- Oh, sorry.

1100
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,834
What's wrong with you?
Shame on you.

1101
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,799
I'm sorry. It was really good to see him.
It was great.

1102
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,214
- Where'd you put my file box?
- Huh?

1103
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:32,557
From the house, where's my file box?

1104
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,468
You told me to throw everything out.

1105
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:35,932
All the old shit, Joy.

1106
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,188
- Fuck, you threw out my file box?
- Llewyn.

1107
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:41,191
Yeah, no cursing. Except now I gotta
go back to the fucking union hall.

1108
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,444
It had my Masters Mate's
and Pilot's license in it.

1109
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:44,945
Jesus Christ, Joy.

1110
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,696
You told me to put it out by the curb.

1111
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:47,981
It's what I did.

1112
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,196
I want you to leave. Get out of here.

1113
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,406
Fuck.

1114
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,453
- Yeah, I'm a dick, right?
- That's right.

1115
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,128
Danny, your uncle's a bad man.

1116
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,913
OK8)'-

1117
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,254
Hello?
- It's Llewyn. Don't hang up.

1118
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,969
I don't wanna stay. I just need a place
to dump my stuff. Please.

1119
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,930
I'm tired of dragging it
all around with me.

1120
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,178
Please?

1121
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,956
- Where are you gonna stay?
- I don't know.

1122
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,162
It's only two nights.

1123
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:42,954
There must be someone in the
five boroughs who isn't pissed at me.

1124
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,253
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

1125
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,462
Why?

1126
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,552
So it went okay?

1127
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,130
I'm doing it Saturday.

1128
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:56,517
Jesus, Llewyn,
you don't even fucking remember.

1129
01:24:56,675 --> 01:25:00,430
Yeah, boy, I'm sorry. I- I was away.

1130
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,770
Well, it seemed like it was a long time,
but it was just a couple of days. Yeah.

1131
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,230
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Where were you?

1132
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,236
In Chicago.

1133
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,567
Why?

1134
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,316
No. Nothing.

1135
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,238
Pappi will let you play tomorrow.

1136
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,534
Pick up a couple bucks.

1137
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,540
No, he won't.
I was there less than a month ago.

1138
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,201
He will. I asked him.

1139
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:26,463
Wow. Thank you,
that was very nice of you,

1140
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,126
but I'm out. I'm done.

1141
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,550
- Going back to the Merchant Marine.
- What, that's it?

1142
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,464
This could be good for you
tomorrow.

1143
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,599
Playing the Gaslight
for the 400th time?

1144
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,010
For the fucking basket?

1145
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,645
Actually,
you'd have to split the basket.

1146
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,555
- Heh.
- There's another act.

1147
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,645
<i>But The Times is gonna be there.</i>

1148
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,354
<i>Oh, The Times.</i>

1149
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:49,861
I'm sorry.

1150
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,773
I'm sorry. Thanks for the thought,

1151
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,908
but it's not going anywhere.

1152
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,283
I'm tired.

1153
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:00,572
You're tired?

1154
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:04,376
Yeah, I'm so fucking tired.

1155
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:08,171
I thought I just needed a night's sleep,
but it's...

1156
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,874
It's more than that.

1157
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:16,263
But thank you, for trying.

1158
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,215
I love you.

1159
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,474
Come on.

1160
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:25,890
Are you shitting me?

1161
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,058
In what way, buddy?

1162
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,069
Eighty-five dollars?
To replace a license?

1163
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,196
You don't throw out the license.

1164
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,403
That's the one thing you keep.

1165
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:37,112
I can't... Where am I gonna...?

1166
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,119
Fuck.

1167
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,914
All right, well,
let me get this money back then.

1168
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,329
I got...

1169
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,753
I kept this fucking thing.

1170
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:52,257
I just paid my dues this morning,
148 bucks. There's the receipt.

1171
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,918
You don't...

1172
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,966
We don't pay dues back.
What are you, nuts?

1173
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,716
I just paid it this morning.
That was four hours ago.

1174
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,429
- Yeah.
- Come on, you're telling me-

1175
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,061
I can't crew the ship,
and I can't get this money back?

1176
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,518
This was money
you owed your union.

1177
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:10,230
You Hugh Davis's kid?

1178
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,315
- Yeah.
- How's he doing?

1179
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,946
He's fucking great. Matter of fact,
he's been asking after you.

1254
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,071
Oh, Mitch, I really appreciate this.

1255
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:36,242
After last time,
I just can't tell you how sorry I am.

1256
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,876
Oh, forget it.

1257
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:41,880
We all get a little emotional over Mike.
It comes out in different ways.

1258
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:44,507
He had such life, you know?
Such a talent.

1259
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:47,294
It's a big hole. A big hole.

1260
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,134
- How long will you be with us?
- Just a day or two, if that's okay.

1261
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,594
- Just until I can figure out the next...
- Sure, yeah.

1262
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,304
Do you know Arlen
and Dodi Gamble?

1263
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,469
This is Llewyn Davis,
our folk-singer friend.

1264
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,183
You're Jim and Jean's friend.

1265
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,349
Uh, sort of.

1266
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,984
Jim played us a pressing of that record,
"Please, Mr. Kennedy. "

1267
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,611
- It was hysterical.
- So funny.

1268
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,066
That's gonna be a hit, man.

1269
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,323
Royalties on that? Whoa, Nelly.

1270
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:11,280
I wish I was in your business.
I mean, one hit could fix you up.

1271
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:15,038
- Uh, yeah...
- Llewyn.

1272
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,824
- Lillian-
- I am so sorry I upset you.

1273
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:22,121
No, no, no.
You're apologizing to me?

1274
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,334
- Yeah.
- No.

1275
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,543
Holy shit.

1276
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,129
- On! Heh.
- on.

1277
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,545
Oh, that's- That's good.
You got a new cat.

1278
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:31,054
- No.
No, he came home.

1279
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,259
Found his way back.

1280
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,925
The doorman heard something
scratching yesterday morning.

1281
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:37,310
Early morning, the wee hours.
- Yeah, see?

1282
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:39,142
<i>It's Ulysses.</i>

1283
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:42,808
- It's- Ulysses?
- Ulysses.

1284
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,352
That's its name?

1285
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:20,182
Hello?

1286
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:05,148
<i>And I'll be dead and gone</i>

1287
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,440
<i>I wouldn't mind the hanging</i>

1288
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:14,274
<i>But the laying in the grave's so long
Poor boy</i>

1289
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:19,492
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

1290
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,928
You probably heard that one before.

1291
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:40,972
If it was never new, and it never
gets old, then it's a folk song.

1292
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,562
All right, one more before I go.

1293
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:58,611
<i>If I had wings</i>

1294
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:01,620
<i>Like Norah's dove</i>

1295
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:05,249
<i>I'd ﬂy up the river</i>

1296
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:09,538
<i>To the one I love</i>

1297
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:13,504
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1298
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:16,715
<i>Oh, honey</i>

1299
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:22,677
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1300
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:30,267
<i>Early one morning</i>

1301
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:32,481
<i>Drizzling rain</i>

1302
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,194
<i>And in my heart</i>

1303
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:40,486
<i>I felt an achin' pain</i>

1304
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:44,831
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1305
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:48,118
<i>Oh, honey</i>

1306
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:54,333
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1307
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:01,302
<i>One of these mornings</i>

1308
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:04,468
<i>It won't be long</i>

1309
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:07,808
<i>You'll cal! my name</i>

1310
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:12,272
<i>And H! be gone</i>

1311
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:16,028
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1312
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:19,612
<i>Oh, honey</i>

1313
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:25,705
<i>Fare, fare thee well</i>

1314
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:32,162
<i>if I had wings</i>

1315
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:35,377
<i>Like Norah's dove</i>

1316
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,589
<i>I'd ﬂy up the river</i>

1317
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,255
<i>To the one I love</i>

1318
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,393
<i>Oh, fare thee well</i>

1319
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:49,596
<i>Oh, honey</i>

1320
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:57,313
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1321
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,576
That's what I got.

1322
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:15,792
- You and Mikey used to do that song.
- Yeah.

1323
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:18,424
Boy, you were some mess last night.

1324
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,460
Yeah, sorry, Pappi. I'm an asshole.

1325
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,636
I don't give a shit.

1326
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:25,969
- Your friend is out back.
- My friend?

1327
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:29,557
Said he was a friend of yours.
Guy in a suit.

1328
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:36,735
<i>Oh, it's fare thee well
My darling true</i>

1329
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:41,114
<i>I'm leaving in the first hour
Of the morn</i>

1330
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,749
You a funny boy, huh?

1331
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:55,036
What?

1332
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:59,044
Had to open your big mouth.

1333
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:01,710
That's what I do for a living.

1334
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:06,841
What you do.
Make fun of folks up there?

1335
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:13,187
You sit there in the audience
last night, yelling your crap.

1336
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:15,314
You yell stuff, man. It's a show.

1337
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,568
It wasn't your show.

1338
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:21,354
It's not the opera, jackass.
It's a fucking basket hou-

1339
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:25,612
We're leaving this fucking
cesspool. You can have it.

1340
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,699
What you do.

1341
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:36,537
- My wife up there trying to sing.
- Unh.

1342
