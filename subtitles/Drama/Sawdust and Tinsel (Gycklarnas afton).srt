1
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,120
Tomorrow you'll see your wife again.

2
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
Are you nervous?

3
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,880
It's been 3 years...

4
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,320
You know who arrived here
with the clown and his wife?

5
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,520
They were at Weger's then

6
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,040
Here, you say?

7
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes. I was there. It was rather painful.

8
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
I'll tell you about it.

9
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,440
Poor old Frost!

10
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,080
That was seven years ago.

11
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,040
The garrison was run by the gun.

12
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,640
The officers were bastards.

13
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,400
They lay around drinking schnapps.

14
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,480
The troops were training hard at the beach..

15
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,480
That was the scenario!

16
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Then, they saw Alma.

17
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,280
She still had
a queenly persona

18
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,480
though already a bit faded.

19
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,760
The chief greets you...

20
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,280
What is this honor worth to your chief?

21
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
Your wife?

22
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,200
My wife! and then?

23
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,040
She's bathing naked with the soldiers!

24
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,200
Be a man!

25
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,920
Have to kill her!

26
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,640
She needs a kick in the backside!

27
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,080
Load the guns!

28
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,880
She shouted
that we were killing her husband.

29
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,160
Strange, such a woman...

30
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,400
Nobody's paid any more,
and there's nothing to eat.

31
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,640
Only half of the costumes are left.

32
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,120
There are some
who don't have anything to do.

33
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,320
Your problemss are appreciated.

34
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,400
Rain, you can nothing about it.

35
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,800
Sure!

36
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,840
All the kids have worms.

37
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,280
My wagon is full of fleas.

38
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,400
I'll be running the menagerie!

39
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,560
There's the bear...edible perhaps.

40
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,560
If it were killed
before it dies of its own accord?

41
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,560
Rather kill you!

42
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,400
Or me... that'd be better.

43
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,680
Then, Albert!
How about that?

44
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,520
Good idea!

45
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,280
Afterwards, you feel stupid.

46
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
- In America...
- Ah! It's not like here!

47
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
Over there, they march through
the city in procession!

48
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
Music and elephants at the head,

49
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,440
everyone smiling...

50
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,280
to the cheers of the crowd,

51
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,480
a powerful voice shouts the program.

52
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,560
If you went by caravan
and our most beautiful costumes?

53
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,000
Those that were left behind?

54
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,560
Then, posters will be made.

55
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,360
Madam Ekberg'll perform,
and Anton 'll be the crier.

56
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Not a bad idea!

57
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,720
I'll wear my green dress!

58
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,920
But no dwarf!

59
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I'll be at the front to announce you!

60
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,760
Another idea! Actors from the
Sjuberg theatre are here on tour.

61
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,760
I'll ask them for some costumes

62
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,320
and this evening: The Grand Official Reception!

63
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,600
Followed-up by a supper of schnapps,

64
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,440
beefsteak, chateaubriand...

65
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,440
and caviar!

66
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,600
On the flower-covered hill, Hjalmar sang

67
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,320
acts of war of yesteryear...

68
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,960
Put on your yellow dress, quickly!

69
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,560
Curl your hair
and fix your make-up!

70
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
We're going visiting.

71
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,880
To the prefect's?
- No, to Sjuberg's.

72
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,280
The theatre people? Are you crazy?

73
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,880
Show me that!

74
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,560
Your ears are dirty.

75
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,160
You won't leave me?

76
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,080
What do you want to say?

77
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,240
If the circus is done for...

78
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,400
We'll know it.

79
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,280
You promise not to leave me?

80
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,360
Don't worry.

81
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,320
You'll see your wife.

82
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,520
And my kids... it's been 3 years...

83
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,040
I am afraid that you do not go back there.

84
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,920
Calm down, darling.

85
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,560
Can I shave?

86
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,800
One day we'll be successful.

87
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,320
You believe that?

88
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,480
Rich circus directors do exist!

89
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,880
They have a house, diamonds,

90
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,280
cars...

91
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,240
The only thing is...

92
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,720
they're in America.

93
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,880
There are still some costumes!

94
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,440
And umbrellas. So...!

95
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
What's up?

96
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,840
Nothing... why?

97
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,400
You seem anxious.

98
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,240
Me? Not at all!

99
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,760
It's up to me to speak to him.

100
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,320
You... you give him your most charming smile.

101
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,240
Pretty girls, that's what interests him.

102
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,720
Breathe deeply, so he sees your breasts.

103
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,200
If he wants to see your legs,
you needn't refuse.

104
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,160
I'll take care of you.

105
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,480
Just keep your mouth shut.

106
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,400
An innocent heart
is a woman's wealth

107
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,960
and will make him smother any temptation.

108
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,920
My dear father, your words

109
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,520
will bear fruit in my heart.

110
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,160
Madam your mother...
for Mister your father...

111
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,600
Mister my husband!

112
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,360
Who do you want?
- the director.

113
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,080
He's rehearsing.

114
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,400
We'll wait.

115
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,080
Who dares speak during rehearsal?

116
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,800
There's a gentleman and a lady...

117
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,440
They can go to the devil!

118
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,040
Here they come!

119
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,360
Wait! He wants to speak to you.

120
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,520
Some other day.

121
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,680
Hello, Mr. Sjuberg.

122
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,480
What a good weather!

123
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,320
I'm Albert Johansson,

124
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,720
owner of the Alberti circus.

125
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,320
and this is Anne, my wife.

126
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,640
Curtsy!

127
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,560
What can I for you?

128
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,240
Us... It's that...

129
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,000
A chair for Madam!

130
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,840
May I?

131
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
I', listening, Mr. Alberti.

132
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,360
Misfortune resulted in half...

133
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,280
our costumes...

134
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,400
being destroyed.

135
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,520
It occurred to me that
you could help us

136
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,160
by lending us
some capes and hats...

137
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,400
between fellow-theatricals...

138
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,160
And what if we catch your vermin?

139
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,520
Lice, the pox...

140
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,000
How would we tell?
I don't know this circus.

141
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,040
It's a serious risk!

142
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,520
I guarantee you...

143
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,960
How much will you pay me?

144
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
Eh well... I was thinking...

145
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,440
- How much do you want?
- Too much, I'm sure.

146
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,760
You insult me.

147
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,840
Yes...

148
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,640
Because you lot are tramps,
as much as us,

149
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,400
and because you go along with
my insults.

150
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,480
Your caravans are not even up
to our shabby hotels.

151
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,200
Your art is not Art.

152
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,680
The lowest here
scorns the best among you.

153
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,680
You only risk your lives.

154
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,520
We risk our pride.

155
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,960
I find your getup ridiculous,

156
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,720
and Madam would undoubtedly look better
without hers.

157
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,480
You don't dare laugh
at our false elegance,

158
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,080
our rouge, our accents.

159
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,440
Why not insult you?

160
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,600
I wouldn't...I don't understand you.

161
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,040
You're so forceful.

162
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,920
And costumes?

163
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,520
You'll have them.

164
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,720
But... how much?

165
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,160
Invite us this evening!

166
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,200
- What an honor!
- Most certainly.

167
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,000
Mr Blom will show you the attic.

168
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,560
Start the scene again!

169
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,000
Courage, my child!
An innocent heart...

170
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,520
You've made me insane!

171
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,160
I lost my head!

172
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,320
Do you want to marry me?

173
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,360
That old ass won't have you any more!

174
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,640
You divide his bed?

175
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,240
You whisper soft words
in his ear?

176
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,480
Come on! Don't make me suffer any more!

177
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,320
I love you!

178
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,160
I want you! Immediately!

179
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,360
I could rape you on the spot,

180
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,320
in front of your dopey director.

181
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,480
Let me go!

182
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,640
No, I won't let you go!

183
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,720
I'll do what I want.

184
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,680
Not that!

185
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,280
You shouldn't talk like that
about my husband!

186
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,800
Only with you, I'd beat you.

187
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,000
I'd rip your low resistance to shreds

188
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,320
like dirty paper!

189
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,200
Who are you going on about?

190
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,600
Don't play the bull.
I'm not your cow.

191
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,560
Deep down you have more choices to make a better deal.

192
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,720
What's your tariff?

193
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
I have a bit saved.

194
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,240
I should have started there.

195
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,360
You are too beautiful.
You have the air of a girl.

196
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,160
Do you want my opinion?

197
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,920
You've never fulfilled a woman!

198
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,520
Careful what you say!

199
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,880
You aren't so beautiful when you blush

200
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,440
If you goad me, I bite.

201
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,840
You'll hurt your mouth.

202
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,600
If I'm not beautiful,
you, you're beautiful!

203
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,120
Forget all I said!

204
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,800
Forgive me!
You must like me...

205
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,320
I beg you!

206
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,360
On your knees!

207
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,520
Face to the ground!

208
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,080
Down further! Harder!

209
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,800
I'll kiss you just once.

210
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Only once.

211
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,280
Go away! You're turning me into a bad woman!

212
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,760
These costumes are fantastic!

213
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,120
This evening, the Alberti circus
is giving an official reception!

214
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,880
M. Blom is a friend!
It offered us schnapps!

215
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,440
You want some?

216
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,920
Listen, good people, and admire!

217
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,200
At great cost and sarifice,

218
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,240
the Alberti circus has come to you!

219
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,280
This evening, an unrivalled Gala performance!

220
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,720
Full of beauty, and excitement!

221
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,040
Not forgetting laughter!

222
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,120
Splendid scenes,

223
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,240
dazzling costumes!

224
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,240
Artists of world fame!

225
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,960
Quiet!

226
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,080
Don't you know this is illegal?

227
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,760
A little advertisement...

228
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,600
You have authorization?

229
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,200
But I believed...

230
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,960
The gentleman is a believer!

231
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,920
Everybody down! Onto the ground!

232
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
Go to the marketplace there, you are tolerated.

233
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,200
You'll see, species of monkey!

234
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,440
You want me to learn to you
to respect the law?

235
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,080
Down! Everyone down!

236
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,400
Died with the cows!

237
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,000
Uncouple the horses!

238
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,760
They will spend the night on our premises.

239
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,800
That will learn how to you to discuss.

240
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,680
On the way!

241
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,800
Heap of jokers!

242
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,480
You, you do that?

243
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,720
She'll not have anything to say!

244
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
And then I don't care!

245
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,800
You drank?

246
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,200
- You'll return early?
- Look at me.

247
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,560
You'd spend the night there!

248
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,840
It's 3 years since I saw my kids!

249
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,560
Now it's urgent!

250
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,480
You don't understand.

251
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,400
I know she's waiting for you...

252
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,480
waiting for your return.

253
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,360
You'll work in her shop.

254
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,960
The farm!

255
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,520
Don't contradict me!

256
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,840
You think of your retirement.

257
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,320
You're getting old, you're afraid.

258
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,880
I'll be back for the gala reception.

259
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,760
Stay here!

260
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,360
Don't go there!

261
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,560
I beg you!

262
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,520
- You're crying?
- Not at all.

263
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,440
- You're jealous?
- Does that astonish you?

264
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,600
And if you left for good?

265
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,000
You've had enough of the circus and me.

266
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,160
What would I do without you?

267
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
But I love you!

268
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,120
If it were true,
you wouldn't be going to her place.

269
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,440
I love you though.

270
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,000
- Liar!
- Good, good, we'll see about it!

271
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,640
You'll not find me here when you get back!

272
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,040
Where would you go?

273
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,120
Somewhere... you'll see.

274
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,000
So much the worse for you.

275
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,360
What do you want?

276
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,680
Don't you  recognize me?

277
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,360
No.

278
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,760
Wait...

279
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,720
What do you want?

280
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,440
- is Your mother there?
- Yes.

281
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,440
- Can I see her?
- She's having lunch.

282
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,360
I can await for her?

283
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,640
The weather is nice.

284
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,200
You are my dad?

285
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,040
Yes.

286
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,240
You are well?

287
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,000
And your brother?

288
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,320
He lost a tooth.

289
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,080
And you, you help your mother.

290
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,560
That's good.

291
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,680
How old are you?

292
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,000
9.

293
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,960
Would you like to join the circus?

294
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,320
No.

295
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,960
Here's mama.

296
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,880
Hello Agda.

297
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,040
I came to see you while passing through.

298
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,520
Are you hungry?

299
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,200
Do I look hungry?

300
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,120
Sounds like it.

301
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,320
Good, I accept!

302
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,440
Watch the shop.

303
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,240
I have only crepes.
Does that suit you?

304
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,920
Fine.

305
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,320
Is the shop doing OK?

306
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,840
Forsell sold up his to me.

307
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,480
I have the two tobacco shops in town.

308
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,880
You look after the other one?

309
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,160
Obviously!

310
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,160
Take off your jacket.

311
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,320
I'm OK as I am.

312
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,160
There's a button missing.

313
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,520
What about your shirts?
Don't you have have any newer?

314
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,200
Probably not.

315
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,440
Buy some!

316
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,360
I can't buy anything.

317
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,760
- don't shout!
- You aggravate me!

318
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,920
Then go away!

319
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,080
I can lend you some money.

320
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,800
Shameful!

321
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,040
Be civil!

322
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,520
It's none of your business!

323
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,360
Very generous of you, I don't want any.

324
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,600
You are too weak!
The thing is so simple.

325
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,000
Why refuse?

326
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,560
You feel strong! You are avenged!

327
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,840
Of what?

328
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,360
Don't be funny!

329
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,000
To have left me?

330
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,040
But I'm grateful!

331
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,400
What?

332
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,440
Now, I have peace.

333
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,960
You left, now my life belongs to me.

334
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,240
More than circus...

335
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,160
That disgusting circus
that scared me so much!

336
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,080
Screaming, swearing,
bickering,

337
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,000
vermin, filth!

338
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,160
Here, I'm happy...
and grateful.

339
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,400
Let's go into the drawing room.

340
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,480
You are an impressive woman.

341
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,640
Thank you.

342
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,280
- Us, things were good.
- How?

343
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,320
Us two,
before you had the shop.

344
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,880
I felt sorry for the kids.

345
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,400
You wanted to form them.

346
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,920
No, sincerely, it was hard.

347
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,400
- You followed me.
- I loved you.

348
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,120
No more?

349
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,360
Is there any point in talking about all that?

350
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,720
No, perhaps not.

351
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,720
My love had done nothing but grow.

352
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,600
But the shortly after your departure,
it had already died.

353
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,520
Odd.

354
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,600
I did not leave you.

355
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,400
You stayed here, me on the road.

356
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,240
Let's not talk about it any more.

357
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,720
You see everything so clearly!

358
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,560
For me, it's allmuddled.

359
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,760
You have money problems...?

360
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,880
What a question!

361
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,200
Your health.

362
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,400
And yours, and thank you.

363
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,840
Nothing changes, here.

364
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,720
Summer or winter, all is calm.

365
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,880
It is a quiet street.

366
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,160
The years go by, and nothing changes.

367
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,320
It is a ripening.

368
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,560
Not, it's a void.

369
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,480
I'm nothing but a clown

370
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,440
in this world of illusions.

371
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,680
The perfidy of a woman, her weakness,

372
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,280
her indifference even,
change my existence

373
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,480
from day in day, hour in hour.

374
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,840
Am I the Count
Badrincourt de Chamball?

375
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,200
Or I am the most miserable
of men?

376
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,920
Out, O dagger, from your hiding-place.

377
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,680
Seek the place
where your thirst will be appeased!

378
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,320
You are my mistress

379
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,280
whom I press to my heart.

380
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,600
The night will see our union
in this garden

381
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,360
where formerly, my cruel goddess

382
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,240
granted her favours to me.

383
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,200
Good-bye, cruel world!

384
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,960
Good-bye, my sovereign!

385
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,080
Your tears can
fall upon my grave.

386
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,400
I die.

387
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,760
Raise the curtain!

388
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,600
Everyone on stage!

389
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,360
The rehearsal is finished.

390
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,680
Quite a sad spectacle.

391
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,080
M. Blom is an idiot.

392
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,800
Thank you, he knows it.

393
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,000
I want to leave the circus.

394
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,920
Are you making fun of me?

395
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,200
I smile at you because you are beautiful.

396
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,200
You do not need to marry me,
you know.

397
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,440
You smell of the stable,
the bad perfume and sweat...

398
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,120
I'll lick you like a dog!

399
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,000
I'll teach you make-up.

400
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,120
Your mouth...

401
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,600
- I really smell of sweat?
- I said that as a joke.

402
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,080
My perfume isn't expensive.

403
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,840
I'll give you some. Wait...

404
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,440
Your hands are beautiful.

405
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,320
That must be expensive!

406
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,880
It's for you.

407
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,520
Nothing to do in the stable.

408
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,360
All here feel the same.

409
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,880
You put make-up on me?

410
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,040
What do you want with makeup?

411
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,200
- a present?
- Gently!

412
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,840
From a woman!

413
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,640
With its return: No more Anne!

414
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,960
No more rider for her ponies!

415
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,240
No more lady sawn into two
by a drunken magician!

416
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,400
Part, disappeared!

417
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,080
And if you get tired of me?

418
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,800
Then, I'll kill you.

419
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,120
If I don't commit suicide first!

420
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,640
Oh, I'm strong. Feel me!

421
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,840
Terrible!

422
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,760
I crack nuts with them!

423
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,280
You frighten me!

424
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,040
I also go full gallop,
without a saddle,

425
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,200
hanging on by my thighs.

426
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,080
You can do that?

427
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,480
No, I don't think so.

428
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,760
You're not strapping man.

429
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,920
You're well made, but a bit flabby.

430
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,200
What an affront!

431
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,400
I bet I'm the strongest!

432
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,400
You eat far too much.

433
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,800
Let me alone! I don't want it!

434
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,040
Let you go now?

435
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,040
I don't dare do it!
I don't want any more.

436
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,600
Give me the key!

437
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,920
How does one learn
how to dance with the bears?

438
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,840
Do you need hot irons?

439
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,480
Give me the key!

440
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,800
You hate me?

441
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,440
The key! The key!

442
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,240
Yes, you hate me...
and I still like you.

443
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,760
The key!

444
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,760
You'll get it afterwards...

445
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,080
The key!

446
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,760
We haven't finished playing.

447
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,280
This amulet is a valuable thing.

448
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,840
I received it from a grateful lady.

449
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,000
If you are good, you can have it.

450
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,160
By selling it,
you will be able to live for a year.

451
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,160
You will be able to leave the circus.

452
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,360
It will carry you to happiness.

453
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,360
You will sell it to a jeweller at face value.

454
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,960
Will that pay me ...how much?

455
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,520
Enough to live one year.
They are true pearls.

456
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,520
You swear to give me the key?

457
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,880
I swear it.

458
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,400
Will nobody find out?

459
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,840
I won't say anything to anyone.

460
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,000
Here, it's all I can do.

461
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,440
Thanks, that was kind of you.

462
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,080
Hello.

463
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,040
What do you want?

464
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,200
his monkey does turns for 5 öre.

465
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,480
5 öre, a lot of money, far too much.

466
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,800
Please, mama!

467
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,200
I'll give it to you.

468
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,400
You say thank you?

469
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
And now, off you go!

470
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,920
Tired?

471
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,080
This meal... and cognac...

472
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,120
Say, Agda...

473
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,800
I cannot too what say...

474
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,520
It is hard to express...

475
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,400
Then, don't say anything!

476
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,720
Don't get annoyed...

477
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,520
I'm not sure!

478
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,000
If, I promise you.

479
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,120
I want to stay with you!

480
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,160
I'm too old for the circus.

481
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,840
I want to share this peaceful life,

482
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,160
to see my boys grow up.

483
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,720
I'll help you with the shops.

484
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,680
I can be pleasant when it's needed.

485
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,280
You will not regret it.

486
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,200
I will not be left any more!

487
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,480
Do not play the beggar!

488
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,200
I am a beggar!

489
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,880
Oh, it's not because of your money!

490
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,040
I'll sell the tent, the costumes

491
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,560
and the horses which are with me.

492
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,960
The money will go to your business.

493
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,520
You talk too much.

494
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,560
You, you don't say a thing.

495
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,680
What can I say to you?

496
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,560
To remain.

497
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,560
Not, you will not remain here.

498
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,240
- There is someone else?
- So what does that matter?

499
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,800
I won't always live alone.

500
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,560
But nobody will force a life on me

501
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,360
and my peace.

502
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,000
Nobody, you hear me? Nobody.

503
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,880
- Where were you?
- Why do ask?

504
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,960
Does the question bother you?

505
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,960
You have funny voice.

506
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,080
I was out for a walk.

507
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,520
- Alone?
- And what else?

508
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,640
Nothing.

509
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,240
And you?

510
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,040
You know perfectly well.

511
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,960
I am unaware of the details.

512
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,040
Let's talk about you.

513
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,400
- You've nothing to hide?
- Less than you!

514
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,800
What do you want to say?

515
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,560
The shop windows, are forbidden?

516
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,040
The goldsmith's shop.

517
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,160
You spied on me?

518
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,880
No, but I saw you leaving the theatre

519
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,960
and to enter opposite.

520
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,480
So?

521
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,280
Why the theatre?

522
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,080
To see the rehearsal!
Is that a crime?

523
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,800
Who was there?

524
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,000
I don't know them.

525
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,760
- was Frans there?
- Perhaps well.

526
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,760
- You spoke to him?
- No.

527
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,360
- You are sure?
- Not a word!

528
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,560
Why did you leave very dishevelled?

529
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,680
A fall in the staircase.

530
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,760
You finished, yes?

531
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,080
Did you mislead me?

532
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,960
You are insane! You've no right!

533
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,040
- You're afraid?
- to be beaten, yes.

534
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,280
You have only to tell the truth.

535
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,360
Frans told me two words.

536
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,920
In his room?

537
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,680
- He took you there?
- Not! I swear you!

538
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,640
The truth!

539
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,040
Or I smash your face in!

540
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,200
You force me to make up things!

541
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,840
I want the truth
that I'll see in your eyes!

542
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,760
He gave me a jewel
supposedly valuable.

543
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,200
I showed it across the road.

544
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,800
- Showed!
- It was worthless.

545
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,120
- And for that, he had you!
- No.

546
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,000
You lie badly.

547
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,640
Don't shout. Nobody'll help you.

548
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,240
I didn't betray you!

549
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,840
I could kill you,
but that doesn't tell me anything.

550
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,240
If you want to lie, lie!

551
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,240
I lay with Frans!

552
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,920
He forced me.

553
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,400
He locked me in with a key.

554
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,800
I was afraid of being late.

555
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,120
He promised the key to me if I yielded.

556
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,200
I was too afraid of him to say no.

557
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,200
Say something!

558
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,000
You still lie!

559
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,280
I heard you speak, this morning.

560
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,160
You want my opinion?

561
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,240
You went to see him

562
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,760
because you're tired of the circus and me...

563
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,280
as I am of the circus and you.

564
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,080
Stop laughing!

565
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,920
We're well stuck in hell here!

566
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,080
This evening will be sensational!

567
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,480
Brass bands of cornets for the horny!

568
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,680
Trombo'es for the jumbos!

569
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,280
Your health, my brother! Skål!

570
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,760
When I really think about it,

571
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,360
I don't really hate anybody.

572
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,280
Not even the cop this morning.

573
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,800
Even not for Anne, who misled me.

574
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,320
We all make mistakes.

575
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,320
You, mistakes everyone,
you, me.

576
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,920
Me, I love people.

577
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,280
I cherish them.
They don't frighten me.

578
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,280
I won't be the idiot
of this poxy circus any more.

579
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,920
I'll be an honest middle-class man

580
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,400
with a bank account

581
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,120
and a faithful wife.

582
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,880
Anne, you'll never be
an faithful wife.

583
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,360
And I'll never marry you

584
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,480
because you misled me...

585
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,440
little wretch!

586
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,400
A little feeling, that made me feel good!

587
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,240
Poor Anne, poor Agda...

588
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,040
the poor little boys!

589
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,560
And you, poor devil,
and your poor wife!

590
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:29,600
It's a pity that people
are obliged to live.

591
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,120
It is a shame!

592
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,560
It is a shame to be Albert.

593
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,280
It is really a shame.

594
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,720
But I will do finally something

595
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,840
that is worthy of a man.

596
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,760
To kill by your own hand?

597
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,480
Do I have to say that?

598
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,680
I got it from Timba, the trainer.

599
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,840
You should shoot the bear.

600
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,080
It doesn't have a long time to go.

601
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,800
Good idea.

602
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,880
Don't forget to kill my wife too.

603
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,880
It would be pure charity.

604
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,800
One must kill all those who suffer.

605
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,800
Five or six, at least.

606
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,680
You, for example.

607
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,560
I have my poor father to look after!

608
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,360
I frightened you?

609
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,760
Not... If...

610
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,520
You are afraid of death?

611
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:00,840
Yes.

612
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,080
Me, I am not afraid.

613
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,080
You commit suicide, then!

614
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,640
It is hot here! Outside!

615
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,000
Open the door!

616
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,760
Look at this life which surrounds us!

617
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,920
I like it, this life!

618
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,560
Why did I need the truth?

619
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,920
To be cuckold without
the knowledge is nothing!

620
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,120
You are the new Othello!

621
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,120
I will strangle her,

622
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,280
I will ask him for forgiveness.

623
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,720
I will aask her to tell all.

624
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,520
All that they did.
I must be insane!

625
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,120
Do you understand me?

626
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,360
No, and I am of the insane!

627
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:01,280
Anne! So weak!
Such a woman! My child!

628
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,640
Why mislead me, the bitch!

629
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,400
I'll do the same!

630
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,000
You finished vomitting?

631
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,480
You, you are like an ice floe.

632
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,520
Get up!

633
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,080
Prepare the show!

634
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,760
One starts in one hour!

635
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,400
You, you little runt, I'll  kick out you...

636
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,480
if I don't commit suicide first!

637
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,680
Try to be funny!

638
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,960
Only, be decent!
It's a town.OK!

639
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,600
I think I'll leave them.

640
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,920
Happy birthday!

641
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,520
This act's gone on long enough!

642
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,880
Here, to close this evening,

643
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,240
A passionate Seniorita
on an Andalusian thorough-bred.

644
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,560
An unforgettable spectacle!

645
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,160
Always fresh and in top form!

646
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,400
Is someone back in saddle?

647
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,480
The plan is straightforward!

648
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,720
Reciprocal insults!

649
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,600
We will be judge and jury.

650
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,120
The director will crack his whip.

651
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,560
Snuffboxes and knives prohibited!

652
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,840
Go!

653
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,720
Kill him, Albert!

654
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,200
I'll get him!

655
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,440
Where is he?

656
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,480
I'll get him!

657
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,960
The spectacle is finished.

658
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,400
Thank you for coming.

659
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,160
Open up!

660
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,600
Let me in!

661
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,520
Are you dead?

662
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,520
No!

663
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,240
You won't open?

664
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,960
Go to hell!

665
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,400
No, Albert! No!

666
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,160
Do we start dismantling?

667
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,880
Whatever you like.

668
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,200
Good gate!

669
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,240
Divide it between you.

670
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,080
Put a shoe on  Prince
before you leave.

671
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,040
- We're leaving?
- Obviously!

672
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:18,240
This afternoon, I had a dream.

673
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,600
I saw Alma, who said to me:

674
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,800
"You poor thing, you look tired and sad.

675
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,600
Don't you want to rest?"

676
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,600
I said yes.

677
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:36,400
"You'll be small like a foetus,
she said.

678
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:42,600
You'll sleep a long time
in my belly."

679
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,520
I lay down in her belly

680
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,760
and there, I slept
like in a cradle.

681
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,320
I got smaller and smaller...

682
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,920
as small as a seed,
and then I disappeared.

683
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,360
Hurry up! Come to bed!

684
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:12,080
She can't fall asleep without me.

685
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,120
Good night.
