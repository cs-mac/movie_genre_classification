I am the researcher, A.I., Ai Li Si.

We haven't talked in a long time. Why would we go?

49

Ever since the camping trip, did you really not talk to her?

Pretty much.

I thought you guys made up. Why didn't you go?

52

You didn't go either.

53

Ai Li Si, this is the U.S.Capital's

79
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,050
Risk Management Advisor, Mr. He Hao Yi.

80
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,400
Mr. He, so your company believes our collaboration

81
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,920
has some risks, and therefore especially sent you to manage?

82
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,780
Every three months, you send some pictures of the experiment,

83
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,830
and ask for $200,000 USD in experiment funds.

84
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,570
The experiment completion time has not been set. There is only the signature of A.I. on the papers.

85
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,370
For such an investment, it took Capital a year before they sent me to understand the situation.

86
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm actually quite surprised.

87
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,870
If the company has concerns,

88
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,890
then please ask any questions you may have.

89
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,350
We will answer fully.

90
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,050
Very good.

91
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,310
My first question is,

92
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,010
where is Ms. Ai residing?

93
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,410
What does this have to do with the experiment?

94
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,740
It's because I once had someone blamelessly disappear.

95
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,620
I definitely won't let that happen again.

96
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,130
Therefore, tell me now where you are residing,

97
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,950
your cell phone number,

98
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,670
your email, Live, Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, and PTT screen names.

99
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,960

Boss, what plan number is this? Did we plan to ask all this?

106

You can continue with the CEO.

Hello, I am Capital's Risk Management Advisor. My name is He Hao Yi.

that I would meet you here.

127

You know me because you're in the same company as Ai Li Si, right?

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,770
I am JSUT's business manager. My name is Peter, Ai Li Si's closest colleague.

Are you upset?

143
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,490
Alright, I won't casually call you that next time.

144
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,540
I'm not upset. It's because you grabbed my hand,

145
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,480
so it's a little sore.

146
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,150
Did you receive the breakfast this morning?

147
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,960
Since you were out of the country this month, I received it everyday.

Thank you. You don't have to anymore.

149
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,820
Then is your stomach pain gone?

150
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,550
I told you, I have a way to treat your stomach pain.

151

you're not allowed to say thank you.

155

Are you alright?

157
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,900
Didn't I say my stomach pain was gone?

158
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,000
That's not it. You haven't seen He Hao Yi in so long.

159
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,210
Is here alright?

160
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,400
He's Capital's Risk Management Advisor. What can happen?

161
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,370
Before, all your feelings show on your face.

162
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,520
Now, you have a poker face. I can't tell anything.

163
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,930
I hope you're really fine.

164
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,670
Wait for me!

165
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,380
You're back?

166
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm back.

167
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,400
What are you up to?

168
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,210
Taking pictures for spring make-up. Come over.

169
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,730
Come look. Come and look!

170
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,760
Look.

171
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
Before make-up. After make-up.

172
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,050
Before make-up. After make-up.

173
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,830
It's great, right?

174
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,460
Such a dedicated blog like mine

175
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,270
is really rare and tiring, you know?

176
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,750
Take your time.

177
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,830
Hey, it's hard on my own. Help me.

178
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,670
Hurry up!

179
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,520
Before and after make-up, okay?

180
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,580
Slow down.

181
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,900
Before make-up.

182
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,450
After make-up.

183
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,330
I pressed video recording.

184
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,150
What are you doing? Cut!

185
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,690
Why are you taking selfies?

186
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,410
What are you thinking? Work didn't go well today?

187
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,460
- Sis.<br> - What?

188
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,500
Do you remember Ai Li Si?

189
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,720
Your college classmate?

190
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,450
Lei Lei's friend?

191
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,870
Your ex-girlfriend? Oh no, that was Amanda.

192
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,710
You're so annoying. You can't even take some photos.

193
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,550
<i> Ai Li Si,</i>

194
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,680
<i>do you remember me?</i>

195
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,460
<i>I remember, but this has no significance to me. </i>

196
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,680
<i>If you have any questions, please go through the CEO.</i>

197
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,420
<i>It turns out,</i>

198
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,580
<i>this is what the reaction should be after hearing a high school classmate's name after thirteen years.</i>

199
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,520
<i>Ai Li Si saw me today just like how Sis heard her name.</i>

200
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,770
<i>Stranger. No meaning.</i>

201
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,690
<i>It turns out I'm the only one who still cares. </i>

202
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,530
Ah Di, what's wrong with you?

203
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,550
Nothing. I haven't gotten over the jet lag.

204
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm going to rest.

205
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,820
You should stop scaring people.

206
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,320
Please! I'm pretty, okay?

207
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,260
Scaring people? I'll scare you.

208
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,890
You said Ah Di came back?

209
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,500
<i>Yeah. </i>

210
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,100
I haven't seen him in so long.

211
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,600
After I get settled in my new job, I'll take him out.

212
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,010
<i>It's her?</i>

213
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,910
<i>He's not bad.</i>

214
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,850
<i>Stop being noisy! </i>

215
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,960
<i>I'm Peter.</i>

216
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,060
<i>- Go away. <br>- I'm returning this.</i>

217
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,850
<i>I'm not interested in you.</i>

218
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,480
<i>Looks like she didn't recognize me.</i>

219
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,930
<i>Could it be that he doesn't like girls?</i>

220
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,940
<i>I'm not the landlubber from back then, Song Han Ming. </i>

221
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,230
Hang on.

222
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,550
Can you go up?

223
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,750
Hold on tight.

224
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,960
Does it still hurt?

225
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,270
How come you know how to treat cramps?

226
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,700
I'm familiar with the sport of swimming.

227
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,480
I think you are too, right?

228
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,560
I was on the swim team in high school.

229
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,290
However, in college, during a competition I hurt my left leg ligament.

230
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,690
From then on, I can't swim fast anymore.

231
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,250
So, everytime I see someone swim fast, I get envious.

232
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,790
Earlier, I wanted to catch up to you, but ended up like this.

233
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,860
What's your name?

234
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,050
Peter. My name is Peter.

235
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,370
My name is Bai Shu Lei. Hello.

236
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,350
So, do you regularly come here to exercise?

237
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,670
Yes. It's on the way home from work.

238
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,890
Oh, such a coincidence. My new company happens to be nearby.

239
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,400
What company?

240
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,940
Jsut Biotec. Have you heard of it?

241
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,420
I heard about it. That is a good company.

242
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,790
Then, I think we will bump into one another very often.

243
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,730
♫ I really want to love you. To persist until the end, ♫

244
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,960
♫ tell me how much courage it requires. My only love. My only love. ♫

245
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,380
That's right! Ms. Bai, have a good night.

246
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,020
Good night.

247
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,340
This guy didn't say he'll give me a ride home.

248
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,840
Does he actually like men or just playing cat and mouse with me?

249
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,280
It's okay, I will let you go this time.

250
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,990
I want to see next time, what trick you have up your sleeve.

251
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,530
(Jsut International Co. LTD)

252
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,670
Is there something?

253
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,970
What kind of relationship do you have with Mr. He?

254
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,040
He is a high school classmate that I haven't seen in 13 years.

255
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,550
Is that it?

256
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,620
Are you worried about my personal involvement with him?

257
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,150
Yes, I am worried you would care about your past friendship

258
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,450
and let it influence your decision.

259
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,240
You think of him as too important.

260
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,220
Capital arranged Mr. He to come.

261
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,940
It means that they are impatient and want to see some achievements.

262
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,290
I'm worried that at any time they will withdraw their support, so I need to find another way.

263
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,850
And, in fact, I need that complete copy of experiment results

264
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,450
in order to search for funding.

265
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,640
If you want to finish this earlier,

266
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,100
then don't have unrelated things bother me.

267
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,270
CEO, from tomorrow, He Hao Yi will represent the collaboration company

268
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,150
to oversee the ongoing process of the experiment in JSUT.

269
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,880
- Just follow the original plan. Don't let him suspect. <br>- Yes.

270
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:07,930
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you<br>by the Forever17 Team@ Viki</i>

271
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,450
Advisor He, I will first guide you around every JSUT department.

272
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,870
I can tour around by myself. Have you arranged a cubicle for me in R&D?

273
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,880
Is there a problem?

274
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,000
I will take care of this immediately.

275
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,230
<i>- Sweet deserts.<br>- There are pineapple cakes.</i>

276
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,370
<i>- I have it, too.<br>- I'll go buy what you want to eat.</i>

277
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,550
<i>Everyone just take some.</i>

278
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,040
<i>Look, you guys all became so skinny.</i>

279
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,060
What a pity.

280
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,020
Please excuse me.

281
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,250
Advisor He, you came to supervise us so early.

282
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,970
Doing things at the right time could have double effectiveness,

283
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,410
and change crisis into turning points.

284
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,560
You are right.

285
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,610
Is it because Advisor He once missed a certain time in your life,

286
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,660
that lets you have such a deep realization?

287
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,620
If you really want to know my past,

288
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,570
I am always at the research and development department. You are welcome to come and find me anytime.

289
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,170
Jun Xiong, how to get to the marketing department?

290
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,040
Over here, Boss.

291
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,060
He's so quick.

292
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,020
Manager Bai, hello.

293
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,240
Are you are my special assistant, Ya Li?

294
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,850
Yes.

295
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,730
That's right.

296
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,860
If you can change your flats to high heels,

297
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,120
and hot chick short skirt to business skirt,

298
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,050
I think that you will look more professional.

299
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,610
My assistant is a representation of myself.

300
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,120
Yes.

301
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,720
Right now, I will go around to understand each department.

302
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,250
On the first day of work, I immediately want to be in the best mindset.

303
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,050
Let's go.

304
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,380
Hello, I am the research and development manager, Zhao Gu Yi.

305
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,380
During this period, Manager Zhao, sorry for disturbing.

306
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,770
No problem.

307
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,230
Juan Mao, help him arrange a seat.

308
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,600
- There's an empty seat next to me. <br> - Where does Ai Li Si sit?

309
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,440
Right there.

310
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,020
Okay.

311
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,590
Then, I'll sit here.

312
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,800
- Good morning everyone. <br>- Peter, good morning.

313
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,640
Good morning.

314
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,290
Oh, it turns out that James Bond in JSUT

315
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,310
is the mystery person who gave Ai Li Si's 3-month supply of breakfast.

316
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,100
This.. This.. What happened?

317
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,980
I thought that only high schoolers sent breakfast.

318
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,100
To care about someone, one should be simple and straightforward to be effective.

319
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:43,450
Someone like you, a high school classmate whom she hasn't seen for a while

320
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,760
probably doesn't know the meaning of accompanying someone.

321
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,830
Ah, that's right. Where's Team Lead Ai?

322
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,280
She is most likely busy working in the lab.

323
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,180
Okay. Goodbye.

324
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,770
Manager Bai, this is our R&D lab.

325
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,800
All our products are researched and developed here.

326
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,860
Hi.

327
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,810
Looking at your outfit I can tell you are probably a researcher.

328
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,620
Then, is it okay if you give me a tour around the lab?

329
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,630
Bai Shu Lei?

330
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,330
Who are you?

331
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,170
Oh, I am the new marketing manager, Bai Shu Lei.

332
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,350
People from other departments who want to come into the research room need to register first.

333
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,580
Have you registered?

334
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,750
Today is my first day at work, so I haven't registered.

335
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,740
Then, you can't come in.

336
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,920
Miss, I just told you I am the new marketing manager.

337
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,560
Even if you are the chairman of the board, you still need to register.

338
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,150
Then, would you be responsible for the secrets that get leaked into the public?

339
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,560
Or do you think that you can use your position to force others?

340
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,800
I'm sorry that doesn't work here.

341
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,430
Miss, I am trying to talk to you nicely. Do you have to speak in this way?

342
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,640
Who do you think you are?

343
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,000
Are you okay, Bai Shu Lei?

344
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,440
How come it's you?

345
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,690
This is what I was going to ask you. Get up first.

346
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,640
Now, let's go back to your question you just asked.

347
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,030
I am the team leader of R&D, Ai Li Si.

348
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,730
♫<i> I really want to love you. To persist until the end, </i>♫

349
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:20,030
♫<i> tell me how much courage it requires. </i>♫

350
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,280
- Ah!<br>- Are you alright, Bai Shu Lei?

351
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,720
How come it's you?

352
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,780
This is the same question I want to ask you.

353
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,930
Now, let's go back to your question you just asked.

354
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,180
I'm the team leader in R&D, Ai Li Si.

355
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,620
<i>Lei Lei!</i>

356
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,680
Manager Bai, are you alright?

357
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,390
Hi!

358
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,900
Peter.

359
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,510
Welcome to you both.

360
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,270
It seems like we all know each other.

361
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,020
You come here.

362
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,780
He Hao Yi, you already knew that Ai Li Si worked in our company. Didn't you?

363
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,290
I only knew that a day before you knew.

364
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,020
You didn't see what kind of attitude she had just now?

365
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,960
Did she already know that I was going to work here so that's why she is giving me trouble in public?

366
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,780
Moreover, it's in front of Peter.

367
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,430
It destroys my carefully planned debut completely.

368
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,650
I think she didn't do it against you.

369
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,240
How would you know?

370
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,740
She treats everyone with the same attitude.

371
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:51,350
Yesterday, I was going to chat with her to understand how she became like this.

372
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,340
At the end, Peter took her away.

373
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,370
Thus, she and Peter are close.

374
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,810
At least, I didn't see her giving Peter a dig.

375
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,930
Fine, I didn't give thorough thought to today's event.

376
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,780
I just want to make sure she's not against me and that will be okay.

377
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,420
From now on, I'll just treat her

378
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,850
as a stranger working in the same company.

379
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,480
Can we really treat Ai Li Si as a stranger?

380
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,230
Of course.

381
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,620
We were only classmates for two years.

382
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,350
If she hadn't said her name was Ai Li Si, I would have completely forgotten her a long time ago.

383
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,930
Ah Di,

384
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,850
I know you really mind that you didn't meet her at that time.

385
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,920
However, since she is so cold to you, why are you still warm to a cold shoulder?

386
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,540
Let bygones be bygones.

387
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,800
We both don't have a time machine. We can only look forward.

388
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,200
Understand?

389
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,460
I'll see.

390
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,570
You didn't hear what I said.

391
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,570
Ai Li Si! Ai Li Si!

392
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,650
Were you also surprised just now?

393
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,020
We never thought that we would bump into both of them here.

394
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,280
Now... Now should we have a

395
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,520
high school reunion in the company?

396
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,210
But I have to say what you just did was awesome.

397
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,530
What did I do?

398
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,560
Teach the Queen a lesson.

399
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,710
I was just teaching a newbie who didn't know about the regulations in R&D a lesson.

400
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,830
Who she is has no meaning to me.

401
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,060
So, should I really not have to worry about that incident?

402
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,600
Although I had promised you to forget the past and

403
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,540
had guaranteed not to mention it to anyone,

404
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,910
now with He Hao Yi and Bai Shu Lei appearing, I'm afraid that you...

405
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,850
How can a long forgotten incident affect me?

406
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,850
Why... Why am I here?

407
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,020
Are you going to the lab?

408
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,090
Then, okay. Let both of us go forward together.

409
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,010
Never look back. Okay?

410
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,960
Manager Zhao, I have something to discuss with you.

411
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,070
It happens that I also want to ask you something.

412
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,500
<i>Did you already know Ai Li Si and Manager Bai before?</i>

413
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,410
<i>We were high school classmates. Only I don't know</i>

414
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,150
<i>why Ai Li Si became this way now.</i>

415
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,100
<i>Although everyone feels Ai Li Si is hard to get along with,</i>

416
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,250
<i>and doesn't see her having friends,</i>

417
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,160
<i>but I feel she is a good girl.</i>

418
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,020
<i>Especially, she works very hard.</i>

419
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,930
<i>She doesn't even take a break for lunch. Isn't it too much?</i>

420
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,770
You didn't have lunch. You must be hungry; I'll take you out for tea this afternoon.

421
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,380
No.

422
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,810
<i>But she takes a break at 3:15 pm everyday.</i>

423
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:19,150
<i>The time for making tea also has to be accurate so it's more flavorful.</i>

424
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,260
Do you drink tea at this particular time everday? May I have a cup?

425
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,750
- No.<br>- Hey.

426
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,170
<i>Then what time does she usually take off?</i>

427
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,670
<i>She often works overtime and sleeps in the office,</i>

428
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,560
<i>but you're lucky today.</i>

429
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,580
<i>She will take off on time once per month.</i>

430
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,780
<i>Today is the day.</i>

431
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,410
Would you like to have dinner together?

432
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,990
No.

433
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520

It's very good.

473
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,960
I want one, too.

474
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,360
Then why didn't you buy one earlier?

475
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,380
I forgot. Let me eat one.

476
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,900
Before we eat pudding, we should eat dinner.

477
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,550
I remember near here...

478
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,080
Ah! There's a good restaurant. Let's go.

479
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,250
Cheers.

480
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,540
He Hao Yi!

481
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,370
Ah Di!

482
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,610
It's been so long since I saw you.

483
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,030
How come you haven't changed at all?

484
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,350
People say that you speak the truth when you're drunk.

485
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,920
I finally see the Ai Li Si I remember.

486
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,680
How are you? Have you been well all these years?

487
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,660
Not good.

488
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,970
Not good at all.

489
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,430
Is that why you've become so cold?

490
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,420
Ah, okay. It's okay.

491
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,130
It's all in the past. I'm here.

492
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,500
Whatever was hard, tell me all.

493
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:04,400
So, so, so, so, so many hardships.

494
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,450
I'll pour for you.

495
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,600
Cheers!

496
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,310
Isn't it already enough?

497
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:01,380
Not yet. You're not drunk yet.

498
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,110
Your words haven't cleared it up yet.

499
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,280
Not okay.

500
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,100
I won't get drunk by drinking unless it's mixed liquor.

501
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,050
Let me tell you. Let me tell you.

502
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:28,600
Thirteen years ago, on the day that you texted me,

503
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:35,030
I really did go.

504
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,960
But I was late.

505
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,110
It was too late.

506
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,260
When I went, you weren't there anymore.

507
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,360
Later I called you,

508
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,340
but it didn't connect.

509
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,500
Didn't connect...

510
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,070
So what was our friendship?

511
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:07,200
After summer, I was going to see you at school like nothing was wrong,

512
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,860
but...

513
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,460
you transferred schools. I went to your house to look for you.

514
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,760
I really went to your house to look for you.

515
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,890
Ai Li Si,

516
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,640
if I apologize to you now,

517
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,000
would it be too late?

518
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,410
<i>Sorry, there is no electricity. We will fix it right away.</i>

519
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,700
Do you remember that in the comic bookstore,

520
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,020
there was also no electricity.

521
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,110
Oh, how did it happen again?

Don't go.

525
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,660
I didn't plan to leave.

526
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:32,200
I only want to use my cellphone as a flashlight.

527

You're not allowed to go.

528
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:40,210
I won't allow you to disappear again.

529

I almost forgot.

539
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,130
Your pudding.

540
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,830
To be honest, I wanted to make you drunk.

541
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,320
I didn't guess wrong. You had a motive.

542
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,460
But all that I've said so far was the truth.

543
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,340
Why?

544
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,460
Why did you want to get me drunk?

545
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,310
I was thinking that...

546
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:34,330
if I got you drunk, then you wouldn't avoid me,

547
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,790
then you would tell me

548
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,770
some real feelings.

549
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,330
What do you want to know?

550
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,740
Where did you go after you transferred?

551
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,130
What did you want to say on that day you made an appointment with us?

552
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,080
And you. What caused you to

553
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,770
become so... cool?

554
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,920
That's it?

555
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:29,020
A man and a woman. Eat, drink beer, talk.

556
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,210
Most people would consider this to be a date.

The expiration for an apology,

isn't as long as 13 years like what you thought.

Your apology to me now isn't necessary.

If you want to use our history as high school classmates to get close to me,

570
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,290
to spend one night with me,

I think it's not my illusion.

620

Since I met you, you always have it in for me.

621
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,900
Yes, I have it in for you.

622
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I have asked Manager Zhao.

623
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You've just started to work at the company for three months.

624
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,600
I think if you have it in for me because of AI Li Si,

625
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,800
first, you don't quite understand the situation.

626
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,280
Second, I think you don't have the right to get involved with my relationship to Ai Li Si.

627
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,000
I know you give much effort.

628
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,400
Not only you have asked Manager Zhao Ai Li Si's condition after she joins the company,

629
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,000
but also you followed her a whole day yesterday. Didn't you?

630
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:30,000
However, you still don't know anything.

631
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,400
If you want to know more about Ai Li Si, I know the answer.

632
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,000
This kind of bluffing and blasting negotiation doesn't work on me.

633
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,700
Then I'll clearly tell you,

634
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,500
I know why Ai Li Si transferred schools 13 years ago.

635
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,100
How would you know?

636
01:02:55,970 --> 01:03:00,720
The reason ist very simple, but I won't tell you.

637
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,800
You know, there's something I really don't get.

638
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,700
Why does Ai Li Si treat you especially different?

639
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,100
Did you do something to Ai Li Si so she has to get along with you?

640
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,400
I can understand your feelings.

641
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,700
You have to give yourself a reason to make me the dark side

642
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,970
so you can accept the reason Ai Li Si is close to me is out of unwillingness. Right?

643
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:35,400
But He Hao Yi, saying it that way is way off.

644
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,800
The reason Ai Li Si accepts me

645
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:42,200
is because we are alike and friends.

646
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,100
That's because I have never given up on Ai Li Si,

647
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,900
and you still live in the past. There is no place for you here.

648
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,400
Now it's not that if you want to return, then you can return. I won't allow.

649
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,700
Ai Li Si won't accept you, either.

650
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:59,580
You don't have the right to make decisions for her.

651
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:04,260
I didn't make decisions for her. Neither did I prohibit her.

652
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,200
JSUT not only has cleansing masks,

653
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,100
but also have series for blackhead termination.

654
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:28,300
Right now, there's a big fight over cleansing masks. We will not only promote new products,

655
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,900
in addition to our new test,

656
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,400
with everyone's cooperation here,

657
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,000
I believe it will reach a win-win situation.

658
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,800
Manager Bai. please continue. I apologize.

659
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,200
We'll also present maintenance series this season,

660
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,400
the promotion of any combination of masks with buy 1 get 1 free.

661
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,600
It's mainly for...

662
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
Sorry.

663
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,000
Hello?

664
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,200
Okay, okay. I got it. I'll look into it.

665
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,000
It's nothing, it's nothing. Please, continue the meeting.

666
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,800
It's mainly for having all our delicate products..

667
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,000
with one plus one greater than two effectiveness..

668
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,600
Manager Bai.

669
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,000
Didn't I tell you that I'd look into it?

670
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,400
I also have something I need to say.

671
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,300
Please tell me after I finish talking to our distributors.

672
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,500
You should not continue this meeting.

673
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,600
I think you don't have the right to tell me what to do.

674
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,400
Fine. I'll just say it then.

675
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,200
There's a problem in the proposal.

676
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,400
The company's product packaging and ingredients,

677
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,000
in your presentation it didn't say that it can be used.

678
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,770
This is a big mistake.

679
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:11,200
Everyone, this product contains things that aren't good and has melanin.

680
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,200
It stimulates with other regular products.

681
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,400
Yin Mei's skin would be irritated and fragile.

682
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,600
It is not supposed to be allowed and the ingredients too.

683
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,500
Your mistake made the product worse. People would have a cognitive thinking of the product.

684
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,480
Before your presentation,

685
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,860
did you actually carefully look over our research lab's instruction manual and ingredients?

686
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,200
Thank you R&D's Team Leader Ai for reminding me,

687
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,800
I should look over the instruction manual more carefully.

688
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,200
But, when the product actually goes out for sale,

689
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,600
I will carefully look over the instruction manual.

690
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,200
- So... <br>- Everyone, let me explain.

691
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,800
Our company has a very hardworking R&D team to help our products become better.

692
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:05,800
So, I believe that our product will have a special touch to it.

693
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,400
Also, using our company's research

694
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,600
professional tone will help promote our slogan.

695
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,000
How does that sound to everyone?

696
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

697
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,600
Then, please come this way.

698
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,000
Come. Come. Come. Sorry, sorry.

699
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,690
Ai Li Si...

700
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,680
Ai Li Si...

701
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,500
What's the matter?

702
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:02,890
Advisor He, you don't have to follow Ai Li Si's every step, do you?

703
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,950
If you haven't used your work as an excuse, it would seem like you're a stalker.

704
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,300
Team Leader Ai, Capital has some questions about your research. Do you have time tonight?

705
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:39,900
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you<br>by the Forever17 Team@ Viki</i>

706
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,300
I shouldn't have believed you 13 years ago.

707
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,400
Are you the Ai Li Si I've known?

708
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:05,400
In the past I wasn't capable to protect you, but I won't let you suffer now.

709
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,200
You like Ai Li Si, don't you?

710
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,100
Right, I like Ai Li Si.

711
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,530
Tumor?

712
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,800
The rate of a successful surgery is about 50%.

713
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,500
Because I want to know the feeling before I die.

714
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,690
