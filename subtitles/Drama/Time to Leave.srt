1
00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:02,242
Griffin?

2
00:00:02,248 --> 00:00:04,201
You believe she plans to sell the serum.

3
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:06,272
- Absolutely.
- Vanessa, we cannot let her do that.

4
00:00:06,316 --> 00:00:08,405
Promise me you will get my
journal off this island.

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,058
You're the one who gives it to Brooke.

6
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:11,945
I am begging you, please, don't do this.

7
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:13,741
- I helped you.
- Yes, you did.

8
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,239
But he left me to die.

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,701
H.G.! H.G.!

10
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,690
- Is that true?
- He lied to your face.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,219
- How can you ever trust him again?
- All this craziness,

12
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,158
it's too much. It's time
for me to go home.

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,332
Goodbye, H.G.

14
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,455
Adam? Who's at the door?

15
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:56,114
Griffin?

16
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:57,764
What did you do to me?

17
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,940
You're going through withdrawal.

18
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,725
Make it stop.

19
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:06,773
Take him down to the lab.

20
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:11,460
Achilles' heel returns.

21
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,027
- He's my brother.
- He tried to kill you...

22
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:17,684
And vice versa. I can't keep score.

23
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,523
Can you make it stop?

24
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:36,355
I can give you a maintenance dose
that'll help reduce the symptoms.

25
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:39,533
The question is, why should I?

26
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:43,667
Because we're family.

27
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,952
Damn it, Griffin.

28
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:53,049
You need to rest. We'll see
how you feel in a few hours.

29
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:54,964
Okay.

30
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:12,101
Are you going to help him?

31
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:15,985
Maybe. I want to monitor
his symptoms first.

32
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,944
It's Griffin.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,888
I'm in.

34
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,542
Did she suspect anything?

35
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:29,762
She doesn't trust me,
but she didn't turn me away.

36
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,026
How are you feeling?

37
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,993
Mmph. I've been better.

38
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,184
Didn't have to exaggerate much.

39
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:37,914
- Hang in there.
- You have to

40
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,550
find the serum...
All of it... and destroy it.

41
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,266
It's too dangerous.

42
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,094
I understand.

43
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,661
I have to go now.

44
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,853
I'll call when I can.

45
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,831
If you help him, he'll
only betray you again.

46
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,497
What do you suggest I do?

47
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,318
He is my brother, and he's in pain.

48
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:01,624
Kill him.

49
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:03,274
That'll stop the pain.

50
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,190
I'll even do it for you.

51
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,543
Watch him. If he gets any
worse, you let me know.

52
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,779
And if he tries anything,

53
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,264
then kill him.

54
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:36,269

- www.addic7ed.com -

55
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:42,870
So, we're moving the
moon rocks to Gallery 3

56
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:45,204
- to make room for the space shuttle.
- Okay.

57
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,277
It's good to see you. It's been forever.

58
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,801
It's been two weeks.

59
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:50,883
A phone call would've
been nice... A text...

60
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,148
Anything. You practically disappeared.

61
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:55,912
I'm sorry, Leon. I must've
gotten carried away.

62
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:57,836
Into the glamorous world
of Vanessa Anders,

63
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:00,621
- or with your actor boyfriend?
- A little of both.

64
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:02,388
I knew it was that guy.

65
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,840
- It's always a guy.
- Well, that's over now.

66
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:06,830
Things got a little too intense,

67
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:08,658
but let's not talk about that.

68
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:12,009
I've been a really bad friend,
and I'm really sorry.

69
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,336
- Will you forgive me?
- We've all been there.

70
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:15,726
I'm just glad you're back.

71
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,293
Me too.

72
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,599
I forgot how exciting moon rocks can be.

73
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,297
Right?

74
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,607
I'll be right back.

75
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,883
Okay, Carl, what are you doing here?

76
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,994
I was instructed to keep an eye on you.

77
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:44,826
How are you feeling?

78
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:46,918
Like my skin is on fire.

79
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:48,878
This injection should
help stabilize you.

80
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,924
- What is it?
- The serum...

81
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,307
Just a small dose.

82
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:54,357
Just enough to help you
with withdrawal symptoms.

83
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,451
Mmph.

84
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,714
Has that Richard Knox fellow arrived?

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,177
Richard Knox?

86
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:04,359
Richard Knox, the venture capitalist?

87
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:06,547
- What are you doing with him?
- Don't worry about it.

88
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,210
Oh, didn't she tell you?

89
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:11,823
Your sister has big
plans for my magic DNA.

90
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,639
She's going to sell me
to the highest bidder.

91
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:16,866
Is that true? You're selling the serum?

92
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:19,134
We don't have Vanessa Anders' money.

93
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:22,332
Don't we deserve to salvage
something from all this?

94
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,151
Yes, Griffin, if I'm going
to be stuck in this time,

95
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,057
I'm going to do it as a rich man.

96
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:30,118
- What do you care about money?
- Enough. You need to rest.

97
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:32,122
You should feel better in a few hours.

98
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,863
I'll tell you all about it then.

99
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,654
May I help you?

100
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,106
H.G., what are you doing here?

101
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,724
I know that you called
Vanessa about Carl.

102
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:08,073
Don't blame her. It was my idea.

103
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,904
I needed to know that you were safe.

104
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:12,964
- John is still out there.
- I can handle myself just fine.

105
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:15,197
Selfishly, it was for
my own peace of mind.

106
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,808
And you had to come here
and tell me this in person?

107
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:20,246
Another selfish move on my behalf.

108
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:23,336
How are you?

109
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:27,920
Jane, I hate how we left things.

110
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:29,748
It's time for my break.

111
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,707
Why don't we go outside?

112
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:37,564
As you can see, the patient
has become septic.

113
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,609
He has a high fever, some swelling,

114
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:41,338
and even some mental deterioration.

115
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,496
He volunteered for this?

116
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,556
He let himself contract a fatal disease?

117
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,222
- Who does this?
- A brave individual

118
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:51,015
helping push the boundaries
of science, Mr. Knox.

119
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,228
And well-paid, I trust.

120
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,366
And just like that,

121
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,524
I've eradicated a disease
once considered deadly.

122
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:10,530
For the fourth time, I might add.

123
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,081
Remarkable.

124
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,913
How are you manipulating the DNA?

125
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:18,730
It's an offshoot of my father's work

126
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,429
combined with my own research.

127
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:22,429
This is my father's journal.

128
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:24,823
He left me his findings.

129
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:29,348
Your father's work with
the DOD back in the '80s.

130
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,090
It was

131
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,654
shut down before it was realized.

132
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,268
Now Brooke and I have
been continuing it.

133
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:40,270
No side effects of note?

134
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,156
Perhaps two worth mentioning.

135
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:48,168
Number one, the serum enhances
the subject's strength

136
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:51,202
approximately 600%. And two,

137
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,656
it's highly addictive.

138
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:56,735
You've created a Superman.

139
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:59,085
We prefer to call them "super soldiers."

140
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,957
You think there's a military
application for the drug?

141
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,916
During wartime, you're
gonna want these guys

142
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,233
on the front lines. Each has
the strength of six men,

143
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,939
significantly reducing the number
of soldiers needed on the ground.

144
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:13,202
They're resistant to disease
and chemical weapons, and...

145
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,423
They're easy to control.

146
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,340
All we need is the
funding to perfect it.

147
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,342
Who else knows about this?

148
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,034
Just you,

149
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,719
as of right now.

150
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,852
And you didn't want to take this

151
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,854
to the Department of Defense?

152
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:35,946
I've learned from my father's mistakes.

153
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,513
Mm.

154
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:41,005
I take it your test trials
wouldn't survive an ethics board.

155
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,693
Richard, that's why we called on you.

156
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,609
I know that discretion
is where you thrive.

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,091
I want to move on this right
away, before word gets out.

158
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:53,790
I can set up a meeting
tonight of investors.

159
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:56,341
- Are you prepared for that?
- Sure.

160
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,912
Just tell us where and when.

161
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,847
And you name again?

162
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,566
Stevenson...

163
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,961
Dr. Stevenson.

164
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,828
Well, doctors,

165
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:12,684
let me make a few phone calls.

166
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:22,545
I know I shouldn't
have come, but I just...

167
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:24,983
Wanted to know how you're doing.

168
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,421
I'm good.

169
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:32,098
I've really missed you.

170
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:35,623
I missed you, too, but...

171
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,408
What more can we do?

172
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,280
I mean, think about it.
What's gonna happen to us?

173
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:42,568
No matter how you write this story,

174
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:45,146
it always ends with you
returning to 1893,

175
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,871
where you belong. You
have to write your books.

176
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,473
You have to live your life,

177
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,704
and I should just get on with mine.

178
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,059
It's the only ending for us.

179
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,241
It's for the best.

180
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,069
I suppose so.

181
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,725
I should get back to work.

182
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:11,233
Goodbye, H.G.

183
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:24,175
- Ooh. God.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

184
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:25,461
Thank you.

185
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,787
I should've been looking. I'm so...

186
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:30,668
Get him in.

187
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:32,211
No!

188
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,880
They took him!

189
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:37,637
Hurry!

190
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:47,828
Who are you?

191
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:50,141
- What is the meaning of this?
- I'm sure you're

192
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:52,480
really confused right now,
but I'm gonna ask the questions,

193
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,740
- if you don't mind.
- Well, I do mind, actually.

194
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,404
- Where am I?
- Someplace private,

195
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,249
so we can talk without interruptions.

196
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:02,700
- Let's start with your name.
- I have nothing to tell you.

197
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:06,373
Well, my name is Agent Danielle Forbes,

198
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,507
and I work for the United
States Department of Defense.

199
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,629
Now, let's start with, how'd
you get to New York City,

200
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:14,888
how long have you been here,
and what are you doing here?

201
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,167
- None of which is your business.
- Wrong. My job is

202
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:19,519
to protect this country
from dangerous people.

203
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,302
Why do you believe that I'm dangerous?

204
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:25,747
Guys, thanks for helping out with this,

205
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,497
but I think I need to
question him alone.

206
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,403
I'll meet you back at the field office.

207
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,332
They're from the New York division.

208
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:46,951
They're not aware of
why I'm really here.

209
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,070
Which is...?

210
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:52,167
I'm from DC, and while
I do work for the DOD,

211
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,218
I'm an astrophysicist.

212
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:56,791
- While I wish I knew what that was...
- How disappointing.

213
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:59,626
I was hoping I wouldn't have
to explain that to H.G. Wells.

214
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:03,149
Well, that was easy.

215
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:05,238
I don't know what you're talking about.

216
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:07,153
Don't insult me, Mr. Wells.

217
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:09,547
I've put a lot on the line coming here.

218
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:12,158
Let's stop playing games.
What do you say?

219
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,379
- Try to sit up.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,535
I feel a little better. Thank you.

221
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:25,799
It's only temporary.

222
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,982
The serum has proved
extremely addictive.

223
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:31,030
- I'll try to wean you off of it slowly.
- Let's go!

224
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:33,344
Be back in a few hours.

225
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,092
So, how much money do you
think this serum will fetch?

226
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,622
Enough for all of us.

227
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:40,640
Knox is known for his overseas tales.

228
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:44,733
You don't care if the serum
goes to Russia or North Korea?

229
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:46,760
They have deeper pockets.

230
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,327
True. This could be huge.

231
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,797
John, congratulations,

232
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,278
you really are adapting
well to modern times.

233
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:57,214
We need to get going. Please
see my brother back to his room.

234
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,613
You mean my cell?

235
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,180
- You don't have to lock me up, Brooke.
- Yes, she does.

236
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,408
So, you refuse to admit it.

237
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:11,504
Why would I admit to
something so preposterous?

238
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,208
As an astrophysicist with the DOD,

239
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:16,956
it is my job to track
unexplained anomalies.

240
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,008
Recently, my department picked up

241
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,141
on a large energy source in New York.

242
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:23,584
It had a geographical signature
we've never seen before

243
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,193
with a structure that seemed
to pierce both space and time.

244
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,528
It sort of reminded me of a black hole.

245
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,709
- Does any of this sound familiar?
- It sounds ridiculous.

246
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,835
Perhaps you should
recalibrate your instruments.

247
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,577
That's what my colleagues said.

248
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,302
Well, perhaps you should listen to them.

249
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:39,542
I did, and I got the same results.

250
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:44,097
So I developed software that
mapped the fluctuations.

251
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,838
Multiple signatures across Manhattan,

252
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:47,705
another on an island
on the coast of Maine,

253
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,061
and one more in London.

254
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,417
I started to figure out the pattern...

255
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,921
The strength of the energy signature

256
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,956
tells me how long ago it was formed.

257
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,183
Based on the active rate of
energy decay, I dated them.

258
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,540
Manhattan is 2017,

259
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:04,543
Maine is 1980,

260
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,980
and London is 1893.

261
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:10,810
Do you know who lived in London in 1893?

262
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:12,725
Many people.

263
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:14,844
Including H.G. Wells,

264
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,717
but I'm sure that's just a coincidence.

265
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,666
I believe that these anomalies
pose a danger to space and time.

266
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:29,143
I need to understand what's going on.

267
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,814
- They're all gone.
- Okay.

268
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,605
I've deactivated her security system.

269
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,310
Great. Watch the door. Let us
know if anyone shows up.

270
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:09,132
Griffin, this is Cameron.
He's a cyber specialist.

271
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:10,874
- How you doing?
- He's on my payroll.

272
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,481
- Where's H.G.?
- He ran into some trouble.

273
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,156
Carl's on his way to get him right now.

274
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,777
Okay. The lab is downstairs.
We should hurry.

275
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:20,183
The only thing that's gonna get
you out of this is the truth.

276
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:22,365
I demand that you untie me.
I have to be somewhere.

277
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:24,508
Where? What's going on?

278
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:26,907
- Tell me and I might let you go.
- There's no time.

279
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,203
This would've been a lot easier
if you had just trusted me.

280
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:33,163
Draw your gun slowly...

281
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,774
And put it on the ground.

282
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,254
Jane?

283
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,012
Jane, you shouldn't be here.

284
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:41,255
I'm a Federal Agent.
You're making a big mistake.

285
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,500
Since when do Federal
Agents kidnap citizens?

286
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:45,421
This is official government business.

287
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:48,909
Really? Because this all
looks really shady to me.

288
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,742
Untie him.

289
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,441
Let's get out of here.

290
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,864
- How long is this gonna take you?
- Depends on

291
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,752
how sophisticated her security is.

292
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:35,307
I'll know in a bit.

293
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,393
- Is that the serum?
- Yes.

294
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,598
Are you okay?

295
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,853
I will be. Let's just get rid of it.

296
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,329
Are there any other computer
terminals in the house?

297
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:10,262
Brooke's research is on her laptop.

298
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:11,922
You'll need to wipe that, too.

299
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:14,785
I don't see it.

300
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,031
She must've taken it with her.

301
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,995
Damn it.

302
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:23,220
We need that laptop.

303
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:43,610
How did you know I was here?

304
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:46,227
Carl and I followed you.
Who was that woman?

305
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,452
She was a DOD Agent. She knows who I am.

306
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,590
The government knows?

307
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,244
It's Vanessa.

308
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:54,485
- Vanessa?
- Brooke is on her way to a meeting

309
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,444
with a venture capitalist
named Richard Knox.

310
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,140
He's the investor we've
been looking for.

311
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,518
- All right, what do I do now?
- Brooke took her laptop

312
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:02,487
with her to the meeting with Knox.

313
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,071
We're destroying everything at
the lab, but we need her laptop

314
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:06,775
because it contains all her research.

315
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,566
Where is this meeting taking place?

316
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:10,269
I'll text you the address.

317
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,538
Now, I have a way we
can remotely destroy

318
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,991
- everything on her computer.
- And how do I do that?

319
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:17,990
- I'll put Cameron on now.
- I've created an app

320
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,019
that can remotely
delete Brooke's laptop,

321
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,955
but I need you to download
it to your phone.

322
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:23,654
I'll send it to your phone, Jane.

323
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,272
What do we do after it's downloaded?

324
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,207
If you can get close
enough to Brooke's laptop,

325
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,828
I can do the rest on my end.

326
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,487
I'm texting you the address now.

327
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,973
Be careful.

328
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,981
Why does John care about Project Utopia?

329
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,783
- He was against it.
- Or he needed to control it.

330
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,921
John has always been
about power and prestige.

331
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:42,416
He wasn't just a doctor in 1893.
He was the chief surgeon.

332
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,641
You don't have to do this.

333
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:47,952
I know.

334
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:49,504
It's not far.

335
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,526
- Let's go.
- Okay.

336
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:12,281
William, I want you to stay in
the lobby and make sure we don't

337
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:14,174
- have any interruptions.
- Yes, Ma'am.

338
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:22,006
- Dr. Monroe.
- Mr. Knox.

339
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,649
Dr. Stevenson.

340
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,633
I have assembled some
very excited investors.

341
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,598
And we are very excited to meet them.

342
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:29,953
And I hope you're ready.

343
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:32,309
There's only one shot with these people.

344
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:33,806
We're more than ready.

345
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,142
Your confidence is inspiring.

346
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,253
Follow me.

347
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:48,492
- How do we know this is everything?
- I know my sister.

348
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:51,301
She keeps everything
contained in one place.

349
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:54,623
I have to find my father's journal.

350
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:56,218
I saw it earlier.

351
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:58,313
It has to be down here somewhere.

352
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,272
What?

353
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:09,639
Thank you.

354
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:12,903
I've ruined my life, Vanessa.

355
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:15,558
It's over for me, but it doesn't
have to be over for you.

356
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:19,051
- It's not over for you, Griffin.
- Everything I wanted...

357
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:23,262
My career, a life with you...

358
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,121
... there's no coming back from this.

359
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:31,375
How do we get inside?

360
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:33,339
There must be another entrance.

361
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,952
Carl, if you go that way,
I'll go around back.

362
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,428
I'm coming with you.

363
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:54,252
This way.

364
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:01,470
The staircase.

365
00:21:01,513 --> 00:21:03,863
Knox's office is on the fourth floor.

366
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,014
Don't move.

367
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,131
Stop!

368
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,633
- Jane, you all right?
- Yeah.

369
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,870
Did you follow us?

370
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:06,915
Yes.

371
00:22:08,248 --> 00:22:10,861
Now, care to explain what's going on?

372
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,090
It took five shots to stop that man.

373
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:22,406
Somebody better start
explaining this real quick.

374
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:26,836
You were right about me.

375
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,231
I am H.G. Wells, and I
traveled here from 1893.

376
00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:32,842
And my time machine and I have
made an absolute mess of things,

377
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:35,237
and we're trying to fix it.
1980... The island in Maine...

378
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:37,063
Do you know what
happened on that island?

379
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:39,376
Yes, I do. It was a DOD research program

380
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:41,792
- Genetic engineering.
- Yes, but it went horribly wrong.

381
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,173
And a deadly drug was
brought back to this time,

382
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:45,993
and we have to stop it.

383
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,621
- How do we do that?
- By stopping the people who have it.

384
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,933
They're on the fourth
floor of this building.

385
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,449
Well, then, let's do it.

386
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:03,970
Ladies and gentlemen,

387
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,935
we live in uncertain times...

388
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:09,073
ISIS, global terrorism,

389
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:12,386
even our own country is
divided against itself.

390
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,622
The world has become a powder keg,

391
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,881
and some days it seems like the match

392
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:19,180
could come from anywhere at nay second.

393
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:22,236
It's no longer a question of if there's
going to be another world war,

394
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:24,436
but when, and how bad it will be.

395
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:27,492
It's in our nature to
tear each other apart.

396
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:29,282
So now, more than ever,

397
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:32,247
safety is important,
strength is important.

398
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:35,503
We have better guns, bigger
bombs, chemical weapons,

399
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:37,710
but they're not making us any safer.

400
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,197
In fact, they're making our soldiers

401
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:42,031
more vulnerable than ever.

402
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,908
Warfare has evolved.

403
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:46,297
Our world has evolved...

404
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,288
but...

405
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,878
Human beings have not...

406
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,879
Until now.

407
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,741
Humanity is about to take
its next step forward.

408
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,873
This is Project Utopia.

409
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:01,311
Human enhancement...
It's no longer just a theory.

410
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,965
See for yourselves.

411
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:29,280
Increased strength...
The strength of six men.

412
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:31,717
Enhanced endurance and stamina.

413
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:36,030
Immunity to most known
bacteria and viral infections.

414
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:38,594
Rapid healing.

415
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:45,547
This way.

416
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:50,314
Tonight I am offering
you the opportunity...

417
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:57,433
And now it just needs to
log on to Brooke's computer.

418
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,570
The strength of six men? Please.

419
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:04,274
I've been involved with
Enhancement therapy for years.

420
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,238
This defies all current findings.

421
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:07,805
You're correct. It does.

422
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:09,204
What I'm saying, Dr. Monroe, is,

423
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,125
this sounds a lot like
your father talking.

424
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:13,437
And we know how his work went nowhere.

425
00:25:14,324 --> 00:25:16,500
Perhaps a demonstration is in order.

426
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:19,575
Adam,

427
00:25:19,793 --> 00:25:22,504
a simple handshake for Mr. Stillman.

428
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:27,110
Go ahead, shake his hand.

429
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,751
- Stop! Stop!
- Okay.

430
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:39,607
- You're breaking it.
- Adam, relax. Let him go.

431
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:42,100
- Aah.
- I think the point has been made.

432
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:45,314
This is not a trick.
Project Utopia is real.

433
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,056
Now, the serum does
have its side effects.

434
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:50,465
But with the right program
of maintenance doses,

435
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:52,262
we can use those effects

436
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:54,923
to make the subjects subservient.

437
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,105
Take Adam, for instance.

438
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,461
Would anyone care to
see what else he can do?

439
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:01,313
Any requests?

440
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,190
Is it working?

441
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:05,096
I installed the virus on her laptop,

442
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:07,408
but it's still too far
away to initiate the wipe.

443
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:10,366
- Well, how close does it need to be?
- I don't know.

444
00:26:12,624 --> 00:26:14,103
Jane.

445
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:21,997
Imagine soldiers who
can withstand firearms

446
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:23,771
and biochemical weapons,

447
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:25,474
who don't need to rest or recover,

448
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,440
who don't experience
concussion or death.

449
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:31,569
Now, the serum...

450
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,925
... will experience fear or doubt.

451
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:43,657
This is all part of the
package that I can offer you.

452
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:51,987
Now, shall we talk
about your investment?

453
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:58,464
Brooke.

454
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:02,192
Is there something wrong?

455
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:04,455
I'm not sure.

456
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,066
What the devil is going on?

457
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:12,867
No.

458
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:14,614
No, they're wiping it.

459
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,508
_

460
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:27,086
- What the hell is this?
- It must be Wells.

461
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:29,251
- He must be in the building.
- What are you talking about?

462
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:31,346
You have a security breach.
They're trying to steal

463
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:33,384
my research right now.

464
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:40,598
We got to go.

465
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:45,456
No. They're in the...
They're in the lab, as well.

466
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,774
They'll destroy everything.
Look, I'll have to get back

467
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,770
to you when I figure out
what's going on. We have to

468
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:51,884
get to the lab. Where
are you going, John?

469
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,106
John?

470
00:27:55,515 --> 00:27:57,343
Come on, hurry.

471
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,090
- Where's Jane?
- I don't know.

472
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,533
Hurry up! Hey, over there!

473
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:03,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

474
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,326
Where's your friend?

475
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:07,534
I don't know.

476
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:09,578
Oh, God.

477
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:11,997
You all right?

478
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,390
I'm fine.

479
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,087
Go find her.

480
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:17,394
Are you sure?

481
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:19,799
I'll be back.

482
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:30,037
What are you doing here?

483
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:38,960
You seem frightened.

484
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:40,483
You've cornered me.

485
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:41,963
What do you expect?

486
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:45,140
Oh. Well, an explanation would be nice.

487
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,064
After everything he did to you,

488
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:49,144
after he lied to you...

489
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,886
... how can you still trust him?

490
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,489
- Don't do this.
- Where is he?

491
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:58,017
This is not about H.G. or me.

492
00:29:58,023 --> 00:29:59,503
This is about the serum.

493
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,163
You need to stop.

494
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:03,891
- I know you're mad at me.
- "Mad"?

495
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:05,420
No, I'm... I'm not mad.

496
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:08,098
I'm gonna tear you apart.

497
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:25,868
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. Are you all right?

498
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,940
- Did he hurt you?
- I'm fine. He didn't get to me.

499
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:30,364
- We have to warn Vanessa.
- Right.

500
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:35,554
Were you able to wipe Brooke's laptop?

501
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,344
Yes, but you have to get
out of the townhouse.

502
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,364
- Brooke is on her way over.
- We're leaving now.

503
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,850
- Are we good here?
- All finished.

504
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:43,120
Good. Let's go.

505
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:45,689
We have to leave. They're
on their way back.

506
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:47,858
- I can't find the journal.
- Where else could it be?

507
00:30:47,864 --> 00:30:50,389
I'll keep looking. You go.
Get out of here.

508
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:55,821
I'll be right behind you.

509
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:57,437
No. I'll help.

510
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:59,096
You should go.

511
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:01,182
Griffin.

512
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,817
Go.

513
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:16,286
Go. Get out of here.

514
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:24,601
Oh, God, she's really bleeding.

515
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:26,323
Take her somewhere safe.

516
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,733
- I'm going after Brooke.
- I'll make sure she gets help.

517
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:30,292
Come on.

518
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:47,316
Brooke.

519
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:50,552
I should've just let you
die the first time.

520
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:53,164
Where's the journal?

521
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:54,877
I don't know.

522
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,947
Liar.

523
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:00,126
It's the only thing you have left.

524
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:03,670
It's the only reason you came back.

525
00:32:05,162 --> 00:32:08,175
What are you gonna do,
burn the place down?

526
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:10,516
Fitting, isn't it?

527
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,029
Wait.

528
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,099
Okay, you win.

529
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:51,890
Goodbye, Griffin.

530
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,059
Get out of my way.

531
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,365
No.

532
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,933
Utopia doesn't exist, Wells.

533
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:05,622
It never did, and it never will.

534
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,226
Wells, get the journal!

535
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:19,537
No!

536
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,712
Don't!

537
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:21,974
No!

538
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,240
No, no, no, no!

539
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,547
No!

540
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:33,121
No. No.

541
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,911
No, no, no.

542
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:47,307
Wells, go!

543
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:49,359
Now!

544
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:57,731
I'm so sorry, Vanessa.

545
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:01,648
Griffin died to destroy the serum.

546
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:04,216
Yes. Project Utopia is no more.

547
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,951
And Brooke and John?

548
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:13,347
They're still out there.

549
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,523
But we will find them.

550
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:19,272
I want this to be over.

551
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,493
It's time for this to be over.

552
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:25,229
Yes.

553
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:29,080
The three-alarm fire

554
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:31,305
ripped through this townhouse
behind me earlier tonight,

555
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:33,922
spreading rapidly and
threatening nearby residences.

556
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:36,887
So far, we can confirm that
Griffin Monroe died in the fire.

557
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:39,374
Mr. Monroe was running for the
28th District's Senate spot

558
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,077
and was widely considered a shoo-in,

559
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,433
but saw a steady drop in
polls in recent months.

560
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,108
His campaign office de...

561
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:51,778
Let me help you with that.

562
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,363
You know this isn't over.

563
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:00,800
We can recreate the serum.

564
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:05,892
You can't be serious?

565
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:08,591
All we need is your blood and your DNA.

566
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:10,854
Everything else can be replicated.

567
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:13,770
Don't sell me a dog.

568
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,588
John, this is...

569
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:18,416
This is just a setback.

570
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:20,287
No, no, no, no, no.

571
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,471
This is over.

572
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:29,412
- I'm not a rich woman.
- I don't care.

573
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,840
There are plenty of
other ways to make money.

574
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:35,067
And I'm not playing your
little games anymore.

575
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,641
Your way failed,

576
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,431
so now we do things my way...

577
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,396
And we start by destroying Wells.

578
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,013
Do you understand?

579
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:46,192
- Do you understand?!
- Yes. Yes, of course.

580
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:52,205
Then we're clear.
Project Utopia is over.

581
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,338
Yeah. It's over.

582
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,372
Good.

583
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:02,203
It's unbelievable.

584
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:05,032
I'm putting my trust in you,
showing you this,

585
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,678
telling you the truth.

586
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,340
Who would I tell?

587
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,419
Who would believe me?

588
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:12,040
The DOD cut my budget

589
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,440
because they thought my
theories were a waste of time.

590
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:17,013
You're not tempted to run back,
try and prove your theories?

591
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,196
The DOD would not know what
to do with this information.

592
00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:21,594
How's your wound?

593
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:23,611
I'll live.

594
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:25,653
So, aren't you worried?

595
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:27,481
About what?

596
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,504
You destroyed Project Utopia
and restored the time line,

597
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:32,896
but what about next time?

598
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,159
As long as the time machine exists,

599
00:36:35,203 --> 00:36:37,858
don't you risk doing
this again, or worse?

600
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,295
Yes. There's a matter
of unfinished business.

601
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:42,602
I have to stop John.

602
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,554
I'll help you stop him.

603
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:49,871
Forgive my suspicions, but...

604
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,930
Why would you help me?

605
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:55,209
There are some of us out there
who believe in your Utopia.

606
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,524
Good does exist in this world.

607
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,706
Mm. One doubts.

608
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:01,670
One shouldn't.

609
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:31,126
So predictable.

610
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:36,740
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

611
00:37:38,742 --> 00:37:40,672
- Save your breath.
- Please.

612
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,242
You tried to sedate me

613
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:49,424
and take my blood without my permission.

614
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,954
I thought you were smarter than that.

615
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,745
What will you do?

616
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,058
Oh, don't you worry about that.

617
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:58,284
Just go to sleep.

618
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,267
When I wake...

619
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,584
Darling, you won't be waking up.

620
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,650
Vanessa's upstairs.

621
00:38:20,694 --> 00:38:22,783
Oh, yes.

622
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:30,965
Thank you for helping me today.
I know how difficult it was for you.

623
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:33,873
Jane, I never meant for you

624
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,732
to be surrounded by so much danger.

625
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,392
I know.

626
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:39,661
And I know I said I didn't want to be

627
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,825
a part of all of this, but...

628
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:43,446
I can't help but think

629
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:46,325
that maybe I was wrong for walking away.

630
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:49,073
Maybe I'm supposed to be here.

631
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,038
Surrounded by death and destruction?

632
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:56,352
To help you stop all this
death and destruction.

633
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:59,187
It's a question of destiny.

634
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:01,689
There's only one real way we'll know

635
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:04,176
my purpose in all of this...

636
00:39:04,182 --> 00:39:06,967
And that's to stay.

637
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:10,623
And when it's all over?

638
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:14,266
You'll leave,

639
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:17,962
and it'll break my heart...

640
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,811
... but I'll pick up the
pieces and move on...

641
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:25,034
And so will you.

642
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:27,712
Whether we want to or not?

643
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:29,147
Yes,

644
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:31,357
whether we want to or not.

645
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,977
Hello?

646
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,633
Good evening.

647
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:42,646
- John?
- Oh, if it isn't

648
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:44,668
Romeo himself,

649
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:48,249
back together again with
his Juliet... How romantic.

650
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:50,692
- Is Brooke with you?
- In a sense.

651
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:54,486
I don't think you have to worry
about Project Utopia anymore.

652
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,623
You killed her?

653
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:57,065
And you're next, H.G.

654
00:39:57,071 --> 00:40:00,552
One last chat, you and me, old friend.

655
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:03,421
I'm coming for you,

656
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:05,858
and soon, this will all be over.
