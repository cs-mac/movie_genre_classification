(EPISODE 1: THE RIDICULOUS GUYS)

2
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,380
What was that?

3
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,350
- Gosh.
- My back...

4
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,300
No, I was just about to see her face.

5
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,630
Yes, this is Ahn Min Hyuk of Ainsoft.

6
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,370
I warned you.

7
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,170
I told you to get rid of "Albertan Chronicles".

8
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,300
- Or else, you'd end up dead.
- Listen, jerk.

9
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,170
Do you know what time it is?

10
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,100
You should let me sleep for a threat to be effective.

11
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,970
I'd be more scared if I was actually awake.

12
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,830
This is so frustrating.

13
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,070
Don't be surprised at what happens from now.

14
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,500
You asked for it.

15
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,830
Ainsoft will go bankrupt. I'll make that happen.

16
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,930
Gosh, who is that?

17
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,070
(DISQUALIFIED)

18
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,570
I know. I know I didn't make it.

(RESUME, DO BONG SOON)

(COVER LETTER)

21
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,370
Not another cover letter.

22
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,200
My name is Do Bong Soon.

23
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,130
I live in Dobong-dong, Dobong-Gu. I'm Do Bong Soon.

24
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,870
As for me,

25
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,100
I'm very special.

26
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,630
Does that sound wrong?

27

(RECORDINGS OF SECRETS IN BONG SOON'S MATERNAL ANCESTRAL LINE)

28
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,870
I have a secret...

29
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,070
that makes me unique from others.

30
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,170
(BONG SOON'S FIRST BIRTHDAY, 1992)

31
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,900
I'm strong. And not just strong, I'm really strong.

32
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,470
The progenitor of this secret gene...

33
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,230
came down from my ancestor Park Gae Boon...

34
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,070
who attacked the enemy by throwing rocks...

35
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,100
during the Siege of Haengju.

36
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,670
This extraordinary power that's handed down...

37
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,700
in my maternal line has a veiled secret.

38
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,230
It was during 1862's rebellion of Jinju peasants and slaves.

39
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,900
An ancestor named Ga Wook Bang...

40
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,830
used her power on the side of the officials...

41
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,370
and hurt the innocent people.

42
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,370
When she looked only after her selfish desires,

43
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,600
she lost her power overnight.

44
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,370
In her last days, she suffered leprosy in solitary.

45
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,600
Ever since then, my ancestors realized that if the power...

46
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,400
was used for something immoral, they would have to pay the price.

47
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,800
However,

48
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,730
my mother Hwang Jin Yi completely ignored the jinx.

49
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,300
Her fanaticism led to a problem.

50
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,400
There wasn't a problem using her power to boost national prestige.

51
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,530
However...

52
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,300
Thank you.

53
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,670
Bring it. Give it to me. You, jump.

54
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,330
Kneel, you punk. I told you to kneel.

55
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,100
What?

56
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,630
It was true. If you used your powers...

57
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,470
for something unjust,

58
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,000
you have to pay the price.

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,770
A rising Greco-Roman wrestler Do Chil Goo...

60
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,130
and the now powerless weightlifter Hwang Jin Yi...

61
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,530
What happened to your face?

62
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,270
- I'm fine.
- Hey...

63
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,630
They ended up...

64
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
setting things on fire that day.

65
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,870
Hey, you jerk.

66
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,600
Push.

67
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,270
Your princess came out first out of your twins.

68
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Is the boy not out yet?

69
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,800
Look. She has a fist.

70
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,270
My goodness.

71
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,200
That's how I was born.

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,730
(MY NAME IS...)

73
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,500
(STRONG GIRL BONG SOON)

74
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,500
There were many times I was frustrated...

75
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,670
while hiding my power.

76
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,600
I must ignore such dirty hands.

77
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,400
For 27 years, I had to fight with myself.

78
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,730
If I could help it, I tried to ignore it.

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,470
This station is Dobong. Dobong Station.

80
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,430
The doors are on your left.

81
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,930
I didn't want to become a spectacle.

82
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,370
I had to hide my power.

83
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,370
For intentional death or suicide, insurance payment could be delayed.

84
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,700
No, Sir. I'm not particularly talking about you.

85
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,500
I've tried all kinds of jobs after graduating high school.

86
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,270
Hello, handsome. You look so brave.

87
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,670
She's a girl.

88
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,300
I even tried farming.

89
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,070
After 10 years, only farmers will survive.

90
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,070
We'll run out of gas, and that will limit our movements.

91
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,970
At that point, we'll have to become self-sufficient.

92
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,370
Bong Soon, put your power to good use.

93
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,500
You should farm. Farm.

94
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,570
Do you know how great farmers are?

95
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,500
With Bong Gi going to medical school,

96
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,870
Uncle left the city to make money from farming.

97
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,430
Mom insisted on closing the walnut bakery and switching to farming.

98
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
She first sent me to Uncle's as an envoy.

99
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,170
Oh, dear!

100
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,300
Look at her, Grandma.

101
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,270
Our plan to return to farming has failed.

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,370
By the merest chance, I stumbled upon a job that was right for me.

103
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,430
In the real world, I have to conceal my power.

104
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,470
In this world, I was able to meet another side of me.

105
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,200
My dream is to develop a game in which the main character is...

106
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
based on myself.

107
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,170
Oh, yes!

108
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,070
That was easy.

109
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,930
The success of role playing games...

110
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,270
depend on the constant supply of contents the users can enjoy.

111
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,630
That's how "Albertan Chronicles" became successful.

112
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,540
It endlessly reveals the world the users can experience catharsis in.

113
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,200
There's no room for boredom.

114
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,930
The CEO of the company only goes to work twice a week.

115
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,570
For the remaining days, all he does is play.

116
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
What a life, don't you think?

117
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,330
I wish you the best of luck, my students.

118
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,070
Hey! Stop right there.

119
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,270
Hey!

120
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,470
You'd better stop there!

121
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,370
You will be dead when I catch you.

122
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,470
Darn it.

123
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,900
I need a personal bodyguard.

124
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,300
Recruit one immediately.

125
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,770
I had a feeling something was bound to happen...

126
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,400
and it did.

127
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,630
(BUD KINDERGARTEN)

128
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,800
What is wrong with my age?

129
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,430
Age is a number when in love.

130
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,530
Excuse me!

131
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,670
No one's here.

132
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,400
What kind of a jerk parks a truck like this?

133
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,970
Who would...

134
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,330
What do you want?

135
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,300
Is this your truck?

136
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,330
No. It's lunch time.

137
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,770
How can I pass through when you're blocking the road like this?

138
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,800
You old man. You can't pass through here.

139
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,100
How can you decide that for yourself?

140
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,030
This isn't your property.

141
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,500
Hey, just go back when I tell you nicely.

142
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,130
If you keep talking back to me, you might get good a beating.

143
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,900
What are you doing?

144
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,170
Goodness. My phone!

145
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,670
I gave you a chance to get out, old man.

146
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,700
You just blew your chance.

147
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,170
- I told you to leave.
- It hurts.

148
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,700
"It hurts"? So what?

149
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,730
Does it hurt?

150
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,870
What?

151
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,570
What are you going to do about it?

152
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,930
Hey, you. Get over here. Quickly.

153
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,470
Let's go. Hey, let's go.

154
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,130
Jerk.

155
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,270
Hello. I would like to file a report.

156
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,330
This is Dobong-dong...

157
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,070
- What are you doing? Give it back.
- Hold it.

158
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,470
Why do women take pictures of food?

159
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,030
My, my.

160
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,400
- Is this your boyfriend?
- Why are you looking...

161
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,170
through my phone? Give it back.

162
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,330
You must have lost your senses.

163
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,000
Who said you could call the cops? Do you want to die?

164
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,300
I see. Are you a law-abiding citizen or something?

165
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,900
Then I'm a law-abiding thug.

166
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,530
You started to beat up that poor old man.

167
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,000
Are you the old man?

168
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,170
Are you the one who got beaten up?

169
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,230
Gosh. He looks like a loser.

170
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,430
Go away.

171
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,970
Gosh.

172
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,900
My screen got cracked.

173
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,700
Hey. You have to pay for my phone.

174
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,430
Goodness.

175
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,370
I still have three years left on my contract.

176
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,500
It's been only three months.

177
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,400
I am asking you for the last time.

178
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,900
- Please pay for this.
- My goodness.

179
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,630
How can kids these days be so fearless?

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,430
Should I rip you into pieces like a rag and hang you on the clothesline?

181
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,230
Look how tiny you are.

182
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,230
- What is going on?
- You're such a small target.

183
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,770
I can finish you in a second.

184
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,030
- Don't hit me.
- What's the police doing?

185
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,530
- I'll kill you.
- Spare me.

186
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,200
This is why I don't like the police.

187
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,030
Don't hit me.

188
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,770
What are we going to do?

189
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,500
Your face is so small like a CD.

190
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,700
Lower your eyes.

191
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,770
Lower them. I told you to lower them.

192
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,570
Lower your eyes.

193
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,270
Hello?

194
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,100
I am at a construction site for redevelopment in Dobong-dong.

195
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,730
I need some police officers and the police squad here.

196
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,130
There are a lot of people here.

197
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,400
A woman and an old man are being threatened by thugs.

198
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,800
Even if I can't use my strength again...

199
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,870
and the plague engulfs my body,

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,570
I can't let this man slide.

201
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,130
- What on earth is the police doing?
- Oh, wow.

202
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,370
- What happened?
- Boss. Boss!

203
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,170
She did it.

204
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,070
What was that?

205
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,400
Darn it.

206
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,900
What is happening?

207
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,170
- Boss, Boss!
- Hey, you.

208
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,000
You have to pay for my phone.

209
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,070
- Who on earth are you?
- Don't fight her.

210
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,530
You should know if you're a social person.

211
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,070
We save all the numbers on our cellphones.

212
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,800
- It will be so uncomfortable...
- Don't do it.

213
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,700
- If my phone stays as it is now.
- She's crazy.

214
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,430
You must be out of your mind.

215
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,930
Hey.

216
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,700
My hand... It got folded.

217
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,130
I'm sorry. Oh, my.

218
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,800
- What should I do?
- Don't fold it.

219
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,470
- I didn't mean this to happen.
- Don't do it!

220
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,330
My goodness. I'm sorry.

221
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,000
Sorry.

222
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,630
You shouldn't have tried to hit me.

223
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,600
Why you...

224
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,570
Come on. Pay for my phone.

225
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,330
Let go of my...

226
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,030
Who... Who is she?

227
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,240
I got you now.

228
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,500
What is this?

229
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,770
Sorry about that.

230
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,970
- No way.
- She's so cool.

231
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,200
Here. Over here.

232
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,100
- Get him out.
- Help.

233
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,970
- Help me out.
- Get him.

234
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,300
Help him out.

235
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Should I call an ambulance?

236
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,000
No, a girl hit me.

237
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,240
She threw me.

238
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,000
- I'm serious.
- I got hit here.

239
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,530
That's not right.

240
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,430
(SERIOUS CRIMES UNIT THREE)

241
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,330
What do I do?

242
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
Gook Doo's going to think it's strange. What do I say?

243
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,170
What do I do...

244
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
Hello, Gook Doo.

245
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,900
My gosh, Gook Doo. It's been a while.

246
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,370
You're hard at work, aren't you?

247
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,670
What should I say?

248
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,130
What's wrong with her?

249
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
- I'm telling you the truth!
- I almost died.

250
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,800
Calm down and sit.

251
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm not joking.

252
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,530
Do Bong Soon.

253
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,800
My gosh, it's her.

254
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,740
That... That's her.

255
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,870
- It was her.
- It's her.

256
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,530
Who did that to you again?

257
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,430
Detective, kids can't lie.

258
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,500
Why won't you believe...

259
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,800
- Name?
- What they say?

260
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,670
- Do...
- Do Bong Soon. Address?

261
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,270
1342, Dobong-dong, Dobong-Gu.

262
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,470
You're saying they took over the road...

263
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,300
and restricted traffic?

264
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,800
The driver Jeong Sun Ho asked them to clear the way,

265
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,330
but they declined and used force.

266
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,430
At the time, the witness Do Bong Soon...

267
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,230
who was trying to report the situation...

268
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,430
You got into a conflict while trying to report,

269
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,300
and Do Bong Soon hit Kim Gwang Bok's face.

270
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,470
His cheek sunk in,

271
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,470
and four of his teeth fell out, resulting in a serious injury.

272
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,070
She's not a joke. If she throws us, we'd fly.

273
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,770
Meanwhile, Hwang Hyun Dong who saw what happened to Kim...

274
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,870
came to resort the issue,

275
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,330
but ended up with five fractured fingers.

276
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,870
When Oh Jin Pyo and Yang Yong Chul came afterwards,

277
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,030
they were thrown 30m into the back of a truck full with sand.

278
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,670
They each received fractures on their neck and their legs.

279
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,870
Chan Young Nam who came to retaliate...

280
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,000
ran into Kim Gang Bok and fell.

281
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Kim flew over 10m...

282
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,430
and hit a truck and fell to the ground.

283
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,170
Does this make sense to you?

284
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,570
Well, the thing is...

285
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,070
According to the current law, young children do not have legal force.

286
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,330
Also, their testimonies do not make any sense.

287
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,570
The problem is,

288
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,030
this is what the driver testified.

289
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,100
If this is true, section 750 of the Civil Act say...

290
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,130
that this is an intentional act of violence. You'll be punished.

291
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,170
If there isn't a testimony from the reporter...

292
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,870
Do you call that a report? It sounds like a martial arts novel.

293
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,930
Who's that?

294
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,900
Korean police are hopeless.

295
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,200
How dare you take your salary after writing such a report?

296
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,370
Who is he?

297
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,800
I reported the incident, and I'm a witness.

298
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,270
What is this? Really?

299
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,570
Guys, you shouldn't lie at the police station.

300
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,270
Do you really think she beat all these men?

301
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,670
- All by herself?
- Yes!

302
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,500
- I told you, it's true.
- Kids don't lie.

303
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,470
Did you watch "The Avengers" at daycare today?

304
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,570
What are your teachers teaching you?

305
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,070
They call it audio-visual education and just play movies.

306
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,070
Their daycare needs to go through a thorough investigation.

307
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,630
Did you report this case?

308
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,630
Yes. I reported it, and I'm also the witness.

309
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,630
However, my testimony is different from what the driver said.

310
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,370
He was a part of the incident. He's a victim.

311
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,970
He was probably not himself.

312
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,600
How was it like, you ask?

313
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,500
What should I say...

314
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,970
Should I say it was five minutes before the world turned into a mess?

315
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,470
A false testimony is not a punishable act,

316
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,930
but if the victim requests a civil suit, you'll be called to court.

317
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,700
Then it'll be seen as perjury and you'll be punished.

318
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,570
Then explain to me how those men got injured.

319
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,800
Look at me. Say it while looking at me.

320
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,100
Them?

321
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,600
I saw them fighting each other.

322
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,470
Be quiet!

323
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,000
- Sit back down.
- Sit down.

324
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,870
Sit down, sit down.

325
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,200
No.

326
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,300
That girl beat all of them on her own.

327
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,800
Kids.

328
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,030
Can you read this?

329
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,600
See?

330
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,800
There is no time for kids to learn Korean.

331
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,270
Why, do you ask? All they do is watch movies.

332
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,230
Education starts from daycare, but look where they're at.

333
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,330
A single girl beat seven men?

334
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,800
She doesn't even have a weapon. It doesn't make sense.

335
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,230
- Why doesn't it?
- No.

336
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,100
Hollywood is ruining too many of us.

337
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,800
Guys. What should I do for you?

338
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,230
Should I just throw you behind bars for self-inflicted injury?

339
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,500
- Why would you do that?
- She did beat us.

340
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,530
- Who beat you?
- Who beat us, then?

341
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,670
Who broke his leg?

342
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,930
Who fractured his neck?

343
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,800
Who did that?

344
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,700
Hey, just wrap it up.

345
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,600
If we report this, the higher-ups will fire me.

346
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,100
To be frank,

347
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,900
does it make sense...

348
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,530
for seven men to get broken bones by one girl?

349
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,930
- Hey.
- It's true.

350
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,930
Why are you making this ridiculous incident a case?

351
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,470
They hurt a driver, and tried to blame it on an innocent person.

352
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,030
We must perform an investigation. They even have criminal records.

353
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,500
- Sit down.
- That's not fair.

354
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,800
Sit down. Just sit down.

355
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,300
- You're the best.
- You're so awesome.

356
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,800
- You're awesome.
- You're the best.

357
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,570
Who did this to us, then?

358
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,470
- You're so awesome.
- You're the best.

359
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,270
Are you happy?

360
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,230
If you don't want to get involved with that kind of people,

361
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,430
find yourself a job instead of wasting time at home.

362
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,030
Sir.

363
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,170
What happened? Why are you at the station?

364
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,600
I've never seen such a thing in my life.

365
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,530
Excuse me.

366
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,400
Shouldn't you thank me?

367
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,730
Why did you lie to the police?

368
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,130
What is this?

369
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,170
I helped you from getting charged.

370
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,270
You won't thank me or apologize to me?

371
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,470
- What is this?
- Why did you bother?

372
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,800
If you're a man,

373
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
be like one.

374
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,630
Don't just watch while a woman takes charge.

375
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,330
You should be ashamed of yourself.

376
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,400
What's with her?

377
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,800
She's really strange.

378
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,930
She's so hot.

379
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,630
Pardon?

380
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,670
She was the most unique person I've ever seen.

381
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,230
How unique?

382
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,930
She was... Ms. Seo. I really liked your project.

383
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,670
Thank you, Sir. I'll work harder.

384
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,870
Please do. You can do it!

385
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,400
Well, I mean...

386
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,000
The encounter was more thrilling than any other computer game.

387
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,430
- Encounter with whom?
- With that girl.

388

389
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,300
Please enjoy.

390
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,630
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

391
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,770
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

392
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,070
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

393
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,730
Hello.

394
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,600
Did you sell a lot?

395
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,500
Is this all?

396
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,230
If I find any money on you, I will hit you for each bill I find.

397
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,770
There you go. You should've started with this.

398
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,670
Let's not be petty. Okay?

399
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,500
You are a man, aren't you?

400
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,870
- I will try.
- Give me a cup of coffee.

401
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,530
I'm back.

402
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,670
Why are you so late?

403
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,430
I had my reasons.

404
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,070
Reasons? What reasons? You don't have a job.

405
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,700
You went to the internet cafe, didn't you?

406
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,770
I am embarrassed to face Myung Soo's mother.

407
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,130
Goodness. What am I going to do with you?

408
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,600
I knew three million young adults were unemployed,

409
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,270
but I never guessed you would be one of them.

410
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Hey, you should just get married.

411
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,730
Get a rich guy who is dumb enough to marry you. Got it?

412
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,970
Whatever.

413
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,730
Officer, take a look at this.

414
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,330
- Lieutenant In.
- Yes?

415
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,000
How do you and the Avengers lady know each other?

416
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
We went to the same elementary, middle, and high school.

417
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,370
That's right. You are from Dobong-dong.

418
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,570
Look at this. The witness from before...

419
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,530
I did a background check on him and he's the CEO of Ainsoft.

420
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,100
What kind of a company is Ainsoft?

421
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,870
You don't know about Ainsoft?

422
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,500
It's the company that created the game, "Albertan Chronicles".

423
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,670
Ahn Min Hyuk's a son of Ahn Chool Do, the chairman of Osung Group.

424
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,530
I knew it. He was too arrogant.

425
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,400
By the way, where are Kim Gwang Bok and Hwang Hyun Dong?

426
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,570
- Are they still in the hospital?
- Yes.

427
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,800
Hey, did you find out about her or not?

428
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Well...

429
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,100
I am about to die.

430
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,100
You have to find her.

431
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,670
This is too embarrassing.

432
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,530
Boss. She was no joke.

433
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,970
She was the strongest person that I've ever gone up against.

434
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,270
- Shut it.
- Sorry, Sir.

435
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,800
Hey, what is her name?

436
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,500
- Do Bong Soon.
- Do Bong Soon.

437
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,230
Do Bong Soon!

438
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,870
Do Bong Soon!

439
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,970
- Calm down.
- Do Bong Soon!

440
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,500
Look at the fractures.

441
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,570
I've been an orthopedist for 10 years.

442
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,630
- I haven't seen anything like this.
- The bones...

443
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,070
were bent all the way and returned to their places.

444
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:52,100
This has to be done by a person who possesses a mysterious ability.

445
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,170
Look at the arm. The bones were completely twisted.

446
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,900
In the medical community, some say...

447
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
we should research about the dynamics between...

448
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,230
the bones and the muscles under force.

449
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,100
This could be a revolutionary research. Revolution.

450
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,930
By the way, this patient lost four teeth from a single punch.

451
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,600
Professor Shin, how should we interpret this?

452
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,670
He was crying, saying it was a woman's doing.

453
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,170
Should we treat him with the Department of Psychiatry?

454
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Psychiatry?

455
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,770
I will give Professor Kim a call.

456
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Here it is.

459
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,100
Darn it. You will ruin the car seat.

460
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,900

- Shut it!

Don't cry.

463
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,500
You, two. You want to go back to your parents, right?

464
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,870
Then, be quiet. If you keep crying,

465
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,400
you will make me very angry.

466
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,900
Mister. My brother is crying. Please stop the car.

467

If you cry and pee again,

468
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,140

By the way, are you going to be okay tomorrow morning?

480
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,230
You remember the curse, right? The abduction didn't count...

481
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,870
because the kidnapper was a scumbag. But this time...

482

493
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,670
(AWARDS)

494
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,530
"Second place in the 2014 Pan Korean Jiu-jitsu Tournament".

495
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,800
"Worked in Squad Three of the security office at the Blue House".

496
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,270
That girl. Find out who she is.

497
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,870
The girl we saw at the police station.

498
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,030
Yes, her.

499
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,800
The girl you're thinking of right now. Got it?

500
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,470
I mean...

501
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,070
Article 60 of the Public Officials Act states that police officers...

502
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,870
must keep all sensitive information confidential even after tenure.

503
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,170
- I'm just...
- Please leave.

504
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,000
I absolutely cannot disclose anyone's personal information.

505
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,430
Apparently, personal information cannot be disclosed.

506
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,800
The police officer was unflinching.

507
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,330
What's his name?

508
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,170
- His name is In Gook Doo.
- In Gook Doo?

509
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,960
The door is open. Come in!

510
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,710
Hey, are you ready?

511
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,300
You heard about what I like, right?

512
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,210
Show me!

513
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,670
Hey, stop.

514
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,540
I said stop!

515
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,570
Who are you?

516
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,710
Wait! Gosh! No, please...

517
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,970
You have the right to remain silent,

518
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,770
and have the right to an attorney.

519
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,040
Hey, are you a cop?

520
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,870
You rat. Do you have a warrant?

521
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,300
I'll request a warrant within 24 hours of your arrest.

522
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,500
Since you might flee, I'll have to arrest you first.

523
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,470
- You punk. Are you a guy?
- Yes.

524
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,940
Do you know whom you're dealing with here?

525
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,100
Mister, do I have to know that?

526
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,400
Article 61 of the Public Officials Act clearly states...

527
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,140
that all officials cannot give or receive gifts, money...

528
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,540
or any other incentives...

529
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,270
in dealings with any persons in regards to their duties.

530
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,210
I've been taught that everyone is equal in the eyes of the law.

531
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,000
He just happens to be a congressman. Why is that my fault?

532
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,640
Lieutenant In, know your place.

533
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
If you keep this up, you might end up...

534
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,600
losing everything in one blow.

535
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,340
Bring it on, then!

536
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,270
My deepest apologies.

537
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,000
Yes, Sir!

538
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,300
What a lunatic!

539
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,940
The higher-ups are losing it right now.

540
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,710
Well, he's not all there.

541
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,600
He used to be known for being peculiar in the academy.

542
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,300
That's what I heard.

543
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,400
That punk. Let's suffocate him with car exhaust fumes.

544
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,740
Send him to the traffic team!

545
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,670
Well, that would attract too much attention.

546
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,870
Then demote him to your worst-performing team!

547
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,770
Lower your head. You're blocking my view.

548
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,540
All of them will die before they even get there.

549
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,500
Anyhow, we should try to tackle things step by step from now on.

550
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,500
Hello, I've been transferred to your team. I'm In Gook Doo.

551
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,300
You can't even get through to that lunatic. He gives me a headache.

552
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,000
It sounds like he's a true police officer.

553
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,160
What?

554
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,740
By the way, why do you need her number?

555
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,870
She's my type.

556
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,940
Oh, was it for your love life?

557
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,500
So to speak.

558
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,240
- How is Chairman Ahn doing?
- Great, thanks to you.

559
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,470
You've been helping my dad in many aspects all his life.

560
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,270
I must say,

561
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,770
I'm very proud of you for achieving this much without your dad's help.

562
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,100
But you know what? There's a limit to what you can achieve...

563
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,200
without utilizing his connections.

564
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,840
Shall I just do physical labour for the rest of my life?

565
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,470
The hourly wage for construction labour is high. It's nothing bad.

566
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,270
Bong Soon, stop eating. Let Bong Gi have some, too.

567
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,300
Also, I misused my strength...

568
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,400
and met with the worst mishap. Shouldn't you know better?

569
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,370
I ended up marrying this man.

570
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,770
What's up?

571
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,700
Gosh.

572
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,570
Hello?

573
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,270
Yes, this is Do Bong Soon. Who is this?

574
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,870
So you're not working at the moment, right?

575
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,740
In professional terms, I'm a job seeker.

576
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,270
I'm not bumming around.

577
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,600
Oh, I see.

578
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,870
Anyway, my boss saw you that day...

579
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,400
and was very impressed. That's why he made such a bold decision.

580
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,170
Gosh, how much more pathetic can he get?

581
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,940
- Pardon me?
- If he has something to say to me,

582
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,800
he can meet me himself. Why did he send you?

583
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,770
I mean, you look much older than him.

584
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,640
Well... You can think of this as a preliminary job interview.

585
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,870
I see. A preliminary job interview?

586
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,640
- Yes.
- Got it.

587
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,770
So you're asking me...

588
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:22,140
to work as a bodyguard for your boss or whoever that guy is, right?

589
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,370
Yes. We'll be sure to pay you a top-notch salary.

590
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:31,300
Sir, I've worked all kinds of jobs since graduating high school.

591
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,370
I can tell which companies are scams...

592
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,540
and which ones are about to go under or work me like a dog.

593
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,540
Also, I don't want a physical job.

594
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,970
I'd like a job where I can use my brain. That's my outlook on career.

595
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,770
I'm not sure why you're giving me this offer,

596
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,700
but I know exactly what I want to do...

597
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,000
and for which company I want to work.

598
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,340
If you don't mind, may I ask you what kind of job it is?

599
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,970
It's none of your business.

600
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,100
I'm so sorry to say no when you came all the way here.

601
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,640
Have a safe journey back.

602
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,170
60,000 dollars a year.

603
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,670
Plus incentives.

604
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,340
Mister, by any chance...

605
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,300
Is it actually for some sort of an adult entertainment establishment?

606
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,040
Why are you offering me such a hefty salary?

607
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,570
What do you even know about me?

608
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,140
- Does that guy like me?
- No, no.

609
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,140
Come to think of it, how did you get my number?

610
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,840
- Am I being stalked?
- Gosh, no.

611
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,140
- Also...
- That's not what it is.

612
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,500
I'm wondering why he's not hiring a male bodyguard.

613
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,970
Why does it have to be a girl? That's the weirdest part.

614
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,240
It is very strange indeed.

615
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,440
- Lend me your ear for a second.
- My ear?

616
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,940
- Why do you need my ear? My gosh.
- There are...

617
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,240
Gosh, that doesn't even make any sense.

618
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,570
What's the name of the company?

619
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,640
It's called Ainsoft.

620
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,270
Sorry? What did you say?

621
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,700
Have you heard of it? It's Ainsoft.

622
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,600
Ainsoft...

623
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,070
Mister.

624
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,770
When can I meet your boss?

625
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:27,440
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

626
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,000
I hope you enjoy it.

627
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,300
Thank you.

628
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,000
I already put sugar in it.

629
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,700
So we should...

630
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,640
call the district office and the city hall...

631
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,940
a dozen times a day to let them know we're against the redevelopment.

632
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,700
How about one of you just buzz your hair off?

633
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,140
- You should do it.
- Come on.

634
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,570
Protesting by buzzing your hair won't get through to them.

635
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,640
Just let the official correspondence pile up...

636
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,800
and go head-to-head with the person in charge.

637
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,870
But actually, I'm all for redevelopment.

638
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:04,140
Laundromat Alley is a terrifying place to be after 10pm.

639
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,470
You're right. Something has to be done about that place.

640
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,640
There are so many unsavoury hoodlums going about town these days.

641
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,040
Oh, my. Gook Doo's mom is here.

642
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,370
- Hello.
- Hello there.

643
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,600
Welcome.

644
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,870
Did you see her wave her hair like a young woman?

645
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:27,600
I'll take 4 egg tarts and 2 pecan pies, please.

646
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,700
"Two pecan pies, please."

647
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,070
By the way,

648
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,370
I enjoyed your novel,

649
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,540
"Furtive Hormones of the Night".

650
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,970
Oh, dear. Was it to your liking?

651
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,570
Yes, I finished it within a day.

652
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,870
I've never thumbed through a book...

653
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,670
so fast in my life. I couldn't stop.

654
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,670
That's right. I heard that Gook Doo ran into...

655
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,370
Bong Soon at the police station.

656
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,370
- Pardon?
- The police station?

657
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,700
There you go.

658
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,640
Bong Soon!

659
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,940
- Bong Soon.
- Let's eat.

660
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,940
Get over here.

661
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,640
- What's with you?
- You!

662
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,300
Why were you at the police station?

663
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,470
How did you know about that, Mom?

664
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,800
Gook Doo works at the police station. Of course I'd know.

665
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,570
You troublemaker, why would you go there?

666
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,540
It just happened that way.

667
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,740
Did you beat someone? Did you? Did you?

668
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,000
Listen, Mom. So you see...

669
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,870
Are you crazy? Didn't you hear about my mother?

670
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,070
She beat a man at the marketplace and suffered from diarrhea...

671
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,700
for a month and then got haemorrhoids. How about me?

672
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,870
Mom, I'm fine.

673
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,800
To be honest, I had a lot of similar incidents.

674
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,970
But I'm fine.

675
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,500
- What?
- Mom?

676
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,700
I must be a mutant.

677
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,200
Also, I got hired.

678
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,400
Now, I can let my talent shine.

679
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,540
Bong Soon, I'm hungry.

680
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,470
Oh, Bong Gi is here.

681
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,240
- What are you doing?
- Hey there.

682
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,170
- Are you all right?
- Gosh.

683
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,700
I got too excited for a second. I'm sorry.

684
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,800
Let's go inside.

685
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,400
Mom, taste it.

686
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
Of course.

687
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,870
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

688
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,870
That looks good.

689
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,840
- It's delicious.
- It's good, right?

690
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,840
It's good.

691
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,740
- Hello.
- It's me.

692
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,470
Yes, I know.

693
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,000
I looked into the assault suspects at the redevelopment site.

694
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,400
They're rotten to the core. Don't travel late at night.

695
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,570
Also, carry around a taser.

696
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,670
There is a surplus, so I'll take you one after work.

697
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,940
- All right.
- I'm hanging up.

698
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,600
Gook Doo, I think I got a job.

699
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
See you.

700
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,500
What a jerk.

701
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,740
I know he's really rude,

702
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,040
but I still like him so much.

703
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,240
There she goes again.

704
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,940
Shouldn't we add some laver flakes?

705
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,370
Good idea.

706
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:50,870
Come in.

707
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,000
Hello.

708
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,770
Welcome.

709
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,200
The ceiling won't be collapsing, so take a seat.

710
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
All right.

711
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,500
- Did you bring your resume?
- Yes.

712
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,400
(RESUME)

713
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,800
Have you interviewed for our company before?

714
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,800
Yes, I have.

715
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,040
(QUALIFICATIONS)

716
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,440
What's this? You plan on getting hired with these qualifications?

717
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,770
You're brave.

718
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,940
I applied because it said gender, educational background, and age...

719
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,940
aren't primary factors here.

720
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,600
You're brave. That's for certain.

721
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,670
"Dobong-dong, Dobong-Gu, Do Bong Soon".

722
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,940
Did you move there to match your name with your address?

723
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,670
Then shouldn't everyone in every...

724
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,240
neighborhood share the same name?

725
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,440
I'm sorry. That was a very unfunny joke.

726
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,670
- It was very old-fashioned.
- Got it.

727
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,170
Why did you want to work here?

728
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,540
Because it's a good company.

729
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,670
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

730
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,670
But you must be disappointed it's not the Strategy Department.

731
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,670
A bit.

732
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,670
There's something I'm curious about.

733
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,800
You seem perfectly healthy,

734
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,270
but why are you in need of a bodyguard?

735
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,040
I have enemies everywhere.

736
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,870
But don't be mistaken, I'm not a criminal.

737
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:14,140
Sure, of course. What is the company's incentives...

738
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,500
and pension policy?

739
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,000
It's commensurate with your performance.

740
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,840
We need to know how good you are.

741
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,570
Is there a company dining hall?

742
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,500
- Yes.
- Are there menstrual leaves?

743
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,870
Not at the moment.

744
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,270
That's a pretty poor standard.

745
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,100
The nature of a bodyguard's profession allows for no holidays.

746
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,200
Fine. Then are there stop motions?

747
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:49,940
What are "stop motions"?

748
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,640
Are you unfamiliar with the term?

749
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,570
Do you mean "stock options"?

750
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,170
Oh, yes. That.

751
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:07,400
We'll think about how to award stock options...

752
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,100
for your particular line of work.

753
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,700
How disappointing.

754
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:17,170
Then may I take a look at the contract?

755
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,500
- Let's arm wrestle.
- Excuse me?

756
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,400
I need to see how good you are.

757
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,870
This is your entrance assessment exam. Let's go.

758
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Come on, then.

759
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,240
Arm wrestling?

760
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,170
Give it a shot.

761
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,500
You go.

762
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
My goodness.

763
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,170
You can add the other hand if you like.

764
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
This is ridiculous.

765
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,340
Don't get humiliated because you lost to a woman.

766
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,370
I'm kind of special.

767
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,240
I'd appreciate it if you don't tell anyone about this.

768
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,640
Mr. Gong, please bring in the contract.

769
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,300
Take a seat, please.

770
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,170
(EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT)

771
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,570
60,000 dollars?

772
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,340
- You can write your name down here.
- Okay.

773
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,670
(DO BONG SOON)

774
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,000
When is my first day?

775
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,570
Do you have strong legs as well, too?

776
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,170
Excuse me?

777
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,540
Mr. Gong, try chicken fighting.

778
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,400
With whom? With her, Sir?

779
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,040
- Yes.
- Goodness.

780
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,170
Come on, Sir. I'm an ex-marine.

781
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,970
That's not exactly a fair match.

782
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,040
Just try it.

783
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,800
Stop joking around around, Sir.

784
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,800
Mr. Gong, if you win,

785
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,800
I'll give you my car.

786
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,640
Contenders, please step in.

787
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,540
All right. Ready...

788
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,970
Hold on a moment. Can he put on a helmet?

789
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,700
- What did you say?
- You might hurt your head.

790
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,640
You should probably wear one.

791
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
A helmet?

792
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,270
Then let's order jjajangmyeon.

793
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,970
Three bowls of jjajangmyeon, please.

794
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,840
- Enjoy your meal.
- Excuse me. We need your helmet.

795
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,640
- Come again?
- Give me your helmet.

796
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,540
Please, I insist.

797
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,270
That's for the helmet and the meal.

798
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,370
- Thank you. Enjoy!
- Have a good one.

799
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,570
Don't push it, Sir.

800
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,270
Let's hurry before the noodles get soggy.

801
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,640
Hurry.

802
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,270
Gosh, I can't believe I'm really doing this.

803
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,300
This is a disgrace to my ancestors.

804
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,870
You're really going to give me the car, right?

805
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,500
It'll be yours right away.

806
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,440
On a count of three, get started.

807
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,500
Understood, Sir.

808
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,500
In 1, 2, 3...

809
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,170
- You're not dead, right?
- Are you all right?

810
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:01,570
Oh, thank the divine. You're alive.

811
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,370
- Excuse me...
- Are you all right?

812
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,270
- Come again?
- I'll speak casually now.

813
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,140
I can't be using honorific to my bodyguard.

814
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,840
Sure.

815
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,140
Carry on.

816
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,170
I want to know my exact responsibilities.

817
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,370
Your main responsibility?

818
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,940
It will be to protect me. You must make me unassailable.

819
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,070
I have a favor to ask.

820
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,970
- What is it?
- If by any chance...

821
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:50,570
I do a stellar job,

822
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:54,100
may I transfer to the Strategy Department?

823
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,240
I don't know.

824
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,800
I'm not sure about your abilities in that line of work.

825
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,570
The only proven ability I've been able to see...

826
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,570
is your strength.

827
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:07,770
Well, I'm just asking for a small chance.

828
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,570
Sure, then. I'll give it to you.

829
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,870
But for now, protect me well.

830
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,870
- Understand?
- Yes, Sir.

831
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,770
Tidy things up before you go.

832
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,540
- Report in by 6am tomorrow.
- Yes, Sir.

833
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,640
Since Mr. Gong is injured,

834
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,200
- you'll have to mind the office.
- All right.

835
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,140
- I'll get going.
- See you tomorrow.

836
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,270
Sure.

837
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,940
Gosh, how can he be so informal from the get-go?

838
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,140
I can't believe that jerk is the CEO. What a shame.

839
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:40,640
Gosh, but at least I got hired.

840
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:46,740
Fine. I'll give him a shot.

841
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,670
But he's such a jerk.

842
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,340
I'm going to let it slide because of the high salary.

843
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,170
I'll consider myself duly compensated...

844
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:56,870
for the informality.

845
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,070
It got all soggy.

846
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,940
Why did he make me do that?

847
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,140
"Bodyguard".

848
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,670
(BODYGUARD)

849
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,940
Come outside real quick. I'm out front.

850
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,200
Gook Doo.

851
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:32,940
Gook Doo.

852
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,540
Here.

853
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,400
Is this for me? I'll use it well. Thank you.

854
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,570
What do you mean? You shouldn't have to use it.

855
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,400
Don't ever put yourself in a position to need it.

856
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,870
This doesn't require a possession permit.

857
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:45,640
Don't expect a big voltage. It's meant for self-defence.

858
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,300
- Head back in now.
- You're leaving already?

859
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,440
It's late. Go inside.

860
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,240
Hey, Gook Doo. How is everything going with your girlfriend?

861
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,400
Hi, Hee Ji.

862
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,100
- Is practice over?
- Oh, it's her.

863
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,340
Did you eat? Go back inside.

864
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,400
See you.

865
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,770
Bye, Gook Doo.

866
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,570
Have a good night. Thanks for this.

867
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,810
We have a casualty.

868
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,200
Everyone, attention!

869
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,470
During last night's meeting,

870
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,470
a homicide occurred in our jurisdiction.

871
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:03,200
- What? A homicide, Sir?
- What was that?

872
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,640
- Where?
- Dobong-dong!

873
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,140
What on earth is going on?

874
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,400
Look at the blood.

875
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,800
- It's blood.
- How could this have happened?

876
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,870
- This area used to be safe.
- Tell me about it.

877
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:15,370
- Oh, no.
- Where are you going?

878
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,970
- How can this be?
- It happened there.

879
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:21,240
Hey. Oh, gosh.

880
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,400
Did... Did someone die?

881
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,550
- I said I'm surrounded by enemies.
- Gosh, you startled me.

882
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,320
What is that?

883
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,350
I'm not sure. What could it be?

884
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,320
Well, it's one reason why I hired you.

885
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,580
In the IT world, even the threats are digital.

886
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,250
Funny, right?

887
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,740
Recently, I've been getting stalked and blackmailed.

888
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,110
- By whom?
- If I knew, they'd be detained.

889
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,420
- Then report to the police.
- I don't trust the police.

890
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,320
I will catch them.

891
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,160
- Help me.
- What?

892
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,120
Didn't you say you like games? It'll be thrilling.

893
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,060
Why don't we try catching them like a game? It'll be fun.

894
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:19,990
You said you wanted to join the Strategy Department, so try it.

895
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,990
We must win.

896
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,420
Is this a joke, Sir?

897
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,990
Life is a game, and the biggest game is life.

898
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,520
There is nothing be serious about.

899
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,260
What do you think? Doesn't it sound like a plan?

900
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:37,130
If we catch them, you'll get your transfer.

901
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,990
Your career opportunities will be guaranteed.

902
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,520
What do you say? Are you in?

903
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,960
Last night, at a local Dobong-dong intersection,

904
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,130
- I'm in.
- A homicide incident occurred.

905
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:47,190
The victim is a young 31-year-old female.

906
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,790
An unfortunate detail is that her wedding was approaching...

907
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,490
in two months time.

908
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,290
Currently, there are no suspects and no surveillance footage available.

909
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,920
The lack of any reliable secondary footage...

910
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,790
is hindering police investigations.

911
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,920
The victim was an editor at a local library.

912
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,160
She was on her way home after working late...

913
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,420
(UNKNOWN CALLER)

914
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,820
Do not ignore this warning.

915
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,090
Wait and see what unfolds.

(STRONG GIRL BONG SOON)

918
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:56,490
Someone must be observing us from around here somewhere.

919
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,860
I can't be sure. There might be an explosive.

920
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,820
- You want me to die?
- Then should I die?

921
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,290
I wonder if there's a crazy, rich guy just for her.

922
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,890
Let's just sleep at my house.

923
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,920
- How do I look?
- It's so perfect.

924
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,190
You like that officer, don't you?

925
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,220
She was totally my type.

926
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,060
- He's gay.
- That's all right.

927
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,190
Nobody is perfect these days.

928
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,590
There was another victim.

929
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:16,390
Save me, please.

930
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,990
How dare you come in here?

931
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,460
The culprit has appeared. We need to lock the place down.

932
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,190
I heard the culprit's voice.

933
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,790
He appeared not long after I left the scene.

934
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:25,890
Call an ambulance, now!

935
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,460
He saw Bong Soon's face.

936
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:30,760
I might have super strength, but it's useless right now.

937
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:33,530
Bong Soon, stay with me tonight.

938
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:37,060
My friend Bong Soon is a helpless girl. Let's go.

939
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,560
Leave her be.
