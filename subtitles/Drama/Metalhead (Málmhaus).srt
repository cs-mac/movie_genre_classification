1
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,566
<i>- Come on, Perla! Here!
- Come to me.</i>

2
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,968
Come on, Perla! Here, Perla.

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,489
- When will be our turn?
- In a little while.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,245
- I must go home. It's almost dinnertime.
- I'll stay a little longer.

5
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,127
How am I supposed to get home?
I came with you.

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,605
Okay, let's go.

7
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,845
- It's dinnertime.
- Follow your brother.

8
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,602
- See you tomorrow!
- Goodbye!

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,206
Dinner is ready, Baldur!

10
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,325
Are you going far?

11
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,522
Yes.

12
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,569
I see that you are armed.

13
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,242
Nothing to keep you
here anymore?

14
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,681
Good morning.

15
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,250
Are you going with me this time?
I'm going to town.

16
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,931
I know.

17
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,491
I have written a new song,
but it is not quite finished...

18
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,649
I will play it for you later.

19
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,088
So...

20
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,644
I thought you were going to town.

21
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,771
I missed the bus.

22
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,451
Mom?

23
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,046
Is it cod?

24
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,766
Don't we have 
any haddock?

25
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,526
Here it is.

26
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,966
- Are you going to stay home tonight?
- No.

27
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,130
- What should you do?
- Anything, I don't know.

28
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,121
Why don't you stay home?
There's a good movie on tv.

29
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,846
Why don't you find a boyfriend?

30
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,531
I am lesbian.

31
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,004
There's more on the shelf.

32
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,727
Hello, Lukka.

33
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,369
They should have distilled it better.

34
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,291
Fucking moonshine...

35
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,602
This was funny maybe once,
about five years ago.

36
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,966
But she's an adult now.

37
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,167
When she is sober you may ask her
where the hell she parked the tractor, Karl.

38
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,489
I will need it this afternoon.

39
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,006
Thank you, Einar.

40
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,768
- I was going to introduce myself.
- Welcome.

41
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,250
It's not a large congregation, so
it is important my personal contact.

42
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,763
I heard that both of you
use to sing in the church choir.

43
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,202
Do you enjoy being here? 
Or they sent you...

44
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,369
No, I have no children and I'm not married.

45
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,645
- Want some coffee, something to eat?
- I don't know if I can take more...

46
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,082
I have eaten a lot at Staöur's home.

47
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,327
But I would love to.

48
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,290
- What do you do here on the farm?
- We produce milk.

49
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,406
- And how is it going?
- We can't complain.

50
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,763
- I'll see you on Tuesday.
- Sure.

51
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,643
Where is the tractor?
Where is Einar's tractor?!

52
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,890
- Behind Iadan in Hrauntunga.
- You need to stop that.

53
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,961
There is not a scratch on it.
I can pay the fuel.

54
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,051
- With whose money?
- Nevermind.

55
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,200
- I'll go to town soon.
- You must find something to do!

56
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,087
The winter will start soon, ask
Halldora for a job at the slaughterhouse.

57
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,524
I won't be like her.
I have my own plans!

58
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,964
You cannot live in a dream forever,
Hera Karlsdottir!

59
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,165
<i> Hera, hairnets. </ i></i>

60
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,210
You must wear a hairnet.

61
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,045
Hairnet!

62
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,810
- I haven't found anyone.
- Those are the rules.

63
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,289
- How's Satan doing?
- Go fuck yourself.

64
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,689
And tell your girlfriend
to do the same.

65
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,565
Excuse me, there's a line here!

66
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,130
We missed you.

67
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,964
I'm still with flu, but I'm better now...
He seems to be very nice.

68
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,047
But why he's not married, do you know?

69
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,561
Well, who knows?

70
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,171
Maybe he likes men.

71
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,365
He is certainly more liberal
than the last priest.

72
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,320
- What about Charles?
- What do you mean?

73
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,923
- Is it better with his arthritis?
- Yes...

74
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,203
I mean... he does not complain.

75
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,565
He's not known for doing that.
The strong, silent man...

76
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,965
No. The dryer is in the socket.

77
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,401
I must do something about
 our damn electricity.

78
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,244
Do you have to play so loud?!

79
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,370
You are going to make your mother deaf!

80
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,571
Can you play something...

81
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,126
Happier?

82
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,081
Out. Get out!

83
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,771
- Where are you going?
- We have to be involved with our community.

84
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,360
What about mom?

85
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,926
I'm going with you.

86
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,641
<i>Mercyful Lord...</i>

87
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,406
Sorry.

88
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,368
What are you doing?

89
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,041
It is not allowed to smoke here.

90
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,281
Can you go outside and put it out?
Then you can come back.

91
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,649
Hey. We were not introduced.

92
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,730
Your brother?

93
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,528
I feel so much.
He's in good hands now.

94
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,890
- Is this new?
- Really old.

95
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,970
Teaze, "One Night Stands."

96
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,527
Yeah... I know Teaze.

97
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,050
I will never solve it.

98
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,443
How is school?

99
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,646
It's okay...
Just a semester left.

100
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,482
- And then, what?
- I have not decided yet.

101
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,607
- Haven't you decided it previously?
- I'll look into different possibilities.

102
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,969
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- It's mostly guys here.

103
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,206
A married girl works in the cafeteria.

104
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,724
There's another one in the store. But it is
nothing like that, she just work there.

105
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,091
And what do you listen to? Eurovision-shit?

106
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,926
I really don't care that much about it.

107
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,283
Haven't you listened my mixtape?

108
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,324
Well, I have it in the car.

109
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,769
Let's go dancing tonight?

110
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,089
It's been a long time since I was at the disco.

111
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,931
Not long enough, I think.

112
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,840
- Hey, hello there.
- Hello.

113
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,648
Don't you remember me?
Ena, Sigurdur's wife, from Haugur.

114
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,444
No.

115
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,451
Oh, it's been a long time since I moved.

116
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,691
I remember when you were a baby. I
have even changed your diapers.

117
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,087
That's wonderful.

118
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,561
- Oh look, here's Miss Perfect.
- Hello! Can't believe you're here...

119
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,844
It is funny to see you!
It's like a reunion.

120
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,522
Remember that we were only three kids in our class.
I have twenty-six children in mine.

121
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,806
What are you doing here?
Not starving to save children somewhere?

122
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,606
You haven't changed at all, Hera!

123
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,806
I came home to visit my family,
and then decided to dance!

124
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,643
I have not seen you.
Aren't you living in your town anymore?

125
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,047
Last time we met you were going there.

126
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,490
Shall we dance?

127
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,251
For who?

128
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,644
Will you dance with me?

129
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,251
Not now.

130
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,482
Karl?

131
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,764
Where are you going?

132
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,326
Home.

133
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,726
Watch out!

134
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,402
Wait!

135
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,528
- Why are you following me?
- We're best friends.

136
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,521
And I was getting bored there.
Crappy music. No Rock at all.

137
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,210
I wouldn't mind that.

138
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,726
Ask my dad first.

139
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,411
It's his cow.

140
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,445
Don't go.

141
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,124
- Oh no.
- Why not?

142
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,164
Stop it!

143
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,284
Hey, stop touching my breast!

144
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,840
It was not my intention.

145
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,009
It's just breasts.

146
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,771
They did not explode.

147
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,360
Do you have a condom?

148
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,604
- Have you?
- I was not expecting this.

149
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,122
I can try to...

150
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,891
Does your dad have one?

151
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,886
Fuck it ...

152
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,370
Are you sleeping?

153
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,089
I want to tell you something.
It is not confirmed yet.

154
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,560
He does not want people to know it
until everything is done. But...

155
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,926
Elli on Holtsmüli
asked me to tame his foal, Fluga.

156
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,130
I was there earlier today.
The foal has a very good temperament.

157
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:40,529
Elli dreams to ride it,
but it can also be used for breeding.

158
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,641
The first steps are important.
You must know what you're doing.

159
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,404
Mistakes cannot be undone.

160
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,649
A horse will always remember the errors.

161
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,646
Next summer is the last chance to
tame the foal. And then it will be four years.

162
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,407
Hey, honey.

163
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,282
What keeps you here?

164
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,482
It's time for we to get rid of these
things. They are not going to be used.

165
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,208
- I can make it it a living room.
- A living room?

166
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,042
- Life is not over.
- You have no right to do something.

167
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,289
This room will remain here!

168
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,527
<i>Young musicians caused a wave
of attacks on churches in Norway...</i>

169
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,690
<i>A movement called "Black Metal".</i>

170
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,283
<i>This 500-year-old wooden church 
in Bergen burned down last week.</i>

171
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,770
<i>Another thirteen got the same fate last year.</i>

172
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,331
I would like to see this music banned 
and vanish from the face of the Earth...

173
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,526
and all those who are
 behind it must be arrested.

174
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,361
<i> Pagan symbols
adorning album covers...</i>

175
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,963
<i>from bands like Mayhem, 
Hades and Darkthrone...</i>

176
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,722
<i>their lyrics are difficult to discern,
but contain negative messages.</i>

177
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,324
<i>The priest Sven-Ole Christiansen
speaks about the dangers of this music...</i>

178
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,081
<i>...and leads an organization
that wants to ban it.</i>

179
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,207
<i>- When I first listened that music, it gave 
me a cold shiver, and I thought, "What...</i>

180
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,566
Oatmeal is done!

181
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,491
We have to get out and ...

182
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,124
- Not now, Knütur.
- I need to talk with you.

183
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,330
I bought it last summer before school
began. I've saved it.

184
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,081
- Is this a joke?
- No.

185
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,124
Don't you want to have a look?

186
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,244
I can take care of us...

187
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,250
Can't you see anything?

188
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,329
What?

189
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,125
Damn! Get out! 
What's the matter with you?

190
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,891
Get out, you idiots!

191
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,247
Go away!

192
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,725
You are free!

193
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,128
- I don't understand you anymore.
- What's wrong with your mind?

194
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,564
- You don't have to talk to me like this.
- Yes we do!

195
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,968
You let the cows flee in the middle of winter!

196
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,404
- Can't you just be normal?
- Normal? Like you?

197
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,480
- You don't know what I've been through.
- I don't? Explain then!

198
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,922
It would be easier if she gave a
 chance. Things can't be like this forever.

199
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,726
Has she been difficult 
like this for a long time?

200
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,802
There was never a moment of peace. 
I can't sleep when she's not at home.

201
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,844
What are you afraid might happen?

202
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,404
And what about your life as a couple?
Is everything alright?

203
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,243
That's not the problem.

204
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:18,802
It can be difficult to manage
a loss. Did you get any help?

205
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,083
I mean, based on what happened.

206
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,522
We have some good friends here...

207
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,042
It's just something we've got to live with.

208
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,164
And what about her?

209
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,250
I'm sorry to hear that...

210
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,840
How old was she?

211
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,526
She was twelve.

212
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,283
Hey.

213
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,163
"Shout at the Devil", "Screaming
For Vengeance ". Classics.

214
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,170
You don't understand.

215
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,568
Don't? What's that 
I do not understand?

216
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,447
Church is always saying that these bands 
are related to Satan worshipping and all that stuff.

217
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,564
But if you read their lyrics...

218
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,765
They deal with death and war -
about reality.

219
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,408
They say things about it, 
and not to harp on it.

220
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,124
You could never understand.

221
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,971
What are you doing?

222
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,450
Never judge a person by appearance.

223
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,123
I'm proving that I can be your best friend.

224
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,925
Which bands do you like?

225
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,170
Bands that I like? 
Where should I start?

226
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,562
Iron Maiden, early Leppard,
Diamond Head, Celtic Frost...

227
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,810
I love Venom,
especially as a live band.

228
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,323
Cronos is probably
my favorite frontman.

229
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,002
Now you think that with
the new priest it can be different?

230
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,931
God can also be found in the dark.

231
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:54,491
Jesus did not mind walking with the outsiders. 
He himself was an outsider.

232
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,604
That was why he was crucified.

233
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,760
Most people can't do what Jesus told:
"Accept people as they are".

234
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,611
He is in debt with me.

235
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,486
About your brother?

236
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,725
Wanna talk about it?

237
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,366
What?

238
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,527
I was just wondering 
why you did that.

239
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,323
They say that time heals all wounds.

240
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,970
This is fucking bullshit.

241
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,242
Don't do this, Karl. 
It's up to you.

242
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,571
- We've never talked about what happened...
- Of course we have.

243
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,365
Not sincerely.

244
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,761
I know you think... 
I...

245
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,250
I should have... put protection
of the drive shaft.

246
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,001
I never blamed you.

247
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,524
But I know what you think.

248
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,488
- People have to do a lot of things.
- Yes, too much.

249
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,568
There was so much that summer...

250
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,368
We had purchased the land, and the 
tractor used to break down all the time.

251
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,201
Sometimes I was under
the engine hood all day long.

252
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,650
I can't go on like this.

253
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,843
Hey. I've made a mixtape.

254
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,361
Just a few songs you might like.

255
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,727
See you around.

256
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,320
Did you want 
to come here?

257
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,401
A good song.
Damn, what a long time since I heard it.

258
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,404
The first song from 
"Sad Wings of Destiny".

259
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,651
They helped me get through school. 
I listened a lot of bands at that time.

260
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,766
There was not a day that
 I didn't listen to Priest.

261
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,411
Downing and Tipton are my favorite
guitar duo. And Halford is a god.

262
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,444
A metal god!

263
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,569
Wait... listen to it.

264
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,206
What a song.

265
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,048
Black Sabbath, Purple
and Zeppelin announced it, they made it.

266
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,891
You know your stuff.

267
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,244
It was Baldur's favorite song.

268
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,524
He always listened to it.

269
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,364
You make some of your own music too.

270
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,089
Where have you heard that?
Has my father told you about me?

271
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,646
I'm curious.

272
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,443
Yes.

273
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,362
- Can I hear it?
- It's not finished yet.

274
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,601
- What are you afraid of?
- Afraid? I'm not.

275
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,606
I'm not afraid of anything.

276
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,571
POST SERVICE

277
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,481
<i>What is it that keeps me here?</i>

278
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,847
<i>It does not suit me that well...</i>

279
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,769
<i>Because I'm not one of them
with a spoon shoved up my ass...</i>

280
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,965
<i>Now I'm looking to get my ass out of bed...</i>

281
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,527
<i>They secretly look forward...</i>

282
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,680
<i>peaceful images of the country life...</i>

283
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,965
<i>They want to live a happy life
With no issues to deal with...</i>

284
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,883
<i>They're children of nature,
Armed with their optimism...</i>

285
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,927
<i>Do we want our children to fall asleep?</i>

286
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,722
<i>Farewell, my little Reykjavik!
My city...</i>

287
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,808
<i>With the boots on...</i>

288
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,085
Hey.

289
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,004
Hey.

290
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,602
Wouldn't you ask the lady to come in?

291
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,921
- Am I disturbing you?
- I was going to bed.

292
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:58,002
It's only eleven o' clock.
Age is taking its toll?

293
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,730
Can I help you with something?

294
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,366
I just wanted to meet you.

295
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,330
You're different.

296
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,125
I can talk to you.

297
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,521
- Hold me.
- I can't.

298
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,521
Why not? Because you're a priest?

299
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,525
- You're not Catholic.
- Hera, you have misunderstood...

300
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,368
- I thought...
- I'm terribly sorry if I've...

301
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,847
This time she has gone too far.

302
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,642
Now she went away from town...

303
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,004
It's time for us to move on.

304
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,050
I have to let go of him.

305
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,285
Yes.

306
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,651
It will be good...

307
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,320
Baldur...

308
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,051
It's the community meeting.

309
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,364
We have decided not to publicly
reveal how the fire started.

310
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,043
The congregation will say
that it was an accident.

311
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,084
We're doing this as a sign 
of respect for your parents.

312
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,964
I will help with the funding.

313
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,404
Since we live together now,
it is the right thing to do.

314
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,002
It's not necessary. I'll do this myself.

315
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,649
You cannot do it alone.

316
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,650
Well, if it takes the rest of their lives.

317
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,368
Everyone knows what you and your family
have been through -

318
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:22,601
...so we've decided to help
and build a new church together.

319
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,443
Take it, dad.

320
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:40,290
That's for you. It is a 
housewarming gift, you might say.

321
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,165
What is it?

322
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:49,003
I know you don't wanna change anything,
but we use one of those back in school.

323
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:54,251
It's good to be able to make sandwiches
or heat up leftovers.

324
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,968
It is a microwave.

325
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,003
Thank you.

326
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,291
I'll put it to use.

327
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,244
Are you sure that is it fresh?

328
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,284
Sure, we got it yesterday.

329
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,081
Hello, dear.

330
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,402
Hello? Yes...

331
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:30,002
- Hera, a phone call for you.
- For me?

332
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,001
Hello?

333
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,365
<i>- Some foreigners are here asking for you.
- Foreigners?</i>

334
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:01,531
- Hera Karlsdottir?
- Yes.

335
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,328
Hi, I'm Øystein.
This is Yngve and Pål Ole.

336
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:14,007
We heard your music. We got ahold of
a copy of your tape in Oslo.

337
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,442
- We want to release it at our label.
- It's a small one but...

338
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,009
- Your sound is unique.
- But that was just a demo.

339
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:28,605
It is the most evil and brutal music
I have heard. Your band is incredible!

340
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:33,282
Band? There... I did it
on my own. It's just me.

341
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,569
- How did you get here?
- We arrived by boat Norröna.

342
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,241
- The day before yesterday.
- It took us four days.

343
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,806
Take it for you.

344
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,080
Was it bad weather?

345
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:00,843
I was damn seasick the whole way.
I'm not used to it.

346
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,330
We took the express bus
from Eskifjördur to Reykjavik.

347
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:12,402
It was a misunderstanding, and we
did not know it took so long.

348
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:26,249
- How much milk do you produce per year?
- A cow yields about 6,000 liters per year.

349
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,046
What is it that hangs 
around the udders?

350
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,640
A bra.

351
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,967
How many animals do you have?

352
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,690
Your hair looks beautiful that way.
Now I can see more of your face.

353
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,290
Thank you.

354
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,925
You have changed.

355
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,609
But you probably know what you're doing.

356
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,970
Yes.

357
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,369
- That's what's important.
- I thought you'd be happy.

358
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,529
It's not about what I want.

359
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:37,044
Hey, come on and please help us.
There's no reason to be shy.

360
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,008
How is it going?

361
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,283
What? Did you forget something?

362
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,250
I am so incredibly sorry.

363
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:33,562
Knütur, can I talk to you?
I need to say a couple of things.

364
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:40,207
- What is it?
- I just want to explain.

365
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,324
Explain then. Is that so hard?

366
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,523
Should we really listen to that?

367
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:11,369
I never wanted to play in a band, but
 I sold my horse to buy a drum kit.

368
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:16,202
<i>I always liked you and supported
all of your weird ideas.</i>

369
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:22,487
- You kissed me on the hill at school!
- Knütur, we were eleven years old.

370
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,686
You have never for one second
thought about how I feel.

371
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,522
It must be awesome to be so tough
and always know exactly what to do.

372
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,610
- It must be amazing.
- I'm not that tough.

373
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,567
- I changed me for your sake!
- I haven't asked you to do that.

374
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:54,240
I hate Dio. I can't support him...

375
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,728
"Holy Diver"? What the hell does that mean?

376
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,607
You must also have known that.
We have not been honest with each other.

377
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,931
I was just expecting...

378
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,521
You are my best friend and I love you.

379
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,690
But not the way I do

380
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,201
I'm sorry...

381
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,407
Get out!

382
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:13,409
- You got a pick?
- Yes, it's in my pocket.

383
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:19,766
- Wait in the car, I'll be right back.
- Bye. And thanks again for the dinner.

384
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,881
Are you tense? Of course you are.
Your first big concert!

385
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,970
There is no concert. 
We'll play only two songs.

386
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,085
- Want a ride, crazy one?
- No, thank you.

387
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,327
It must be nerve-wracking.

388
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:51,571
What do you say?
I'm getting really nervous.

389
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,046
It's too loud!

390
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,090
<i>Flesh and blood</i>

391
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,647
<i>To earth you shall return</i>

392
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:53,323
- We can't hear you singing!
- Play something Icelandic!

393
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,684
<i>Flesh and Blood</i>

394
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,725
<i>To earth you shall return</i>

395
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,170
<i>Courage of a warrior</i>

396
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,523
<i>Anything shall burn</i>

397
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,764
<i>The scorched earth</i>

398
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,850
<i>Devouring our best</i>

399
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,289
<i>The scorched earth</i>

400
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:38,088
<i>Always killing everything</i>

401
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,084
<i>My pain</i>

402
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,921
<i>It drains my soul</i>

403
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,809
<i>Plagued defeat</i>

404
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,289
<i>Black sands of Iden</i>

405
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,288
<i>As far as the my can see</i>

406
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,882
<i>Lacerated all land</i>

407
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,003
<i>As far as the my can see</i>

408
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,523
<i>There shall be no end...</i>

409
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:54,610
Every detail is reminiscent of him,
about how it could have been.

410
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,889
But life must go on.

411
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,801
You can't wallow in grief
forever, it will eat it up.

412
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,648
I can't.

413
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,364
Certainly we can.

414
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:09,127
