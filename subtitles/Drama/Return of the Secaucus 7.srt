1
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:09,645
Open the door, you stupid motherfucker!
Open the fuckin' door!

2
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,807
I had the fuckin' keys, Stan!

3
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,408
This is faster.

4
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,094
I need it.

5
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:20,934
Relax, you'll get it.

6
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:22,329
I need it so bad.

7
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:24,485
Get the fuckin' door, Johnny!

8
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:25,844
Come on!

9
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,775
No! Honey, don't you
dare go down there!

10
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:39,694
Yes, it's Osman's Drug
at 7th and Burdoch.

11
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:45,806
What the fuck! I thought you
knew where the good stuff was!

12
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,965
He always keeps
it right in here!

13
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:51,725
Shit!

14
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,728
I'm gonna count to three.

15
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:55,850
Or?

16
00:02:56,935 --> 00:03:00,086
Or my wife will be mopping up
your blood tomorrow morning.

17
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:01,528
Yeah, Pops?

18
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,926
You'd shoot your little boy?
With that big gun..

19
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,333
you'd shoot and kill
little Johnny D.?

20
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:17,010
You ain't gonna shoot
your little boy!

21
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,325
- Shut up!
- You shut the fuck up!

22
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,690
And help Johnny D.
Find the good shit!

23
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:23,451
Cops!

24
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:24,854
No, don't!

25
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:29,974
No, don't!

26
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:31,654
I live here!

27
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,727
Do you want to fuck around?

28
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,767
Come on, you motherfucker!

29
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:03,528
You want to play with me?
Let's do it!

30
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:52,648
Did you find any?

31
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:54,090
What?

32
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,489
Let's go.

33
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:13,730
Come on!

34
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,290
Sit down!

35
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,486
Sit down, you ugly bitch!

36
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,167
Put her in the chair.

37
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,325
You're not only ugly,
you're stupid, too.

38
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:37,293
Get smart with me and
I'll rip your face off!

39
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,443
Now then..

40
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,173
what's your name?

41
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,973
- Maggie.
- Full name.

42
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:46,649
Blowjob.

43
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,288
Maggie Blowjob.

44
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,892
Go ahead. Grin away.

45
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:08,091
We'll put you on Death Row,
you'll lose that grin real quick.

46
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:09,690
Here.

47
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:13,126
Sign that. I don't have any
more time for your bullshit.

48
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,008
Can I have a pencil?

49
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,483
Having been found guilty
of the crime of murder..

50
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:47,205
 it is the judgment of this court that you
be sentenced to die by lethal injection.

51
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:50,932
You are hereby remanded to the
federal prison in Pleasanton..

52
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:54,371
 where you shall remain until
your sentence is carried out.

53
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,131
And may God have
mercy on your soul.

54
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:02,014
Motherfuckers!

55
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:32,123
No.. no!

56
00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:35,806
Please wait for my mom!

57
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:40,253
Wait, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

58
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:43,846
Wait till my mommy comes!

59
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,608
Wait for her!

60
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,485
You've got to tell my mom!
My mom will come and get me!

61
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:55,884
Mommy!

62
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:02,890
Hi.

63
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:04,804
I'm Bob.

64
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,489
Is that "Maggie" short
for "Margaret"?

65
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,525
Mister, what is this place?

66
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,450
Where am I?

67
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:23,532
You're dead. At least, that's
what everybody thinks.

68
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:29,574
Your funeral.

69
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,485
We staged it Saturday afternoon.

70
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,574
You're buried here.
Oakmont Cemetery.

71
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,328
Plot 48, row 12.

72
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:46,733
- There's your father.
- Didn't my mother come?

73
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:49,527
No, your mother, she..

74
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:59,045
You know you can't get out.

75
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:07,126
I work for some people.

76
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:10,164
"The government,"
let's call them.

77
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,843
We've decided to give
you another chance.

78
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:20,293
Is that about me?

79
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,328
Yes, it is.

80
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:38,693
You know a lot about me.

81
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,130
We do.

82
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,410
So..

83
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,611
you're gonna give
me this chance?

84
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,528
What do I gotta do?

85
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:51,694
Learn, Maggie.

86
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,892
Learn to speak properly, learn to
stand up straight, for a start.

87
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:57,535
Learn languages,
computers, and so on.

88
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,894
Do something to help your
country, for a change.

89
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,487
What if I'm not interested?

90
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,689
Row 48..

91
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,808
plot 12.

92
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,763
Can I think about it?

93
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:29,085
Yeah, why don't you
think about it?

94
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:31,848
You've got one hour.

95
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,846
Stupid fucking asshole!

96
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,253
Come on, up! Up!

97
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:16,014
Which way is out?

98
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,169
This way.

99
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:25,370
- Who are these assholes?
- Just people who work here. It's okay.

100
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:29,452
Put it down. There's no problem.
Just go back to your desks.

101
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,605
Bullshit! Everything's fucked!

102
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,884
Come on. You know you
can't get away with this.

103
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:36,010
Put it away!

104
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:37,608
Get back to the wall.

105
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,287
Everything's under control.

106
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:44,328
- Open it!
- I can't!

107
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:47,524
- Open the fucking door!
- I can't.

108
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,731
- Tell them to do it!
- They won't.

109
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:53,451
I'll blow his
fucking brains out!

110
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:55,213
They still won't do it.

111
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,168
Just give me the gun.

112
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:03,929
Good girl.

113
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,053
Just put it down.

114
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:08,534
Come on, Maggie.

115
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,044
You're too smart to
fight these odds.

116
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:13,210
It's okay.

117
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:14,887
It's okay. Put it down.

118
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,768
Rule number one:

119
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:27,126
Never chamber the first round.

120
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,965
That'll slow you
down for a while..

121
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,413
 "Maggie for Margaret."

122
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,130
So?

123
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:08,086
What's it to be, yes or no?

124
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:12,889
What if I said I have a couple of
questions & that I need some more time?

125
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:14,727
What if I said there
is no more time?

126
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:17,773
What if I said you can kiss
my ass right in the crack?

127
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,205
What's it gonna be, yes or no?

128
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:32,129
I'm gonna have a few
things that I'll need.

129
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,287
I'm gonna need some stuff.

130
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,374
I need some music.

131
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:40,489
Some good music.

132
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:42,966
I'm gonna want some Nina Simone.

133
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:45,894
Nina Simone.

134
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:50,648
Yeah, and..

135
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:53,885
I want some more pain killers.

136
00:14:57,415 --> 00:14:59,371
My leg is fuckin' killing me.

137
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:09,084
Is that it?

138
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,808
I'll make a list.

139
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:14,168
You do that, Maggie.

140
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,967
Bet your fuckin' ass.

141
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:28,244
We're gonna start with a
simple program first.

142
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:31,805
This is just like a typewriter keyboard.
You got letters here..

143
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:34,170
numbers here. Return, okay?

144
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:36,531
Tab.. Wait, wait, wait.

145
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,374
This is a mouse.

146
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:41,527
You use this to write with, draw, save..
Things like that.

147
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:44,652
See the roller? Roll that
around and watch the screen.

148
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,089
Good, good.

149
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:47,850
Wait!

150
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,210
Wait, wait. Real easy, okay?

151
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,887
Real easy. Like that. Now move the
arrow down to where it says, "Play."

152
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:57,973
Right here, click once.

153
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,846
Pay attention, Maggie.

154
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,488
- Can we make the dinosaur eat him?
- You want to make the dinosaur eat him?

155
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,848
Very good, very good.

156
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,891
Feel a little bit more relaxed.

157
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:25,450
You.

158
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:28,568
I can't. My leg hurts.

159
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,489
That's okay. We're just working on reflexes.
It'll be easy. Come on.

160
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:44,973
I've taken my guard. See
if you can hit my face.

161
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:50,373
Hit me. Come on, hit me.

162
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,452
Hit me. Hit me. Come on.

163
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:37,845
Always smile when you
enter a room, dear.

164
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:41,530
It relaxes others, and it lifts
the features of the face.

165
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:54,727
You know what "Nature's
first green is gold" means?

166
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:58,890
"Nature's first green is gold."

167
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,965
It means that the
first is best..

168
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:08,330
that youth is better
than old age.

169
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:15,930
You have the gift of youth.
That is what we'll build on.

170
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:24,332
It's charming, my dear, but
it doesn't address my point.

171
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:30,254
Put the gum here.

172
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,649
That's better.

173
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:49,929
Sit down.

174
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,772
Are you an ugly duckling..

175
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:05,449
or a swan?

176
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,130
Because the choice
is yours, you know.

177
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,531
Belief is half of being.

178
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,853
It's a fancy way of saying, if
you believe you're pretty..

179
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,732
then you will be pretty.

180
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,174
You'll see.

181
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:28,210
What do you do when you're
most uncomfortable?

182
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,411
When you're angry or scared?

183
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,604
I hit.

184
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:35,566
You might want to try smiling.

185
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,964
Just smile a little smile and..

186
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:42,409
say something offhand. It doesn't
have to fit the situation, really.

187
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:44,810
Say..

188
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:50,047
Say, "I never did mind
about the little things."

189
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:58,210
Say it!

190
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,928
Please, dear.

191
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,411
A smile, and the sentence.

192
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,486
"I never did mind.."

193
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,487
"I never did mind.."

194
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,850
"..about the little things."

195
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,847
Chin up. Shoulders back.

196
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:34,165
Have some pride in yourself.

197
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:35,884
Show me.

198
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,209
Yes, Maggie.

199
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,728
Better. Good.

200
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,772
"I lie down for a nap today.

201
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:42,811
"Yesterday I lay
down for a nap."

202
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,568
"If something unfortunate
happens, I feel bad.."

203
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:46,644
Louder, please.

204
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:50,205
"I feel 'bad' about it, not
'badly.' 'Bad' is an adjective.

205
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,886
"Remember to say, 'It is a secret
between her and me.' Not, 'she and I."'

206
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:14,894
Turn it down, will you?
Please, turn it down.

207
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:19,208
People are beginning to complain. Why
don't you use the headset I got you?

208
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:20,893
'Cause they're crappy.

209
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,014
You know, you..

210
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:36,607
This is Nina Simone.

211
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:40,566
You got it for me, remember?

212
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,046
She wants sugar in her bowl?

213
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:47,613
No, she's saying:

214
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:52,247
"Baby, just stick it in me twice a
day, and I'll do anything for you."

215
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,130
"I'll lick the
ground you walk on."

216
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,887
Why do you talk so dirty?

217
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,647
Why do you talk so faggy?

218
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:06,247
So, how is it going?

219
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:10,691
Man, I'm so majorly bored.

220
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:16,008
Think I'm going crazy. Started talking
to myself and all kinds of stuff.

221
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,168
Your reports are excellent.

222
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,449
All right!

223
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:24,248
So, do I get a reward or something?
It's my birthday next week.

224
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,051
Why don't you let me go outside?

225
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:29,688
Just for one night?

226
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:32,333
You can have me followed.

227
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:37,370
Please!

228
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:38,968
I can't. Okay?

229
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:46,534
Look, Maggie..

230
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:49,814
I know how you feel.

231
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,613
- Bullshit!
- Yes, I do.

232
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:53,925
I used to be a recruit myself.

233
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,286
I used to be where you are now.

234
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:59,293
And, just like you, I
hated every moment of it.

235
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,647
So you understand.

236
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,003
I'm going stir-crazy. Please!
Just let me go out for a walk.

237
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:09,728
I said I can't.

238
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,693
That's it. Okay?

239
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,891
I want to go for a walk!

240
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,169
Girl number five?

241
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,894
Take out the bad guys. Do
not shoot the good guys.

242
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,045
You got two seconds
for each target.

243
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:34,284
Understand?

244
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:35,928
Ready, set..

245
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:37,454
and go.

246
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,294
What was that?

247
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:57,287
- Fun.
- Yeah, right.

248
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,447
What is it with you?

249
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:04,170
Eating should be
graceful, yet natural.

250
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:07,772
If you get a bone in your mouth,
take it out with your fingers..

251
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,652
and put it on the
edge of your plate.

252
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:11,965
No fake middle-class delicacy.

253
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,564
No hiding the bone
behind a napkin.

254
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,690
Today we'll start
with the entrée.

255
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,603
Let's begin.

256
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:53,570
Bone!

257
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,568
May I be excused?

258
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:13,209
You've done better.

259
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:17,447
She's a pain, but I can bring her around.
She's got great potential.

260
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:21,325
I like her potential, too. She
has some mighty nice potential.

261
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:24,804
So, bottom-line me
about this girl.

262
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:28,093
We need a young female operative.
I think she's the one.

263
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:30,735
Usually, it takes two years.
In this case..

264
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:32,089
Six months.

265
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:35,772
That's right. I don't want to
see any more attitude from her.

266
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:40,007
Enough with this crap. She bites, she
kicks, she throws food.. what is that?

267
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:41,934
So, you got it?

268
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:46,486
Six months. I want immediate results
or she gets a bullet in the brain.

269
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:06,844
Turn it off.

270
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:13,013
Ask me why I'm so serious.

271
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,254
Why are you so serious?

272
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:18,884
Because I've got serious stuff to
tell you, "Maggie for Margaret."

273
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:22,567
First, the good stuff.

274
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,734
Happy birthday.

275
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:50,091
Okay, now the bad stuff.

276
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,044
Kaufman has drawn a
line in the sand.

277
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:56,173
He says he's not gonna take
any more crap from you.

278
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:59,207
He mentioned the word "bullet"
and the word "brain."

279
00:26:59,295 --> 00:27:02,128
You hearing me? Is
this going in, Maggie?

280
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:05,293
Because I want you to know,
it's now out of my hands.

281
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:21,929
Happy birthday.

282
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,054
Will you help me?

283
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,292
Of course. Come upstairs.

284
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:57,644
All you need is balance. We have
to find your feminine strength.

285
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:00,965
Some moon to go with your sun.

286
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:04,243
A bit of the poet to
balance the warrior.

287
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:29,205
Don't you want to
carry your jacket?

288
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:31,126
Surely not just for
a dinner lesson.

289
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:32,489
What's worth doing..

290
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:35,692
is worth doing well.
- You've mentioned that before.

291
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:38,335
Et tu as pris longtemps
pour I'apprendre, ma chère.

292
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:41,293
J'ai pensé me le faire
tatouer sur le bras.

293
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:42,734
Very good!

294
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:46,489
You look..

295
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:48,009
beautiful.

296
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:53,213
You've really outdone
yourself this time.

297
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,005
Yes, about this
one, I am pleased.

298
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:59,246
Then why do I have to have another
dinner lesson after six months?

299
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:03,453
Or are you afraid I'll revert and
put my feet back up on the table?

300
00:29:04,015 --> 00:29:05,289
I think that..

301
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,004
tonight we should
have dinner out.

302
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:12,290
Really?

303
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,254
Thank you!

304
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,854
Shall we go?

305
00:30:47,255 --> 00:30:50,088
Good evening. Would you
like to see the wine list?

306
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:53,053
No, thanks. Just a bottle
of Dom Perignon, please.

307
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:54,363
Very good, sir.

308
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:58,004
Thank you.

309
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,047
Don't open it yet.

310
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:19,814
That's fine.

311
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:41,130
More than you can
possibly imagine..

312
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:43,851
I wish you every good thing.

313
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:01,044
It's loaded.

314
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:03,885
I don't understand.

315
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:07,126
A lady and two men are sitting
behind you on the balcony.

316
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:10,092
The man on the right is a VIP.

317
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,372
The other one's his bodyguard.

318
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:16,525
I want you to put two bullets in
the VIP.. two bullets minimum.

319
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:18,887
Then go to the men's room.

320
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,650
In the last stall there's a small
window that leads to a courtyard.

321
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,885
There will be a car
waiting for you.

322
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,286
Don't do anything till I leave.

323
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,771
You've got three minutes, okay?

324
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,007
It was bricked in.

325
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:46,812
The window was all bricked in.

326
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:48,726
Yes, of course it was.

327
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:51,287
That was your final test.

328
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:54,648
Motherfucker!

329
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:00,806
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Son of a bitch!

330
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:02,647
You get out tomorrow!

331
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:06,087
You get out tomorrow.

332
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:10,613
That was your last test.
You get out tomorrow.

333
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,166
I'm really gonna miss you.

334
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:36,644
You know that.

335
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,252
I'll never kiss you again.

336
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,529
What level of operation
is she ready for?

337
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,045
S-1.

338
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:24,894
Ambitious as ever.

339
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:28,529
Don't sit down.

340
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:31,933
I need her ready by March.

341
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,687
You're gonna love this.

342
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:38,164
A woman goes into a bar
with a duck under her arm.

343
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:41,804
She orders a few beers. Bartender says,
"What're you doing with that pig?"

344
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:45,729
She says, "This is a duck." He
says, "I was talking to the duck."

345
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:48,773
I was talking to the duck!

346
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:52,407
I think you're dangerous.

347
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:57,852
A real loose cannon. If it was up to me
we'd put you down, so make no mistakes.

348
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:02,414
I'm telling you, if you cross on
a red light, you are worm bait.

349
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,410
Entiende?

350
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:08,890
'Bye.

351
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:16,933
I was talking to the duck.

352
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:21,932
Your name's Claudia Doran. You're from
Chicago. You live in Venice, California.

353
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:25,451
You're a computer expert for Super Mac.
You travel a lot.

354
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:29,452
Here's your passport, driver's
license, birth certificate.

355
00:39:30,255 --> 00:39:32,894
There's cash in here to
buy yourself a new car.

356
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:36,006
Your code name is Nina.

357
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:40,687
As in Nina Simone?

358
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:45,850
Yeah.

359
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,374
I'm scared.

360
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:48,730
You?

361
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,013
That'll be the day.

362
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:56,770
Go on.

363
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,529
I warned you.

364
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:50,247
It needs a lot of work!

365
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:54,487
That's not a urine stain.

366
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:56,969
It's fully..

367
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:03,366
Actually, there's another one
that's closer to being done.

368
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:23,923
I'll take it.

369
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,170
All right.

370
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,769
Here's your..

371
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:07,210
ravioli.

372
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:10,373
And your ravioli.

373
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:12,729
And your..

374
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:15,051
oh, my goodness, it's ravioli.

375
00:44:15,615 --> 00:44:16,650
Thanks.

376
00:44:17,735 --> 00:44:21,045
Cammie Swiss Cake Rolls. Now
that sounds nutritious.

377
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:26,807
Sorry. I suppose it's embarrassing to have
some fool pawing through your food.

378
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:30,089
Don't worry about it. I
don't get embarrassed.

379
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:31,888
What do you mean?

380
00:44:32,455 --> 00:44:34,013
Just, nothing embarrasses me.

381
00:44:34,095 --> 00:44:35,289
You mean, ever?

382
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:42,573
That's great! You'll have
to teach me that trick.

383
00:44:46,175 --> 00:44:47,528
Where're you from?

384
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,885
- It's not a trick question.
- Chicago.

385
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:54,328
I'm from Denver.

386
00:44:55,295 --> 00:44:58,332
So I know you're from Chicago,
and you love ravioli.

387
00:44:59,055 --> 00:45:00,249
That's a start.

388
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:07,043
So how does someone get
to know you better?

389
00:45:08,855 --> 00:45:10,447
For you, it'd be easy.

390
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,645
Then have dinner
with me tonight.

391
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:15,530
Okay.

392
00:45:16,015 --> 00:45:17,368
Let me guess..

393
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:19,050
Ravioli?

394
00:45:20,615 --> 00:45:21,684
It's a deal.

395
00:45:22,615 --> 00:45:25,209
All I have to do is show any
apartment that's vacant..

396
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:28,093
change some light bulbs, sweep
the stairs once a week..

397
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,325
pick up rent checks. For that..

398
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,487
half off my own rent.

399
00:45:32,655 --> 00:45:35,772
Mostly what I do, though,
is work on my portfolio.

400
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:37,688
I'm a photographer.

401
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,526
I take some good
stuff sometimes.

402
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:44,244
I've sold to some galleries.
Weston and Levinson's, you know?

403
00:45:45,135 --> 00:45:47,968
All day, though, all
I do is run around..

404
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:50,886
and just take care of stuff.

405
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:02,486
You really like ravioli, huh?

406
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:37,046
I usually make the first move.

407
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:40,294
This is fine, too.

408
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:36,889
This is hard.

409
00:48:37,055 --> 00:48:38,568
Shut up and finish it.

410
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:41,608
- It's hard as hell.
- Shut up and finish it.

411
00:48:41,935 --> 00:48:43,414
Let's go out, get a hamburger..

412
00:48:43,495 --> 00:48:45,326
Shut up and finish it.

413
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:49,693
I'll call Ned and Karen and
see if they want to come.

414
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:51,610
Sure.

415
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:55,408
You don't really like
them much, do you?

416
00:48:56,655 --> 00:48:57,804
They're okay.

417
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:02,769
Why don't you ask
somebody sometime?

418
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,524
Like who?

419
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:05,849
I don't know.

420
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:10,169
A friend. One of your buddies.
Somebody you like to hang around with.

421
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:13,527
You haven't had one person in
this place in four months.

422
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:15,364
I know.

423
00:49:15,575 --> 00:49:16,803
Not one.

424
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:20,573
'Cause I want only you.

425
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,649
You're so guarded.

426
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:25,009
I'm not guarded.

427
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,051
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

428
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:29,724
You're like living with a ghost.

429
00:49:30,455 --> 00:49:32,286
You never tell me anything.

430
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:37,293
All right. So, then..

431
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:40,286
what do you want to know?

432
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:46,003
I don't know. I want to know what
your fifth-grade teacher was like.

433
00:49:46,455 --> 00:49:50,130
I want to know if this pretty face
had pimples on it in high school.

434
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,685
I want to meet your
friends from work.

435
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:57,654
I want to know why you listen to Nina
Simone when you're in a bad mood.

436
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:12,169
Forget it.

437
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:38,771
My mother loved Nina Simone.

438
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:44,163
She used to play her
records all the time.

439
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:51,289
I grew up listening
to this music.

440
00:50:52,335 --> 00:50:53,290
It..

441
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:57,168
sounded so..

442
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,408
passionate..

443
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:02,648
so savage.

444
00:51:06,575 --> 00:51:08,531
All about love and loss.

445
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:16,573
I play Nina Simone when I
think about my mother.

446
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,328
- Hello?
- Nina?

447
00:51:53,935 --> 00:51:56,165
J.W. Marriott in Century City.

448
00:51:56,335 --> 00:51:58,565
Personnel entrance. One hour.

449
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:01,004
All right.

450
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:03,244
'Bye.

451
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,083
Who's that?

452
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:10,853
I'm about to lose a sale
on 500 video cards.

453
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:14,049
I gotta go all the
way to El Segundo.

454
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,204
Hurry back.

455
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:21,204
I will.

456
00:52:48,215 --> 00:52:49,330
Excuse me.

457
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:52,609
What do I do?

458
00:52:57,455 --> 00:52:58,570
Change.

459
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:17,690
Now what?

460
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,848
Now we wait.

461
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,407
Testing, one.. two.. three.

462
00:53:24,655 --> 00:53:26,407
Testing, one.. two.. three.

463
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:53,612
Good morning. Room service.

464
00:53:55,495 --> 00:53:59,329
Certainly. About 15 minutes. Yes, sir.
Thank you for calling.

465
00:54:19,535 --> 00:54:22,254
- What do I do?
- Take this tray where I tell you.

466
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:23,849
- Then?
- Nothing.

467
00:54:23,935 --> 00:54:27,974
You take the tray up, give him the
tray and you come back down here.

468
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,933
That too much for you?

469
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:22,730
Thanks.

470
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:30,728
Now what do I do?

471
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:32,803
Go home.

472
00:55:33,215 --> 00:55:34,330
That's it?

473
00:56:38,455 --> 00:56:39,410
So?

474
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:41,289
How are you?

475
00:56:41,895 --> 00:56:44,534
I just blew up a hotel. How
the hell do you think I am?

476
00:56:44,615 --> 00:56:48,369
Everybody at headquarters,
especially Kaufman, is very happy.

477
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,685
I just thought you'd
like to know that.

478
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:52,003
Fabulous.

479
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:55,490
So, I hear you've met somebody.

480
00:56:58,975 --> 00:57:00,203
What's he like?

481
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:03,527
He's really great.

482
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:06,090
I never would've met him
if it hadn't been for you.

483
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:07,608
I have to meet him.

484
00:57:07,695 --> 00:57:08,605
What?

485
00:57:08,695 --> 00:57:11,163
Yeah. It's just a
routine checkup.

486
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:17,333
- I can't.
- Just invite me to dinner, okay?

487
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:20,210
No.

488
00:57:21,935 --> 00:57:23,607
Just invite me to dinner.

489
00:57:28,295 --> 00:57:29,444
Uncle Bob!

490
00:57:29,935 --> 00:57:31,368
You must be J.P.

491
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:33,128
You shouldn't.

492
00:57:34,775 --> 00:57:36,049
You should've.

493
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:37,170
Come on.

494
00:57:39,295 --> 00:57:43,368
It's such a pleasure to meet you.
I haven't met any of her family.

495
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:45,610
Claudia.

496
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:49,893
Long time no see.

497
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:51,614
Uncle Bob.

498
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:54,404
You look..

499
00:57:54,535 --> 00:57:56,491
great! Really great!

500
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,004
Thanks.

501
00:58:00,335 --> 00:58:02,565
- Can we get you..
- Something to drink?

502
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,811
Scotch. Scotch would be nice.

503
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:09,130
Here. These are from Uncle Bob.

504
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:10,484
Great!

505
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:13,446
She looks really beautiful.

506
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:15,931
Must be something
to do with you.

507
00:58:16,015 --> 00:58:17,050
It is.

508
00:58:19,615 --> 00:58:22,129
You know, you're older
than I thought.

509
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:26,767
I bet you're not the youngest
photographer in town.

510
00:58:28,015 --> 00:58:29,334
That's true.

511
00:58:29,615 --> 00:58:33,085
But the other guys are just out of
high school.They have no experience.

512
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:36,645
He may not be the youngest, but
he's certainly the cutest.

513
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:41,450
So..

514
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:44,492
How old are you, Uncle Bob?

515
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:45,924
I'm..

516
00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:48,170
37.

517
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,532
So that makes you..

518
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:52,884
Thirteen years older.

519
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:56,411
It's funny. The other day I was
reading something, it was really..

520
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:59,726
It's actually closer to 14. Her
birthday's in three months.

521
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:02,205
What exactly is
your point, P.J.?

522
00:59:02,295 --> 00:59:03,364
J.P.

523
00:59:03,495 --> 00:59:04,644
You guys!

524
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:06,003
Wait a minute.

525
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:10,407
Easy. Why don't you just arm-wrestle
right now and get it over with?

526
00:59:17,615 --> 00:59:19,287
What was she like as a child?

527
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:23,414
I ask her all the time. She never talks
about herself. No details, nothing.

528
00:59:23,495 --> 00:59:25,167
- Let me see.
- What?

529
00:59:27,535 --> 00:59:31,528
He just wanted to know what you
were like when you were a little girl.

530
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:33,808
You promised.

531
00:59:35,015 --> 00:59:37,848
- She hates questions.
- Do I ask you questions?

532
00:59:38,055 --> 00:59:39,773
No, I wish you would, though.

533
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:42,415
- Can't we just drop it?
- Not this time.

534
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,931
Don't you fucking get it? I
don't want to talk about it!

535
00:59:46,335 --> 00:59:50,453
I didn't drag my ass from the gutter
in Kansas City to take shit from you!

536
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:17,606
I thought you were from Chicago.

537
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:21,574
Kansas City.

538
01:00:22,095 --> 01:00:25,292
She was born in Kansas City
but raised in Chicago.

539
01:00:26,735 --> 01:00:30,011
I used to see her during the
summers on my uncle's farm.

540
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,207
You didn't know she spent
summers on a farm, did you?

541
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,134
Well, she did.

542
01:00:39,495 --> 01:00:41,167
I remember one summer..

543
01:00:41,935 --> 01:00:43,368
the local kids..

544
01:00:44,655 --> 01:00:47,169
the kids' family
owned this mare.

545
01:00:47,575 --> 01:00:48,724
She was..

546
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:53,207
black as a raven's wing, completely wild.
Remember? They called her Beauty.

547
01:00:54,775 --> 01:00:58,324
She was trained as a trotter, but
she'd never really been ridden.

548
01:00:58,415 --> 01:00:59,530
Anyway..

549
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:02,965
The kids told Claudia that
she had to ride Beauty..

550
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:07,854
that it was like an initiation, a
kind of thing they all had to do.

551
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:10,366
Anyway, one day, I remember..

552
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:11,889
about noon..

553
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:14,326
it was really, really hot.

554
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,488
We heard this scream.

555
01:01:17,495 --> 01:01:19,008
We ran outside.

556
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,654
There was Claudia.

557
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:23,684
Claudia..

558
01:01:24,295 --> 01:01:26,411
bareback on this wild horse.

559
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:30,493
The horse went completely crazy.
Bucked, reared.

560
01:01:31,575 --> 01:01:32,894
She hung on.

561
01:01:33,535 --> 01:01:36,333
She just gritted her
teeth, dug her heels in..

562
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:38,854
and she hung on.

563
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,525
By God, she rode that horse.

564
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:48,369
I guess that's how I
remember her really.

565
01:01:49,295 --> 01:01:51,729
This slip of a girl on
a wild black horse.

566
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:57,287
She was so beautiful.

567
01:01:59,535 --> 01:02:01,765
She was so beautiful
that she gleamed.

568
01:02:08,615 --> 01:02:10,253
Do you know what I mean?

569
01:02:11,335 --> 01:02:12,734
That's really you.

570
01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:19,209
That's what I'd have
thought you'd be like.

571
01:02:22,535 --> 01:02:23,763
By the way..

572
01:02:24,215 --> 01:02:26,445
did Claudia tell you what I do?

573
01:02:28,815 --> 01:02:29,804
No.

574
01:02:31,055 --> 01:02:32,568
I'm in the travel business.

575
01:02:32,655 --> 01:02:35,328
I'm a partner in a
travel agency and..

576
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:41,765
I've got these two tickets here,
if you'd like to take them.

577
01:02:42,295 --> 01:02:44,809
They're for New Orleans
for the Mardi Gras.

578
01:02:45,135 --> 01:02:47,012
Thought you might like to go.

579
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:51,694
You're so sweet.

580
01:02:53,655 --> 01:02:56,169
I'll enjoy thinking
of both of you there.

581
01:02:56,935 --> 01:02:57,890
I will.

582
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:52,175
- I'm hungry!
- We gotta get out of here!

583
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:55,334
We gotta go!

584
01:04:01,895 --> 01:04:03,453
Let's go to the hotel!

585
01:04:03,695 --> 01:04:05,526
Wait! Let's try here!

586
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,694
Down here!

587
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:12,173
Can't we just eat here?

588
01:04:12,255 --> 01:04:15,292
Food's crappy. I know that
place is just down here.

589
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:16,968
You better be right.

590
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:25,414
It's right over here.

591
01:04:35,095 --> 01:04:36,733
What do you want?

592
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:40,723
We want your money.

593
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:43,613
Maybe you could help us out
with something to eat.

594
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:46,250
Me and my friend,
we real hungry now.

595
01:04:46,495 --> 01:04:48,963
That's real good but we
want all your money.

596
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:51,850
Go to hell.

597
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:00,730
Come on!

598
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:03,329
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

599
01:05:03,935 --> 01:05:06,972
You beat the hell out of them.
You didn't even give me a chance.

600
01:05:07,055 --> 01:05:08,249
It was just a reflex.

601
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:11,532
You've got some reflexes!
Where'd you learn how to do that?

602
01:05:16,535 --> 01:05:17,968
I don't know.

603
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:22,650
I took a self-defense class
once when I was just a girl.

604
01:05:31,655 --> 01:05:33,134
I'm so hungry!

605
01:05:36,695 --> 01:05:38,367
I gotta have food.

606
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:42,490
What is it? It's five, right?

607
01:05:44,335 --> 01:05:46,724
- Room service. May I help you?
- Hello?

608
01:05:50,255 --> 01:05:51,847
This is Room 30.

609
01:05:54,695 --> 01:05:57,163
I'd like to order
some food, please.

610
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:01,969
Could I have a couple
of chicken salads..

611
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:04,853
and a couple of
pieces of pecan pie..

612
01:06:05,455 --> 01:06:08,049
and what kind of
soda do you have?

613
01:06:11,575 --> 01:06:13,884
All right, then. I
guess I'll have..

614
01:06:16,855 --> 01:06:18,413
I'll take Pepsi.

615
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,408
Can I have four cans of that,
because we get thirsty after sex?

616
01:06:31,615 --> 01:06:32,968
Kiss my neck.

617
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:34,204
Okay.

618
01:06:36,495 --> 01:06:37,848
Kiss it harder.

619
01:06:46,255 --> 01:06:47,210
Yes?

620
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:48,370
Nina?

621
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:52,725
Yes?

622
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:55,689
The bathroom cabinet has
a hidden compartment.

623
01:07:00,055 --> 01:07:01,124
All right.

624
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:04,773
Then make it two pieces
of chocolate-rum cake.

625
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,128
They're all out of pecan pie.

626
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:13,092
Okay, we're out of this joint.

627
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:18,849
I gotta take a bath.
I feel really dirty.

628
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:22,408
If you could just wait for
room service, please.

629
01:07:51,615 --> 01:07:52,843
Nina in position.

630
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:54,766
First item's under the sink.

631
01:08:23,295 --> 01:08:25,525
- Assembly completed.
- Open the window.

632
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:37,251
- There's no handle.
- Open the window.

633
01:08:39,855 --> 01:08:41,368
- Claudia?
- Yeah?

634
01:08:42,935 --> 01:08:44,971
You know what I've
been thinking?

635
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,010
What?

636
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:50,606
I've got a really good idea.

637
01:08:53,135 --> 01:08:56,605
Just thinking we could make Bob's
present an engagement present.

638
01:08:57,455 --> 01:08:59,366
Save the poor slob some money.

639
01:09:10,175 --> 01:09:11,290
Okay.

640
01:09:13,135 --> 01:09:16,013
What do you say, you want to do it?
Make it formal?

641
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:18,284
Honey?

642
01:09:22,415 --> 01:09:23,689
The limousine.

643
01:09:26,935 --> 01:09:28,607
Take aim on the limousine.

644
01:09:29,935 --> 01:09:32,244
We're waiting for
further instructions.

645
01:09:36,295 --> 01:09:38,968
I asked you a question.
Don't I deserve an answer?

646
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:40,249
In a minute.

647
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:44,692
It's how I always imagined it.
Proposing through a door.

648
01:09:50,415 --> 01:09:52,292
Christ! What is it with you?

649
01:09:56,615 --> 01:09:58,094
Say something.

650
01:09:58,255 --> 01:10:00,815
Say, "Go to hell, J.P."
Tell me you love me..

651
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:04,287
or "Get lost" or whatever.
Just answer me, okay?

652
01:10:09,615 --> 01:10:10,889
Room service.

653
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:17,767
- How many targets?
- One.

654
01:10:18,575 --> 01:10:21,408
- What's he look like?
- I haven't been informed yet.

655
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:26,449
How're you enjoying our
beautiful Mardi Gras?

656
01:10:26,535 --> 01:10:27,445
Real well.

657
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:29,446
Target visible in five seconds.

658
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:43,648
- Thanks.
- Y'all come back and see us, you hear?

659
01:10:45,255 --> 01:10:46,529
Which one is it?

660
01:10:46,695 --> 01:10:48,447
I don't have that data yet.

661
01:10:48,975 --> 01:10:50,966
You've got nothing to say to me?

662
01:10:51,215 --> 01:10:52,728
Which target, dammit?

663
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,564
The woman.

664
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:02,254
The woman in white.

665
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:10,053
The woman in white, I said.

666
01:11:18,895 --> 01:11:20,294
The fucking woman!

667
01:11:31,815 --> 01:11:33,168
What is with you?

668
01:11:34,895 --> 01:11:36,533
What the hell's going on?

669
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:40,810
What's this?

670
01:11:45,655 --> 01:11:47,611
You've got nothing to say to me?

671
01:11:49,615 --> 01:11:52,334
A while ago, I did
something really bad.

672
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:58,970
I came through it, but I'm
always gonna be paying for it.

673
01:12:02,495 --> 01:12:03,644
It's okay.

674
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:10,567
It's in the past.

675
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:12,453
You can just let it go.

676
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,523
I can't.

677
01:12:17,815 --> 01:12:19,646
But you've got to believe me.

678
01:12:21,775 --> 01:12:23,367
If I'm secretive..

679
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:26,206
I've got my reasons.

680
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:30,567
For now, I'll take that.

681
01:12:33,775 --> 01:12:34,890
For now.

682
01:13:12,335 --> 01:13:15,372
Students, this is a defensive tactic.
Watch me.

683
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,013
So how was New Orleans?

684
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,491
Everything you touch
turns to shit.

685
01:13:28,135 --> 01:13:32,413
Why'd you send me on a job with J.P.?
What happens to him if he finds out?

686
01:13:32,655 --> 01:13:34,771
I know it wasn't an easy job.

687
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:37,005
You're so pathetic.
Listen to you.

688
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:40,804
You stand there with that little smile.
Drop the fucking mask, for once.

689
01:13:40,895 --> 01:13:42,886
Fuck you! That was my last job.

690
01:13:44,655 --> 01:13:46,771
You stupid, ignorant
little girl.

691
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:49,688
You think you can decide you
don't want to play anymore?

692
01:13:49,775 --> 01:13:51,970
Where the fuck do
you think you are?

693
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:54,330
Haven't you heard
anything that I've said?

694
01:13:54,415 --> 01:13:56,485
- I mean it!
- You don't know what you're saying.

695
01:13:56,575 --> 01:14:00,204
- I'm through! I'm out!
- Which word do you not understand?

696
01:14:00,455 --> 01:14:03,686
There is no "out." There is no
"through." There is no out!

697
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:14,168
You've gotta help me.

698
01:14:14,775 --> 01:14:17,448
I can't do this. I can't
live like this anymore.

699
01:14:21,615 --> 01:14:24,049
Don't you like me well
enough to help me?

700
01:14:24,655 --> 01:14:25,849
Like you?

701
01:14:27,895 --> 01:14:28,964
I know..

702
01:14:29,415 --> 01:14:32,407
you like that you made me
into something different.

703
01:14:33,895 --> 01:14:36,170
But you're not looking
close enough.

704
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:37,888
I am different.

705
01:14:39,215 --> 01:14:40,773
Help me be better.

706
01:14:42,975 --> 01:14:44,886
Please, Bob, let me go.

707
01:15:01,175 --> 01:15:03,086
You know who Fahd Bahktiar is?

708
01:15:06,055 --> 01:15:07,727
He's one of the
world's richest men.

709
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:10,773
He's peddling nuclear
information to the Middle East.

710
01:15:11,055 --> 01:15:14,889
I need a woman for this one. It's the
kind of job you were trained for.

711
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:18,532
I want you to do three things.

712
01:15:18,855 --> 01:15:22,131
Number One:
Impersonate his girlfriend
so you can get into his house.

713
01:15:22,215 --> 01:15:26,572
Number Two:
Take the disk that he's been sending
the data on, then destroy his computer.

714
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:28,494
And number three:

715
01:15:29,335 --> 01:15:31,053
I want you to take him out.

716
01:15:35,335 --> 01:15:38,088
If I do this job, if
I bring this off..

717
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:41,174
will you do what you can
to help me get out?

718
01:15:46,655 --> 01:15:47,690
No.

719
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,293
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

720
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,889
Would you take these, John?
Thanks.

721
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:15,406
Maggie! What a pleasure!

722
01:16:16,495 --> 01:16:17,894
How are you?

723
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:21,687
Does anybody ever get out?

724
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:25,045
Thank you, John.
I'll do the rest.

725
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:31,010
Were you like me once? Would they
let you leave if you wanted to?

726
01:16:33,215 --> 01:16:37,367
Happiness in life comes from braiding
together what one would like to have..

727
01:16:37,655 --> 01:16:38,929
with what is inevitable.

728
01:16:39,015 --> 01:16:42,007
Stop that shit! Stop talking
like that and answer me!

729
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:46,804
I'm sorry.

730
01:16:48,175 --> 01:16:52,407
I don't want to be rude to you. You were
the only one who was nice to me here.

731
01:16:56,015 --> 01:16:57,733
Please, could you tell me?

732
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,924
Could you just leave
if you wanted to?

733
01:17:02,455 --> 01:17:04,491
Just get on a plane
and disappear?

734
01:17:07,015 --> 01:17:08,573
To tell the truth, dear..

735
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:12,534
I don't know. It's a possibility
that never entered my mind.

736
01:17:21,775 --> 01:17:23,493
You won't tell Bob I came?

737
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:26,090
Thank you.

738
01:17:44,295 --> 01:17:46,047
- You look tired.
- I am.

739
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,286
- Want a back rub?
- Yeah.

740
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,485
- With the hypnotic fantasy oil?
- Yeah.

741
01:17:50,575 --> 01:17:51,644
All right.

742
01:17:52,055 --> 01:17:53,283
On the bed.

743
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:54,808
I'll be right back.

744
01:18:00,655 --> 01:18:01,804
Hello, Maggie.

745
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,209
These are copies of the
photos I gave you.

746
01:18:06,575 --> 01:18:08,406
Amanda says that you..

747
01:18:09,455 --> 01:18:10,729
dropped them.

748
01:18:12,215 --> 01:18:13,933
I don't think I can do it.

749
01:18:20,855 --> 01:18:23,005
If you pull this
job off for me..

750
01:18:24,495 --> 01:18:26,770
I'll see what I can
do to help you.

751
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:35,767
See the upstairs corner?

752
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:39,803
That's his bedroom. Right here.
You arrive early. You do it here.

753
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,173
With the right wig, clothes,
attitude, you can..

754
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:46,247
look sufficiently like the
girlfriend to get into his house.

755
01:18:46,335 --> 01:18:48,405
What happens to her?
Does she die, too?

756
01:18:48,495 --> 01:18:51,009
Absolutely not. No
unnecessary wetworks.

757
01:18:52,015 --> 01:18:53,130
Good.

758
01:18:54,575 --> 01:18:57,726
Look at those earrings.
Got the buck in the walk.

759
01:18:58,695 --> 01:19:00,174
I have those glasses.

760
01:19:00,255 --> 01:19:03,053
- Yeah? Great.
- I'll get that brand of cigarettes.

761
01:19:03,175 --> 01:19:05,086
- She's right-handed.
- Me, too.

762
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:06,528
Long cigarettes.

763
01:19:07,295 --> 01:19:08,648
Is that mole real?

764
01:19:08,735 --> 01:19:09,884
Not on me, it won't be.

765
01:19:09,975 --> 01:19:11,328
Here we go again.

766
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:16,526
"Happy birthday to you"

767
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:24,613
They don't go out!

768
01:19:24,775 --> 01:19:26,333
It won't go out.

769
01:19:29,575 --> 01:19:30,928
It's heavy.

770
01:19:31,335 --> 01:19:32,688
"It's heavy."

771
01:19:35,575 --> 01:19:37,293
Get out of the way now.

772
01:19:37,735 --> 01:19:39,646
"Get out of the way now."

773
01:19:42,255 --> 01:19:43,449
There he is.

774
01:19:45,775 --> 01:19:49,563
Frank, for Christ's sake, do us a
favor and put the camera away.

775
01:19:49,695 --> 01:19:50,730
All right.

776
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:53,093
Let's go over it again.

777
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,366
We've only done it 20 times.

778
01:19:55,455 --> 01:19:58,333
Look, it's tomorrow night.
This is our last chance.

779
01:19:58,455 --> 01:20:01,253
Okay. We meet at 4:00
to go to Angela's.

780
01:20:02,295 --> 01:20:04,013
Let's make it a quarter to.

781
01:20:04,135 --> 01:20:05,853
That'll give us more time.

782
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,649
Hey, honey!

783
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:14,208
Uncle Bob, is it really you?
How nice to see you.

784
01:20:14,575 --> 01:20:17,135
No, it can't be Uncle Bob.
It's got to be..

785
01:20:17,655 --> 01:20:19,691
Aunt Pauline or Cousin Molly..

786
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,453
or something, right?

787
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,487
Wait a minute! I got it!

788
01:20:25,455 --> 01:20:29,653
This must be Cindy D'Amato. Used to
work for Super Mac. Quit to get married.

789
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:32,611
Hi. How the hell are you?

790
01:20:40,975 --> 01:20:43,284
What in heaven's name
have you got there?

791
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:46,845
You bought it for me, remember?
When I moved into the studio.

792
01:20:47,535 --> 01:20:51,130
- Give me that nonsensical object. Give it..
- You keep away from me.

793
01:20:51,215 --> 01:20:53,251
Don't you try to intimidate me.

794
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:55,853
You are not going to tell Carol.

795
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:56,970
Swear you won't!

796
01:20:57,055 --> 01:20:58,727
I'll swear nothing!

797
01:21:24,655 --> 01:21:25,883
- Hi.
- Hi.

798
01:21:37,135 --> 01:21:38,568
We're from Sherry's.

799
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:40,168
Where's Francine?

800
01:21:40,255 --> 01:21:42,689
Francine's sick today,
so Sherry sent us.

801
01:21:43,295 --> 01:21:44,569
They said Francine was coming.

802
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:48,045
I guess they got it wrong 'cause
Francine's sick. I don't know.

803
01:21:48,135 --> 01:21:51,013
Sherry sent us 'cause
Francine ate something bad.

804
01:21:52,335 --> 01:21:53,768
She got sick.

805
01:21:54,295 --> 01:21:57,605
I could really care less if I
did another head of hair today.

806
01:21:57,695 --> 01:21:59,208
So make up your mind.

807
01:22:05,455 --> 01:22:06,934
All right. Come on.

808
01:22:13,175 --> 01:22:15,325
Who are these people?
Where's Francine?

809
01:22:15,415 --> 01:22:16,894
Francine's sick, so we're here.

810
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:20,172
Great. Some new fucking blood.
Can you do me out here?

811
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:22,565
Sure. I can burn hair anywhere.

812
01:22:22,695 --> 01:22:23,923
Is this outfit all right?

813
01:22:24,015 --> 01:22:25,528
- Is the stain gone?
- Yes.

814
01:22:25,615 --> 01:22:28,129
Fine. Put it in my room
with the red boots.

815
01:22:29,775 --> 01:22:32,289
I want some fucking
softness around my face.

816
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:35,334
Last time Francine did me, she
slicked all my hair back..

817
01:22:35,415 --> 01:22:38,248
and made me look like some
kind of fucking dyke.

818
01:22:39,095 --> 01:22:40,972
Did you guys meet my friends?

819
01:22:41,615 --> 01:22:44,766
This is "Stupid" and the
other one is "Stupider."

820
01:22:48,575 --> 01:22:51,726
- Would you like some ginseng tea?
- No, I don't drink tea.

821
01:22:53,455 --> 01:22:57,289
Francine says you love her ginseng tea.
It's great for the sex drive.

822
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:59,843
I've got no trouble
in that department.

823
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:01,254
It's really very good.

824
01:23:01,335 --> 01:23:04,008
Enough with the fucking
tea, for Christ's sake.

825
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:06,694
Suit yourself.

826
01:23:07,935 --> 01:23:10,688
- Do you have silk, please, for my fingers?
- Sure.

827
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:34,653
Oh, God! I'm dead!

828
01:23:35,655 --> 01:23:37,771
- Let me see.
- Damn it, I'm hit!

829
01:23:38,175 --> 01:23:39,324
It's okay.

830
01:23:41,415 --> 01:23:43,371
Hold still. Just push it hard.

831
01:23:43,695 --> 01:23:44,810
I'm calling Kaufman.

832
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:47,284
- I'm calling Kaufman.
- I can finish it. I have to!

833
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:50,606
He said if anything goes wrong,
we're supposed to call him.

834
01:23:53,255 --> 01:23:56,167
It's screwed up. There are
two down and I'm hit.

835
01:23:56,975 --> 01:23:57,964
How?

836
01:23:59,215 --> 01:24:01,126
Okay, okay. Yes, okay.

837
01:24:03,935 --> 01:24:05,812
They're calling in a cleaner.

838
01:24:05,935 --> 01:24:07,050
Jesus!

839
01:24:25,135 --> 01:24:28,047
We've heard reports of shots.
Did you hear anything?

840
01:24:34,255 --> 01:24:36,086
I'm Victor. I'm the cleaner.

841
01:24:44,015 --> 01:24:47,132
The job's gone bad, but I
think I can finish it.

842
01:24:47,735 --> 01:24:49,532
This part of the job's over.

843
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:51,929
I'm the cleaner.

844
01:24:54,935 --> 01:24:56,448
Where's the material?

845
01:24:56,775 --> 01:24:57,969
Outside.

846
01:25:06,335 --> 01:25:07,768
What's that for?

847
01:25:09,335 --> 01:25:10,893
Cleaning up your shit.

848
01:25:20,495 --> 01:25:22,213
Christ! What're you doing?

849
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:28,049
She's not dead.

850
01:25:29,815 --> 01:25:34,013
Oh, God! Kaufman said no wetworks.
He said no wetworks. I'll call him now.

851
01:25:49,095 --> 01:25:51,609
"I never did mind about the
little things."

852
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,525
I'll go get ready
for the next step.

853
01:26:15,615 --> 01:26:17,367
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

854
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:21,366
All right, have a nice evening.

855
01:26:47,175 --> 01:26:48,005
Hi, Angela.

856
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:51,485
- New driver?
- For Christ's sake, open the stupid gate!

857
01:26:57,175 --> 01:26:59,928
It went off the tracks and
I called in a cleaner.

858
01:27:00,295 --> 01:27:01,364
What happened?

859
01:27:01,455 --> 01:27:06,051
Two down. I was afraid we'd get splashed
with shit. I told him to get it cleaned up.

860
01:27:06,415 --> 01:27:08,246
- How clean?
- Down to the nap.

861
01:27:08,495 --> 01:27:11,214
The cleaner's going with
your girl to Bahktiar's.

862
01:27:12,335 --> 01:27:13,814
After she finishes..

863
01:27:14,575 --> 01:27:16,167
he'll clean her, too.

864
01:27:36,655 --> 01:27:39,294
Of course, it was me. I
heard the bloody thing.

865
01:27:40,975 --> 01:27:42,533
He's upstairs. You're early.

866
01:27:42,615 --> 01:27:44,924
- So sue me, stupid.
- Want a drink?

867
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:47,210
Salty Dog. Leave it down here.

868
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:48,490
I must piss.

869
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:04,448
Go to your computer, bring
up your nuclear program.

870
01:28:05,975 --> 01:28:08,409
What are you going to
accomplish by this?

871
01:28:08,495 --> 01:28:09,450
Do it!

872
01:28:11,575 --> 01:28:13,008
Suck my dick.

873
01:28:17,895 --> 01:28:19,374
Go to your computer.

874
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:31,564
Should the Arabs be the only people
not to have this technology?

875
01:28:31,855 --> 01:28:33,493
Is that what you think?

876
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:37,250
Hurry up.

877
01:28:42,695 --> 01:28:44,253
I cannot access the data.

878
01:28:44,335 --> 01:28:45,484
Yeah, right.

879
01:28:45,775 --> 01:28:46,844
The system is down.

880
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:49,369
Get around to the other
side of the desk.

881
01:28:50,615 --> 01:28:54,085
I can make you very rich, beyond
anything you can imagine.

882
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:57,407
And if I say I will, I will.
I'll do it, I promise.

883
01:29:03,215 --> 01:29:04,694
What's the password?

884
01:29:07,815 --> 01:29:09,294
What's the password?

885
01:29:13,055 --> 01:29:16,092
Try to imagine what a bullet
in the stomach feels like.

886
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:22,764
Peddler.

887
01:29:48,335 --> 01:29:52,123
You can't park there. Move it around
to the back with the other cars.

888
01:29:54,295 --> 01:29:56,445
Are you deaf? Move the car!

889
01:30:27,215 --> 01:30:28,409
On the ground.

890
01:30:29,135 --> 01:30:32,445
Don't be a stupid bitch. I'm
offering you anything you want.

891
01:30:32,535 --> 01:30:36,130
Get on your knees, forehead to the
ground, hands behind your back.

892
01:30:38,695 --> 01:30:40,686
You think killing me
will solve anything?

893
01:30:40,775 --> 01:30:44,563
You think you can keep 800 million
people in the 14th century forever?

894
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:04,691
That's it. I've had it.

895
01:35:00,615 --> 01:35:02,492
Be sure it's hooked up.

896
01:35:02,895 --> 01:35:04,726
Wait till he gets down there.

897
01:35:05,895 --> 01:35:07,487
Is there a woman down there?

898
01:35:07,575 --> 01:35:11,727
There could be 20 women down there,
for all I know. The car's in a bad spot.

899
01:35:13,935 --> 01:35:15,050
That's it.

900
01:35:48,335 --> 01:35:49,450
You awake?

901
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:57,292
I know you are. I can tell
by the way you're breathing.

902
01:36:01,775 --> 01:36:03,208
I'm so tired.

903
01:36:06,735 --> 01:36:07,850
My God!

904
01:36:09,615 --> 01:36:11,367
What happened to your face?

905
01:37:00,295 --> 01:37:01,410
She's gone.

906
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:03,404
Where?

907
01:37:08,175 --> 01:37:09,085
Where?

908
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:10,524
I don't know.

909
01:37:11,615 --> 01:37:13,333
She took off empty-handed.

910
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:17,053
She didn't take any of her
clothes or even her purse.

911
01:37:17,255 --> 01:37:19,166
So whoever it is you are..

912
01:37:20,015 --> 01:37:22,245
just leave her alone.
Let her go.

913
01:37:22,415 --> 01:37:24,804
- I can't. She's got information.
- Yeah.

914
01:37:27,415 --> 01:37:28,973
Why don't you get out?

915
01:37:31,135 --> 01:37:32,614
She left you a note.

916
01:37:33,975 --> 01:37:34,964
Yeah?

917
01:37:36,455 --> 01:37:37,774
I tore it up.

918
01:37:39,255 --> 01:37:40,574
What did it say?

919
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:49,808
Can I take this?

920
01:37:51,215 --> 01:37:52,330
Yeah, sure.

921
01:37:55,135 --> 01:37:56,329
You like Nina?

922
01:37:59,215 --> 01:38:00,204
Yeah.

923
01:38:02,215 --> 01:38:03,364
I love her.

924
01:38:09,535 --> 01:38:10,809
We'll miss her.

925
01:38:19,535 --> 01:38:20,809
We'll miss her.

926
01:39:40,495 --> 01:39:42,565
We had a bad car
wreck last night.

927
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:44,649
No, no.. no.

928
01:39:45,455 --> 01:39:47,605
I have all the
information we need.

929
01:39:49,695 --> 01:39:51,208
The cleaner's dead..

930
01:39:55,135 --> 01:39:56,648
and the girl is..

931
01:40:01,935 --> 01:40:03,288
the girl is..

932
01:40:05,095 --> 01:40:06,733
the girl's dead, too.

933
01:40:07,135 --> 01:40:08,090
Yeah.

934
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:56,410
