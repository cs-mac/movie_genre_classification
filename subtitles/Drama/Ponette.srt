1
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:07,318
I'm going to draw a dog on your cast.

2
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:10,973
I don't like it when they're all white.
I'll do the first drawing.

3
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:29,625
Mommy's in pretty bad shape.

4
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,930
The doctors think she may die.

5
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,391
Are we going home?

6
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:03,527
No, we're going to Claire's.

7
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:15,373
Will Mathias and Delphine be there?

8
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:16,574
Of course.

9
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:22,013
Will there be lions?

10
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,850
Mathias and Delphine
are your cousins, not wild animals.

11
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:29,487
But will there be lions?

12
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:33,191
If there are,
your Russian dog will protect you.

13
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,271
What are you doing?

14
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:48,373
Putting my head out of the window.

15
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,001
No no no no...

16
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,250
No.

17
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,594
If you went slower, I could do it.

18
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:11,864
I could go even faster, but I'm careful.

19
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:17,270
I didn't buckle you in so you see
what it means to be careful.

20
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,172
Not like your stupid mother.

21
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,009
She's not stupid!

22
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,145
Was I driving?

23
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:30,050
She wasn't drunk.

24
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,591
She wasn't speeding.
She knew the road by heart.

25
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,305
What could she have been thinking
with you in the car?

26
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:45,415
It wasn't on purpose.

27
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,134
It's not her fault.

28
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,440
Did you ever break your arm with me?

29
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:53,908
Or get hurt?

30
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,610
She's not stupid.

31
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,391
I'm not hurt.

32
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:56,305
- Are you okay up there?
- Yes.

33
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,652
- Will you make me a promise?
- Yes.

34
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:07,651
Never die.
Swear on it and spit.

35
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:10,720
And when we get really old?

36
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:14,796
I don't give a shit.
Spit and say: "I'll never die".

37
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,361
- I'll never die.
- Louder. I don't believe you.

38
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,396
I'll never die.

39
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:20,631
Spit!

40
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,521
Mommy is dead.

41
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,159
You know what that means?

42
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:56,991
Yes!

43
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:05,177
She's flying with her magic mirror.

44
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:12,451
She's dead!

45
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:16,622
I thought she'd be with us forever too.

46
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,092
I could act as stupid as I wanted.
I trusted her.

47
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,927
I knew you were with her.

48
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,402
Can I spit?

49
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,913
Can I spit...

50
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:42,015
so you don't...

51
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,587
die?

52
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:01,668
You think I'll manage
to raise you alone?

53
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,938
Yeah, you'll manage.

54
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:17,718
You can do it.

55
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:23,357
She was all broken.

56
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:25,326
They couldn't fix her.

57
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:26,627
They couldn't.

58
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:38,707
I'll make us feel better, okay?

59
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,442
Yeah, I'd like that.

60
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:51,620
You have nothing for her?

61
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,117
I don't know.

62
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:56,459
- You don't know what to give her?
- No.

63
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,427
You can give her Yoyotte.

64
00:07:58,694 --> 00:07:59,688
Not Yoyotte.

65
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:04,495
If you give her something you love,
she'll know you love her.

66
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,902
No, I only love Yoyotte.

67
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:08,515
Yes!

68
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,440
They lock her in with screws.

69
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,376
They put her in the cemetery?

70
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,310
Yeah.

71
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:29,059
Sometimes they put them in hospitals.

72
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,662
to get shots.
That didn't work this time.

73
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,200
She's going to heaven.
It's nice there.

74
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,436
Your mommy will like it there.

75
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,805
She can't come back.

76
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:45,209
If they bury her right,
she can't come back.

77
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,647
Jesus can take her up there.

78
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,006
No.

79
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:01,926
Mom, can we put
our presents in the box?

80
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:05,530
Can they put a few things inside?

81
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:45,671
Later on, she'll be able to come out.

82
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:50,543
No one can come out.
Only zombies can.

83
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:54,347
They put a heavy cross on you
to keep you in.

84
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:57,050
You stay in there like a statue.

85
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:07,033
You can keep Yoyotte.

86
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:15,235
What's in there?

87
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:16,934
It's sand.

88
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,672
- Sand for dead people?
- Yeah.

89
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:21,208
To put around their tombs?

90
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,044
I think it's to bury them with.

91
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:35,089
I like living above ground.

92
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:37,458
I really hate skulls.

93
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,967
The man told me
if you don't put a pillow inside,

94
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:49,003
it's like she's in a tin can.

95
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,372
But if you put a pillow in there,

96
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,642
your mommy will sleep for a long time.

97
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,250
Don't worry,
your mommy has a pillow.

98
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:05,554
She'll sleep for a long, long time.

99
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,450
Can I go to Lyon
if I come back soon?

100
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:35,874
Yes.

101
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,521
I'll call you tonight and every night.

102
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:40,924
We'll talk about school,
your shenanigans

103
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,594
and all your cousins' mischief.
Okay, honey?

104
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:47,497
Here's Yoyotte.

105
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,495
No!

106
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,140
I didn't start the car yet.
you never usually cry until later.

107
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:59,276
until I start driving away.

108
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:04,114
If you cry,
I'll be sad all the way.

109
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,652
I'll try again, and
you'll try not to cry, okay?

110
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,165
Okay.

111
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:14,258
I'm careful, I drive slowly.
Nothing can happen.

112
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:18,796
If you're scared, give me Yoyotte.
I'll give you something.

113
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,714
What?

114
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:21,966
I don't know.

115
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,335
My watch, my favourite thing.

116
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,437
You give me my favourite thing.

117
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:30,275
I'll give you Teddy.

118
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:33,011
Go get Teddy, then.

119
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,773
Thanks, honey. Here,

120
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:45,123
put it in your pocket.
Claire will make a hole in the band.

121
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,792
Listen to the tic-toc.

122
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:48,393
Listen.

123
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,897
When you're sad, listen to it.

124
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,365
It's my heart beating.

125
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,402
Teddy will take care of you.

126
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:00,155
Yes, he'll protect me.

127
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,079
Give me a lovey-dovey kiss.

128
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:27,000
Come on!

129
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:35,208
Ponette, why aren't you dressed yet?

130
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,878
- I'm talking to my mommy.
- Why?

131
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:39,346
I feel like it.

132
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,785
Mommy came to play with me.

133
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,221
What do you say to her?

134
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:49,557
I ask where she lives.

135
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:51,525
She says in the sky,

136
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,614
there are castles
that are all different colours!

137
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:59,800
My castle, my mommy's,

138
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:03,204
is red with a gold roof.

139
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:10,478
That's where the two of us live.

140
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,481
You live here. That's baloney!

141
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,651
At night I live with my mommy.

142
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:19,821
and during the day I live here.

143
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,895
I like the night more.

144
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:31,366
Why are you mean to us?

145
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,569
Because you're mean to me.

146
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:34,903
No, we're nice.

147
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,438
Not about my mommy.

148
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:39,708
You didn't play with your mother.

149
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,581
Ask Yoyotte.

150
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,882
She was there.

151
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,452
So Yoyotte can talk now?

152
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:52,669
Yoyotte can talk if she wants to.

153
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:54,690
Play with Yoyotte then!

154
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:57,860
And with your mother too!

155
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:21,251
They say you can't talk.

156
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,876
and that I didn't play with mommy.

157
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:35,800
When Mathias dies,

158
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,703
he'll stay in the box forever!

159
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,576
He'll get eaten up!

160
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,579
You better clean the room.

161
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:52,283
or she'll be angry, and so will I!

162
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,220
If you don't,
I'll throw you on the floor!

163
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:57,389
There!

164
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,665
Don't cry, I'll make you better.

165
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,972
Don't be scared.

166
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,544
It's over now.

167
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,451
Mommy was all broken.

168
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,291
Last night she wasn't.

169
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,861
She was fine.

170
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,364
You're the same.

171
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,604
You won't come and play?

172
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,574
You're mean!
You never want to!

173
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,844
I'll only play with Yoyotte.
She's very sick.

174
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,501
Mommy didn't come last night.

175
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,702
What do you mean?

176
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,458
She comes to see me at night.

177
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:18,906
She comes into your dreams.

178
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:21,175
No, she comes down at night.

179
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,250
But not last night.

180
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,220
Maybe she can't come every night.

181
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,222
She needs to sleep too.

182
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,024
Will she sleep tonight?

183
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,994
I don't know.
If you want her to come,

184
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,062
then I'm sure you will see her.

185
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:49,471
I want her to come every day.

186
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,341
You know what?

187
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,084
I'm going to tell you a story.

188
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,769
A true one.

189
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,565
When Jesus died,
they buried his body

190
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:03,052
and put a heavy tombstone
on his grave.

191
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,855
So he couldn't get out?

192
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:09,091
We still do it,
so the dead rest in peace.

193
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:13,196
But when people came
to see him in the cemetery,

194
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:17,533
the tombstone had moved
and Jesus wasn't there anymore.

195
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,505
They saw two men
wearing beautiful, gleaming clothes.

196
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:24,274
Who were they?

197
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:25,909
Princes?

198
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,978
No, they were angels.

199
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:33,600
The angels said Jesus was alive.
He wasn't dead anymore.

200
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:37,254
Jesus went to see his friends that day.

201
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:40,657
They were scared.
They thought he was a ghost.

202
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:47,564
Delphine said
dead people become spirits.

203
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:51,302
He wasn't a spirit.
Jesus came back to life.

204
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:52,903
He was resurrected.

205
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:59,544
- He got back to normal?
- Yes.

206
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:02,580
Now he's alive, in Heaven.

207
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,351
And mommy?

208
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,989
Will she come back to life too?

209
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:13,024
She's with Jesus. One day,

210
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:14,859
everyone will be resurrected.

211
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:18,096
Everyone will be together:
mommy, daddy, you...

212
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:20,498
When will that happen?

213
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:23,702
It will happen
when God wants it to happen.

214
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:27,406
Why?

215
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,143
Why is mommy in Heaven
and not you?

216
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,745
I hope I'll be there one day too.

217
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:36,348
Why wouldn't you be?

218
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,450
I will be. I intend to.

219
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:41,654
Mommy didn't want to.
She wanted to stay with me.

220
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:46,058
She'll be back tonight.
I better hurry back to bed.

221
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,343
What are you doing?

222
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,811
I can't tell you.

223
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:07,289
Don't tell me. I don't care!

224
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,955
Can I stay with you?

225
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,733
Mommy didn't come last night.

226
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,569
What do you want to play?

227
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:33,106
I don't want to play.
I'm waiting for my mother.

228
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:34,875
Dead people never come back.

229
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,278
Jesus did it for his friends.

230
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,385
I'm more than a friend.

231
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:46,988
I'm mommy's daughter.

232
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:50,058
Grandpa never came back.

233
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:53,661
Because no one was waiting for him.

234
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:14,594
You're not playing?

235
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:18,020
I can't find Delphine.
Ponette's waiting for her mom.

236
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,911
It's just a game.

237
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,618
No, she's really waiting.

238
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,196
Ponette!

239
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:29,465
Won't you play with Mathias?

240
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,235
I can't.

241
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:33,703
What are you doing?

242
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:36,506
I can't tell you.

243
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,787
Ponette's playing at waiting for her mom.

244
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,626
What game is this?

245
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:03,267
Baby, I recognize your little legs!

246
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,105
I'm dead again.

247
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:12,443
If someone says the magic word,
I'll come back to life.

248
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,545
What's the magic word?

249
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:16,380
It's Jesus's magic word.

250
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:18,683
Is it a real magic word?

251
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:20,985
It's for resurrecting his friends.

252
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:23,788
If you don't believe me,
ask my mom.

253
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:26,391
What's the magic word?

254
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:30,662
It has to be whispered,
or else something bad can happen.

255
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,605
Ta

256
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,169
Li

257
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,003
Ta Koom!

258
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,297
Ta Li Ta Koom!

259
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:32,025
Now that everyone's gone,

260
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:36,363
you can come.

261
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:41,630
You can do it for me.

262
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,393
Won't you come to eat?

263
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:09,797
I don't want to.

264
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:14,102
You have to eat a little.
Daddy would want that.

265
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:19,708
I'm not hungry.

266
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:23,020
What are you waiting for?

267
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,074
Nothing.
I'm just looking around.

268
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:31,486
Will you wait for long?

269
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,188
I don't know.

270
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:42,398
I thought I believed in God
like a child,

271
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,867
but you found him right away.

272
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:50,273
It's as if your mommy
took you to heaven

273
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,876
and you came back with your heart
full of God's love.

274
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:58,982
Even if you scare me a little,

275
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:02,685
you're a wonderful girl.

276
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,003
Ponette!

277
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:22,873
I'm sorry.

278
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,541
What does "sorry" mean?

279
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:27,044
It means you shouldn't wait.

280
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:28,479
She won't come.

281
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:30,114
Yes she will.

282
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:31,782
Jesus came back,

283
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:35,586
but when other people die,
they don't really come back.

284
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,557
But I can really fly!

285
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:42,360
She hears you, sees you,

286
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:44,796
and she still loves you.

287
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,432
But she can't come back.
I'm sure of it.

288
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:00,145
You know,

289
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:04,316
flying mice can fly upside down
and right-side up too.

290
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,726
They go like this to turn around

291
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:10,923
and then...

292
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,027
and like this with their wings.

293
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:17,529
I can fly really far.

294
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:20,966
Show me how you fly.

295
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:24,470
You can't see flying mice.

296
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:26,605
They fly too fast.

297
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:40,486
But I can see them.

298
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:43,289
I don't know how to tell you.

299
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:46,359
Flying mice...

300
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:49,396
No, that's enough.
No more flying mice.

301
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,007
Maybe one day
I'll be able to teach others to fly.

302
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,309
She won't come back, Ponette.

303
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:06,251
Let's go inside now.

304
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:07,950
I don't want to.

305
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,683
It's my turn to decide tonight.

306
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:16,924
It's Jesus who decides what I do.

307
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:18,793
I take care of you.

308
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:22,597
Jesus is relying on me to do that.

309
00:27:22,797 --> 00:27:23,865
Let's go.

310
00:27:55,847 --> 00:28:00,536
Tomorrow my mommy and I are leaving
and we're never coming back.

311
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:06,603
She didn't come because you all
ganged up on her, not me.

312
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:17,854
They don't want her to come back.

313
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:20,690
I do. I love your mommy.

314
00:28:21,124 --> 00:28:22,459
You never told her.

315
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,396
I can't tell her.

316
00:28:24,596 --> 00:28:26,963
You can too.
She can hear you.

317
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,399
How do I do it?

318
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,170
You pray. You close your eyes.

319
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,539
I don't believe in that!

320
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:38,675
You pray.
You close your eyes.

321
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,611
Put my hands right.

322
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:43,614
Like this?

323
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,517
Close...

324
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:47,918
No, wait.

325
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,522
Do like this.

326
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,190
Like this?

327
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:57,061
No, one half.

328
00:28:58,663 --> 00:28:59,997
Not the other.

329
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:02,400
Like this.

330
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,635
No, straight, like this.

331
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:07,138
Like this.

332
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:10,275
No, like this.

333
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:12,877
- How?
- Like this.

334
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,483
I love you.
I'm not sure you can hear me,

335
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,254
but I'm looking after Ponette
for you. That's all.

336
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:27,759
Good. Now I'll tell you
where mommy and I hide.

337
00:29:30,362 --> 00:29:32,164
It'll be our secret.

338
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:33,633
Okay.

339
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:25,252
We'll wait here.

340
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:30,257
Hello little bear.

341
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:35,763
I'll take you along.
Don't make any noise.

342
00:30:36,897 --> 00:30:38,132
Because...

343
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:42,103
Jesus is in jail.

344
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:43,838
Why?

345
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:47,942
He was put in jail by evil witches.

346
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:50,078
They better not find us!

347
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:53,848
Hurry, let's hide!

348
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,494
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

349
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,757
- Is this your hiding place?
- Yes.

350
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:11,266
This is no hiding place.
Everyone can see you.

351
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,902
Anyway, mommy's still asleep.

352
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:18,440
We have to sing her a song
to wake her up.

353
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:20,376
I don't know any songs.

354
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:24,580
This is dumb!
Dead people can't wake up.

355
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:33,790
You're bothering her.
She doesn't want to see you.

356
00:31:33,956 --> 00:31:35,925
She won't come!

357
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,465
We can't stay here.

358
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,770
She doesn't like it here.
It's too close.

359
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:02,619
Mommy will be happy to see you.

360
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:05,989
But you have to be nice,
or else she won't come.

361
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:09,693
If you're not nice,
she won't come.

362
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:14,331
We have to find presents for her.

363
00:33:07,687 --> 00:33:09,288
Are you coming?

364
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,948
Mommy!

365
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:45,427
Talita Koom!

366
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:03,363
Talita Koom! Talita Koom!

367
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:29,953
Talita Koom!

368
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:44,689
It took me two hours to drive here,

369
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,613
plus another two tonight.

370
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,419
Why are you here all alone?

371
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:54,058
I have some presents.
Little presents.

372
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:57,028
Too bad they're not for me.

373
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:06,304
They're for mommy?

374
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:08,740
Yeah, but for you too.

375
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:14,780
How much longer
will you wait for her?

376
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:20,119
Are you crazy or what?

377
00:36:23,155 --> 00:36:24,461
No.

378
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:27,426
Yes you are.

379
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:38,582
It may be the influence
of your cousins and Claire,

380
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,106
but you're crazy.

381
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,706
God doesn't talk to the living.

382
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:52,619
God's for the dead, not us.

383
00:37:16,077 --> 00:37:18,379
Your mommy wasn't scared to die,

384
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:22,750
so spare her
all this Jesus and God stuff.

385
00:37:29,023 --> 00:37:30,225
Please.

386
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,293
Live in a world with me and your cousins.

387
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,417
a world of the living.

388
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:54,867
Lying to yourself
won't make the hurting stop.

389
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:01,707
You didn't have to yell at me.

390
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:05,344
I'll stop yelling
if you stop acting crazy, okay?

391
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:06,745
Okay?

392
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:08,599
Okay.

393
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:25,031
Let's go to your room.

394
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:39,746
First door on the right.

395
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:44,585
This is the right?

396
00:38:44,952 --> 00:38:46,253
Here we are, Ponette.

397
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:47,936
tell her your name.

398
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:48,922
Luce.

399
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:51,825
She'll be staying here with Delphine?

400
00:38:51,992 --> 00:38:53,093
And Luce too.

401
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,329
We're going to Mathias's room. Stay here.

402
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,541
Will you be my friend?

403
00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:09,510
I have to ask Yoyotte.

404
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:10,645
Who's Yoyotte?

405
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:13,247
My doll. I think she'd like that.

406
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,216
Great! It'll be fun!

407
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:27,507
Like that!

408
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:28,930
Like that!

409
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:32,334
Very good! Very good!

410
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:40,008
Guillame is just like last year.

411
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,745
He won't let the boys look at Carla.

412
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,414
I like it

413
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:48,217
when boys look at me.
Are you jealous?

414
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:51,854
The other boys are chicken.
He scares them.

415
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:53,551
He's really ugly,

416
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:55,324
that boyfriend of yours.

417
00:39:56,826 --> 00:39:58,294
But he's really strong.

418
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:00,229
And really ugly.

419
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:05,335
If everyone does like him,
no one will look at anyone.

420
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:08,972
He doesn't want me
to have another boyfriend.

421
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:12,409
I have a boyfriend at home
and another one here.

422
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:13,543
Who is it?

423
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,113
My cousin.
I'm like my mom. I prefer singles.

424
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,524
What are singles?

425
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:23,253
They're people who are all alone

426
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:26,256
except for their kids,
if they have kids.

427
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:27,691
No boyfriends?

428
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:32,529
"Singles", that means...

429
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,467
sometimes it means you have

430
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,503
a boyfriend,
but you're not married.

431
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,906
sometimes, but it's rare.

432
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,611
Are there ever...

433
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,214
guys who come see your mom?

434
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,842
Yeah.

435
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,018
Friends or boyfriends?

436
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,588
No, they're not boyfriends!

437
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,656
So that means...

438
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,174
Your mom likes singles.

439
00:41:02,374 --> 00:41:06,215
So there's a guy...

440
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:10,936
Each time there's a guy
who comes to her house, right?

441
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:16,074
So afterwards... they're not singles
if there are two of them.

442
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:20,312
No, they don't stay at the house.

443
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:22,948
But they're together!

444
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,385
They just come
to make her feel better.

445
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,421
What happened to your mom?

446
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:31,791
Daddy and her are separated.

447
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:33,292
Really?

448
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,799
Why doesn't Ponette talk?

449
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:44,137
When she thinks about what happened,
she gets sad.

450
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,625
I have to go to the bathroom.

451
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,026
I'll take you.

452
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,053
I'm taking her to the bathroom.

453
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:18,773
Delphine, it's bedtime!

454
00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:21,909
Ponette has to go.
She doesn't feel well.

455
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:23,311
Are you sick?

456
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,513
She's too sad to answer.

457
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,524
I'll take care of Ponette.

458
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:28,877
Okay.

459
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:32,420
You shouldn't be too sad.

460
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,055
Yes I should.

461
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:35,990
Your mommy was sad too.

462
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:38,359
She cried on her way to heaven.

463
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:40,662
God cried as he waited for her.

464
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:44,199
When God was Jesus on earth,
he also cried.

465
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:46,701
But usually he's as joyful as a child.

466
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:49,456
It's not joyful being a child.

467
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:51,956
When we need God, he makes a sign.

468
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:52,908
What kind of sign?

469
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:55,544
He touches you
and you feel better.

470
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,179
He didn't touch me.

471
00:42:57,346 --> 00:42:59,081
You weren't paying attention.

472
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:03,185
I was too!
But I don't know what he looks like.

473
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:05,187
Like nothing. He's a spirit.

474
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:06,789
Jesus isn't a spirit.

475
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:10,059
When he went up to heaven
he became one.

476
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:11,293
Come on.

477
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:19,120
Daddy said that it's not true.

478
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:23,139
And that it won't stop me from hurting.

479
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:30,947
It's not nice to lie to me!

480
00:43:57,641 --> 00:43:58,909
You feel better?

481
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:04,048
Yeah, but I don't like the girl out there.

482
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:05,983
She's nice. You'll see.

483
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:08,719
Goodnight.
Goodnight to Yoyotte too.

484
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:12,590
Goodnight.

485
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:19,964
And goodnight to my daddy too.

486
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,053
- Your tummy hurts?
- Yes.

487
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,651
I have some tummy medicine.

488
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:44,529
It's really yummy.

489
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:46,792
A tiny teaspoon.

490
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:54,133
I'll be right back.
Mathias can stay.

491
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:00,506
Was it good?

492
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,109
Yes. I love syrup.

493
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:07,413
Me too. It's my favourite.
But I hate suppositories.

494
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,611
I've had enough.
I never want any more.

495
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,486
Well, I love suppositories!

496
00:45:13,653 --> 00:45:16,083
What? You love suppositories?

497
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:20,527
Yes. And you know
what I like the most?

498
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:21,842
No.

499
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:25,332
When they rub cream on you,

500
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:28,001
they touch you and you feel better.

501
00:45:28,202 --> 00:45:30,871
- Should I pretend to?
- Okay, do it here.

502
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:36,994
I'll take off your T-shirt.

503
00:45:37,745 --> 00:45:39,814
I'll take my little tube.

504
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,351
On your nose.

505
00:45:51,092 --> 00:45:53,428
Up to your nose.

506
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:00,001
There, all finished!

507
00:46:02,203 --> 00:46:03,271
Feel better now?

508
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:05,640
Yes, a little better.

509
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,909
I feel a lot better.

510
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,448
You know,

511
00:46:13,615 --> 00:46:17,085
I'm in Arthur's gang.
We'll be raiding the girls.

512
00:46:17,419 --> 00:46:19,922
Aurelie is really nice.

513
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:24,093
Tickle, tickle.

514
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,394
Stop it.

515
00:46:25,594 --> 00:46:26,962
Tickle tickle.

516
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:32,668
Let me go, Ponette...

517
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:35,438
A goodbye kiss.

518
00:46:59,129 --> 00:47:02,366
That's God's room.
It's where you go to pray.

519
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,368
Can we go in?

520
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:07,682
Not alone.
We can't make noise in there.

521
00:47:07,882 --> 00:47:10,874
You have to ask a teacher
or Aurelie.

522
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:20,951
Why does God have a room?

523
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:24,822
Just because. If you
don't believe me, ask Aurelie.

524
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:27,158
Or ask Ada, the girl over there.

525
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:29,227
I won't ask her anything.

526
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:42,307
You never want to,

527
00:47:42,507 --> 00:47:46,011
but you keep asking me questions
about your mother.

528
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:50,916
Just ask Ada.
She knows tons about God.

529
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:54,553
And she's a Jew.
She knows everything about Jesus.

530
00:47:56,054 --> 00:47:59,191
Why do Jews know
everything about Jesus?

531
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,761
Because Jesus was a Jew.
Just like Ada.

532
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:04,797
I don't think so.

533
00:48:05,931 --> 00:48:07,600
I'm sure of it.

534
00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:11,103
You never heard of Jews
and you say it's not true.

535
00:48:11,303 --> 00:48:12,838
I'll explain.

536
00:48:13,005 --> 00:48:16,381
There's a Jewish religion
and a Catholic one.

537
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:19,412
Catholics are allowed to eat pork.

538
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:21,614
Jews aren't allowed to.

539
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:24,851
But Ada eats pork anyway.

540
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:27,450
- You know what pork is?
- Yes.

541
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,690
What's the difference
between Jews and Catholics?

542
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:34,794
Some Catholics aren't nice.

543
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:38,465
But there' aren't
too many mean Catholics.

544
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:41,802
There are nice Jews too.

545
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:46,339
Some Catholics speak Arabic.

546
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,443
Because Arabs aren't Jews.

547
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:53,347
Arabs live across the sea

548
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:55,082
and they're Catholics.

549
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:56,750
Are you sure?

550
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:59,754
Yeah, they're half-Jewish, half-Catholic.

551
00:48:59,954 --> 00:49:01,255
I doubt it.

552
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:05,893
There are Arabs
who are totally Jewish,

553
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,528
but not a lot.

554
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,597
I don't get it at all!

555
00:49:10,064 --> 00:49:12,200
You didn't listen. That's why.

556
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:21,768
If you want, you can ask Ada.

557
00:49:21,968 --> 00:49:24,012
She's nice.
She'll explain things.

558
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:27,682
You know what she is?
She's a child of God.

559
00:49:28,164 --> 00:49:29,376
A child of God?

560
00:49:29,576 --> 00:49:33,288
Yeah, she's the only one.
There are no others here.

561
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,844
- Are you really a child of God?
- Sure I am.

562
00:49:56,145 --> 00:49:58,247
What's a child of God?

563
00:49:58,681 --> 00:50:01,117
It's like God is our daddy.

564
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:04,654
But don't you already have a daddy?

565
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:07,901
This way, I can ask God things too.

566
00:50:08,101 --> 00:50:10,193
God has powers. He's almighty.

567
00:50:10,393 --> 00:50:13,096
He can give orders
because he's the strongest.

568
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:16,600
You know,
Jesus is not almighty.

569
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:21,135
He can't order God around.

570
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:23,273
But if you're a child of God,

571
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:26,210
you have power over God.

572
00:50:27,644 --> 00:50:30,647
Some people
can order God around a little.

573
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:35,025
My daddy doesn't believe in God.

574
00:50:35,352 --> 00:50:38,863
I do.
I can even make him stop talking.

575
00:50:39,063 --> 00:50:40,658
because sometimes
he talks too much.

576
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:44,362
I do something and he loses his voice.

577
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:45,897
What do you do?

578
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:47,965
My powers are my secrets.

579
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:50,968
What's his voice like?

580
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:54,072
It's deep.
I can hear it everywhere.

581
00:50:54,272 --> 00:50:56,808
Below, above, right, left,

582
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,309
every which way.

583
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:04,683
God said
I had to undergo great trials.

584
00:51:05,383 --> 00:51:07,619
"You have to undergo great trials."

585
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,473
- To become a child of God?
- Yes.

586
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:12,391
And I did them all.

587
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:15,127
I can make you do them too.

588
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:19,998
But if your daddy doesn't believe
in God, it may not work.

589
00:51:26,872 --> 00:51:28,474
What if I believe?

590
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:32,244
I don't know.
I'll think over and ask him.

591
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:46,960
What I really want,

592
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:50,997
is to make God
let me talk to my mother.

593
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:53,600
Can't you just talk to her?

594
00:51:54,034 --> 00:51:56,636
No, my mommy's dead.

595
00:51:57,537 --> 00:52:00,340
No one can talk to a dead person.

596
00:52:01,408 --> 00:52:03,644
You can't talk to her directly.

597
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:08,515
You have to ask God.
God decides.

598
00:52:08,715 --> 00:52:11,658
But you can
if you're a child of God!

599
00:52:15,389 --> 00:52:16,991
You do it in God's room?

600
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:19,536
What's God's room?

601
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:22,530
The room where my people pray.

602
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,131
Oh, the chapel.

603
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:26,901
You can talk to him there too.

604
00:52:27,168 --> 00:52:29,937
Your mother wouldn't hear you.
Only God.

605
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:46,555
I'll see what to do

606
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:49,491
if your dad doesn't believe
and your mom's dead.

607
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:52,260
You want me to give you a trial tomorrow?

608
00:52:52,894 --> 00:52:53,965
Okay.

609
00:53:09,512 --> 00:53:12,122
- Did I hurt you?
- Yes.

610
00:53:26,863 --> 00:53:30,500
Aurelie,
can you show me God's room?

611
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:34,625
Okay, but not for long.
I have work to do.

612
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:58,763
We pray here.

613
00:53:59,196 --> 00:54:02,334
We can think about God and Jesus.

614
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:06,070
I know mommy's in heaven.

615
00:54:06,237 --> 00:54:07,605
She's with God.

616
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,453
Yes, she lives with God.

617
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:53,164
Yes.

618
00:54:53,686 --> 00:54:56,856
Before, mommy couldn't hear me.

619
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,926
She can hear your prayers.

620
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:13,373
But she couldn't answer
because it's God who decides.

621
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:18,645
God's the boss. He decides.
That's right.

622
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:28,655
You know what lava is?

623
00:55:28,922 --> 00:55:30,090
It's the devil.

624
00:55:30,858 --> 00:55:34,261
If you fall in the lava,
you burn and die!

625
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:37,031
There are little islands.

626
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:41,479
You have to jump onto an island.

627
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:43,771
You need to wear glasses.

628
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,309
I can stay with you in the lava

629
00:55:48,476 --> 00:55:51,451
because I already passed this trial.

630
00:55:51,651 --> 00:55:54,854
- My feet can't burn.
- Yes.

631
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:59,460
- Ready?
- Yes.

632
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:04,292
I'll help you.
If you fall in the lava, you'll die!

633
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:07,596
And your glasses will burn!

634
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:10,298
They'll melt!

635
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,335
Hurry up!

636
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:20,427
You win! But...

637
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:24,113
the second jump is the hardest.

638
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:28,749
Come on!

639
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:30,052
You messed up.

640
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,355
Good thing I'm here.

641
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:35,429
Can you smell your shoes?

642
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:45,679
- Can't you smell them?
- No.

643
00:56:45,879 --> 00:56:48,671
You can't smell the burnt rubber?

644
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,874
Yes I can.

645
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:56,780
And now you have to jump
from the island back to earth.

646
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,750
Come on, lazybones!

647
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,157
You're not a child of God yet.

648
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:12,596
But anyway,
you passed the first trial.

649
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,736
It was a little hard.

650
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:21,372
But soon you'll have magic powers.

651
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:17,029
God Almighty...

652
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:29,509
God Almighty...

653
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:33,813
you know my mommy is dead

654
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:37,417
because she's with you.

655
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,263
But I want to talk to my mommy.

656
00:58:59,173 --> 00:59:02,109
I tried and I couldn't.

657
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:09,817
She never answered me.

658
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,238
Tell her to talk to me.

659
00:59:46,689 --> 00:59:48,390
See, mommy?

660
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,762
I talked to God Almighty.

661
00:59:54,964 --> 00:59:57,099
I have lots of kisses for you.

662
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,919
Can you kiss the candy?

663
01:00:16,086 --> 01:00:18,321
Go on, go on.

664
01:00:18,855 --> 01:00:21,625
We'll play a trick on Mathias.

665
01:00:21,825 --> 01:00:23,026
Come on.

666
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:25,762
You'll see. It'll be funny.

667
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:27,498
For the others too.

668
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,303
You're single.
You want some candy?

669
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,437
What flavour?

670
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:35,329
Bite it and see.

671
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:37,208
What does single mean?

672
01:00:37,374 --> 01:00:38,876
If you bite it...

673
01:00:39,043 --> 01:00:41,345
You'll see, like I said.

674
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,785
Why are you laughing?

675
01:00:47,985 --> 01:00:50,188
You're in love with Carla!

676
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:57,651
She played the magic candy trick on you!

677
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,433
She kissed the candy before.

678
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,303
Now you have to love Carla.

679
01:01:05,503 --> 01:01:08,273
You have to ask her to marry you!

680
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,235
What if I don't want to?

681
01:01:10,448 --> 01:01:13,018
With magic candy,
you have to want to!

682
01:01:14,146 --> 01:01:16,515
You have to ask her to get married.

683
01:01:17,983 --> 01:01:20,986
You're like daddies.
You don't like love.

684
01:01:23,003 --> 01:01:24,323
My daddy likes love.

685
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,838
My daddy loves love.

686
01:01:27,038 --> 01:01:27,793
Mathias loves Carla!

687
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:30,262
Mathias loves Carla!

688
01:01:30,463 --> 01:01:32,198
Give her a kiss!

689
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,934
A kiss! A kiss!

690
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:40,106
Leave me alone!

691
01:01:48,848 --> 01:01:51,584
"Caroline's little dog..."

692
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:53,720
Yes, Ponette?

693
01:01:53,887 --> 01:01:56,056
My head hurts.

694
01:01:56,723 --> 01:01:59,693
Can I go to sleep in my room?

695
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:02,860
Delphine,
take her to her room.

696
01:02:08,669 --> 01:02:11,268
We'll ask Aurelie for medicine.

697
01:02:12,373 --> 01:02:14,675
You'll see. You'll feel better.

698
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:23,918
Go to sleep now.

699
01:02:43,705 --> 01:02:45,106
God Almighty...

700
01:03:15,137 --> 01:03:16,606
God Almighty,

701
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:20,243
I hope you told

702
01:03:21,144 --> 01:03:24,747
mommy that I prayed.

703
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:27,684
It was a prayer for you

704
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:29,753
and for her too.

705
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:39,029
I'm okay. I'll wait on my bed.

706
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:44,401
That way, it'll be a secret.
No one will see.

707
01:03:47,771 --> 01:03:51,775
This is my second prayer
and I'm very happy.

708
01:03:51,942 --> 01:03:53,444
Thank you, God.

709
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:06,090
If God is almighty,
why won't he make a sign?

710
01:04:08,326 --> 01:04:11,996
He won't talk to me.
My prayers didn't do anything.

711
01:04:12,397 --> 01:04:14,799
Not for mommy, not for nothing.

712
01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:18,136
You just started.
Why do you want signs?

713
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,772
Aurelie told me too.

714
01:04:20,939 --> 01:04:23,174
Maybe your mommy's angry.

715
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:25,443
At me?

716
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:26,511
I don't know.

717
01:04:26,711 --> 01:04:29,414
Ask Aurelie or Ada.

718
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:31,016
They know.

719
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:33,285
I was never dead.

720
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,555
I don't know what happens in heaven.

721
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:40,788
Mom is picking us up tonight.

722
01:04:40,988 --> 01:04:42,494
Pack your things.

723
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:44,496
Don't forget anything.

724
01:04:53,873 --> 01:04:55,141
Watch closely.

725
01:04:55,408 --> 01:04:57,677
This is what you have to do.

726
01:05:03,616 --> 01:05:06,940
- You're scared!
- No.

727
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,155
You'll never be a child of God.

728
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:11,791
- I don't care.
- No, you're just scared.

729
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:14,261
No, God is against me.

730
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:15,962
Why would he be?

731
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:17,497
He's upset.

732
01:05:17,697 --> 01:05:19,833
Yeah, upset.

733
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:23,236
He's angry.

734
01:05:23,604 --> 01:05:26,379
- At who?
- At me.

735
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:27,274
All he told me was:

736
01:05:27,741 --> 01:05:31,612
"Ponette has trials to undergo".

737
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:32,813
That's all.

738
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:35,049
He didn't say anything to me.

739
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,422
See, I wasn't scared!

740
01:05:42,156 --> 01:05:44,025
That makes two trials.

741
01:05:46,694 --> 01:05:50,965
I'm stopping. I'll start again
when God talks to me.

742
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:53,902
He won't
unless you're a child of God.

743
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,876
What if I pass all the tests?

744
01:06:02,978 --> 01:06:04,846
Then he'll talk to you too.

745
01:06:05,146 --> 01:06:06,715
You have to get ahead.

746
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:11,253
If you work on it this week-end
it'll go faster.

747
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:18,093
What should I do?

748
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,295
Prove that you're brave.

749
01:06:30,973 --> 01:06:33,061
It's a really hard one.

750
01:06:33,261 --> 01:06:35,478
It's scary, especially if you hear noises.

751
01:06:38,881 --> 01:06:41,017
It's just for five minutes.

752
01:06:42,585 --> 01:06:44,610
Chickening out?

753
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:50,794
I don't know if this counts
for being a child of God.

754
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:52,362
If it's scary, it does.

755
01:06:52,562 --> 01:06:53,763
And this is scary.

756
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:56,132
And it stinks!

757
01:07:02,372 --> 01:07:05,475
It forces you to be brave, so it counts.

758
01:07:05,742 --> 01:07:07,377
Give me the watch.

759
01:07:07,544 --> 01:07:09,409
You'll stay nearby?

760
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,081
We can't tell you that.

761
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:14,451
Come on.

762
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:20,206
Five minutes.

763
01:07:23,894 --> 01:07:25,796
I'll help you in.

764
01:07:32,937 --> 01:07:36,241
Here, give me the watch.

765
01:07:36,441 --> 01:07:38,576
Ill close it: one, two, three!

766
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:47,786
Move your hand.

767
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:50,338
Look.

768
01:07:50,389 --> 01:07:51,792
Five minutes.

769
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:54,302
When the little hand is on 5.

770
01:07:57,062 --> 01:07:59,398
You're already really brave.

771
01:07:59,598 --> 01:08:04,003
If you tell yourself a Batman story,
it'll go faster.

772
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:08,641
Starting now.

773
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:15,781
- Should we go or stay?
- Let's go!

774
01:08:15,948 --> 01:08:18,251
No, we should stay.
She's crying!

775
01:08:18,418 --> 01:08:19,719
Hurry up!

776
01:08:22,622 --> 01:08:23,856
You did it!

777
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:25,258
Five minutes!

778
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:28,152
Great, Ponette! You did it!

779
01:08:28,352 --> 01:08:29,529
Great!

780
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:31,698
I'll help her out.

781
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:34,267
and then you help me out.

782
01:08:36,002 --> 01:08:37,938
Sure I will.

783
01:08:38,638 --> 01:08:39,973
You'll help me out?

784
01:08:44,945 --> 01:08:46,346
You did it!

785
01:08:46,713 --> 01:08:48,549
You did it, Ponette!

786
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:51,819
Get in there!

787
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,822
On my shoulders.

788
01:08:57,191 --> 01:08:59,460
Climb up, Ponette.

789
01:09:00,327 --> 01:09:01,495
Help me out now.

790
01:09:02,196 --> 01:09:03,764
Okay.

791
01:09:03,964 --> 01:09:04,899
Get in there!

792
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,362
Watch your hands.

793
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,873
Careful.

794
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:12,373
Let's go.

795
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,791
Careful.

796
01:09:19,681 --> 01:09:21,549
Come back!

797
01:09:24,486 --> 01:09:25,654
Who wants to kill me?

798
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:28,290
We always have to kill you!

799
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:30,759
Then you hit me. Forget it!

800
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:33,428
Go rot in jail!

801
01:09:39,368 --> 01:09:40,736
You can kill me.

802
01:09:40,903 --> 01:09:42,104
I don't want to.

803
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,832
I'll lend you my gun
if you do.

804
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,583
I'll shoot you in the head.

805
01:09:53,783 --> 01:09:56,942
Yeah! And Ill scream while I die!

806
01:10:21,912 --> 01:10:23,380
You can't kill anyone else!

807
01:10:23,547 --> 01:10:24,615
Why not?

808
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:27,495
It's my gun. Give it back.

809
01:10:27,684 --> 01:10:29,286
Give it back.

810
01:10:29,953 --> 01:10:32,323
Give it back! It's mine!

811
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:37,628
You killed your mom
because you were mean.

812
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:39,830
Don't try killing anyone else.

813
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:47,061
You already killed your mother!

814
01:10:49,073 --> 01:10:52,408
When someone's mommy dies...

815
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:55,013
it's because her kid was mean.

816
01:10:55,562 --> 01:10:57,329
Get it?

817
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,652
That's not true!

818
01:11:01,586 --> 01:11:03,922
I'm not mean!
You're the mean one!

819
01:11:04,122 --> 01:11:08,136
No, I'm always nice
and my mom's not dead!

820
01:11:09,037 --> 01:11:10,337
Get it?

821
01:11:13,131 --> 01:11:14,884
You're mean!

822
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,136
It serves you right she's dead!

823
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:22,374
If my mommy was here,

824
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:25,511
you'd never have said that.

825
01:11:26,317 --> 01:11:29,881
If my mommy was here...

826
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:31,217
You're mean!

827
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:54,941
What's wrong?

828
01:11:55,108 --> 01:11:56,977
I want to die.

829
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,311
Why?

830
01:11:58,478 --> 01:12:00,180
Because I want to.

831
01:12:02,683 --> 01:12:04,017
Is it Antoine?

832
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:05,385
No, it's me.

833
01:12:05,552 --> 01:12:07,221
What did Antoine say?

834
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:10,190
He said I was really mean...

835
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:15,863
and it serves me right
if my mommy died.

836
01:12:16,263 --> 01:12:18,332
That's dumb.

837
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:21,102
You're nice. I'm nice too.

838
01:12:22,269 --> 01:12:25,773
When you're nice,
you give presents.

839
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:29,310
You can have my Batman
if you want it.

840
01:12:29,977 --> 01:12:30,712
Thanks.

841
01:12:30,878 --> 01:12:34,048
Put it in your pocket
so you don't lose it.

842
01:12:35,683 --> 01:12:38,486
If you're nice,
you should give me something.

843
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:40,555
What will it be?

844
01:12:40,855 --> 01:12:42,657
My daddy's watch.

845
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:45,060
Okay.

846
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,241
- Give it back when I want.
- Okay.

847
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:58,807
Go back to sleep now.

848
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,116
I want to disappear forever.

849
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:08,417
To go where?

850
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,619
To see my mommy.

851
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:13,256
Your mommy may be in heaven.

852
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,228
That's why...

853
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,970
That's why
you have to make me die.

854
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,941
But your father's coming on Friday.

855
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,616
Is it Antoine you want to kill?

856
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,029
Yes.

857
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:43,754
Then you'll stop thinking bout dying?

858
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:45,689
I want to die.

859
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:48,759
Either we kill him
and you don't die...

860
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:54,198
or we don't kill Antoine
and we kill you.

861
01:13:58,369 --> 01:14:00,871
But I don't know how to kill him.

862
01:14:01,906 --> 01:14:04,709
We can buy a real-life gun.

863
01:14:10,915 --> 01:14:14,319
But if we kill him,
Aurelie will yell at us.

864
01:14:14,485 --> 01:14:15,587
No she won't.

865
01:14:17,355 --> 01:14:21,693
From now on,
stick by me during recess.

866
01:14:23,762 --> 01:14:25,864
You're nutty but nice.

867
01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:29,301
I don't want you deciding to die.
Give me a kiss.

868
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,039
Go back to bed now.

869
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:46,385
You still want your mom to come back?

870
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:50,189
If you're having a hard time, I have an idea.

871
01:14:50,356 --> 01:14:53,008
- You know Mathias's Smarties?
- Yes.

872
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,561
- Mathias really loves Carla now.
- That's true.

873
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:58,074
Keep quiet about Carla!

874
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:02,268
If you go to the cemetery,
take some Smarties.

875
01:15:02,435 --> 01:15:04,637
But I'm almost a child of God.

876
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:07,540
But you need to fix her voice.

877
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:11,111
- She'll have no voice?
- She hasn't spoken for a while.

878
01:15:11,277 --> 01:15:12,579
I have to fix it?

879
01:15:12,746 --> 01:15:16,516
Resurrect her with magic Smarties
then have her eat them.

880
01:15:18,351 --> 01:15:19,586
I gave you five.

881
01:15:19,753 --> 01:15:21,355
What's the blue one for?

882
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:24,791
So you don't fall in water.
Green resurrects.

883
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:26,293
And red?

884
01:15:26,493 --> 01:15:27,961
Take your seats!

885
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,932
Come on, you chatterboxes.

886
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,536
The orange one is...

887
01:15:36,403 --> 01:15:39,306
if you want to take a walk,

888
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:42,487
your mommy will too.

889
01:15:53,288 --> 01:15:55,924
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for daddy.

890
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,159
Henri said to come!

891
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:03,498
I'm waiting for daddy.

892
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:08,637
Parents come on Fridays,
after school.

893
01:16:08,804 --> 01:16:10,272
That's tomorrow.

894
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:19,915
Don't stand there. Come with me.

895
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:41,704
Delphine?

896
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:43,640
What is it?

897
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,174
My mommy,

898
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:48,645
she came for real in my dream.

899
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:49,979
And?

900
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,081
And

901
01:16:51,681 --> 01:16:52,949
she came.

902
01:16:53,116 --> 01:16:56,753
She smelled me and I smelled her.

903
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,255
What did she smell like?

904
01:16:58,455 --> 01:16:59,823
She smelled good.

905
01:17:00,557 --> 01:17:04,818
Like candy.
I can still smell her.

906
01:17:05,018 --> 01:17:06,461
Can you?

907
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:09,700
No.

908
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,969
And you know what else?

909
01:17:13,137 --> 01:17:16,640
She held me in her arms.

910
01:17:18,776 --> 01:17:21,646
I don't smell anything.
She went away again.

911
01:20:22,032 --> 01:20:23,200
Mommy!

912
01:20:37,014 --> 01:20:38,315
I'm here.

913
01:20:58,369 --> 01:21:00,238
So I smell like candy?

914
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:03,875
My nutty little girl.

915
01:21:06,711 --> 01:21:09,514
Mathias is right.
You're nutty but nice.

916
01:21:09,748 --> 01:21:11,750
I came so you'd stop worrying.

917
01:21:12,351 --> 01:21:13,652
I came in flesh and blood

918
01:21:13,819 --> 01:21:16,421
so I wouldn't scare you,
but it's really me.

919
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:23,262
I looked for you with God.

920
01:21:23,729 --> 01:21:24,997
I know.

921
01:21:25,197 --> 01:21:27,233
When I felt I was dying,

922
01:21:27,433 --> 01:21:30,503
I could have resisted,
but it was easier not to.

923
01:21:30,669 --> 01:21:33,439
I didn't fight. I let go.

924
01:21:37,577 --> 01:21:40,613
I know it wasn't nice for you.

925
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:44,784
I didn't think of you.
I was mean and selfish.

926
01:21:45,952 --> 01:21:49,856
I did all the trials with Ada.

927
01:21:53,893 --> 01:21:58,131
I said goodbye.
I wasn't bad. It took time.

928
01:21:58,298 --> 01:22:01,969
When I reached the end,
before I went under,

929
01:22:02,369 --> 01:22:05,205
I heard a voice.
It was you calling me.

930
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:08,442
All the time...

931
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:12,179
I called out to you

932
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:15,449
but to tell you
it wasn't worth it.

933
01:22:15,616 --> 01:22:19,086
I called you
then I don't know what happened.

934
01:22:20,254 --> 01:22:22,690
Last night you held me.
I'm sure of it.

935
01:22:22,857 --> 01:22:25,059
You held me too.

936
01:22:26,694 --> 01:22:30,398
Happy spirits like your mommy
never die.

937
01:22:31,666 --> 01:22:33,342
Let's go.

938
01:22:36,671 --> 01:22:37,972
A yellow flower!

939
01:22:38,573 --> 01:22:40,375
What pretty flowers!

940
01:22:41,376 --> 01:22:43,145
I picked it

941
01:22:43,345 --> 01:22:45,013
because your tomb wasn't pretty.

942
01:22:45,881 --> 01:22:46,982
Where was it?

943
01:22:47,415 --> 01:22:48,617
Over there.

944
01:22:48,917 --> 01:22:50,485
On Ulysses's tomb.

945
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,754
Who remembers Ulysses?

946
01:22:53,622 --> 01:22:56,191
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

947
01:22:56,391 --> 01:22:57,726
Isn't it spooky here?

948
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:02,298
Everyone's forgotten Ulysses.

949
01:23:02,464 --> 01:23:05,367
Fortunately,
memories still remember him.

950
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:11,641
It's a memory.
Someone we probably never knew.

951
01:23:11,807 --> 01:23:16,012
A girl's whistling and her
daddy's saying: "That's not nice!"

952
01:23:16,312 --> 01:23:17,447
It is nice!

953
01:23:17,613 --> 01:23:21,617
Maybe it was a long time ago
when only boys whistled.

954
01:23:23,252 --> 01:23:26,890
Maybe it's Ulysses's daughter's memory.

955
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:29,292
Her name is Clorinde.

956
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:31,728
Bye, Clorinde! See you later.

957
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:34,598
Bye, Ulysses.

958
01:23:37,834 --> 01:23:42,406
Tomorrow daddy will take you out
and you'll laugh all day long!

959
01:23:44,074 --> 01:23:46,210
You played with them
twice at night.

960
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:47,077
With who?

961
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:49,213
With Mathias and Delphine.

962
01:23:49,379 --> 01:23:51,782
You didn't play with me or look at me.

963
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:54,084
Never again. I'll play with you.

964
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:56,453
We'll play tonight, if you want.

965
01:23:59,123 --> 01:24:00,358
For real?

966
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:02,460
For real in your dreams.

967
01:24:06,297 --> 01:24:07,899
That's not for real.

968
01:24:08,065 --> 01:24:10,168
When we play it's always for real.

969
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:11,869
Catch me a memory.

970
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:14,539
I don't want to.

971
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,176
I hate children who never want to.

972
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,538
I hate children who complain.

973
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:23,367
Why are you alive?
To want everything.

974
01:24:23,567 --> 01:24:26,651
That's why I came back,
so you'd make me a promise.

975
01:24:26,818 --> 01:24:31,808
Stop crying, stop complaining.
I don't want a sad child.

976
01:24:32,024 --> 01:24:34,324
- Does life scare you?
- No.

977
01:24:34,893 --> 01:24:37,663
No, life's not too much for my girl.

978
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:39,998
No one likes neglectful children.

979
01:24:42,001 --> 01:24:43,602
What's a neglectful child?

980
01:24:44,503 --> 01:24:47,840
- One who forgets to laugh?
- That's right!

981
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,009
A child who forgets to laugh.

982
01:24:50,176 --> 01:24:52,345
You can die,

983
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:53,813
but die alive,

984
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,181
full of life!

985
01:24:56,249 --> 01:24:57,984
Until then, the world is yours.

986
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:01,454
Try everything.
Every single thing.

987
01:25:01,621 --> 01:25:02,989
Then you can die.

988
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:05,091
I have to try everything!

989
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,427
Everything!
Can you not care?

990
01:25:08,795 --> 01:25:11,197
No, you can't.

991
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:14,134
No, you have to care about life.

992
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,381
- Mommy?
- Yes?

993
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:20,907
I'm cold.

994
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,844
That's why I brought a sweater.
You want it?

995
01:25:26,713 --> 01:25:31,085
When I saw you leave, I thought:
"She's going to be cold".

996
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,293
What did you find?

997
01:25:40,628 --> 01:25:41,529
What did you find?

998
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:43,364
- I won't show you.
- Yes you will.

999
01:25:45,032 --> 01:25:45,900
What is it?

1000
01:25:46,067 --> 01:25:47,335
A baby.

1001
01:25:48,603 --> 01:25:51,305
- A baby's memory?
- One who's not born yet.

1002
01:25:51,472 --> 01:25:53,808
- It's in its mommy's belly?
- Yes.

1003
01:25:54,008 --> 01:25:55,989
- Do you know this baby?
- Yes.

1004
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:57,312
Do I know it too?

1005
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,539
- Do I know it?
- Yes!

1006
01:26:03,084 --> 01:26:04,586
What's it doing?

1007
01:26:04,753 --> 01:26:06,254
It's jiggling around.

1008
01:26:06,421 --> 01:26:09,024
I know. It's night time.

1009
01:26:09,191 --> 01:26:12,461
Mommy's asleep
and daddy's playing with the baby.

1010
01:26:12,628 --> 01:26:15,163
He's stroking it in mommy's belly.

1011
01:26:15,364 --> 01:26:18,667
The baby answers him
by thrashing about.

1012
01:26:19,635 --> 01:26:22,137
- With its feet?
- And fists.

1013
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:28,497
And the baby can hear daddy talking.

1014
01:26:30,913 --> 01:26:34,083
And when I wake up,
I see you both playing.

1015
01:26:34,584 --> 01:26:37,186
Yes, we play while you sleep.

1016
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:41,457
So I fall back asleep
because I like it when you play.

1017
01:26:42,892 --> 01:26:43,660
And the baby,

1018
01:26:44,394 --> 01:26:46,429
it can talk too.

1019
01:26:49,065 --> 01:26:52,335
It says: "Don't tickle me!"

1020
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:59,543
Ponette, whenever you want,

1021
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:02,179
jump up and catch a memory of me,

1022
01:27:02,346 --> 01:27:04,359
- Okay.
- You promise?

1023
01:27:12,356 --> 01:27:14,225
Will you stay with me?

1024
01:27:14,658 --> 01:27:16,060
No, I'm dead.

1025
01:27:16,227 --> 01:27:17,695
Not anymore.

1026
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:19,830
I'm still a little dead.

1027
01:27:28,506 --> 01:27:32,210
If you stay,
maybe they'll forget you're here.

1028
01:27:34,379 --> 01:27:36,447
But they'll know I'm here.

1029
01:27:36,648 --> 01:27:39,584
Not if the two of us hide well.

1030
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,222
You can hide with me.

1031
01:27:49,594 --> 01:27:51,149
My head hit the steering wheel

1032
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:52,939
and everything broke.

1033
01:27:53,139 --> 01:27:57,035
My chest broke against it too.
You know that.

1034
01:28:37,477 --> 01:28:39,179
You have to go now.

1035
01:28:39,413 --> 01:28:41,715
Daddy came for you.

1036
01:28:42,516 --> 01:28:45,308
Go and be happy with him.

1037
01:28:45,508 --> 01:28:47,788
I'm not sad
when you're happy with him.

1038
01:28:52,793 --> 01:28:55,129
We're going to Lyon, to the fair.

1039
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,659
Go then.
Don't forget I love you.

1040
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:00,034
Don't forget.

1041
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:02,970
Goodbye, Ponette.

1042
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:04,906
You have to go now.

1043
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:07,428
Go.

1044
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:08,976
No.

1045
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:12,113
Turn around.

1046
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,060
Do you love me

1047
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:27,496
for real?

1048
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:30,226
Oh yes, I love you.

1049
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,701
Go now.

1050
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,783
- Have some candy.
- No.

1051
01:29:36,405 --> 01:29:37,673
Go see daddy.

1052
01:30:07,804 --> 01:30:08,705
Ponette!

1053
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,208
Where were you?

1054
01:30:13,843 --> 01:30:17,798
With my mommy.
I saw her all day long.

1055
01:30:17,998 --> 01:30:21,251
You went to the cemetery alone?
Are you crazy?

1056
01:30:22,653 --> 01:30:23,820
How was it?

1057
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:25,422
It was nice.

1058
01:30:26,657 --> 01:30:29,839
She came back in flesh and blood.

1059
01:30:30,416 --> 01:30:32,463
I wasn't even scared.

1060
01:30:39,437 --> 01:30:42,306
She gave me her red sweater.

1061
01:30:42,673 --> 01:30:46,310
I haven't seen it in a while.
She was right to.

1062
01:30:47,245 --> 01:30:48,880
Yeah, but...

1063
01:30:49,213 --> 01:30:52,517
the thing is
she'll never come back.

1064
01:30:52,684 --> 01:30:54,018
She told me so.

1065
01:30:54,252 --> 01:30:56,454
She can't keep making round trips.

1066
01:30:56,754 --> 01:30:57,789
No.

1067
01:30:57,956 --> 01:31:02,494
But there are holes in the ground
and you can come back.

1068
01:31:16,575 --> 01:31:19,378
She told me to learn to be happy.

1069
01:31:58,952 --> 01:32:01,788
She told me to learn to be happy.

1070
01:32:07,629 --> 01:32:07,629
