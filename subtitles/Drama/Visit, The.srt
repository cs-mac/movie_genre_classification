00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,058
WOMAN:                          
At the end of high school,      

3
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,994
I fell in love with             
a substitute English teacher.   

4
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,662
It was quite a scandal.         

5
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,865
    Corin didn't start out      
    a bad guy though.           

6
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:10,502
    We were together            
    about 10 years              
    and we had two kids.        

7
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,173
And then he fell in love        
with someone in a Starbucks     

8
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:17,743
and moved to                    
Palo Alto, California.          

9
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,146
Kind of severed relations       
with the three of us.           

10
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:26,518
    My parents,                 
    if I were defending them,   
    which I'm not,              

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,055
had said back in the day        
that he had an "impatient eye." 

12
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,257
    They didn't like him.       

13
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,562
    Week I left,                
    things... escalated.        

14
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:39,798
My parents cursed at me,        
which was, like, crazy unusual. 

15
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,303
    And it ended one afternoon  
    very badly.                 

16
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,139
    I left at 19.               

17
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:50,342
    Haven't spoken              
    to my parents               
    in 15 years.                

18
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,646
Whatever.                       
That's just the history.        

19
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,750
Recently, my parents            
looked me up on the Internet.   

20
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,454
Asked to meet                   
their grandchildren.            
Spend a week with them.         

21
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,757
I looked my parents up.         
They have a counseling Web site.

22
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,327
(chuckles)                      
People love 'em.                

23
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,163
Ironically,                     
they counsel people,            
which is a hoot.                

24
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,398
    Whatever.                   

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,301
I told the kids.                
They said they wanted to go.    

26
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,338
I told them I didn't            
want them to go. They said      
they were gonna go anyway.      

27
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,507
They're brats.                  
What can I tell you?            

28
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,276
And my 15-year-old              

29
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,278
wants to make a documentary     
about this.                     

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,480
        GIRL:                   
        Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
        Go back.                

31
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,718
    Describe the events         
    on the day you left         
    your parents' farm at 19.   

32
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,523
I did something                 
I don't choose to tell you.     

33
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:41,960
If they choose to tell you,     
that's their right. Okay?       

34
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,196
                GIRL:           
                I wanna do this 
                for you.        

35
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,598
MOM:                            
Listen, they're good people.    

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
Ask them.                       

37
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,638
Can I be done with my part?     
I still gotta                   
get you guys packed.            

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,209
<i>떰 (speakers:</i>                   
<i>    chorus vocalizing)</i>          

39
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,780
I'm on the text                 
with two separate girls.        

40
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,316
            It's important      
            you put the word    
            "separate" in there,

41
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,285
    in case we thought          
    they were conjoined twins.  

42
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:08,320
    MOM:                        
    Explain "on the text."      

43
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,821
            GIRL:               
            In communication.   
            Nothing more.       

44
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,323
No, they're on deck.            

45
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,992
    You are 13!                 
    There's no deck to be on.   

46
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,562
    GIRL:                       
    I've seen him in the shower.
    That's eerily accurate.     

47
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:19,831
You don't even                  
have boobs!                     
            Stop, both of you!  

48
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,300
I<i> need</i> to text.                 

49
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,901
                (laughs)        
                It's one week.  

50
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,837
        Your phones won't work  
        all the way out there.  
        You'll be home Saturday.

51
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,207
            GIRL:               
            Are you holding     
            my camera properly? 

52
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,576
Swerve, girl.                   
Okay?                           

53
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,813
Oh.                             

54
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,821

(track bell ringing)            

56
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,930
    (no audible dialogue)       

57
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,924
GIRL:                           
Our mother, Loretta Jamison,    

58
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:24,029
is dating an eligible           
and rather rakish-looking man   
named Miguel Diego Torres.      

59
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,064
He's in love with her.          

60
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,966
        We've decided           
        to promote this union   

61
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,534
            by giving them time.

62
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,069
        They're going on a trip.

63
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,572
Mm-hmm.                         
A Royal Caribbean cruise.       

64
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,741
Your basic beach cruise.        

65
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:39,044
        We're visiting          
        our grandparents,       
        whom we have never seen.

66
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,980
        We don't know           
        their temperament       
        or their proclivities.  

67
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,617
Yeah.                           
And we don't even know          
what they like.                 

68
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,820
They--                          
They could be scrapbookers.     

69
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,990
They could think                
boy bands are cute.             

70
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,128
    - Ticket?                   
    - GIRL:                     
      Two for Masonville, PA.   

71
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,163
Our grandparents                
are meeting us.                 

72
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,434
        You a, uh, film prodigy?
        You know, I used to be  
        a pretty good actor.    

73
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,836
GIRL:                           
Oh, my, uh--                    
my camera light's blinking.     

74
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,506
    "I am disgraced, impeached  
     and baffled here."         
Battery pack is low.            

75
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,808
    "Pierced to the soul with   
     slander's venomed spear--" 

76
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,978
Unfortunately,                  
I'm just gonna have to          
shut the camera off.            

77
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,513
(microphone rumbling)           

78
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,119
            (door closes)       

79
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:25,424
Since our father left,          
my-- my brother's had           
a preoccupation with germs.     

80
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:30,295
The psychologist                
we saw for a month said it was  
his way of controlling things.  

81
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,197
                    (door opens)

82
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,299
떰 (imitating beats)            

83
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,335
    (rapping)                   
     Girl, I'm chillin' again 

84
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,469
         I'm feelin' again    

85
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,204
             I'm like Iron Man 
              and Batman       

86
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,039
             I'm a hero again  
              Oh               

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,142
 You think I'm little,         
  but last month I grew         
  an inch and a quarter again  

88
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,945
     You think you're          
      too good for me,          
      but that's really a joke 

89
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,046
     'Cause, see,              
      that doesn't bother me   

90
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,482
     'Cause I'm not            
      a sensitive bloke, oh    

91
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,952
     Now, in the end,          
      you'll be in my bed,      
      we won't be just friends 

92
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,822
         You'll write          
          inappropriate texts   
          and hit "send"       

93
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,558
     We share a Starbucks      
      Frappuccino blend, oh    

94
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,293
         And see, this isn't   
          just philosophy      

95
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,128
         It's based on science,
          you see              

96
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,831
 Mr. Singh, my pediatrician,   
  just confirmed for me        

97
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,334
 You tall skanks,              
  I'm going through puberty    

98
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,203
                 Ho 떰         
    Ooh!                        

99
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,905
                Whoo!           
Pound.                          

100
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,674
Whoa.                           

101
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,744
    Maybe I can rap at the end  
    of your documentary.        

102
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,145
GIRL:                           
Right.                          

103
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,514
Because that's how              
all Oscar-winning               
documentaries end--             

104
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,750
with songs of misogyny.         

105
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,322
GIRL:                           
This is where                   
our mom grew up.                

106
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,759
When she left,                  
she thought she was with        
the man of her dreams.          

107
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,934
(bell tolling)                  

108
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,375
        WOMAN (laughing):       
        Oh!                     

109
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,577
            Hi.                 
                Hi.             
                (laughs)        

110
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,513
    MAN:                        
    Becca, right?               
    Yeah?                       

111
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,648
            BECCA:              
            Oh!                 

112
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,386
This is                         
Marja Bella Jamison.            

113
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,722
Uh, my-- my nana.               

114
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,492
She's a good cook.              
And, uh, we--                   
we have the same eyes.          

115
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,363
            And this is Fredrick
            Spencer Jamison.    

116
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,231
                My-- My Pop Pop.

117
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:17,402
        He's a farmer now,      
        but they also volunteer 
        as counselors.          

118
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,872
BECCA:                          
How do you feel about           
your new grandparents, Tyler?   

119
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,741
        It's all good.          

120
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,911
    I mean, they don't even know
    who One Direction is, so--  

121
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,480
Nana, d-did you                 
make these pretzels?            

122
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,415
                    Yes, I did. 

123
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,284
        (Pop Pop laughing)      

124
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,619
NANA:                           
Thank you so much.              
        (kisses)                

125
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,021
    Yes.                        

126
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,601
NANA:                           
Here we are.                    

127
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,737
(car doors                      
 opening, closing)              

128
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,842
(Pop Pop sighs)                 
BECCA: Tyler, look!             
It's Mom's tree swing.          

129
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,945
Okay, on camera,                
tell us what Mom told you.      

130
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,281
    She used to wait out here   
    on this when her friends    
    would come over.            

131
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:07,419
BECCA: This is                  
the perfect cinematic image     
to open the documentary.        

132
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,987
Go near it.                     

133
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,358
Wait!                           
Wait, don't touch it.           

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,194
Just let it                     
organically swing.              

135
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,306
                (hinge creaking)

136
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,476
BECCA:                          
We're entering the home         
that Mom grew up in.            

137
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,845
(Nana, Pop Pop                  
 talking, faint)                

138
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,015
Look!                           

139
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,518
There's the clock               
that she told us about.         

140
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,053
            (ticking)           

141
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,557
            Do you play sports? 

142
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,325
I don't like sports.            

143
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,060
            He used to.         

144
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,329
        What<i> do</i> you do?         

145
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,798
        Why are your pants      
        so low?                 

146
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,300
    I rap.                      

147
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,469
            It's a form         
            of modern poetry.   

148
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:01,740
        If you give him a topic,
        he'll extemporaneously  
        rhyme on the subject.   

149
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,809
        His stage nom de plume  
        is "T-Diamond Stylus."  

150
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,113
Go ahead.                       
Nana, give him anything.        

151
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,483
                Is food okay?   
                I like food.    

152
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,485
    Yeah.                       
    Of course.                  

153
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,053
                    How about...

154
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,757
            pineapple           
            upside-down cake?   

155
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,192
    Yeah.                       
    Sure. Why not?              

156
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,527
    Okay.                       
            (chuckles)          

157
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,129
    Mm-hmm.                     

158
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,766
    Okay.                       

159
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,135
    Got it.                     
    Okay.                       

160
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,072
 The girls, they like me      

161
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,407
 They think I'm sweet          
  like candy                   

162
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,876
 One girl looked at me         
  like I was a Hershey... bar  

163
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,444
 Her name was Angie           

164
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,580
 And a few tall girls,         
  they just looked at me        
  blankly                      

165
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,049
 So here's the thing           
  you gotta understand          
  about me                     

166
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,685
 I got more rhymes             
  than a beehive has bees      

167
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,554
 So it didn't surprise,        
  confuse or make me say        
  "For heaven's sake"          

168
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,890
 When a Hawaiian girl          
  with a balance disorder said 

169
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:55,026
 "You remind me of a pineapple 
  upside-down cake"            

170
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,561
     Ho! 떰                    

171
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,196
            POP POP:            
            Whoa!               

172
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,365
                (both laughing) 

173
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,634
                    Yes, sir!   
        Yeah?                   

174
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,406
BECCA (whispering):             
Mom's room.                     

175
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,709
                POP POP:        
                It's not fancy. 

176
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,378
I call the main bed.            
            BECCA:              
            No pre-calls!       

177
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,448
No, no, no! I got here first!   
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!     

178
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,817
            Rock-paper-scissors?
Okay.                           

179
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,654
    TOGETHER:                   
    Rock, paper, scissors!      
    Shoot!                      

180
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,923
                    Do it again.

181
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,925
    Rock, paper, scissors.      
    Shoot.                      

182
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,660
                    (chuckles)  

183
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,596
        Have a nice rest        
        all the way over there. 

184
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,164
    (Tyler sighs)               

185
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,267
You guys are good kids.         
This is gonna be a great week.  

186
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,803
By the way,                     
there's mold in the basement.   

187
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,139
    We don't want you guys      
    to get sick. Yeah.          

188
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,575
I-I got, like, no bars!         

189
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,210
    None.                       

190
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,779
BECCA:                          
Just keep unpacking.            

191
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,115
No, don't--                     
don't look at the camera.       

192
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,750
There we go.                    

193
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,022
This is so beautiful--          
Stop looking at the ca--        

194
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,024
Just unpack                     
like you normally would.        

195
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,960
But I'm not here, okay?         
Just be-- be--                  

196
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,062
(chuckles)                      
Be natural.                     

197
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,966
Is this natural enough?         

198
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,367
BECCA:                          
You're such an idiot.           

199
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,411
BECCA:                          
These are the people            
in Nana and Pop Pop's life.     

200
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,882
        You have to burn them   
        a little.               

201

298
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,093
Well, I-- I got                 
that kind of sound.             
                    Mmm.        

299
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,861
People say.                     

300
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,930
        Come, Becca, darling.   
        Eat.                    

301
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,598
            (chuckles)          

302
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,769
                (horse snorting)
BECCA:                          
Pop Pop.                        

303
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,874
(grunting)                      
(wood splitting)                

304
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,609
Pop Pop?                        

305
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,715
(Becca gasps)                   

306
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,951
        You need me?            

307
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,020
(horse whinnies)                

308
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,389
    Your grandmother is fine.   

309
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,659
She had a little bit            
of a stomach flu last night.    

310
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,131
    Must have been              
    a 24-hour thing.            

311
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,434
I-I knew it was                 
something like that.            

312
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,805
    She's an old lady, Becca.   

313
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,142
        She gets sick sometimes.

314
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,311
Yeah, of course.                

315
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,147
                        BECCA:  
                        Tyler!  

316
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,085
    Pop Pop said he'd take us   
    into town this afternoon    

317
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,821
    to shoot some of            
    Mom's old hangouts.         

318
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,556
            Tyler!              

319
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,293
Raaar!                          
            (screams)           

320
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,430
You can play                    
hide-and-seek down here.        

321
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,399
There's, um-- There's           
lots of visual tension.         

322
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,235
    Mom's hide-and-seek place.  

323
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,108
You better hide,                
my ethnically confused friend.  

324
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,843
                One Mississippi.

325
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,579
                Two Mississippi.

326
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,748
            Three Mississippi.  

327
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,783
            Four Mississippi.   

328
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,286
            Five Mississippi!   

329
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,522
                Ready or not,   
                here I come!    

330
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,366
            I see you,          
            you little pudge.   

331
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,613
    I'll have to use strategy.  

332
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,417
    He's faster, but I'm--      
    I'm smarter, by at least    
    two standard deviations.    

333
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,554
Here I come!                    

334
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,022
                    (screams)   

335
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,525
                (Becca panting) 

336
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,529
(chuckles)                      
Right past me.                  

337
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,235
    (panting)                   

338
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,443
(panting)                       

339
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,914
                Becca?          

340
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,286
Becca?                          

341
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,423
    (growling)                  

342
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,226
    Here I come, Tyler.         
    Here I come.                
(Tyler gasping)                 

343
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,729
(Tyler screaming)               

344
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,901
            (whispers):         
            Tyler? Tyler?       

345
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,037
TYLER:                          
Oh, my God-- Ohh! Oh!           

346
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,206
TYLER:                          
Stop! Stop!                     

347
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,475
(high-pitched giggling)         

348
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,683
(laughing)                      
I'm gonna get you.              

349
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,553
I'm coming to get you,          
Becca!                          

350
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,688
                (gasps)         

351
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,294
                (Tyler groans)  

352
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,601
            (growls, laughing)  

353
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,078
            (sighs)             

354
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,314
        I'm making              
        chicken pot pie.        

355
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,625
TYLER:                          
What the hell was that?         

356
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,527
                (gasps)         

357
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,634
            (knocking)          

358
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,571
BECCA:                          
Can I help you?                 

359
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,573
            Hi.                 
            Uh, I'm Doctor Sam. 

360
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,009
    I work at the hospital where
    your grandparents counsel.  

361
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,478
        You must be Becca.      

362
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,447
        Are you making a movie? 

363
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:59,250
        I used to be an actor   
        back in my day.         

364
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,285
            "Life's but         
             a walking shadow,  

365
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,754
    a poor player that struts   
    and frets his hour--"       

366
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,824
Did you wanna talk              
to Nana and Pop Pop?            
        Yes. Are they around?   

367
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,293
No, th-they're                  
taking a walk, I think.         

368
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,195
You just missed them.           

369
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,697
                Okay.           

370
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,800
        Well, uh, tell 'em      
        I stopped by.           

371
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,036
    They were supposed to       
    volunteer a few days ago.   

372
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,638
        I tried calling.        

373
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,641
    I just wanted to make sure  
    everything was okay.        

374
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:28,879
I think the volunteer stuff is  
getting too stressful for them, 
although they won't admit it.   

375
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,948
Oh, they're fine.               

376
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,583
        Well, glad to hear it.  

377
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,987
        Tell them there's       
        a lot of excitement     
        down at the hospital.   

378
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,324
        I, uh-- I can't wait    
        to tell 'em.            
        I know they love gossip.

379
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,960
I'll tell them.                 
Nice to meet you.               

380
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,998
    12:15 PM. Tuesday.          

381
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,502
    Tyler Jamison,              
    known to most ladies        
    as T-Diamond Stylus,        

382
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,472
    investigates                
    what is in the shed.        

383
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,974
    This is                     
    an isolated farm.           

384
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,743
    People sneaking around.     

385
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,613
    Is it dead bodies?          

386
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,083
    Is it dead bodies?          

387
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,087
    Is it dead bodies?          

388
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,534
(lock slides)                   
(hinge creaking)                

389
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,102
(door closes)                   

390
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,105
            (thumping)          

391
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,122
    I'm gonna go to the shed.   

392
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,537
Ugh.                            

393
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,772
Smells like ass in here.        

394
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,883
            (flies buzzing)     

395
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,586
I'm--                           

396
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,456
I-I'm moving closer             
to the suspicious pile.         

397
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,659
        (buzzing continues)     

398
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,769
Oh, shit!                       

399
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,171
(groaning)                      

400
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,441
Oh, goddamn it!                 

401
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:40,144
(groaning continues)            

402
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,179
Ohh! Sarah McLachlan!           

403
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,183
                        Tyler.  

404
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,885
What the hell, Nana?            

405
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:53,591
        Your Pop Pop            
        has incontinence.       

406
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,759
    He hides his accidents      
    in the shed,                

407
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:59,530
        and then I think        
        he burns them           
        out in the field.       

408
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,834
    He's such a physical man,   
    he gets ashamed.            

409
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:09,640
    You must be disappointed    
    in your grandparents.       

410
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,842
        I'm sorry               
        we ruined things.       

411
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,545
        We're really trying.    

412
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,949
        I'll make you           
        some bread pudding.     

413
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:22,953
            Are we okay?        

414
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,225
                Yeah.           
                Yeah, I'm good, 
                Nana.           

415
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,128
                Good.           

416
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,630
                    (door slams)

417
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:35,332
    My mom's a classic          
    narrative character.        

418
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:38,869
She says things like            
"Things don't work out for me," 
and then makes it happen.       

419
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,337
                    (footsteps) 

420
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:44,675
    She needs the elixir,       
    or all of her relationships 
    will fall apart.            

421
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,477
                        TYLER:  
                        Becca!  

422
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:51,348
    Pop Pop, we play this game  
    where you have to           
    point to a building,        

423
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,552
    and you have to say         
    who lives there             
    and what they secretly do.  

424
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,120
        Becca,                  
        do that police station. 

425
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,025
                A police officer
                named Jerry     
                works there,    

426
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:03,527
            but he never        
            comes in to work,   

427
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,429
                he never answers
                the phone,      

428
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,432
        because all he          
        really wants to do      
        is be a Latin dancer.   

429
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,867
(all laugh)                     

430
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,169
    TYLER:                      
    Ooh, okay, I'll go.         

431
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,072
That huge brick building        
back there is a sneaker factory,

432
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,041
        and a woman named Sally 
        works there--           

433
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,543
Oh, that's Maple Shade,         
actually.                       

434
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,545
    Yeah, M-Mom said            
    you guys volunteer there.   

435
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,048
Yeah, every Tuesday             
and Thursday.                   

436
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,751
They're good people.            
There's just nobody there       
to take care of 'em.            

437
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,956
    I have to find              
    my Maple Shade badge        
    and we'll visit.            

438
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:40,097
Join us on a journey into       
young Loretta Jamison's past.   

439
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,033
This was young Loretta's        
high school.                    

440
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,604
Young Loretta and her friends   
used to hang out at this sign.  

441
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:50,140
We will now go around           
to the back                     

442
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:54,812
to catch a glimpse of young,    
mischievous Loretta's locker    
through a window.               

443
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:57,081
BECCA:                          
Pop Pop,                        
was Mom a good student?         

444
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,649
            We have to go.      

445
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,318
            That fellow         
            keeps staring at us.

446
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,820
H-He's--                        
He's not, Pop Pop.              

447
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,089
            Damn it,            
            he keeps stopping.  

448
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,091
Pop Pop?                        
        Pretending              
        like he's not watching. 

449
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,760
What are you doing?             
Pop Pop, stop!                  
    Hey.                        

450
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,829
    Hey!                        
    Stop following me.          

451
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,430
No, no, no,                     
don't--                         
    He's following me!          

452
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:16,066
    Whoa, whoa, whoa!           
    I'm not following you!      
    I don't know who you are!   

453
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:19,103
            Stop following me,  
            you cross-eyed--    
    Pop Pop! Pop Pop!           

454
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,405
    You're hurting him!         
                    Get off me! 

455
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,073
    Hey.                        

456
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,175
                What's          
                your problem?   
            Tyler.              

457
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,946
    He doesn't know you,        
    Pop Pop.                    

458
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:30,514
            Oh, man.            

459
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,683
            Yeah, my mistake.   

460
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,085
        I'm fine.               
        I'm-I'm--               

461
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,687
            I'm sorry.          

462
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,858
TYLER:                          
That was crazy.                 
He's as strong as a wrestler.   

463
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,627
BECCA:                          
He's old.                       
They get confused.              

464
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,130
Don't freak out.                
Old people get paranoid.        

465
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:49,166
And he's a country guy.         
All he does is chop wood.       

466
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:59,209
TYLER:                          
Hey. You still don't            
want to talk about it?          

467
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:20,698
        (thumping, creaking)    

468
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,374
        (thumping,              
         creaking continue)     

469
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,553
                What is that?   
    (rhythmic thumping)         

470
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,589
TYLER:                          
Okay, we think there's          
someone outside the door.       

471
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,691
It's 10:47.                     

472
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,927
    (thumping, squealing)       
Open the door, Becca.           

473
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,363
                    No way.     

474
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,132
Okay, keep recording this.      

475
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,675
            (loud thump)        

476
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,910
Come on. Let's see              
what's out there.               

477
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,847
            (thumping, scraping)

478
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,749
        No, something's wrong.  

479
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,917
I'm opening the door,           
Becca.                          

480
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,721
I'm opening the door now,       
Becca.                          

481
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,957
                I don't think   
                you should.     

482
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,461
Here I go.                      
I'm gonna open the door.        

483
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,931
            Well, open it then! 
            Why do you keep     
            talking about it?   

484
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,801
            (thumping continues)

485
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,644
        (groans)                

486
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,780
            (thumping,          
             scraping continues)

487
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,482
        Jesus, Becca,           
        I'm blind.              

488
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,121
            Pop Pop?            

489
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,092
            Pop Pop?            

490
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,928
                I gotta tell you
                the truth.      

491
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,330
        She has                 
        a diagnosed disorder.   

492
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,167
            Apparently,         
            many elderly people 
            have it.            

493
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:07,137
Why was she throwing up         
like that?                      

494
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,772
                        Well... 

495
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,942
sometimes                       
she gets it in her head         
that she ate something,         

496
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:15,112
and it's inside her--           

497
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,513
(sighs)                         

498
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,849
and trying to crawl out.        

499
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:22,119
It's called sundowning.         
It's a kind of dementia.        

500
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,454
It's triggered by nightfall.    

501
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,290
BECCA:                          
This is real?                   

502
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:30,160
It's like somebody              
talking in their sleep,         
is how I was explained it.      

503
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,629
It's probably best              
that we just call it a rule     

504
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,632
that you two shouldn't          
come out of your room           
after 9:30 PM.                  

505
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,267
    Deal?                       

506
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,804
Is that a deal?                 
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,498
Get farther in there.           

604
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,674
All the way in.                 

605
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,425
Okay.                           
I'll star in your movie.        

606
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,831
            If you could        
            be any animal,      
            what would you be?  

607
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,501
    Is there a right answer?    

608
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:48,071
        No. These questions     
        are intended            
        to get you loosened up. 

609
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,739
            Oh.                 

610
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,244
        A grizzly bear.         
                (Becca laughs)  

611
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,480
                    I think     
                    we're warm. 

612
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:00,450
        Mom told me             
        that you and Pop Pop    
        were very much in love. 

613
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,554
            Where did you       
            first meet Pop Pop? 

614
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,656
        In a garden.            

615
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,758
                And what did you
                think of him?   

616
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,428
        Oh, he was handsome.    

617
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,497
        He has a very strong    
        personality.            

618
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,167
                This is great.  

619
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:19,536
            Uh, we'll come back 
            to that.            

620
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:22,539
            Right now,          
            I want to talk about
            something else.     

621
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,708
            I know it happened  
            a long time ago,    

622
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,777
            but what happened   
            on the day Mom left?

623
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,780
            She won't tell me.  

624
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,519
                    Did she do  
                    something?  

625
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,723
                        Nana?   

626
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,258
                        Nana.   

627
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,426
        (whimpering)            

628
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,762
                Nana!           
                Don't answer    
                that question.  

629
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:55,438
    No more questions           
    about Loretta Jamison.      

630
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,343
        Maybe I can ask about-- 
    I don't want to star        
    in your movie.              

631
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,479
            Okay.               

632
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,482
        It's Wednesday night.   
        Three nights left.      

633
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,451
        T-Diamond Stylus        
        is gonna find out       

634
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,820
            what exactly        
            is going on.        

635
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,555
            What are you doing? 

636
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,292
        I'm putting the camera  
        out tonight.            

637
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,294
        It's like we're living  
        with a werewolf.        

638
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,329
        You can't record her.   
        Swerve.                 

639
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,264
        Look, I know you won't  
        understand this         

640
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,434
    because your brain          
    isn't fully developed yet,  
    but you can't do this.      

641
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,904
                        Why?    
It's exploitative.              
I have cinematic standards.     

642
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,005
                    (laughs)    
                    No.         

643
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,108
    No one gives a crap about   
    cinematic standards, okay?  

644
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,943
            It's not the 1800s. 

645
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,812
                Have you seen   
                reality TV?     

646
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,982
<i>Housekeepers of Houston</i>         
has, like, a billion viewers.   

647
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,152
Look, if one of us isn't        
participating in the event,     
we can't record it.             

648
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,953
It's just what's ethical.       

649
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:46,823
No offense to Ryan Seacrest     
or whoever came up with         
<i>The Housekeepers of Houston.</i>    

650
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,893
                You think       
                you're so great,
                don't you?      

651
00:38:57,636 --> 00:39:00,370
    I hope things               
    don't get weirder.          

652
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,373
'Cause I'm at my limit.         

653
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,847
(thumping)                      

654
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,916
                TYLER:          
                Show the clock. 
                Show the clock. 

655
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:18,555
            This is what Pop Pop
            was talking about.  
(thumping continues)            

656
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,725
        The werewolf is real.   
Wait.                           

657
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,128
            She's sundowning.   
(running footsteps)             

658
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,397
    We're participating in this.

659
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,733
     You're not being           
    <i> Housekeepers of Houston.</i>   

660
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,002
Wait.                           

661
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:36,072
If you're gonna open the door,  
just open it for a little bit.  

662
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,910
(running footsteps              
 continue)                      

663
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,093
    (hinge creaking)            

664
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,804
            (footsteps running) 

665
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,843
(Tyler gasps)                   

666
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,959
(Tyler gasps)                   

667
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:36,199
She's supposed to do that?      
It's just like someone          
talking in their sleep.         

668
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,735
You used to                     
talk in your sleep              
till you were seven.            

669
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:41,838
Dad used to come in             
and quiet you down.             

670
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,775
                    (thumping)  

671
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,131
        Hey, Becca.             

672
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,167
        Who am I?               

673
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,309
BECCA:                          
T.                              

674
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,010
T.                              

675
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,746
(whispers):                     
T.                              

676
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:28,184
        There's a family        
        of foxes.               

677
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,786
        You're going to         
        miss it.                

678
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,821
We're coming!                   
We're coming!                   

679
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,826
Just stop.                      

680
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,471
        Hey, why is Nana        
        staring into the well?  
Come on. Let's go.              

681
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,139
Come on.                        
Enough of that.                 

682
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,075
I don't know.                   
Come on.                        

683
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,851
            Mise-en-scene.      

684
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,287
You know,                       
y-you're not as dumb            

685
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,223
as your performance             
on the standardized tests       
would indicate.                 

686
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,992
            Oh-- Oh!            

687
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,194
        Forgot I had            
        something for you.      

688
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,570
When you think of Dad now,      
in California,                  

689
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,705
do you still                    
like him?                       

690
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,842
            I don't know.       
            Stuff happens.      

691
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:28,478
    No, but Dad is hilarious.   
    Dad's funny.                

692
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,081
        He sent the funny card  
        of the fat lady         
        on the boardwalk.       

693
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,816
        Do you remember that?   

694
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:36,052
What do you mean,               
"stuff happens"?                

695
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,757
            People leave        

696
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,593
    'cause they find something  
    they like better.           

697
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:46,763
So you don't                    
feel bad?                       

698
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,599
                No.             

699
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,835
You're not                      
being truthful.                 

700
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:55,772
        Well, you can believe   
        what you want,          

701
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,941
        but this is how I feel. 

702
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,777
Make me                         
believe you.                    

703
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:10,453
    So, I'm on the Titans       
    pee-wee football team,      
    and it was third down.      

704
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:13,122
        It was at the end,      
        and we were leading.    

705
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:16,526
    So if we stopped 'em,       
    we probably win the game.   
Give me context.                

706
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:19,629
How old are you?                
            I'm eight.          

707
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,566
        So, I'm free safety,    

708
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:28,705
which means that I'm supposed   
to tackle the guy if he makes   
it pass to people on the line.  

709
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,740
        So their running back   
        punches the hole--      

710
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,142
Okay, am I supposed to be       
following these terms?          

711
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:36,312
Are these phrases supposed      
to mean something to me?        
            Just listen.        

712
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,751
        So their running back,  
        who's big,              
        makes it past the line, 

713
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,554
        and I'm the only one    
        left to tackle him.     

714
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:47,957
All I gotta do is tackle him,   
put my hands around him         
and tackle him, but...          

715
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,328
        I just stand there.     

716
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:57,100
    They call it "freezing."    
    And I could hear            
    everyone yelling.           

717
00:43:57,102 --> 00:44:00,970
        Coach Daugherty. Dad.   
        All my teammates.       

718
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,741
        He gets the first down  
        and runs and runs,      

719
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,676
        and the other team      
        is celebrating,         

720
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,911
        and I'm still           
        standing there.         

721
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:13,750
            Same place.         

722
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,155
    Then the assistant coach    
    came and got me,            

723
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,291
    and Dad patted me           
    on the shoulder and then    
    went to the car, and he--   

724
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:25,361
    he never told me            
    he was angry or anything.   

725
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,832
You think Dad didn't            
say anything and left           

726
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:34,237
because you didn't              
tackle another eight-year-old   
in a game five years ago?       

727
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:41,210
        Well, when you          
        say it like that,       
        it sounds stupid.       

728
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,118
                BECCA:          
                Why are we here?

729
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,354
She was staring                 
at something.                   

730
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:03,032
        So, what did you find?  

731
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:06,235
It's only water.                

732
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:14,043
So, I just read these           
in order?                       

733
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,882
"If you could be any animal,    
 what would it be?"             

734
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,518
I feel like a douche,           
Becca.                          
            Shut up.            

735
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,253
        I would be a dolphin.   

736
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,389
        It's an intuitive       
        and highly intelligent  
        creature                

737
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:30,059
    with great power and poetry 
    in its movements.           

738
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,061
How come you like               
the pizza delivery guy,         

739
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,264
even though he has              
all that ratchet acne?          

740
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,970
Please answer                   
the question.                   

741
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,276
            He's kind.          

742
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,113
        He has kind eyes.       

743
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:56,452
How come you don't              
look at yourself                
in the mirror?                  

744
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,522
            Okay, fine.         

745
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:01,224
        What's this now?        

746
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:04,727
Besides when you're editing,    
y-you don't like                
looking at yourself.            

747
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:06,562
You never                       
look at yourself                
in the mirror.                  

748
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,031
You comb your hair              
with your back                  
to the mirror.                  

749
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,467
And I see you                   
brush your teeth.               

750
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,970
You look down                   
the whole time.                 

751
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,208
Your sweater's                  
inside out.                     

752
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,977
Did you know that?              

753
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,648
Did you see that                
in the mirror                   
this morning?                   

754
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,350
Is that correct?                

755
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:34,957
It doesn't                      
feel so good,                   
does it?                        

756
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:40,596
    Are you changing            
    the focal length            
    of the lens?                

757
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,498
No. I don't even know           
what that is.                   

758
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,234
    Are you zooming?            

759
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,136
No.                             

760
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:53,743
So, do you admit that           
you don't look at yourself,     

761
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:56,112
or are you gonna                
keep lying?                     

762
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:59,448
When do you think               
I started doing that?           

763
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,017
TYLER:                          
You know when.                  

764
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:05,087
That's not true,                
asshole.                        

765
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,825
TYLER:                          
You think you're worthless.     

766
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:10,860
Admit it.                       

767
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,533
            (crying)            

768
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:22,371
        He gave me a card       
        when he left.           

769
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,342
            A card.             

770
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,383
    Old footage of us as kids.  

771
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:38,254
    Was thinking of using it    
    in the doc.                 

772
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,391
    I refuse to use anything    
    that has my dad in it.      

773
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:45,895
        That would mean         
        I forgive him.          

774
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:53,402
(footsteps)                     

775
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:56,572
TYLER:                          
Nana?                           

776
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:02,411
Nana?                           

777
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:10,086
            Becca's blind.      

778
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:14,223
        I know I'm right.       

779
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,459
        There<i> is</i> something      
        going on here.          

780
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:23,199
TYLER:                          
Maybe there's something         
down in the basement.           

781
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,067
They don't want us              
to go down there.               

782
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,003
They're throwing shade.         

783
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,005
    Speak English.              

784
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,340
They could be hiding            
something down there.           

785
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,443
    There's mold down there.    
    That's why they don't       
    want us to go down.         

786
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,612
    Just stop, okay?            

787
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:39,248
Just let me put                 
the camera out.                 

788
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,221
        Hi. I'm Stacey.         

789
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,423
        Is Mr. and Mrs. Jamison 
        around?                 

790
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,358
BECCA:                          
No. They just                   
stepped out.                    

791
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,194
It's just me                    
and my brother here.            

792
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:55,398
    Mr. and Mrs. Jamison were   
    counselors at Meadowbrook.  

793
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,767
        I was in the rehab      
        program there.          

794
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:01,537
    They used to sit by my bed  
    when I wasn't in good shape.

795
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:04,106
    All night sometimes, so--   

796
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,909
        Anyway, this is         
        a blueberry cobbler     
        for them.               

797
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,446
        They were supposed      
        to stop by on Saturday, 
        but they never showed.  

798
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,648
    I know Mrs. Jamison hadn't  
    been feeling herself,       

799
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,252
    so I thought I'd just       
    stop by and check in on 'em.

800
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,921
        They hear               
        all that scuttlebutt    
        down at Maple Shade?    

801
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,324
Uh, I don't think so.           

802
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:25,127
BECCA:                          
Stacey, it's okay.              
Just be natural.                

803
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,664
I'm just-- I'm just getting     
portraits of everybody.         

804
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,299
Just be natural.                

805
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:33,369
Okay. Never mind.

A white thing?                  
    Yeah, it used to run around 
    the factory at night.       

905
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,557
                Only<i> I</i> saw it.  

906
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,326
        I started to tell people
        about it and they--     

907
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:53,228
        they didn't believe me. 

908
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,931
                Had yellow eyes.

909
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:00,135
            Then they fired me. 

910
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:04,239
                And nobody      
                talked to me.   

911
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:10,345
Mom didn't tell me that.        

912
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:12,247
        Oh, she doesn't know.   

913
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,082
        Happened after she left.

914
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,255
Pop Pop,                        
you seem down.                  

915
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,092
            Well, it's just, uh,

916
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:27,596
        the end of your trip.   

917
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:32,634
            I know it's all     
            coming to an end.   

918
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:38,574
Why don't you just ask Mom      
if you can visit?               

919
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:41,810
Are you really                  
still angry?                    

920
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,647
                    (sighs)     

921
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:51,987
She can't get over this.        
She still thinks                
you're mad at her.              

922
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:03,732
TYLER:                          
That whole "white thing" story--
the hairs on my arm stood up.   

923
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:06,602
It's definitely some sort       
of late onset schizophrenia.    

924
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,637
They're both in bad shape.      
Great.                          

925
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,139
(thumps)                        
Our Pop Pop                     
has schizophrenia               

926
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:14,076
and our Nana                    
becomes Michael Myers           
when the sun goes down.         

927
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:16,178
(wind howling)                  

928
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,285
                That's Stacey.  

929
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:26,722
(chattering, faint)             

930
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:30,158
TYLER:                          
What? Why is she angry?         

931
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:33,996
    She must be telling them    
    that they need to get help. 

932
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:36,331
    (chattering)                

933
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:42,204
POP POP:                        
Come in the back.               

934
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:48,944
(horse nickers)                 
    I got it all off.           

935
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:52,881
I didn't see                    
Stacey leave.                   
Did you?                        

936
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,654
Nana said okay.                 

937
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,592
BECCA:                          
Thanks for doing this.          

938
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:05,661
We're leaving soon,             
Nana.                           

939
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,130
        I'm sad it's all over.  

940
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:10,832
This is the last time           
I'll get to ask you questions.  

941
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,968
It's like-- It's like           
the big end to my film,         

942
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,137
and like you said,              
"You're the star."              

943
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,639
                Oh.             
                (chuckles)      

944
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:20,509
Tell me anything.               
Whatever you wanna talk about.  

945
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,611
                I know a story. 

946
01:01:22,613 --> 01:01:25,714
            It's about water.   
        Great.                  

947
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,151
                There is a pond 

948
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:32,387
        that has                
        little creatures in it. 

949
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:37,025
        These creatures         
        are from another planet,
        but no one realizes it. 

950
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:42,230
    These creatures spit        
    into the water all day long.

951
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,135
            Their spit          
            can make you sleep, 
            but not die.        

952
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:51,807
    When people go underwater   
    in the pond,                

953
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:55,243
            they go             
            into a deep sleep.  

954
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,946
    A really beautiful sleep.   

955
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:00,849
            The creatures       
            from another planet 

956
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:04,686
    have many people            
    at the bottom of the pond,  

957
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:07,055
            storing them up.    

958
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,924
            They are going      
            to take them back   

959
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:12,728
    to their planet             
    of Sinmorfitellia one day.  

960
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,334
    That's just a made-up story.

961
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:20,869
                It's not real.  

962
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:23,171
    Wow. That's--               
    That's some story.          

963
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:25,507
            And the creatures   
            have antennas,      

964
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:28,176
            but they are        
            invisible antennas. 

965
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:34,950
    Can we talk about Mom?      

966
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,757
    You don't ever              
    wanna see her?              

967
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:48,897
                No. Never.      

968
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:51,566
On the day she left,            

969
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,502
she must have done something.   

970
01:02:57,908 --> 01:02:59,975
                (sobs, whimpers)
        Okay, okay.             

971
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:02,277
Let's-- Let's pretend           
we're telling another story.    

972
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:07,249
And the story                   
concerns a young girl...        

973
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:10,085
who thinks she's in love        
with an older man,              

974
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,988
    and they decide             
    to run off together.        

975
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:22,464
Now, the parents of the girl    
warn her that this won't work   

976
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,366
and they refuse to let her go.  

977
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,971
And then one day, the girl gets 
into a horrible fight with them 
and leaves forever.             

978
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:34,609
Now, the parents                
in this story don't know it,    

979
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:38,413
but she misses them a lot       

980
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:41,183
and she suffers greatly.        

981
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,921
And then                        
the worst thing happens.        

982
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:50,258
The man, he breaks              
the girl's heart                

983
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,360
(voice cracks)                  
and leaves forever              

984
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:56,898
and leaves their                
two small children behind.      

985
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:00,101
(sniffles)                      
So, Nana--                      

986
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:04,940
Nana, in this story,            
what do you hope                
will happen to the girl?        

987
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,946
            In this story,      
            is she very sad?    

988
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:12,714
She's inconsolable              
at times.                       

989
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:14,482
She tries everything            
to be happy.                    

990
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:18,987
Medications, and goes           
to therapy for four years,      
but still remains a little sad. 

991
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,989
        I don't like this story.

992
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,861
What do you think the parents   
in this story should do         
if they saw the girl again?     

993
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:31,166
Nana. Nana, pretend you         
were in this story              

994
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:34,169
and she was your daughter       
and she left.                   

995
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,305
What would you say              
when you finally                
saw her again?                  

996
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,311
            I would tell her... 

997
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:48,950
            "I forgive you,     
             little girl."      

998
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,390

Mom should be home.

1291
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:07,788
        and then we kinda       
        stood there in shock,   
        and then I left.        

1292
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:12,993

1307
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:43,083
                 Happy birthday
                  to you 떰     

1308
01:28:43,085 --> 01:28:45,585
        Blow them out!          
                    Okay, okay! 

1309
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:51,358
    Yay!                        
            Yeah!               

1310
01:29:06,141 --> 01:29:08,642
    (rapping):                  
     I may be thirteen,        
      may not live in the hood 

1311
01:29:08,644 --> 01:29:11,978
     May not carry no chrome,  
      may not be allowed        
      a cell phone at dinner   

1312
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:15,982
     But I'm young             
      and can do 18 push-ups    
      and I speak the truth    

1313
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:19,319
 My sister tried               
  to make a film about          
  old people feeling dismay    

1314
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:20,987
         But it didn't         
          turn out that way    

1315
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:23,824
 She had to scream and kill    
  and got vomit in her face    

1316
01:29:23,826 --> 01:29:25,492
             Chunks in her hair
              from a stew      

1317
01:29:25,494 --> 01:29:28,662
     But she washed them out   
      with Herbal Essence       
      Body Envy Shampoo        

1318
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:31,798
         So here's a few things
          T-Diamond learned     
          from visiting elders 

1319
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,967
         Adult diapers         
          come in many a name  

1320
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:36,169
 There's Attends and Depends   
  and Medline and Prevail      

1321
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:38,705
         But they all the same 
          They keep your mess   
          from spilling out    

1322
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,241
     And they keep it contained
      So here's the truth      

1323
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:43,877
 I got messed up with a killer 
  who's truly insane           

1324
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:46,580
     I will try not to refrain,
      try to overcome my pain  

1325
01:29:46,582 --> 01:29:48,382
     'Cause one day            
      it will get me my fame   

1326
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:51,017
     Like 50 Cent getting shot 
      and being lame            
      You see                  

1327
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:53,754
 I got a diaper shoved         
  in my face for half an hour  

1328
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:56,189
         I thought it was over 
          I thought I'd be      
          under the ground     

1329
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,558
     Growing four-leaf clovers 
      Some dude going over me   
      with a mower             

1330
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,261
     But that's not            
      what happened, you see,   
      'cause I went all mental 

1331
01:30:01,263 --> 01:30:03,897
 I was like Mel Gibson         
  at the end                    
  of a<i> Lethal Weapon</i> rental    

1332
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:05,999
         I'm straight now      
          I'm not gonna lie    

1333
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:08,668
         For three weeks       
          that diaper left me   
          like a basket case   

1334
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:11,538
 I had to use two              
  whole Dove bars on my face   

1335
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:14,040
 And one last thing            
  and I don't mean to sicken   

1336
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:15,675
             But the truth is 

1337
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:18,078
             Shit doesn't taste
              like chicken 떰   

1338
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,915
