1
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,007
Did you catch anything?

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,127
No.

3
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,688
It's OK... it's fine.

4
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,560
(In Hungarian)
What's in there?

5
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,481
What've you got there?

6
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,562
A carp.

7
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,281
Nice carp...

8
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,571
You can't find those in Romania.
It's one of those African carp.

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,801
Do you have a fishing permit?

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,609
It's illegal without a permit.

11
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,810
Got one of those permit things?

12
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,771
But I've crossed here before.
I didn't steal it...

13
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,407
it's illegal without a fishing permit.

14
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,528
But I caught it myself.

15
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,323
It's not OK!

16
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,683
You need veterinary certificate for that.

17
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,043
You can only cross with 3 or 4 kilos.

18
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,561
Do you have a shop receipt for it?

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,843
But I've crossed with fish
before with no problems...

20
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,408
Because it's alive you need
something to prove it's yours.

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,526
But I caught it...

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,082
I understand that, but...

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,008
No. No.

24
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,851
Leave the fish here and you can go.

25
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,849
This is the Hungarian border.

26
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,963
This is not a fish market.

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,567
But we're all in the
European Union, aren't we?

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,243
This fish is not in the E.U.

29
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,722
Come on, my friend, let him through...

30
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,890
I know this guy. He's from Salonta.

31
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,568
(In Hungarian)
Let him go.

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,966
Let him go.

33
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,691
Not possible!

34
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,401
Sir, you can go, but the fish has to stay.

35
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,728
I said, leave the fish here
and you can go! Now!

36
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,124
Come on Mr. Nelu, you know the rules...

37
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,921
One stays inside
and the other outside.

38
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,802
Mr. Nelu?

39
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,922
Can I help you?

40
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,890
What does it say here?

41
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,171
It's potato soup.

42
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,804
Really?

43
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,523
Yes.

44
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,131
And what do I do with it?

45
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,487
Well you take a pan,

46
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,249
...Till it with water
and put the tin there...

47
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,851
...and warm it up.

48
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,044
When the water starts to boil, it's ready.

49
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,969
Take it Out,
open it, and you can eat it.

50
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,605
But this serves four.

51
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,291
But I live alone.

52
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,762
No problem.

53
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,327
You can put it in the fridge
and eat it later.

54
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,001
Will it keep?

55
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,122
Sure!

56
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,322
It's biologically natural.

57
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,851
Really?

58
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,811
And this?

59
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,451
What does it say?

60
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,687
It says "lecker".

61
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,961
What's that?

62
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,010
That means it's good.
Very good.

63
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,083
And is it?

64
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,327
Yes.

65
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,927
Hello, Nelu.

66
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,561
Hello, Miron.

67
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,605
Should I come up there?

68
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,927
No, no need.

69
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,442
I say you get those metal tiles.

70
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,210
They're good, they're really nice.

71
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,726
Aren't they expensive?

72
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,842
No, they're not expensive.

73
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,326
They're pretty cheap.

74
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,566
How about the chimney?

75
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,730
I don't do chimneys.

76
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,043
I stick to what I'm good at.

77
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,090
Come inside.

78
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,520
Coming.

79
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,330
So they're cheaper...

80
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,010
They're good. Really nice.

81
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,610
Come on in.

82
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,404
Will you drink a palinka?

83
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,887
We're out of palinka.

84
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,923
You'll have to bring more from the cellar...

85
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,968
Well...

86
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,725
So, Nelu, what's the plan?

87
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,331
When do we start?

88
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,130
Cucu promised me some old tiles
from the factory.

89
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,810
You should get those metal tiles.

90
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,490
They're not expensive.

91
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,241
We'll see... If we get the loan,
we'll buy metal tiles.

92
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,522
We're not buying metal ones.

93
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,725
I have to start the job at Popa's.

94
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,804
And we need to talk about my fee.

95
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,526
What is there to talk about?
Haven't we talked already?

96
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,288
I've told you how much I charge.

97
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,528
I need half the money before I start.

98
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,802
You've not even started and you want money?

99
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,923
We'll give you as much food and drink
as you like.

100
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,770
That's not the way I work, Mrs. Florica.

101
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,041
This is how I work.

102
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,402
Half of the money before
and half after.

103
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,131
I haven't asked for any food...

104
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,084
Food isn't money.

105
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,605
Some handyman...
He doesn't need food, he needs money...

106
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,201
Don't take it like that, Mrs. Florica.

107
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,403
I don't mind starting later.

108
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,011
If we get that loan...

109
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,486
It's hard for all of us.

110
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,521
You shouldn't start the job
if you don't have the money.

111
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,530
You've got a nerve.

112
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,961
Out of my house before I get really angry!

113
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,687
You think you're so clever, don't you?

114
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,445
You rude pig!

115
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,523
I didn't insult you, Mrs. Florica...

116
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,281
We don't need any handyman.
Forget about it.

117
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,242
Come on, get out!

118
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,250
You're always asking people for money
before you even start!

119
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,046
From Victorash, too...
And their roof is still leaking.

120
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,726
See you, Nelu.

121
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,891
Get out of here!

122
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,805
You just sit there
like you're deaf or something!

123
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,444
That Miron has such a nerve...

124
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,607
He doesn't want food.
He only wants money.

125
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,601
You know...

126
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,049
...the Delta is
just like the seaside...

127
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,284
With sandy beaches.

128
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,528
You can swim and sunbathe too.

129
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,722
I'm not going to the Delta...

130
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,729
...to drown in of those broken boats.

131
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,165
I'm just saying that the Delta's
just like the seaside.

132
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,649
I could also do a bit of fishing.

133
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,042
Well in that case, go on your own.

134
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,245
If we go, we go together...

135
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,885
Like a family.

136
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,565
Turn it off.

137
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,731
Come on, let's go!

138
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,689
(Speaking in Turkish)

139
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,166
Step away.

140
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,001
Move aside.

141
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,651
Leave me alone!

142
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,801
OK, come on.

143
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,965
Come inside.

144
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,767
OK... OK...

145
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,650
Take these clothes!

146
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,767
OK.

147
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,849
That's right...

148
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,121
Take those clothes.

149
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,407
OK.

150
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,726
Quiet.

151
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,566
Hello there. Hello, Tibi.

152
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,409
Listen, my bike just broke down
near Arpasel.

153
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,490
I'll be late for work...

154
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,885
Yes, yes...

155
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,485
Sure, no problem...

156
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,251
Thanks a lot.

157
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,647
OK.

158
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,171
I owe you a beer. Bye.

159
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,766
Bye.

160
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,084
Take these.

161
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,645
I don't need your money.

162
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,251
No money!

163
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,169
Put the shoes on!

164
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,921
OK. You're in Salonta now,
in Romania...

165
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,208
OK...

166
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,890
This is Salonta...

167
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,569
Romania...

168
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,761
Here...

169
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,688
Yeah, maybe.

170
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,562
Yeah, yeah...

171
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,409
Hello, Nelu.

172
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,283
Hello.

173
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,244
Do you want me to plough
that land of yours?

174
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,605
Will you stop bothering me!

175
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,290
I'm not going to plant anything there.

176
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,891
Well, don't regret it later.

177
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,127
No, no.

178
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,446
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

179
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,601
I don't need any money...

180
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,370
I don't need your money...

181
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,040
Sit there.

182
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,011
Stay there!

183
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,765
Come here.

184
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,641
Stay there.

185
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,601
Listen...

186
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,530
I don't understand a word you're saying...

187
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,404
Just stay here and we'll see...

188
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,602
I don't want it...

189
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,809
OK, OK.

190
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,206
You can stay here.

191
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,242
We'll see about that.

192
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,601
Sit down.

193
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,487
Just stay there.

194
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,081
Hello, Nelu.

195
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,289
Hello, Nelu.

196
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,523
Hello, Miron.

197
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,844
Put it on my tab.

198
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,769
Well, can you start the job then?

199
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,641
I'm sorry, I've started the job
at Popa's.

200
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,611
Did you get that loan?

201
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,881
The loan's none of your business.

202
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,523
Well thanks a lot.

203
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,684
Come on, wake up!

204
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,009
Wake up, Mister!

205
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,931
Come and eat something.

206
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,965
Come on in...

207
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,327
Sit down.

208
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,522
Eat.

209
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,090
Come on, eat.

210
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,646
Tomorrow, We'll SSG...

211
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,762
(in German)
Morgen.

212
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,482
Morgen!

213
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,922
Morgen.

214
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,650
Like you say...

215
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,041
Hello, brother-in-law!

216
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,770
Hello!

217
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,803
He brought that Italian guy again...

218
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,162
Nelu...

219
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,082
Like I told you before,
he wants to buy all the land and the house.

220
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,246
Both for a very good price,
a very good price.

221
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,370
We've told you, we're
not selling.

222
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,521
Didn't father, God rest his soul,
tell us to stay put?

223
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,721
That's what he said.

224
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,888
He did, I agree.

225
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,850
But why don't you just sell it?

226
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,964
And move to town.
With hot running water.

227
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Last time, you said
you'd think about it, no?

228
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,961
We don't want to anymore.

229
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,131
I'm going to repair the roof.

230
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,560
So, now you're repairing the roof?

231
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,250
(In Italian)
What's happening, Daniel?

232
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,680
We're going!

233
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,206
As you wish...

234
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,290
You'll regret it...

235
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,962
Bye.

236
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,968
Bye.

237
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,688
Well...

238
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,691
Here's the plan.

239
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,570
I don't want to ride in the side-car again.
It gives me a headache.

240
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,286
We won't take the road to Cluj, there's
too much traffic.

241
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,925
We'll take the road to Arad.

242
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,163
Deva
and then Sibiu, the Olt Valley.

243
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,123
We can spend a night there.

244
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,571
The next day we'll pass
Bucharest and head to Tulcea.

245
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,644
And then take the boat.

246
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,201
We should book ahead for the boat.
it'll be busy.

247
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,284
It's busy everywhere now.

248
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,005
It's busy at the seaside too.
I Saw it on TV.

249
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,201
You stay there and rest...

250
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,881
It's never hurt this much before.

251
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,281
Stay in bed. Get some more sleep.

252
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,210
You don't have a temperature.

253
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,280
Come back quickly.

254
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,842
I won't be long.

255
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,485
Pray for mother and father,
may they rest in peace...

256
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,289
How are you, Mr. Nelu?

257
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,161
Fine, as always.

258
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,521
What are you doing around here?

259
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,886
Have you been to church yet?

260
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,007
I'm going now.

261
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,962
OK. Bye.

262
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,888
Bye.

263
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,442
Hello.

264
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,602
Hello.

265
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,162
This one is torn.
I can't exchange it.

266
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,121
These are Deutsche Marks.

267
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,924
We stopped exchanging
Deutsche Marks ages ago.

268
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,042
No problem.

269
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,810
If it's not possible...

270
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,208
710 Euros in total.

271
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,526
An ID, please.

272
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,401
I don't have ii.

273
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,326
OK.

274
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,171
20...

275
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,004
25...

276
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,966
29...

277
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,930
2,996 lei

278
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,127
Thank you. Bye.

279
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,560
Bye.

280
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:01,809
Hello, loji.

281
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,762
Hello.

282
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,762
Have you got them?

283
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,041
I've got them.

284
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,847
Let me see.

285
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,362
You stick this into the ground...

286
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,130
It has a swinger...

287
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,485
And a beeper that beeps.

288
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,120
Nice.

289
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,442
Made in China?

290
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,643
No, they're Japanese originals.

291
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,923
Like the ones on Discovery Channel.

292
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,890
Clever stuff!

293
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,768
How much?

294
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,964
50 - and with the swinger it's 100.

295
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,886
OK. Give me a beeper.

296
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,809
But it only comes with the swinger.

297
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,365
I don't need the swinger.

298
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,971
That's the deal.

299
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,367
OK then.

300
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,040
Thanks, bye.

301
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,127
Bye.

302
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,961
Hello.

303
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,843
Hello.

304
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,286
How are you?

305
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,926
You're late.

306
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,528
Florica?

307
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,565
She's got a headache.

308
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,731
Poor her.

309
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,804
She's got a headache...

310
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,764
Stop upsetting her so much.

311
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,646
How do I upset her?

312
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,170
You know better than me.

313
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,329
Bye.

314
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,123
Bye.

315
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,447
You bring strangers into my house...

316
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,011
He's just a poor man.

317
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,482
I hired him to help us around.

318
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,405
I almost had a heart attack...

319
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,965
...when I went to the cellar
for potatoes.

320
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,571
You're out of your mind!

321
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,610
Are we out of potatoes?

322
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,803
I wanted to call the Police.

323
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,686
Don't worry.
I hired him to help me with the repairs.

324
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,405
Don't lie to me.

325
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,602
You'll put me in the grave...

326
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,290
You'll be happy then...

327
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,567
I'll take those.

328
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,082
You think I've not seen on TV
all the things happening around here.

329
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,528
About foreigners jumping the border...

330
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,127
He's not a foreigner.
He's just a Gypsy I hired.

331
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,731
He didn't have anywhere to sleep.

332
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,684
You really think I'm stupid, don't you?

333
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,811
Do whatever you like.
You don't listen to me anyway.

334
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,127
Morgen...

335
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,808
Morgen...

336
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,202
Morgen...

337
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,365
Will you peel the potatoes?

338
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,282
He could sleep on the couch.

339
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,402
I won't sleep with strangers in my house.

340
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,250
But it's cold down there.

341
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,321
He'll catch a cold
and we'll have to take him to hospital.

342
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,482
Give him another blanket,
give him that old quilt.

343
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,768
He didn't score
in the last three games.

344
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,923
He scored against Marghita.

345
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,404
Pascut scored that goal against Marghita.

346
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,290
Pascut didn't even play...

347
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,209
Of course he played...

348
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,964
Will you come and help me with your trailer?

349
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,246
I was going to pick my grapes.

350
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,203
But you said you'd help me...

351
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,642
I did, but you didn't tell me when.

352
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,086
Never mind...

353
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,611
You know what?

354
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,321
I'll talk to my wife and...

355
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,090
OK, talk to her...

356
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,605
What kind of tiles
will you buy? Metal ones?

357
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,408
Metal ones, of course,
they're nicer. And cheaper...

358
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,849
Have you got that loan?

359
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,051
No, but I've managed somehow.

360
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,162
I see...

361
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,762
Well...

362
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,970
I have to go.

363
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,362
I bought myself a beeper and a swinger.

364
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,202
Nice.

365
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,482
How much?

366
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,245
Not much.

367
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,569
100.

368
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,685
If you like, you could join me
one of these days.

369
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,767
We'll see.

370
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,086
You were right.

371
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,689
The metal ones are really nice.

372
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,605
And they're more hard-wearing.

373
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,209
Hello.

374
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:40,884
Hello.

375
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,923
We're from the Salonta Border Police.

376
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,888
Agent Mircea Popovici.

377
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,167
Are you Mr. Nelu Manciu?

378
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,049
Yes, that's me.

379
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,964
Can you show me your ID?

380
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,090
We're checking the border zone.

381
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,881
Just 3 second.

382
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,281
The man in the car?

383
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,886
A colleague from work.

384
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,487
I see...

385
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,371
You have a mustache
in this photo.

386
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,163
Yes.

387
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,210
You need to have a new photo taken.

388
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,126
I didn't know that.

389
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,044
...or grow your mustache again...

390
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,806
Is that what the law says?

391
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,967
Yes, it is...

392
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,880
The law is the law.

393
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,809
And you can't bargain with the law.

394
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,047
Anyway. Apart from that mustache,
what we want to know is...

395
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,208
Have you seen anything strange
around the border?

396
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,130
Or here around your farm?

397
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,488
Anyone passing by?
Anything strange?

398
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,208
It's just me and my wife...
Our son is in Cluj.

399
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,287
Is that so?

400
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,966
What's he doing there?

401
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,811
He's at the University.

402
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,810
I guess you've seen on TV
the problems we have at the border?

403
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,007
You've seen, haven't you?

404
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,045
I don't watch TV. My wife does.

405
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,445
You should call us if you notice
anything strange.

406
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,289
Anything.

407
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,164
Here's our phone number.

408
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,403
I don't want to remind you
that concealing information

409
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,648
about illegal border crossings...

410
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,369
...is punishable by law...

411
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,608
It is against the law...

412
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,450
Being an accomplice and all...

413
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,091
I haven't seen anything.

414
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,286
That's all, Mr. Manciu.

415
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,447
If you see anything strange around
here, call us immediately.

416
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,283
And tell your wife the same thing.

417
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,447
I understand...

418
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,169
Have a good day.

419
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:20,884
Good day.

420
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,922
Come on, Ovi!

421
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,686
Park it in the yard.

422
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,640
You're back...

423
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,402
Telefonen... Germany...

424
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,165
Try again...

425
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,601
Where are you all heading to?

426
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,131
To watch a friendly against Sarkad!

427
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,890
You mean to lose again?

428
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,090
(In Hungarian)
What's up?

429
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,250
(In Hungarian)
Nothing.

430
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,370
Come on, Salonta!
Come on, Salonta!

431
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,204
Right, we're in Hungary. Go!

432
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,245
Take care, my friend.
Take care!

433
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,407
Come on, Nelu!

434
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,522
I'm coming!

435
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,166
Take care now...

436
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,481
Safe trip!

437
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,405
Stay there.

438
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,364
What the hell have you done?

439
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,008
Mrs. Angela?

440
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,486
Wait a minute.

441
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,010
Hello.

442
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,042
Good evening.

443
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,406
I understand there's a problem?

444
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,046
Yes, there is.

445
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,844
That man doesn't have any ID
or medical insurance.

446
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,644
So he has to pay.

447
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,763
That's not a problem, Mrs. Angela.

448
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,207
We must put down a name at least...

449
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,686
We'll put down a name.

450
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,251
Wait for me in the car.

451
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,920
But the doctor should come and...

452
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,326
Let's sort this out, Mrs. Angela.

453
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,330
Just tell me
how much I have to pay and...

454
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,649
We have to wait for the doctor.

455
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,251
I'll call the doctor later...

456
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,045
They played real football back then,
not like they do now.

457
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,486
Geolgau, Crisan...

458
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,206
Camataru... he really knew
how to score goals...

459
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,489
Hagi's times were also good...

460
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,449
Craiova's times were the greatest...

461
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,285
All the teams played well back then...

462
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,527
isn't that right, Nelu?

463
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,563
You were a Craiova fan in those days,
weren't you?

464
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,485
I support CFR now...

465
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,966
Fuck CFR too.

466
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,684
They only have Spanish,
Argentinian and Brazilians.

467
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,651
It's like watching a South American
soap opera not a football match...

468
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,570
It's not as though we don't
have good players here.

469
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,888
They bring them from abroad...

470
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,522
Why are they playing for Romanian teams?

471
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,609
For money, you idiot, for money.

472
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,804
Do you think that they come here
for the game?

473
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,411
Yeah, I know, but...

474
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,689
What matters is the national team.

475
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,247
Fuck all the Portuguese and the Gypsies.

476
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,804
Our boys are out of the teams
because of them.

477
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,125
Good evening.

478
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,370
Good evening.

479
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,440
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

480
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,925
Two coffees, please.

481
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,167
No sugar for me.

482
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,245
Want to play some cards?

483
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,005
I'll play.

484
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,687
Want a beer?

485
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,241
No, I'm on duty.

486
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,960
Good evening.

487
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,366
Good evening.

488
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,609
We'll give you a ride, Mr. Manciu.

489
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,205
But I have my motorbike here.

490
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,649
You were drinking back there,
weren't you?

491
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,365
Let's take a ride.

492
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,761
But why?

493
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,005
We want to show you something.

494
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,007
Don't worry, we'll bring you back here.

495
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,209
Do you want a cigarette, Mr. Manciu?

496
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,130
No thanks, I don't smoke.

497
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,805
So, Mr. Manciu...

498
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,842
We'll show you how things
work around here...

499
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,165
What technology we've got...

500
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,088
We can see through walls with this thing.

501
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,370
Through walls...

502
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,245
Can you see them?

503
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,327
Yes.

504
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,729
These people want to go to America
or some other fucking place...

505
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,845
You think we'll let them?

506
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,845
They can go...

507
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,930
Why should we bother?

508
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,929
We have to get them papers,
lawyers and translators.

509
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,087
And wipe their asses too.

510
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,362
They should go wherever
the fuck they want...

511
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,931
Have you seen the bunny rabbits?

512
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,367
Sitting there...

513
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,404
They've been sitting there
for two days.

514
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,806
Waiting.

515
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,084
We could catch them, Mr. Manciu.

516
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,242
But what's the point?

517
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,930
More will come...

518
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,963
And we're just a couple of guys here.

519
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,684
What we mean to say, Mr. Manciu...

520
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,283
You should be very careful...

521
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,961
We don't want to have any problems here...

522
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,290
Get it?

523
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,163
If the county inspector pays us a visit...

524
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,408
Then you and me, we
don't know each other.

525
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,206
I get it.

526
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,561
Are you sure?

527
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,770
Want to take another look?

528
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,166
- Hello!
- Hello!

529
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,042
Well...

530
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,004
I don't think so...

531
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,091
I don't think so...

532
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,367
I haven't bought from them
for a long time.

533
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,571
They aren't like they used to be.

534
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,128
Sure... Sure...

535
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,444
Yes.

536
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,964
So...

537
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,050
You go down...

538
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,602
...Decebal Street...

539
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,650
By the market...

540
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,683
Yes, that way...

541
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,241
Cross the bridge...

542
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,767
You must cross the bridge...

543
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,200
Listen to me...

544
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,130
Cross the bridge and then you'll see
the petrol station on your right.

545
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,321
Yes.

546
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,647
Then you go down...

547
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,841
...Cosbuc Street.

548
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,927
No...

549
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,567
Not that way.

550
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,250
You have to cross the bridge!

551
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,369
Yes.

552
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,281
The petrol station is on the right...

553
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,801
I'll tell you one more time. Pay attention!

554
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,287
You pass by Decebal market.

555
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,170
Cross the bridge...

556
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,651
Yes, and the petrol station is
on the right.

557
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,565
On Cosbuc Street.

558
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,649
OK.

559
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,649
OK.

560
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:20,809
Who?

561
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,128
Luci?

562
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,646
She's fine...

563
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,407
OK.

564
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,285
Whose wedding?

565
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,761
No...

566
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,203
No...

567
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,243
I'm not going to any wedding.

568
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,124
I've already been to
three weddings this year.

569
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,925
I won't go to this one.

570
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,925
OK, then...

571
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,602
OK.

572
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,287
Yes.

573
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,721
Bye.

574
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,321
Bye, bye.

575
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,965
What are you doing here?

576
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,647
Well, you said
he could work the slicing machine...

577
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,805
We'll see about that...

578
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,364
Bur you said l should bring him here...

579
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,325
What am I supposed to do with him?

580
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,329
You said he could work the
slicing machine.

581
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,805
That's not your business.

582
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,806
OK, then.

583
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,645
Do what you like...

584
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,605
I don't have time to waste.

585
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,245
I'll be late for work.

586
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,290
Bye.

587
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,287
No, HO.

588
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,721
Stay here with Daniel.

589
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,565
OK? Sit down.

590
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,845
Bye.

591
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,966
Sit down.

592
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,970
Sit down.

593
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,605
Sit down.

594
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,287
Well...

595
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,845
What can you do?

596
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,645
What can you do?

597
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,330
What are you good at?

598
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,685
Hurry up, Mr. Nelu!

599
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,685
Go fuck yourself...

600
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,921
Hello, Diego.

601
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,288
Hello, Nelu.

602
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,602
How are you?

603
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,320
Just shopping...

604
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,682
Can you help me get rid of
this Turkish guy?

605
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,964
I don't do that kind of thing anymore.

606
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,286
He's got a bit of money.

607
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,209
I said, I don't do that kind of thing.

608
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,721
Come on, help me out...

609
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,564
Leave me alone.

610
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,205
Hello, Peacock.

611
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,167
It's me.

612
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,322
Are you still marking that road to Sarkad?

613
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,647
When?

614
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,041
Nelu!

615
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,327
Hello.

616
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,686
Hello.

617
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,722
Well...

618
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,806
Are we going home?

619
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,001
Come on.

620
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,486
Be careful with that!

621
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,206
Put it down.

622
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,331
Get behind me.

623
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,160
To me right.

624
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,087
Hold it.

625
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,080
Don't let go.

626
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,886
Don't let the wind get it.

627
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,286
Hold it here.

628
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,720
Hold it there.

629
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,369
Is it OK?

630
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,368
It's OK!

631
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,291
What are you doing here?

632
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,606
Come home!

633
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,525
We're going home.

634
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,288
Nelu, you think people don't talk?

635
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,965
People know about him.

636
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,929
What do people know?

637
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,963
That you keep the man at the farm.

638
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,964
Be careful with this Gypsy of yours.

639
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,730
People talk.

640
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,323
He could be some kind of a terrorist.

641
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,650
He could have who knows what disease.

642
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,490
Don't you watch TV?

643
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,162
We'll get rid of him
once the roof is repaired.

644
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,329
He can go back where he came from.

645
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,090
Just shut up.

646
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,371
Don't you dare tell my sister to shut up.

647
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,007
You ruined her life, her youth...

648
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,611
I didn't ruin anything...

649
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,809
I'll have a word
at the town-hall tomorrow.

650
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,527
If he wants citizenship,
we'll make him Romanian.

651
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,961
We already have plenty of Gypsies
around here anyway...

652
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,530
I can't believe I'm driving around the
border with Turks in my car...

653
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,491
Hurry up!

654
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,721
Come on!

655
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,722
Did you bring that paper?

656
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,610
Hurry up, we'll miss Zoli's shift.

657
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,086
I talked to him.

658
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,250
It's OK, I spoke to him too.

659
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,885
OK, we'll see...

660
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:58,763
OK!

661
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,003
OK. OK.

662
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,683
OK. OK.

663
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,326
So this is that Turk of yours?

664
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,806
Yes, that's him.

665
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,484
Shit! Where's Zoli?

666
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,921
What are you doing?

667
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,806
Formula 1?

668
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,606
It took us 3 hours to get here...

669
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,481
(In Hungarian)
What are you doing?

670
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,887
What's going on?

671
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,411
We have to mark the road to Sarkad.

672
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,408
Sarkad?

673
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,249
Sarkad...

674
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,044
I have the official paper here.

675
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,489
Part of the...

676
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,727
Sorry, that's not it.

677
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,887
Here is the paper.

678
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,811
The town-halls agreed
to mark the road across the border.

679
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,206
New EU laws, you know?

680
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,528
We have to mark the road to Sarkad.

681
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,561
To Sarkad...

682
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,687
What are you doing up there, Nelu?

683
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,721
Helping these guys.

684
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,126
You're helping them...

685
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,488
What's with this paper? Turn back
to Salonta.

686
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,122
But...

687
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,042
(In Hungarian)
It's white...

688
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,366
Sorry?

689
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,841
White is not good.

690
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,644
White no good.

691
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,091
But we have this paper here!

692
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,406
White is no good.

693
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,331
In Hungary the markings are yellow,
in Romania they're white.

694
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,285
Please turn back
and change the color of the paint.

695
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,000
...and bring the paper.

696
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:52,450
Paper?

697
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,687
- Stamped!
- Stamped?

698
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,802
Yes, stamped.

699
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,968
A new stamped paper.

700
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,525
So, we must bring yellow...

701
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,801
Turn back, please!

702
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,922
We'll bring some yellow paint then...

703
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,929
White paint isn't legal.

704
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,360
Please, turn back.

705
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,123
Yellow!

706
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,162
Come on, move!

707
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,122
Let's go, guys!

708
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,084
We'll come back with the
yellow paint.

709
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,403
Please, turn around.

710
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,206
The red is mine.

711
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,007
Quit playing cards and go to sleep!

712
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,121
Turn off the light!

713
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,684
Where is the red?

714
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,966
Don't you hear me, Nelu?

715
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,970
Is this how you play in Turkey?

716
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,364
You're killing me!

717
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,406
That's yours.

718
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,326
That's a red one...

719
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,766
Put it at the bottom.

720
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,286
Well done.

721
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,566
That's yours, too.

722
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,282
No, the red one...

723
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,242
Put it there.

724
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,362
Leave it there...

725
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,768
Border Police! Your IDs, please!

726
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,167
We don't have our IDs.

727
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,646
How come?

728
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:01,563
We don't have them.

729
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,443
Show me your IDs!

730
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,130
We left in a hurry this morning
and forget to take them.

731
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,725
Please show us some ID.

732
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,487
Our IDs are at home.

733
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,011
At home?

734
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,929
We've been harvesting the corn.

735
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,089
Hello.

736
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,287
Hello.

737
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,681
Is there a problem?

738
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,846
We need to see some IDS.

739
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,442
It's not on me.

740
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,085
Not yours. Their's.

741
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,085
We've got them at the farm.

742
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,731
Then let's go to the farm!

743
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,249
Come on!

744
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,771
Let's go to the farm!

745
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,686
Follow us!

746
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,561
Stay here.

747
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,603
I'll take a photo of the two of you.

748
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,566
Can't we talk about this?

749
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,402
Please point in the direction he came from.

750
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,965
Where you found him.

751
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,122
Mr. Manciu, please point in the
direction you found him.

752
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,931
Good...

753
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,163
Now, please point in the direction
of the border.

754
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:18,963
I ran the check.

755
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:19,809
And?

756
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,482
His name is Behfan Gunes.

757
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,482
They say he probably crossed
from Bulgaria two weeks ago.

758
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,011
He doesn't have a Romanian visa.

759
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,486
We need to solve this.

760
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,410
Send him back to Bulgaria?

761
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,687
Too complicated.

762
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,644
I wouldn't call HO at the weekend.

763
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,411
We'll just take him out of the border zone...

764
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,250
He should go to Bucharest,
to his embassy.

765
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,282
Sounds good to me.

766
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,567
Come on!

767
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,286
Why didn't you report this?

768
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,081
Call who?

769
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,169
Don't play dumb with us.
This isn't a joke!

770
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,807
Sir, we don't know this man.

771
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,168
What do you mean,
you don't know him, Mrs. Manciu?

772
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,930
He was on the back of the cart with you.

773
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,246
How do you explain that?

774
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,362
I don't know him...

775
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,607
Why should I know him?

776
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,368
(In English)
Name?

777
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,966
(In Turkish)
Name?

778
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,049
Nationality?

779
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,480
He's from Turkey.

780
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,571
He must reach Germany.
His son, his family.

781
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:15,886
He has no visa. No ID.

782
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,447
This isn't a playground, it's a national
border!

783
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,402
Understand?

784
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,365
This man has to reach his family
in Germany.

785
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,042
Hi, Ovidiu.

786
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,483
Hello, Mr. Daniel.

787
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,602
Hi, Popovici.

788
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,241
What's the problem?

789
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,926
Who is this man?

790
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,326
What's he doing here?

791
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,524
Mr. Daniel, this man cannot justify his
presence on our national border.

792
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,562
He doesn't have an ID.

793
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,967
He entered Romania illegally,
he has no visa...

794
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,241
We have to send him back.

795
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,248
I see...

796
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,250
I know, border problems, I know.

797
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,450
There is another option...

798
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,401
A relocation program
in Timisoara.

799
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,283
That's right.

800
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,811
We can send him there.

801
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,761
Perhaps he could get on the program?

802
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,201
It's an EU initiative.

803
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,925
They take them where they need
more inhabitants.

804
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,168
To Canada or to Sweden...
there's space for them there.

805
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,727
Canada?

806
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,251
Isn't it too cold there?

807
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,249
You guys have got a nerve.

808
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,889
Can't you understand he has to go
to Germany?

809
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,491
To his family... To his son...

810
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,207
Can you understand
he doesn't have the correct papers?

811
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,084
You just come into my house
without a warrant...

812
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,964
What has this man done to you?

813
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,726
Get out of my house!

814
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:24,887
Calm down, Nelu!

815
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,969
You're pushing your luck here,
Mr. Manciu.

816
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,127
Let me remind you...

817
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,449
...unjustified presence
in a border zone is punishable by law.

818
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,441
And acting as accomplice to
an illegal crossing is also punishable.

819
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,371
You think I care about your law?

820
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,569
What has this man done to you?

821
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,320
Shut your mouth Nelu!
You'll get yourself arrested!

822
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,962
I'm sure we can come
to some understanding.

823
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,400
We can't come to an understanding!

824
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,090
They should get out of my house!

825
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,681
We'll leave.

826
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,690
Leave him alone.

827
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,241
Haven't you heard about
national security?

828
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,050
National security?

829
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,521
There are no more borders!

830
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,085
Stay here Florica...

831
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,001
Get out.

832
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,682
You were in the border zone
without a visa.

833
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,162
You don't have the right to be here
without a visa.

834
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,569
Go back to Timisoara,
or Bucharest, or Istanbul!

835
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,969
Get a visa and you can go
wherever you want!

836
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,727
Get it?

837
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,005
Border Zone

838
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,171
This is Hungary...

839
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,367
Go, go...

840
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,208
Take care!

841
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,523
Take care...
