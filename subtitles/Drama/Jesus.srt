1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,033
Hear, hear, you ignoble guests

2
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:09,354
of the great and gracious Pilate!

3
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:11,367
Listen now to me,

4
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,900
and imagine the scene!

5
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:19,880
( laughter )

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,168
Behold, the great
Temple of Jerusalem!

7
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:30,687
Ah...!

8
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,723
Ah-hh!

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,877
The Temple is brimming
with Passover pilgrims!

10
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:54,904
The cries
of the money-changers!

11
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:58,221
"Change your money

12
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,993
Give your money!"

13
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:02,007
Shhh! Shhh!

14
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,579
And then suddenly,
a voice...

15
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:13,229
a voice
of righteous anger.

16
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:16,243
Jesus!

17
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,968
Jesus!

18
00:01:25,788 --> 00:01:27,854
Jesus!

19
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:40,310
My Father's house
is not a house of trade!

20
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,482
( laughter )

21
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,191
The Temple is corrupt.

22
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,905
You have all forgotten
the Word of God.

23
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:53,233
Enter a priest.

24
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,173
It's Caiaphas!

25
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,293
How dare you accuse us!

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,137
You are nothing but
a carpenter from Nazareth!

27
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:05,514
We are the Temple elite.

28
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:08,393
We answer only to God.

29
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,009
And to Rome, in the person
of Pontius Pilate.

30
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,753
Ah-hh!

31
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:20,241
And then, a trap!

32
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:22,252
And then, a trap!

33
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:25,561
Do you say we should not
pay taxes to Rome?

34
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,767
To which the carpenter said,

35
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,148
"Who's face is on this coin?"

36
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,091
Caesar's!

37
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:35,230
Give to Caesar
what belongs to Caesar,

38
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:38,182
and to God
what belongs to God!

39
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:40,888
I won't crucify him for that!

40
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,423
( laughter )

41
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:21,220
Livio! Livio!

42
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,438
Livio!

43
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,631
Oh, bravo.
Bravo, citizen!

44
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,118
Ah, the Jews...

45
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:38,526
such a...

46
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:41,735
such a strange people.

47
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:44,148
What is it about them
that craves these messiahs?

48
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:46,353
What does the word mean, anyway?

49
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,231
"The anointed."

50
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,145
The king from the line
of David promised by God.

51
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,425
Oppressed people need
to believe in a deliverer.

52
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:59,435
Well, they'll just have to be
content with "governor" for now.

53
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:04,593
"King" is a little showy,
don't you think, Livio?

54
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:07,808
Not for you,
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,420
I love they way
you kiss up to me, Livio.

56
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,339
It's so...justified.

57
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:34,728
He needs food and water.

58
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,603
He's been sitting up there
for five hours.

59
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,983
I offered it to him an hour ago.
He waved me away.

60
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,729
You rushed up like a wild camel.
He's still mourning John the Baptist.

61
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,800
You don't go rushing
up to him like that.

62
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:48,377
Just because I'm a fisherman,
that doesn't make me stupid, Judas.

63
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,263
-You said it, not me.
-Why don't you both shut up!

64
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,301
You shut up! I'm tired of you
bossing everyone around!

65
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,513
And I'm tired of you
acting like a bully.

66
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:57,529
Stop it!

67
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,001
Look!

68
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:22,497
What do you think they want?

69
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,847
For you to speak.

70
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,039
Do you think I have
anything to say?

71
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:46,664
Sitdown everybody.
Sitdown, please.

72
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,912
Come along, sit.

73
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:55,467
Jesus will speak to you.

74
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:13,073
Blessed are the poor,

75
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:16,250
for they will inherit
the kingdom of heaven.

76
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,270
I'd like to inherit
something right now!

77
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,279
( laughter )

78
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:30,244
The rich and the powerful
think they own the world.

79
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:32,694
And actually, they do.

80
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,915
But what can they buy
with all that money?

81
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:38,925
Everything!

82
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,397
( laughter )

83
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,178
Wealth does not buy life.

84
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,865
It does not buy a good heart.

85
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,986
And it cannot buy
the kingdom of God.

86
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:59,003
You can have it no matter
how poor you are.

87
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,916
Very poor!

88
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,550
( laughter )

89
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:04,297
If you hunger and thirst
for righteousness

90
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:05,934
you will be satisfied.

91
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,746
But how?

92
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,724
How?

93
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,804
What do you want
from your God?

94
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,148
Mercy!

95
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,291
Yes-- then show mercy.

96
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:20,109
Love.

97
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,827
Then show love.

98
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,681
A new house!

99
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,364
( laughter )

100
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,118
No taxes!

101
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,510
( laughter )

102
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:31,048
Remember the prophets?

103
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,967
They were persecuted,
but they didn't lose faith.

104
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:35,918
Meet it with love.

105
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,128
And follow the law of Moses!

106
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,337
The law?
Yes!

107
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,176
Don't worry so much
about what you eat and drink.

108
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:48,448
What comes out of your mouth
is more important.

109
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:51,394
This is what can really
harm you for eternity.

110
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:58,172
Blessed is the womb that bore you
and the breast that nursed you.

111
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:06,038
Blessed rather are those who hear
the Word of God and obey it.

112
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,318
You are his mother?

113
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,991
Yes, I am Jesus' mother.

114
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,727
I'm sorry for the pain
he caused you today.

115
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:26,222
Well, he didn't mean to.

116
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,148
But he did.

117
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,555
Men always do.

118
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:34,461
Are you one of his followers?

119
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:37,461
I'm a prostitute.

120
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:40,106
I do not judge.

121
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:43,442
I have been judged too,
in my life.

122
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,885
He scares me.

123
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,930
Pretty funny, huh?

124
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:56,540
A prostitute afraid of a man.

125
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:59,985
That is because...

126
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,591
in him there is something
greater than any man.

127
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:08,304
Would you like
to walk with me?

128
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:38,128
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

129
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:41,508
He told me to gather
his closest followers, and wait.

130
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:42,965
Wait for what?

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,445
Why don't you have
a little patience, Simon?

132
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,245
Peter. My name is Peter.
He called me Peter.

133
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:51,424
"Peter, Peter, Peter."

134
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:01,998
I love you all.

135
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,568
Most of you have been
with me from the beginning.

136
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:08,744
But now the crowds have grown
too large for me alone.

137
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:11,884
I need men to share my power
to minister to those in need.

138
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:16,683
And so,
I am going to pick twelve

139
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,065
who will have the authority
to proclaim my message.

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,714
( murmuring )

141
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,525
Peter...

142
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,845
John...

143
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,495
( murmuring )

144
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:45,003
and brother James.

145
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:53,438
Sons of thunder.

146
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:58,662
Andrew...

147
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:08,713
Judas...

148
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,383
Matthew.

149
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,432
( low grumbling )

150
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,584
The tax collector?

151
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:33,273
Thomas...

152
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,634
Philip...

153
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,036
Bartholomew...

154
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,922
James, son of Alphaeus.

155
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,482
Taddeus...

156
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,820
Simon.

157
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:20,292
I give you authority
over unclean spirits.

158
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,554
Cure the sick.

159
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,582
Cast out demons.

160
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,066
Take nothing with you...

161
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,847
as you meet people.

162
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,897
No bread,

163
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,251
no bag,

164
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,463
no money.

165
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:59,453
Your mission begins in this world,
and is fulfilled in the next.

166
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,790
You are my apostles.

167
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:21,610
Go to the other side|and wait for me

168
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:33,670
Please,
I need to rest for a while.

169
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,788
Please go home.

170
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:38,433
Just for one night.
I need to get some rest.

171
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:54,205
( distant thunder )

172
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,246
We're sinking!

173
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,627
( shouting )

174
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,319
I can't swim.

175
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,529
In this storm,
it doesn't matter!

176
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,450
Are we going over?

177
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,327
Why don't you ask
our great captain?

178
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:40,369
Bail!

179
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,989
I'm bailing!

180
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:43,183
Bail!

181
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:44,610
I'm bailing!

182
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,963
It's a ghost!

183
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,946
Don't be afraid!

184
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,113
Lord...

185
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:10,080
if it is you, command me
to come to you on the water.

186
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,063
Come!

187
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:25,593
- No, don't go, Simon!
- I want to go.

188
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,391
( thunderclap )

189
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:57,526
Lord!

190
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:00,014
Save me!

191
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,797
Save me!

192
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:10,627
Lord, save me.
Save me.

193
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:13,401
You of little faith!

194
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:44,677
Truly,
you are the Son of God.

195
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,980
When he speaks,
multitudes come.

196
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:55,360
Multitudes?
Let's not exaggerate.

197
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,503
Five thousand, at least.

198
00:16:57,544 --> 00:17:01,005
They say he fed them all
with one basket of fish.

199
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,090
Do you mock me?

200
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:05,974
It is said that he is a relative
of John the Baptist.

201
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:08,851
The Baptist?

202
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:10,735
Whom you killed.

203
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:15,462
Didn't the Baptist say
that he would live again?

204
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,668
Weren't those his last words?

205
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:21,178
And what if it's him...

206
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:22,641
come back to destroy me?

207
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,592
Perhaps.

208
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:31,992
Just raise your hand,
and crush him.

209
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:35,134
Guard!

210
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:45,619
Jesus!
Have mercy on me!

211
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:48,657
My daughter's tormented
by a demon!

212
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,046
Have mercy on my daughter!

213
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:53,460
Send the Canaanite away.
She has no place here.

214
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:56,922
Jesus!
Please, have mercy!

215
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,748
You are not a Jew.

216
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:01,852
I was sent only to the lost sheep
of the house of lsrael.

217
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,916
Jesus, have mercy!
Have mercy, Lord.

218
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:13,299
Please help me.

219
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:18,590
It is not fair to take children's food
and throw it to the dogs.

220
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:24,511
Yet even the dogs eat the crumbs
that fall from their master's table.

221
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,510
Woman...

222
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:46,618
great is your faith.

223
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,879
Your daughter is healed.

224
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,406
Go and find her.

225
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,843
Bless you,
Jesus of Nazareth!

226
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:03,324
Master,
our God is for the Gentiles?

227
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:05,432
I saw a dying girl.

228
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,924
Would you rather
I let her die?

229
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:16,638
This woman has taught me...

230
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:19,179
that my message
is for the Gentiles as well.

231
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:21,433
If I can learn,
so can you.

232
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:47,346
Mary...

233
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,306
Come.

234
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,549
Son, this is a new friend
of mine...

235
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,002
Mary Magdalene.
She wishes to join us.

236
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:02,581
I know Mary.

237
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:06,352
I am a prostitute, Jesus.

238
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:08,502
You were...

239
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:09,898
once...

240
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,883
a long time ago.

241
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:26,942
Your father
would be so proud.

242
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,333
Which one?

243
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,612
Both.

244
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,322
There's 30 pieces
of silver in there,

245
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:36,109
and plenty more
where that came from,

246
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,602
if we put our minds to it.

247
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:39,908
Give it back.

248
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,427
( laughter )

249
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,444
I can't give it back.

250
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,033
It came
from many different people.

251
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,107
Then give it away to the poor.

252
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,688
After what it took
for me to get it?

253
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,803
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

254
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,642
Give it to the poor.

255
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,967
Help us!
Please, help us!

256
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,918
Help me!
We're starving!

257
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:19,573
A gift
from the Messiah!

258
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,362
- Jesus!
- Yes.

259
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,770
Jesus, do you remember me?
I am Zerah. We met in Bethany.

260
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:18,282
Yes, of course,
I remember you.

261
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:19,410
Lazarus is dying!

262
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:21,457
Mary and Martha
have sent me to find you.

263
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:23,215
They beg of you.
Come quickly!

264
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:28,080
Thank you, Zerah.
Thank you for the message.

265
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:31,542
You can ride behind me.
We will be there before the sun sets.

266
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:32,635
You go ahead.

267
00:22:32,678 --> 00:22:35,587
But, Lord,
he is gravely ill!

268
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,435
You go ahead.

269
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:40,416
You're not going to come?
You're going to help?

270
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:42,400
I'll come
when the time is right.

271
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:43,811
They said...

272
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:45,031
you were their friend!

273
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:52,405
Lord, you have spoken
of Lazarus many times.

274
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,091
If you need
to go to him, you must.

275
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,669
He heals strangers,
but does nothing for his friends.

276
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,499
It smells so good.

277
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,445
My father...

278
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:23,585
taught me how to get
the best wood from a tree like this.

279
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:25,770
Were you a good carpenter?

280
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,817
It's a good thing
I started preaching.

281
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:31,942
See, Joseph used to say
that only his hands were educated.

282
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,902
That wasn't true.

283
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:37,035
He was the wisest man
I've known.

284
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:39,547
Wise and generous.

285
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,631
He would give his last crust
of bread to a stranger.

286
00:23:41,674 --> 00:23:44,020
Even to a Gentile?

287
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,760
You question me too, Mary?

288
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,212
No. Never.

289
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,817
I would never question you.

290
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:58,570
But you question yourself.

291
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:07,917
I just don't understand how you
could believe in someone like me.

292
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:11,368
God forgives you, Mary.

293
00:24:16,544 --> 00:24:20,040
If I were a man I would be
your most loyal disciple.

294
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,631
Those who speak for me
are my disciples.

295
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:40,616
Lazarus was a good man, Mary.

296
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,895
- Yes, he was.
- It's a great loss.

297
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,941
Your brother will rise again.

298
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:59,759
Resurrection day?

299
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:03,597
I am the resurrection and the life.
Those who believe in me will live.

300
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,408
Do you believe this?

301
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,432
I know who you are, now.

302
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:18,708
Jesus!

303
00:25:20,596 --> 00:25:24,757
If you had been here,
Lazarus would not have died.

304
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,141
Where have you laid him?

305
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,256
Lazarus has died...

306
00:25:52,515 --> 00:25:54,297
so you may believe!

307
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,353
You...

308
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,637
take the stone away.

309
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:05,598
Jesus!
It has been four days.

310
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:08,022
Take the stone away!

311
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:48,902
Father...

312
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:52,148
I thank you
for having heard me.

313
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:57,599
Lazarus, come out!

314
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,775
He mocks us with a "show."

315
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,959
Trust Jesus, Martha.

316
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:14,405
Someone should stop this.
It's a cruel joke!

317
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:32,903
( screams )

318
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,389
It's a miracle.

319
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,471
Unbind him.

320
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,449
God be praised!

321
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:26,625
( pounding )
Silence! Silence!

322
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,719
Raised from the dead?!

323
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:33,645
I was there, Caiaphas.

324
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:36,712
I saw my friend Lazarus
come out of the tomb.

325
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:40,419
I smelled the rotting flesh,

326
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:44,157
but he walked out
of the tomb alive!

327
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:47,691
A dead dog thrown in the cave
just before it was closed.

328
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:52,325
I marched
with the funeral procession!

329
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:56,557
I watched the body
being put into the tomb,

330
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:59,731
and the door shut and sealed.

331
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,720
Examine the evidence...

332
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,586
Jesus and Lazarus
are old friends.

333
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:08,430
The sister is in love with Jesus,
by your own account.

334
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:09,752
- True.
- So, think!

335
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,360
Who better to concoct
this story with?

336
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,940
Lazarus pretends to be dead.

337
00:29:14,982 --> 00:29:16,955
He spends a few nights
in the cave.

338
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:18,417
The High Priest is right.

339
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:22,016
All it takes is one
"raising from the dead" story

340
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,376
to make this Jesus a legend.

341
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:26,221
And suddenly,
he is "the Messiah."

342
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:29,232
There are reports
of another raising, a child.

343
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,216
There are always reports.

344
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,092
That's how
these false prophets live...

345
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:35,975
on "reports"!

346
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:38,643
Gossip
is their lifeblood!

347
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:40,363
No one...

348
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:43,690
no one can defeat death.

349
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,708
Think!

350
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,163
You know nothing at all.

351
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:50,895
How can a gentle man
who teaches the laws of Moses

352
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:53,844
and keeps our traditions
be a danger?

353
00:29:53,878 --> 00:29:56,415
A man who loves our people,

354
00:29:56,457 --> 00:30:00,549
and gives them the courage
to live a hard life.

355
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,801
Word is spreading
among the population

356
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,349
that the Messiah has arrived.

357
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:06,006
They will rise up
against Rome!

358
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,753
And the Romans
will crush the revolt!

359
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,539
( uproar )

360
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,868
Only this time, they will
crush us along with it!

361
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,074
We are the peacekeepers,

362
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,863
and if no peace is kept,

363
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,868
Rome will destroy the Temple,
along with the nation.

364
00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:24,917
Pilate has made that clear.

365
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:26,601
You...

366
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,445
you...

367
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,056
you.

368
00:30:32,658 --> 00:30:34,664
You will die!

369
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:40,221
And along with you, the blood
of Abraham, Moses, and Elijah.

370
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:45,551
We cannot allow this
because of one false "Messiah"!

371
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,913
Judas lscariot,
do you know us?

372
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:10,237
You were with Barabbas.

373
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:11,693
Barabbas has been arrested.

374
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:13,407
The Zealots have been driven
into the mountains.

375
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,455
But your rabbi
could rally them once again.

376
00:31:15,497 --> 00:31:17,008
There is an army waiting.

377
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:18,404
This triumphant entry
into Jerusalem--

378
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,685
On a donkey in torn robes,
it's brilliant!

379
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:23,529
It makes Herod and Pilate look like
the asses they actually are.

380
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:25,742
When will Jesus call
for revolution?

381
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:29,774
Soon. Soon.

382
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:31,889
We'll be watching
for the right moment, Judas.

383
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,780
- Praise Jesus!
- Praise Jesus!

384
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,998
This man must be arrested.

385
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,722
In the middle of this
ridiculous festival...

386
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:24,046
Passover.

387
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:27,386
No, no!
Block, then thrust, Giannario!

388
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:30,662
Whoever heard of a festival

389
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:33,166
to celebrate that your own god
didn't destroy you.

390
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:36,344
-These Jews are mad.
-These Jews are dangerous!

391
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,132
I can't arrest
their current hero

392
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,018
while there are thousands
of them in town.

393
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:42,467
I'd have a riot on my hands.
Think, Livio!

394
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,854
Then do it at night.

395
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,671
Find someone to betray him.
Get him alone, I don't care.

396
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,286
But if you don't stop him,

397
00:32:47,328 --> 00:32:49,776
he's going to bring Rome
down on us all.

398
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,456
He must be stopped--

399
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:52,781
dead!

400
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:55,784
I thought you were a better
politician than this, Livio.

401
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:59,887
Paolo, teach him
to counter that attack!

402
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,566
If there is another rebellion
in this miserable place,

403
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,491
Rome will throw both of us
to the lions!

404
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,869
I could kill this "Messiah"
tomorrow...

405
00:33:05,904 --> 00:33:08,216
and there will be another
right behind him.

406
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,251
- Or...
- Or?

407
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:13,437
We could see to it
that he becomes

408
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:15,822
a problem for some
of his own people,

409
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:19,196
and they could solve
the problem for us.

410
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:25,707
Bravo, Giannario!

411
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:37,104
Master?
Master, may I speak with you?

412
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:38,491
Yes.

413
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:42,551
Lord, there will never
be a better time

414
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:45,164
to strike against
Roman power in Jerusalem.

415
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,619
There is an army
of Zealots waiting.

416
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:50,856
The city is full
of pilgrims for Passover.

417
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:52,540
They believe in you.

418
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,504
Rise up, ask them to attack
the palace, they will.

419
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:58,994
Sheer numbers will overwhelm
the Roman guard,

420
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:02,130
and once we are in charge,
Rome will leave us alone.

421
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,908
Now is the time.

422
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:08,318
Surely it is your destiny.

423
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,024
In two days...

424
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,256
it will be Passover.

425
00:34:28,187 --> 00:34:30,531
In two days,
I will be killed.

426
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,803
Please, God!
Not now!

427
00:34:33,842 --> 00:34:35,023
No.

428
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:36,350
No, my Lord!

429
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,033
No, it cannot be.

430
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:40,285
Lord, the Zealots
will join with your followers.

431
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:41,743
Thousands at your command!

432
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:43,818
Freedom, not just
from the Romans,

433
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:46,205
but from all tyranny.
The tyranny of sin, Judas.

434
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,022
That is my battle,
not the Romans.

435
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:51,521
Then you are betraying
your people, not saving them.

436
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:53,515
You are the one man
who has the power,

437
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:55,996
and yet you refuse?
That's betrayal!

438
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,340
I'm not here to lead
a violent revolution, Judas!

439
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,009
You may have no choice.

440
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:05,135
God forbid it, Lord!

441
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:08,551
It must happen, Peter.

442
00:35:08,587 --> 00:35:10,628
No, Lord.
I will not let it happen!

443
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:14,096
- None of us will!
- It is God's will, Peter.

444
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:16,555
No, Lord, it cannot be.
You must prevent this!

445
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:18,404
I cannot allow myself
to prevent it.

446
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,154
I must do as my Father
has commanded.

447
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:22,471
No, Lord, you cannot die.
Your mission is only beginning!

448
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:24,616
- Peter--
- You cannot let this happen!

449
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:26,236
I will fight
with all my strength.

450
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:27,462
Satan!

451
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:31,265
Get away from me.

452
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,544
Why?

453
00:36:02,372 --> 00:36:03,725
It's why I was born.

454
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,903
To die?

455
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:07,159
Now?

456
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:15,792
To prove God's love.

457
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:18,535
How?
How is that love?

458
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:21,911
I have to give everything.

459
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,048
Nothing held back...

460
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:28,387
so they will know.

461
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:48,060
It's too much to pay
for an animal to be sacrificed.

462
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:50,542
Then go away,
ignorant Galilean.

463
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,525
I have every right
to worship in the Temple.

464
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,517
A sacrifice is required.
Buy or go away!

465
00:36:56,562 --> 00:37:00,158
You control this only because
you lick the boots of Rome!

466
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,553
You fool!

467
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,317
( woman screams )

468
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:24,061
The Romans have spilled
the blood of our brothers,

469
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,947
and in the grounds
of the Holy Temple!

470
00:37:25,984 --> 00:37:28,195
And do you know why
this happened?

471
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:30,048
Yes, because Rome
rules this city,

472
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:32,191
and now the Temple.

473
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:35,863
They appointed you,
and now they own you, Caiaphas.

474
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:37,855
It happened
because of Jesus of Nazareth!

475
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,929
Because of the Romans!

476
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:43,275
These men who attacked the priests
were from Galilee, Nazareth.

477
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,757
They would never have had
the strength or the will,

478
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:48,001
except for this Jesus.

479
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,132
He makes the people think
they can overthrow Rome.

480
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:54,518
Have you forgotten
what he did at the Temple?

481
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:58,422
Kicking over the tables!
These Galileans are following his lead!

482
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:00,902
The speeches
inflame the people.

483
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:03,146
He has followers,
armed and ready

484
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:06,127
to attack the Romans at any minute!
Is that what you want?

485
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,329
I want you gone
from this council!

486
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,747
You blame everyone but yourself.

487
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:14,094
I will not stand by
and watch you destroy us.

488
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:18,585
I am withdrawing until you
come to your senses and resign.

489
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,480
As I told you before...

490
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,557
if we let this man continue,

491
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,271
the people will say
the Messiah is here,

492
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,378
so they will rise up
against Rome again.

493
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:40,915
And the Romans
will crush the revolt.

494
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:44,691
It is better for you
to have one man die

495
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:47,229
for the good of the people

496
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:49,911
than to have
the whole nation destroyed.

497
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,587
Jesus of Nazareth...

498
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,522
must die.

499
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,974
There are rumors
in the streets, priest!

500
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:18,562
Rumors?

501
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:21,210
Don't be coy with me!

502
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,779
This man, Jesus,

503
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:28,384
rides an ass into town,
and is welcomed like a king!

504
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:30,670
Herod wants to kill him,
but does nothing,

505
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,950
and you promise me you
can keep peace in the Temple,

506
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:36,416
but I had to use swords!

507
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,032
- Rome will not be silent forever!
- These false messiahs--

508
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:42,534
Don't speak to me of messiahs!

509
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:47,168
I don't care about your religion,
I care about peace!

510
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,854
Peace, yes.
I too, care about peace--

511
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:50,812
Well then,
get control of this man!

512
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:53,653
I fear my power is...

513
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:56,863
limited.

514
00:39:57,352 --> 00:40:00,385
So you want me to do
your dirty work for you?

515
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:03,034
I have no choice.

516
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:07,799
I cannot endanger lsrael
for one man.

517
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,787
Bring him to me.

518
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:16,030
I will eliminate him.

519
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,774
( clapping )

520
00:40:54,757 --> 00:40:56,831
Quick, quick!
Come on!

521
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,385
Quick!

522
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:07,386
This is too dangerous.

523
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,128
We should not be
in Jerusalem.

524
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,122
I will die with him...

525
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:16,899
if this is what he wants.

526
00:41:57,695 --> 00:42:00,794
Take...

527
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:02,786
eat.

528
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:06,654
This is my body.

529
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,809
Drink from it...

530
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:48,209
all of you,

531
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:50,524
for this is my blood...

532
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:55,249
of the covenant,

533
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:57,735
which is poured out for many...

534
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:01,005
for the forgiveness of sins.

535
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,496
Do this in remembrance of me.

536
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:39,265
One of you will betray me.

537
00:43:39,303 --> 00:43:42,041
- No, no!
- Not l, Lord, never!

538
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,366
Not l, Lord!

539
00:43:43,403 --> 00:43:44,587
Nor l, Lord.

540
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:46,136
Nor l, Lord!

541
00:43:50,058 --> 00:43:51,976
Do what you have to do...

542
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:57,851
do it quickly.

543
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:18,759
Where is he going?

544
00:44:18,793 --> 00:44:21,072
My kingdom is coming.

545
00:44:27,557 --> 00:44:30,297
After three days,
I will rise again.

546
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,682
I am told you have something
to say to me.

547
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:21,217
I know where he is.
I can deliver him to you.

548
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:23,168
And the price?

549
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,599
You think I'm a beggar?
A thief?

550
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:31,230
Then why do you come to me?
Aren't you one of his followers?

551
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,539
I am one of his disciples.
He chose me himself.

552
00:45:34,403 --> 00:45:36,017
Then why do you betray him?

553
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:39,322
He's not the man
I thought he was.

554
00:45:42,736 --> 00:45:45,972
You want to pay me, eh?

555
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:49,174
Thirty pieces of silver.

556
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:52,513
Done.

557
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:01,739
Lord, where are we going?

558
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:03,950
We should have stayed
in the room.

559
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,595
What if we are seen up here?
You know they want to kill you!

560
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:09,878
Not now.

561
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:12,818
Rabbi...

562
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,424
if all of your followers
become deserters,

563
00:46:15,466 --> 00:46:18,633
I want you to know
I will never desert you.

564
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:21,808
Peter, tonight, before the dawn,
you will betray me three times.

565
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:24,028
Never.

566
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:25,981
Even if I must die with you,
I will never betray you.

567
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:39,427
Sit here while I go
over there and pray.

568
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:42,044
John, Andrew, Peter,
James, come with me.

569
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,277
- Master, I will never--
- Not now, Peter.

570
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:09,996
I am deeply grieved.

571
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:15,847
What I face now would be
difficult for any man...

572
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:21,039
and I must face it as a man,
to fulfill my pledge.

573
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:29,737
Wait here,
and stay awake with me,

574
00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:31,592
while I go
overthere and pray.

575
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:33,777
Yes, Lord.

576
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:35,886
Yes, Lord.

577
00:47:42,178 --> 00:47:46,304
My Father, if it is possible,
let this pass from me.

578
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,760
Yet, not what I want,
but what you want.

579
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,772
He is out
at the Mount of Olives,

580
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:13,728
in a garden
called Gethsemane.

581
00:48:13,762 --> 00:48:15,835
I followed him there
with his men.

582
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:17,953
I'll take you there.

583
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:21,788
How many are there?

584
00:48:21,831 --> 00:48:23,048
Twelve.

585
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:26,290
How will we know
which one he is?

586
00:48:26,328 --> 00:48:29,924
The one I kiss is Jesus.

587
00:48:31,122 --> 00:48:32,836
My Father...

588
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,286
if this cannot pass
unless I drink all of it,

589
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:38,197
then your will be done.

590
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,252
But if there is another way...

591
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:46,595
I am so afraid I cannot
endure this, my Father.

592
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:59,046
The final act begins, Jesus.

593
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,635
There will be no reprieve
handed down from your Father.

594
00:49:04,438 --> 00:49:06,479
He's willing for you
to go through this,

595
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,689
every painful step of the way.

596
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:14,056
If it is his will.

597
00:49:14,093 --> 00:49:15,875
His will?

598
00:49:18,227 --> 00:49:21,463
His will for you
is to be flogged,

599
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:24,466
spit on, humiliated,

600
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,979
dragged through the streets,
laughed at,

601
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:31,252
tried, convicted
and crucified.

602
00:49:32,744 --> 00:49:37,401
You've seen crucifixion,
but you've never felt it.

603
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,062
You've never felt the pain
of nails through your hands,

604
00:49:42,102 --> 00:49:45,135
of nails through your feet.

605
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:49,371
It's agony.
It's hours in agony.

606
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,998
The weight of your own body
crushes your lungs,

607
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:58,300
and you'll suffocate,
slowly.

608
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:02,363
And you will endure this alone.

609
00:50:02,406 --> 00:50:05,404
Look at them over there.
They can't even stay awake.

610
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:06,985
And they'll run,
as soon as Judas shows up.

611
00:50:07,027 --> 00:50:08,910
You know I'm right...

612
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:11,944
and it's all in vain, Jesus.

613
00:50:11,988 --> 00:50:17,569
No, no...
not in vain.

614
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:20,375
Through me God will reveal
his love for mankind.

615
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:22,452
God?

616
00:50:22,494 --> 00:50:25,403
That unseen, heartless,
burn-in-hell,

617
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,749
watch-your-children-starve God?

618
00:50:27,785 --> 00:50:29,173
Not in vain.

619
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:30,785
Oh, yes...

620
00:50:32,348 --> 00:50:34,097
in vain.

621
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:37,988
Let me show you--
the future.

622
00:50:38,028 --> 00:50:41,129
Crusades, in your name.

623
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,673
"Jesus Christ" they shout,
when they kill.

624
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:47,052
In the name of Jesus Christ!

625
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:50,156
In the name of Jesus Christ!

626
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,966
Killing for Christ
will be a big business

627
00:50:57,009 --> 00:50:59,919
through the centuries,
Christ Jesus.

628
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,484
And this is what
you're dying for.

629
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:05,992
This is what your agony
will give them.

630
00:51:06,037 --> 00:51:09,306
another reason to kill
and torture each other.

631
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:14,362
Don't you think they have
enough reasons already...

632
00:51:14,403 --> 00:51:16,503
It's so easy.
th It is so easy Jesus,

633
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:18,327
just ask him
to come get you.

634
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:22,332
The world at war!

635
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:27,655
Why?

636
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:30,074
Why?
Who knows?

637
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:32,150
That guy doesn't like the pimple
on the nose of that guy--

638
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:34,823
but you can stop it.
Tonight!

639
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,283
You can stop it.

640
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:39,091
Come down off that cross
they have waiting for you.

641
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:42,003
Why die in agony
when you can take control?

642
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,012
Make the earth a paradise!

643
00:52:44,057 --> 00:52:46,727
End poverty! End hunger!
End war!

644
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:49,643
You can do it!
It's within your power, right now.

645
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:51,920
- No, I cannot.
- Oh, yes, you can.

646
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,739
It is not God's will.

647
00:52:53,778 --> 00:52:56,776
It is not God's will
to end a war?

648
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,164
What kind
of a God is that?

649
00:52:59,201 --> 00:53:01,049
One who loves mankind so much

650
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:03,296
that he gives them
freedom of choice.

651
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:06,210
He hasn't created them
so that he can be their dictator.

652
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:08,849
He gives them the choice
of doing good or evil.

653
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,358
And this is what they choose.

654
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,831
Yes.

655
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:16,746
I forgive you.

656
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:19,389
I don't want
your forgiveness.

657
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:23,590
Look, here comes
Judas and his mob.

658
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:30,565
Jesus, you don't even
have to bow down to me.

659
00:53:30,606 --> 00:53:31,959
I'm not even asking you that.

660
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:34,735
Just call to your Father,
and ask him to deliver you.

661
00:53:34,773 --> 00:53:36,554
Tell him you don't want this.

662
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,305
He won't make you go through this,
you know he won't.

663
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:41,077
Just wave your hand,
and you'll be home... safe.

664
00:53:41,115 --> 00:53:43,358
Do it-- now.

665
00:53:43,396 --> 00:53:46,100
You know
what I showed you was true.

666
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,609
You are going to die in vain.

667
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:51,595
You don't know the plan. I do.
I've seen it. Nothing changes.

668
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:54,268
They don't have the capacity
to love like you want them to.

669
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:55,852
This will never happen.

670
00:53:55,896 --> 00:54:00,688
Just lift your hands,
Jesus, and wave this all away.

671
00:54:00,723 --> 00:54:05,312
Go home, Jesus.
Go home to your Father... now.

672
00:54:05,352 --> 00:54:07,991
Don't die in vain.

673
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:10,736
Don't die alone.

674
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:13,104
I am not alone.

675
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:16,741
I'm with my Father.

676
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:20,415
- You will die in vain, Jesus.
- No!

677
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,667
I am in the hearts of man.

678
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:24,385
I will die
for the everlasting kindness

679
00:54:24,425 --> 00:54:27,368
of the human heart
created by the Father,

680
00:54:27,401 --> 00:54:31,459
so that men will make his image
shine once again,

681
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,105
And those who will want to,

682
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:38,047
will find in me the strength
to love until the end!

683
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:43,986
Friend...

684
00:54:46,573 --> 00:54:48,455
do what you are here to do.

685
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:00,418
Betrayed with a kiss.

686
00:55:07,306 --> 00:55:09,379
(jeers and shouting )

687
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:45,513
You-- I know you.
You were with him!

688
00:55:45,549 --> 00:55:48,817
He was with
the great "Messiah."

689
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:51,595
You're a fool!

690
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:53,447
You are the fool!

691
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:56,326
You followed him around
like a dog!

692
00:55:56,362 --> 00:55:58,830
I never saw that man before!

693
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,267
I don't know
what you're talking about!

694
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,468
He claims to be the Messiah.

695
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:10,312
His disciples claim
he raised a man from the dead.

696
00:56:10,348 --> 00:56:13,122
- lmpossible!
- Not when you are the Son of God.

697
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,497
- Is that who you claim to be?
- Is this a trial?

698
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:20,828
It is our duty, Seth, to protect
the Temple from false prophets.

699
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:25,057
Your duty, brother Jared,
is of no concern here.

700
00:56:25,096 --> 00:56:27,836
You fear him because
the people listen to him,

701
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:29,478
because he asks us
to become better Jews.

702
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,832
Who do you say you are?

703
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:33,942
Be careful what you say.

704
00:56:35,134 --> 00:56:36,880
Answer.

705
00:56:38,142 --> 00:56:41,209
Do you claim to be
the Son of God?

706
00:56:42,707 --> 00:56:44,748
It is you who says it.

707
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:47,665
He admits it!
Blasphemy!

708
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:49,672
You cannot deny it!

709
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:54,773
This man was with
Jesus of Nazareth!

710
00:56:55,727 --> 00:56:57,541
You're a liar.

711
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:02,330
( laughing )

712
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:12,118
You false prophet!

713
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:13,766
Take him to Pilate!

714
00:57:17,578 --> 00:57:20,486
I swear, I don't know
what they are talking about!

715
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:30,174
( rooster crows )

716
00:58:17,182 --> 00:58:19,459
I can't.

717
00:58:22,109 --> 00:58:24,319
I can't watch them hurt him.

718
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,989
If you believe in my son.

719
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:31,659
you will stand by him, with me.

720
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:42,209
Caiaphas, what are you doing
coming here at this hour?

721
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:44,918
We bring you
Jesus of Nazareth.

722
00:58:58,673 --> 00:59:00,815
Jesus?

723
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:04,260
So this is the one who makes
a mockery of Herod Antipas,

724
00:59:04,293 --> 00:59:06,245
and causes my High Priest
to tremble.

725
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:09,476
Jesus of Nazareth,

726
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,091
I am Pontius Pilate,
Governor of Judea.

727
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,266
I know who you are.

728
00:59:16,563 --> 00:59:20,259
Well, what accusation
do you bring against this man?

729
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:23,828
Blasphemy,
punishable by death.

730
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:27,501
Blasphemy against what?
Your god?

731
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:30,539
- Yes, my lord.
- This is not a crime against Rome.

732
00:59:32,304 --> 00:59:34,580
But he also proclaims
himself as king.

733
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,590
He denies
Rome's power in this land.

734
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:39,543
Oh, Caiaphas,
stop wasting my time.

735
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:40,989
Take him and judge him
according to your law!

736
00:59:41,025 --> 00:59:44,790
This crime, my lord,
demands a death sentence.

737
00:59:44,827 --> 00:59:47,072
And only you can give
this punishment.

738
00:59:49,515 --> 00:59:51,432
Leave him with me.

739
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,671
Jesus of Nazareth.

740
01:00:09,124 --> 01:00:11,796
You have an interesting face.

741
01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:17,903
Are you
the King of the Jews, Jesus?

742
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:23,390
Do you ask this on your own,
or did others tell you about me?

743
01:00:23,434 --> 01:00:25,576
I'm not a Jew!

744
01:00:25,616 --> 01:00:28,525
Your own nation and chief priests
have handed you over to me.

745
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,838
My kingdom
is not of this world.

746
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,343
If it were, my followers
would be fighting.

747
01:00:33,388 --> 01:00:35,068
Oh, so you are a king?

748
01:00:35,107 --> 01:00:37,206
I was born
to testify to the truth.

749
01:00:38,174 --> 01:00:39,922
Really?

750
01:00:47,697 --> 01:00:50,009
What is the truth?

751
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,472
Everyone wants to know
the truth, Jesus.

752
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:58,837
Do you know the truth?

753
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:04,727
If I could find a man
who knew the truth

754
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,826
I would take him to Rome,

755
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:09,617
and escape this burnt
crust of a country.

756
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:15,036
It's within my power.

757
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,855
No.

758
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:21,938
I didn't think so.

759
01:01:23,932 --> 01:01:27,799
Too much to ask.
Bring him.

760
01:01:32,926 --> 01:01:34,968
I find no case
against this man.

761
01:01:35,903 --> 01:01:37,786
This man
is perverting our nation,

762
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,289
forbidding us from paying
taxes to your emperor,

763
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:42,938
and saying that he himself
is the Messiah, the king!

764
01:01:42,978 --> 01:01:43,598
Caiaphas...

765
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:46,740
He stirs up people
by teaching throughout all Judea,

766
01:01:46,781 --> 01:01:49,318
from Galilee where he began,
even to this holy city.

767
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:51,243
He is from Galilee?

768
01:01:51,279 --> 01:01:52,732
Yes.

769
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,244
Oh, well--

770
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:56,532
that comes under
Herod's jurisdiction.

771
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:59,377
I can't rule on a crime
from Herod's people.

772
01:01:59,413 --> 01:02:00,799
And you're lucky,
my friend.

773
01:02:00,835 --> 01:02:02,876
Herod just happens to be
in Jerusalem for Passover.

774
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:03,338
Go tell him the "truth."

775
01:02:03,373 --> 01:02:05,515
Take him to Herod.

776
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,337
But, my lord--

777
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:11,275
Stop worrying, Caiaphas.
It's a game, just a game.

778
01:02:11,308 --> 01:02:13,520
We have to have
some fun occasionally.

779
01:02:17,453 --> 01:02:20,879
Jesus of Nazareth.

780
01:02:20,924 --> 01:02:23,461
This is Jesus of Nazareth.

781
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:26,739
I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

782
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:28,592
Welcome.

783
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:33,321
Livio, look, we are visited
by Jesus of Nazareth.

784
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:34,936
Behold, the "Messiah."

785
01:02:34,978 --> 01:02:38,677
I've heard all kinds
of wonderful things about you.

786
01:02:38,715 --> 01:02:40,821
Livio tells me you can
raise men from the dead.

787
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:43,569
Not even John the Baptist
ever raised a man from the dead.

788
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:44,826
Livio, quiet.

789
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:46,906
This is no ordinary criminal
standing here.

790
01:02:46,948 --> 01:02:49,587
This is a man of God.

791
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:52,896
I apologize for this Roman's behavior.

792
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:58,017
You're a man of God,
are you not?

793
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,847
Yes, well...

794
01:03:02,887 --> 01:03:07,441
I heard wonderful things,
healing the sick and such.

795
01:03:09,071 --> 01:03:11,381
I made a mistake
with the Baptist.

796
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:12,865
I never meant
to have him killed.

797
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:15,503
This man is dangerous
to the entire country.

798
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:18,115
He encourages rebellion
against Rome.

799
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:21,099
See, that's just a lie,
isn't it, Jesus?

800
01:03:21,132 --> 01:03:23,602
I never heard
anything like that.

801
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:25,923
He calls himself
the King of the Jews.

802
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,742
Quiet, Livio.

803
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,594
You will be King of the Jews.

804
01:03:35,317 --> 01:03:37,629
Is that true?

805
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:40,575
Do you crown yourself "king"?

806
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:43,055
See... see, that disturbs me,

807
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:47,216
because I have the idea
that I should be king of lsrael,

808
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:52,646
not a dirty, uneducated
prophet from Nazareth.

809
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,148
( laughter )

810
01:03:57,962 --> 01:04:00,836
Oh, but, but I am willing
to overlook all that,

811
01:04:00,872 --> 01:04:03,938
if you just show me a sign.

812
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:07,385
Everyone is talking about
you curing blind men and lepers.

813
01:04:07,419 --> 01:04:08,963
Lepers! Ugh!

814
01:04:09,006 --> 01:04:10,979
Oh, yes, darling...

815
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:13,334
he is a--

816
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:17,431
supposedly he touches them,
and they are cured.

817
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:18,974
He touches the unclean?

818
01:04:19,018 --> 01:04:19,806
Yes.

819
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:23,342
Get him out of here,
and don't touch him.

820
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:27,415
I'm only asking
for a small sign.

821
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,624
It doesn't have to be
a big healing,

822
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:32,370
it's just that this knee
is causing me a lot of--

823
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:33,098
Don't touch him!

824
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:38,156
Is that it, Jesus?

825
01:04:38,197 --> 01:04:41,004
Are you really going
to stand there like a statue?

826
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:45,364
He won't even speak to me.

827
01:04:45,404 --> 01:04:47,675
Silence can be
a politician's best weapon.

828
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,683
Kings must talk!

829
01:04:50,723 --> 01:04:53,067
Talking is a requirement,
didn't you know that?

830
01:04:53,102 --> 01:04:55,313
There's never been
a mute king.

831
01:04:55,352 --> 01:04:58,654
Behold the Mute King
of the Jews!

832
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:13,355
- Behold the King!
- And get him out of here.

833
01:05:13,394 --> 01:05:16,664
Your Majesty! Your Majesty,
do not let this charlatan escape!

834
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:20,072
Exactly, a charlatan.
What do you care?

835
01:05:20,107 --> 01:05:23,049
Even false prophets
can have power.

836
01:05:23,082 --> 01:05:25,393
Let Rome handle it.

837
01:05:27,713 --> 01:05:31,016
Take him to Pilate.
Take him to Pilate!

838
01:05:47,222 --> 01:05:50,526
Well, what a surprise.
Jesus is back.

839
01:05:50,562 --> 01:05:53,100
You mean to tell me
that Herod did nothing?

840
01:05:53,142 --> 01:05:55,216
As you predicted.

841
01:05:58,069 --> 01:06:02,522
Do you not hear the many
accusations they make against you?

842
01:06:02,566 --> 01:06:05,902
Treason...

843
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:07,980
claiming to be God...

844
01:06:08,022 --> 01:06:12,114
insurrection!

845
01:06:12,155 --> 01:06:15,989
Do you answer any
of these charges?

846
01:06:18,372 --> 01:06:21,010
And now, we will let
"the people" speak.

847
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:25,046
You brought me this man,

848
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:29,245
as one who was
perverting the people.

849
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,729
I have examined him
in your presence,

850
01:06:31,764 --> 01:06:35,891
and have found him not to be guilty
of any of your charges.

851
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:38,739
He's guilty, Pilate.
He's guilty!

852
01:06:38,776 --> 01:06:40,523
He's guilty!

853
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:43,434
Passover?

854
01:06:43,471 --> 01:06:45,251
A custom at Passover.

855
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,976
As is the custom at Passover,

856
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:56,365
I as representative of Rome,
release to you a prisoner.

857
01:06:57,788 --> 01:07:01,690
I give you Jesus of Nazareth.

858
01:07:04,964 --> 01:07:06,811
No! No!

859
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,817
Yes! Yes! Yes!

860
01:07:10,404 --> 01:07:13,280
Just give us justice, Pilate!

861
01:07:13,314 --> 01:07:15,816
Not Jesus!
Have you forgotten--

862
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:20,685
Don't you want me to release
the King of the Jews?

863
01:07:20,721 --> 01:07:24,126
Yes!
Release him!

864
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,472
Yes! Yes!

865
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:29,642
Release Jesus!

866
01:07:29,682 --> 01:07:31,858
No! No!

867
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:34,968
Release Barabbas!
Give us Barabbas!

868
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:37,047
Barabbas! Barabbas!

869
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:39,468
Barabbas! Barabbas!

870
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,501
Do you hear
what they want, Jesus?

871
01:07:46,597 --> 01:07:49,438
They'd rather have
a murderer than you.

872
01:07:51,954 --> 01:07:55,618
Bring me, Barabbas.
And flog this one.

873
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,206
Come on,
let's get out of here.

874
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,215
I'm not going to stand by
and watch a Jew beaten by Romans.

875
01:09:12,686 --> 01:09:15,188
Release Barabbas.

876
01:09:24,325 --> 01:09:27,821
Hail, the King of the Jews!

877
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:31,359
Barabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas!

878
01:09:36,196 --> 01:09:39,691
I release Barabbas!

879
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:41,482
( cheering )

880
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:46,904
Without a sword
you raised an army.

881
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:48,658
You could have taken the city.

882
01:09:48,696 --> 01:09:51,301
I fought them, you wouldn't!

883
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:55,670
So the sword will live
to fight another day, "Messiah"!

884
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,994
Hail!

885
01:10:00,038 --> 01:10:01,018
( cheering )

886
01:10:07,446 --> 01:10:09,362
Watch this.

887
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:12,892
I've thought of the final blow.

888
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,818
I am innocent
of this man's blood.

889
01:10:22,856 --> 01:10:26,057
See to it yourselves.

890
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:36,047
Crucify him.

891
01:10:46,862 --> 01:10:50,267
Make way. No pushing!
Stand aside!

892
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:18,006
Jesus...!

893
01:11:31,678 --> 01:11:33,130
Traitor!

894
01:11:33,992 --> 01:11:36,495
This is not what I wanted.
It's not what I wanted!

895
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:38,883
Do you think
this is what I wanted?

896
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,092
You sold him
to the Romans.

897
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:44,201
So that the people
would rise up!

898
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:45,530
For money!

899
01:11:45,566 --> 01:11:47,943
I was willing
to die for him.

900
01:11:51,882 --> 01:11:54,383
He was the revolution.

901
01:11:55,884 --> 01:11:58,758
But he refused.
I had to make it happen!

902
01:11:58,793 --> 01:12:03,450
I thought he would find his anger
under the Roman whip.

903
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:06,657
I thought the people
would follow him and rise up!

904
01:12:09,341 --> 01:12:11,946
But he is allowing
himself to die.

905
01:12:14,202 --> 01:12:16,548
The people
have turned against him.

906
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:19,088
Why?

907
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:24,480
- You killed him!
- And you...

908
01:12:24,519 --> 01:12:26,267
you abandoned him!

909
01:12:36,342 --> 01:12:40,006
I would have died for him.

910
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,504
(screaming )

911
01:13:43,236 --> 01:13:44,985
No! Jesus!

912
01:13:45,024 --> 01:13:48,089
Jesus, I'm here.

913
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:15,887
Ohh-- Father, forgive them...

914
01:14:15,922 --> 01:14:17,704
for they know not what they do!

915
01:14:17,742 --> 01:14:22,196
We know exactly
what we're doing, "Messiah."

916
01:14:25,313 --> 01:14:29,113
They've given him
a place to stand.

917
01:14:32,755 --> 01:14:34,602
Why?

918
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:38,436
So he will die slower.

919
01:15:11,344 --> 01:15:13,756
( thunder rumbling )

920
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:40,108
My God!

921
01:15:41,105 --> 01:15:44,014
Why have you forsaken me?!

922
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,766
Father...

923
01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:56,179
into your hands
I commend my spirit.

924
01:18:43,902 --> 01:18:46,439
They've stolen his body!

925
01:18:48,366 --> 01:18:50,509
What?

926
01:18:50,548 --> 01:18:54,448
The stone was rolled away.
They've taken his body!

927
01:18:56,203 --> 01:18:57,714
Taken?

928
01:18:57,758 --> 01:18:59,538
Who's taken his body?

929
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:06,019
Peter, John, no!
It's not safe!

930
01:19:19,086 --> 01:19:20,834
Gone!

931
01:19:24,277 --> 01:19:26,814
He is risen!

932
01:19:26,857 --> 01:19:28,807
Risen?
No, the body is stolen!

933
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:32,900
He said, "Afterthree days,
I will rise again."

934
01:19:34,032 --> 01:19:35,542
Risen...?

935
01:19:36,446 --> 01:19:37,900
He's alive!

936
01:19:45,507 --> 01:19:47,084
Mary, he's alive!

937
01:19:47,128 --> 01:19:49,202
He said he would rise
after three days. He's alive!

938
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,554
We must tell the others.
Come on!

939
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,718
Woman,
why are you weeping?

940
01:20:16,071 --> 01:20:19,306
If you carried my Lord away...

941
01:20:19,344 --> 01:20:21,351
tell me where you laid him.

942
01:20:21,395 --> 01:20:23,040
Please...?

943
01:20:23,081 --> 01:20:25,054
Mary.

944
01:20:26,817 --> 01:20:29,693
Teacher?

945
01:20:43,053 --> 01:20:45,432
Mary...

946
01:20:45,468 --> 01:20:47,744
you must let me go now.

947
01:20:47,781 --> 01:20:51,243
I haven't yet ascended
to my Father.

948
01:20:56,413 --> 01:21:00,336
Now go to the others
and tell them I'm alive.

949
01:21:00,381 --> 01:21:05,398
Mary, will you go
and tell them for me?

950
01:21:25,066 --> 01:21:26,813
I don't understand...

951
01:21:26,852 --> 01:21:29,761
How could you see him?
He's dead!

952
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:33,163
I've seen him.

953
01:21:35,846 --> 01:21:37,628
Is it true, Mary?

954
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,192
Yes...

955
01:21:40,236 --> 01:21:41,950
it's true.

956
01:21:43,642 --> 01:21:45,525
I've seen him.

957
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:48,961
I talked to him.

958
01:21:52,273 --> 01:21:54,742
This is ridiculous.

959
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:56,601
We saw him crucified!

960
01:21:56,638 --> 01:21:58,284
We buried him ourselves!

961
01:21:59,746 --> 01:22:00,929
How could he be alive?

962
01:22:00,969 --> 01:22:04,340
- How could Lazarus be alive?
- How could blind men see?

963
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:05,492
I'm sorry...

964
01:22:05,533 --> 01:22:08,600
but I don't believe that death
is conquered that easily.

965
01:22:08,641 --> 01:22:10,816
There are too many
other possibilities.

966
01:22:10,856 --> 01:22:12,705
He is the Son of God.

967
01:22:12,742 --> 01:22:16,406
Jesus himself said
there would be false prophets.

968
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:19,715
We have to be careful.
This could be a trick!

969
01:22:19,753 --> 01:22:23,980
Thomas, you must believe.

970
01:22:24,018 --> 01:22:27,852
I want to, Mary.
Believe me, I want to!

971
01:22:27,887 --> 01:22:30,660
But my mind won't let me.

972
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:32,268
I will have to see for myself.

973
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:34,982
Thomas...

974
01:22:36,973 --> 01:22:38,753
I saw him.

975
01:22:39,915 --> 01:22:42,418
Are you sure it was him?

976
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:49,371
Did you see the wounds in his wrists?

977
01:22:51,085 --> 01:22:54,252
See?

978
01:22:54,822 --> 01:22:56,828
She can't be sure.

979
01:22:57,696 --> 01:22:59,445
Something else
is going on here.

980
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:01,986
Unless I see
the mark of the nails--

981
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:05,435
no, unless I put my finger
in the mark of the nails,

982
01:23:05,469 --> 01:23:07,250
I will not believe.

983
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:09,665
Peace be with you.

984
01:23:39,017 --> 01:23:41,158
Thomas...

985
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:54,987
put your finger here.

986
01:23:59,684 --> 01:24:01,532
My Lord, and my God!

987
01:24:04,345 --> 01:24:06,916
Yes, you believe
because you have seen me.

988
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:13,331
Blessed are those
who believe without seeing.

989
01:24:13,928 --> 01:24:16,102
Now, go...

990
01:24:16,143 --> 01:24:19,278
into all the world,
and preach what you have heard.

991
01:24:21,335 --> 01:24:23,940
Preach the good news.

992
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,468
I am with you...

993
01:24:41,469 --> 01:24:42,469
Until the end of the world.
