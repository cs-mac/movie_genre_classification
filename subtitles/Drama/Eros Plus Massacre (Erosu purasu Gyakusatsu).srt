00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:14,853
<i>Mako!</i>

2
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:18,842
<i>In the confusion following
the great earthquake of 1923,</i>

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,888
<i>the anarchist Sakae Ôsugi was
assassinated, along with his wife.</i>

4
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,808
<i>She was your mother, Noe Itô, right?</i>

5
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:30,156
<i>You were seven years old
when your mother was killed.</i>

6
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,387
<i>Tell me what you remember.</i>

7
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,859
<i>You were seven,
so you must remember something.</i>

8
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:42,126
<i>When your mother left that morning,
what did she say to you?</i>

9
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,342
<i>Was your mother beautiful?</i>

10
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,772
<i>Did you love your mother?</i>

11
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,318
<i>Did you love your mother?</i>

12
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:14,805
<i>I've wanted to meet you and
ask you these questions for a long time.</i>

13
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:18,172
<i>Since I left Tokyo,
I've been repeating them out loud.</i>

14
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:21,905
<i>Weren't you jealous of Noe?</i>

15
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,137
<i>I mean, as a woman.</i>

16
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:32,343
<i>All of a sudden, that day when
your parents disappeared from you,</i>

17
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,783
<i>you became jealous, right?</i>

18
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,795
<i>Yes, jealous...</i>

19
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,303
<i>During the 28 years of her short life,
she was married three times.</i>

20
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,639
<i>She left her second husband,
the poet Jun Tsuji,</i>

21
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,445
<i>with whom she had two children,
in order to be with Sakae Ôsugi.</i>

22
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:27,669
<i>She was responsible when Ôsugi's lover
Itsuko Masaoka stabbed him out of jealousy.</i>

23
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:30,610
<i>The case of "Hikage no Chaya" in 1916.</i>

24
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,998
<i>She joined the "Seitô" movement,
led by Aichô Hiraga,</i>

25
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,616
<i>becoming the youngest member of the group.</i>

26
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,474
<i>As the last remaining member,
she ended the movement.</i>

27
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:46,000
<i>During the last ten years of her life,
she gave birth to seven children.</i>

28
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:52,246
<i>In a few years, she lived as much as
the entire lives of several ordinary women.</i>

29
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:54,206
<i>Noe Itô...</i>

30
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,251
<i>was your mother, wasn't she?</i>

31
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,789
Thank you. I have no more questions.

32
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,041
Tell me your name once more.

33
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:28,783
A-ko.

34
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:30,295
But I'm Eiko.

35
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,411
Eiko Sokutai, 20 year old student.

36
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,998
- Then, I'm B-ko.
- Good, B-ko.

37
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,928
A final word, please.

38
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,601
I have nothing to do with this.

39
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,761
You speak of my mother?

40
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,252
I have no mother.

41
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,486
You speak of my mother's mother?

42
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,614
My mother has no mother.

43
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,911
You speak of my mother's mother's mother?

44
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:06,956
Then...

45
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,337
It's you.

46
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,204

- Sakae Ôsugi

48
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,253
Drunk upon the happiness of decadence,
this film is a dialogue with you and I,

49
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:29,258
the ambiguous participants in the erotica
and revolutions of Sakae Ôsugi and Noe Itô,

50
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,814
whose lives were dedicated
to the beauty of chaos.

I'll never forget that moment.

74
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,150
- What moment?
- That moment.

75
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:16,878
That moment?

76
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,221
A spider descended
from the ceiling on a thread.

77
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,005
It swung in the air.

78
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,869
I burned it.

79
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:42,012
Then it said,
"I burst into flames and die!"

80
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,533
Who burst into flames?

81
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,068
Me...

82
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,197
You're crazy! Crazy!

83
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,087
The thief Kandata had saved the spider.

84
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:11,841
And I burned it.

85
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,271
Just to fill the emptiness of time.

86
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,629
No, that's an excuse!

87
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,893
Emptiness?

88
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:25,616
Well, look at the state of your love life!

89
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,367
His image is used
to hide your dry, empty heart.

90
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:34,585
Until recently, it was our slogan!

91
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:38,776
But now...

92
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,667
Now, these words
have been inscribed on my back:

93
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,598
"Oh Buddha, condemn me to Hell!"

94
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:52,324
"Kandata saved the spider, not me!"

95
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:58,001
Enough with the stupid stories.

96
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:01,364
My stories are stupid
because I don't say anything.

97
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:11,756
- What are you looking at?
- Your legs.

98
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:14,015
The hairs on your legs.

99
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:17,326
What about my hairs?

100
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,799
Will they keep growing after you're dead?

101
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:27,470
What are you gonna do next?

102
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:31,317
Go home and sleep.
I want to sleep soundly.

103
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:36,530
No, I mean...
What are you gonna do in the future?

104
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,648
What are your plans?

105
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,048
Marry a girl.

106
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,031
You got engaged?

107
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,447
A girl said "yes" to you?

108
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,042
I just decided...

109
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,347
You're a student, right?

110
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,264
When do you graduate?

111
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,407
What will you do afterwards?

112
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,575
A year and nine months maybe...

113
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,797
Really? The future should scare you.

114
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,532
I don't really get what you mean.

115
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:18,090
You should worry about your future!

116
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:21,231
Not really.
I'm not interested in anything.

117
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,309
We have come to
take the ashes of Sakae Ôsugi!

118
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,144
That anarchist was executed.

119
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,730
- He's forbidden to be buried!
- Don't let them!

120
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,024
Don't give them to the police!

121
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,131
He will have the funeral he deserves!

122
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:39,568
Band of thieves!

123
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,202
We must remove all that remains of Ôsugi!

124
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:21,190
"I have decided to die within 24 hours."

125
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,298
"Megumi"

126
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:36,603
Megumi... Blessing...

127
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,438
Bless... Blessed if you don't...

128
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,211
Bless... Bless...

129
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,588
Mercy... Grace...

130
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,832
For what?

131
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,332
Why didn't you respond?

132
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,197
I didn't write just out of curiosity.

133
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,233
Copper pollution in the Watase River

134
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:43,119
led to the nearby villages being abandoned.

135
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,682
That was 30 years ago,
before I was even born.

136
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:50,336
It's been over ten years since Shôzô Tanaka

137
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,610
made a fuss about it in Parliament.

138
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,356
I thought it had all been resolved.

139
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:00,613
Some villagers held on,
to stay in the desolate swamp.

140
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:04,293
But today the State forcibly
evicted them to build a dam.

141
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:09,118
It's like drowning illegitimate
children after the scandal.

142
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:13,302
It's exactly the same thing!
But nobody's doing anything...

143
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:16,003
Not a word in any newspapers!

144
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,924
When I heard about this,
it was like a slap in the face.

145
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:23,069
I was ashamed.

146
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,163
Ashamed of my ignorance
about what happens in the world.

147
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:29,016
That's why...

148
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,245
I want to ask what you would've done.

149
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:35,503
That's why I sent the letter.

150
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:43,552
The cherry trees are blooming.

151
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:47,042
Just like on that day.

152
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,673
To you,

153
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:54,658
a childish country girl
like me asking you for justice

154
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,154
must seem like nothing
but fleeting sentimentality.

155
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:00,466
That's what you told Tsuji?

156
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,358
He would have said,

157
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:09,452
"Instead of thinking about all this,
think about who you are."

158
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:16,044
"Because one of those bored, bourgeois,
'new women' from the 'Seitô' movement"

159
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,889
"happened to be moved by
the tragedy of Yanaka Village,"

160
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:23,994
"and talks nonsense like fever struck..."
Isn't that what you think?

161
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,441
"What can these 'new women' do?"

162
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:29,685
- But I...
- I can't do anything either.

163
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,569
Look behind you.

164
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,393
I'm being watched 24 hours a day,
thanks to your tax money.

165
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,955
An anarchist without arms to act

166
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,504
is like a duck with broken wings.

167
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:47,855
A duck?

168
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,413
All I can do is quack.

169
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:54,329
This way of talking...
It's not like the Ôsugi I know.

170
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:57,111
This is my true appearance.

171
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:58,931
A duck!

172
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,447
The duck wrote back to the duck,
but it wasn't sent.

173
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:12,201
Because it was so long,
it could've been taken for a love letter.

174
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,755
The cherry blossoms...

175
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,815
They dance before my eyes...

176
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,655
The cherry blossoms?

177
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,693
They're so beautiful!

178
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:35,846
Where I was born, in Imajuku,
they bloom a week earlier than in Tokyo.

179
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:46,482
"Spring, March, survivors of the massacre,
we dance among the flowers."

180
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,887
They were also in bloom that day.

181
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,166
When I got out of prison,

182
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,872
Shûsui and the others weren't there.

183
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:00,484
They had been killed.

184
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,761
We dance among the flowers...
The flowers...

185
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,660
There were cherry blossoms
at that time too.

186
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,104
My cherry blossoms...

187
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,561
Before he could get near me,
I had run away on my wedding night.

188
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:13,978
I couldn't bear to be trapped
in old traditions, or the role of a wife.

189
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,660
And Tsuji received a bird that
he treats like the woman he loves.

190
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:25,354
Now that she's exhausted her resources,
she wants to fly again.

191
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:28,159
Don't make fun. I'm not exaggerating.

192
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,758
I was being serious.

193
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:37,752
No...

194
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,454
I was supposed to escape
to a house free of old traditions,

195
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,011
but when I regained my senses,

196
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:48,721
I saw I was trapped in the same old house.

197
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,365
Tsuji's house...

198
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,866
Are you re-enacting the flight of "Nora,"
so popular at the Imperial Theatre lately?

199
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,229
I told you not to make fun of me.

200
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:06,228
Escaping isn't the issue.
It's knowing what to do afterwards.

201
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:09,811
Escaping is the only way of knowing.

202
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:13,889
How can you know beforehand?

203
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,586
- Noe...
- I'm serious!

204
00:24:22,922 --> 00:24:25,733
I've thought about it for over six months.

205
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,231
Do you know what you're saying?

206
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,274
Mr. Ôsugi,

207
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:37,312
where is your usual cockiness?

208
00:24:37,496 --> 00:24:39,162
You're being a coward.

209
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,162
I...

210
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:58,060
I'm pregnant!

211
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:02,582
Remember the first time I met you?

212
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,478
I've already given birth.

213
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:09,224
I named him Ryûji, Ryûji Tsuji.

214
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,444
A good name, right?

215
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,089
But I really am pregnant.

216
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,619
I don't know what it is yet.

217
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,155
It's so complex. And so new!

218
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:34,952
It's the one and only thing
that can be known only by a woman.

219
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,528
It's our one unique act!

220
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,564
I think I understand you.

221
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,747
But what will you do?

222
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,412
There's your wife, Yasuko Hori,

223
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,107
and also Itsuko Masaoka, your mistress...

224
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,002
And me as well...

225
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,762
- Why burn it?
- To relax.

226
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:30,774
Burn it!

227
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,106
It's burning.

228
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,377
No, I mean something else.

229
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,883
I read about it:

230
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:46,460
Barriers in your subconscious
that you aren't even aware of.

231
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,600
Childhood traumas, obsessions...

232
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:52,708
That explains why you play with fire.

233
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,482
You can't accept that you're an adult.

234
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,293
Psychoanalysis bores me.

235
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,002
You never know if the doctor is normal.

236
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:05,653
If the doctor is crazy, it's useless.

237
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:10,102
Hey, you think you could ignite me?

238
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:11,991
Set me ablaze!

239
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:45,166
Okay. Stand by.

240
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,790
- Rolling!
- Action!

241
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,701
- I gotta go.
- Where?

242
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:02,016
Megumi's apartment. She wants to die.

243
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:09,555
- Who?
- Megumi.

244
00:28:11,713 --> 00:28:13,599
Let her die if she wants.

245
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,270
I know.

246
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,631
But I can't do that.

247
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:20,496
Do what you want.

248
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,014
Later...

249
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,980
Cut! Once more!

250
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,726
Excuse me, are you Eiko Sokutai?

251
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:49,177
Yes. What do you want?

252
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:54,214
Eiko Sokutai, student, 20 years old,

253
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:56,518
Tokyo School of Design.

254
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,374
Specialty: aesthetics of information.

255
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:01,186
Residence: Gifu Prefecture.

256
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,549
- Current address...
- Hurry up!

257
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,568
On February 28 at 7 p.m.,
at the Fairmont Snack Bar,

258
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,785
you met a man, right?

259
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:21,255
Sure, I meet men every day.

260
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:24,274
There are 5,300,000 of them in Tokyo.

261
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,351
Let's go. Stand by!

262
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:32,281
Rolling!

263
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:34,936
Action!

264
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,241
Certainly.

265
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:39,612
Cut!

266
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:41,119
Once more.

267
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:47,875
Excluding children under 9,
there are 4,200,000.

268
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:51,425
They all suffer from sexual needs.

269
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:54,129
What do you want?

270
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:56,827
Are you a reporter?
Insurance inspector?

271
00:29:56,914 --> 00:30:00,622
Don't smile! You're models, not humans!

272
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,335
- Rolling!
- Action!

273
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,217
Police...

274
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,310
You're suspected of prostitution.

275
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,985
No expression! Be an actor!

276
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,193
You're still leaving?

277
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:13,562
It's the last day of "Seitô" magazine.

278
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,619
When I succeeded Aichô as editor,
nobody thought I would last two issues.

279
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,747
But this is already the fourth!

280
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:24,218
Four already?

281
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:29,041
You promised you would help,
but I'm still waiting.

282
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:32,218
It's your magazine. Do what you want.

283
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:35,042
But sometimes I wish I could rely on you.

284
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,392
I've already given you all that I can.

285
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,533
You talk as though you want to leave me.

286
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,342
Yes.

287
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:54,749
You eviscerate anything you
happen upon, then devour it.

288
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,428
I don't want that to happen to me.

289
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:03,872
You're the one who encouraged
me to study, to complete my training.

290
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:09,622
Yes, and you've made progress!

291
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:12,469
At 20 years old, editor of "Seito,"

292
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,584
militant activist for women's rights,

293
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:20,356
wife of the lazy man, Jun Tsuji,

294
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:23,330
and mother of Makoto and Ryûji.

295
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,164
What are you saying?

296
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:30,236
You always talk of "women's emancipation."

297
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:33,748
Surely, the plight of
women must be improved.

298
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,128
But, on my own,
I've been rethinking this recently...

299
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:43,423
All we've managed to
accomplish at this point are just words.

300
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:45,967
"Women's emancipation."

301
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:47,578
"Modernization."

302
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:48,886
"Ego."

303
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,913
What's the point?

304
00:32:52,473 --> 00:32:56,057
You speak of women's liberation,
but you can't take care of Makoto,

305
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,136
and you don't do housework.

306
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:01,394
Sorry, I'm not being ironic...

307
00:33:02,258 --> 00:33:04,930
I have lots of respect for your activism.

308
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:07,630
It's your best merit.

309
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:11,234
The Meiji Restoration, modernization...

310
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:15,190
We have the train,
and a skyscraper in Asakusa...

311
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,876
We have a Parliament.

312
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,835
These days, I play the shakuhachi,

313
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,929
but it doesn't console me.

314
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,259
"Do not seek for freedom, in self-denial,"

315
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,863
"but seek for yourself,
and become an Almighty Ego."

316
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:36,122
It's you who taught me
the words of Max Stirner.

317
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,911
That's why I stopped working.

318
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,447
Reading, sleeping...

319
00:33:43,817 --> 00:33:47,111
I do what I want,
and concentrate on myself.

320
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:52,571
This way, I can look much farther.

321
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:56,671
You always look too far!

322
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,630
Why don't you look around you?

323
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:04,333
The peasants of Yanaka
could die in cold water tomorrow,

324
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,446
but you can't even see that!

325
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,840
I know!

326
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:13,279
Looking so far ahead
can be painful sometimes.

327
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:17,819
"Women's emancipation."

328
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:19,563
"Modernization."

329
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,240
When will it happen?

330
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,555
In 50 or 70 years? I don't know.

331
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,783
It's now 1916.

332
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,371
Trains go as far as Kyûshû.

333
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:34,033
And yet...

334
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:38,391
Where does this intense light come from,

335
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:42,106
to gradually change the ego from within?

336
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:47,488
This void in me grows day by day.

337
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:54,153
Like it's anticipating the day when
emancipation is finally achieved.

338
00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:56,800
That's how I feel.

339
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:00,643
I...

340
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,889
I still love you.

341
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,320
Very much.

342
00:35:08,364 --> 00:35:11,195
But you don't need me anymore.

343
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:16,033
No. I need you.

344
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,308
People are born free.

345
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:21,673
But despite this,

346
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:26,017
or perhaps because of this,
people fear freedom,

347
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:28,448
and desire to be chained.

348
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:31,058
Thus they destroy themselves.

349
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:34,677
Love...

350
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:40,422
Even our love... Has killed our freedom.

351
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:43,590
You know this very well.

352
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:48,691
You're like a bird who has
stopped flapping her wings.

353
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:52,504
I would ask you to stay in this house,

354
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,606
but you wouldn't be able to.

355
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,179
I'm not the type to go against the wind.

356
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:05,119
But you go against the wind,

357
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,483
whichever way it blows.

358
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:17,826
I'll return.

359
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,898
When I told you to forget about
the peasants of Yanaka, you were furious.

360
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:38,405
Abandoned for 30 years,

361
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,856
left on a frigid, dammed lake.

362
00:36:42,328 --> 00:36:45,435
Those peasants
stubbornly cling to their land.

363
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:48,462
I thought that something in their hearts,

364
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:53,431
the source of their determination,
might be stronger than my own emptiness.

365
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:57,093
That's why I said what I said.

366
00:36:57,303 --> 00:36:58,884
I don't understand.

367
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:00,429
You don't understand.

368
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:02,969
I don't understand either.

369
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:06,539
That's why I keep looking further.

370
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:10,828
Makoto is crying.

371
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,615
Please take care of him.

372
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:22,016
<i>You go up the stairs.</i>

373
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:25,976
<i>From the first floor to the second,
from the second to the third,</i>

374
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:28,623
<i>from the third to the fourth.</i>

375
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,264
<i>I go from the third floor to the fourth!</i>

376
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,901
<i>You enter a room away from the others.</i>

377
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,959
<i>Yes, a secret room.</i>

378
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:57,459
<i>You take off your clothes.</i>

379
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:00,538
<i>I take off my clothes!</i>

380
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:04,242
<i>- What for?
- The customer likes it.</i>

381
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,283
<i>If you don't please him,
you don't get paid.</i>

382
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,162
<i>You are naked now.</i>

383
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:20,596
<i>I'm naked now!</i>

384
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:27,092
<i>- Then you say...
- Then I say...</i>

385
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,822
<i>- Say it.
- Say what?</i>

386
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:33,354
<i>How should I know? You said it.</i>

387
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:34,775
<i>Hurry up.</i>

388
00:38:37,578 --> 00:38:40,343
<i>- What did you say?
- I don't know.</i>

389
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:42,455
<i>But it's you who said it.</i>

390
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,524
<i>"Hello," a hello to 1970.</i>

391
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,318
<i>That's not it...</i>

392
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:51,360
<i>"Hello, man. Hello, lover."</i>

393
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:52,838
<i>"Hello, customer."</i>

394
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:55,384
<i>That's better.</i>

395
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:57,260
<i>Then what?</i>

396
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,239
<i>You show him your goods...</i>

397
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:02,967
<i>I show him...</i>

398
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,366
<i>This is the case of February 28,</i>

399
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:09,526
<i>at 7:20 p.m.</i>

400
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:13,092
<i>This is the case of 20... 20...</i>

401
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:15,564
<i>- 28.
- ...at night.</i>

402
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,506
<i>Hey, why do you need the date?</i>

403
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:21,565
<i>Get straight to the crime.</i>

404
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:24,422
<i>- Was the guy killed?
- Don't say that.</i>

405
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,123
<i>The tape is running.</i>

406
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,416
<i>This could serve as evidence.</i>

407
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:30,690
<i>You made love.</i>

408
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,824
<i>I made love with that guy.</i>

409
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:35,301
<i>With my lover!</i>

410
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,193
<i>Before leaving the hotel,
you took his money.</i>

411
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:40,975
<i>How much?</i>

412
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:43,898
<i>This game is boring!</i>

413
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,702
<i>Should I just pretend that I killed him?</i>

414
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:50,106
<i>Broke a vase over his head!</i>

415
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:55,386
<i>The amount, please.
We still have plenty of tape.</i>

416
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,737
<i>I cut his artery with scissors!</i>

417
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:02,293
<i>How much?</i>

418
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,530
<i>- 300 Yen.
- Be serious.</i>

419
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,162
<i>I was going to ask for 5,000,</i>

420
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:10,890
<i>but I started to stutter,
and I couldn't pronounce the "go."</i>

421
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,008
<i>Ga...</i>

422
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,058
<i>Gi...</i>

423
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:15,063
<i>Gu...</i>

424
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:16,253
<i>Ge...</i>

425
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:17,440
<i>Go...</i>

426
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:21,441
<i>So I said "three" instead. That okay?</i>

427
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,123
<i>3,000 yen? Too cheap...</i>

428
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:26,961
<i>- So was he killed?
- He's alive.</i>

429
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:29,126
<i>He won't be arrested.</i>

430
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:33,283
<i>Under the laws of this country,
the one who pays isn't a criminal.</i>

431
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:36,194
<i>The law could surely seem unjust,</i>

432
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:39,097
<i>but we must denounce the crime,</i>

433
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:41,892
<i>the cause, and the system it's a part of,</i>

434
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:44,062
<i>if we are to eliminate evil.</i>

435
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,338
<i>Thanks for your cooperation.</i>

436
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:48,247
<i>Say your name again.</i>

437
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:50,988
<i>Eiko Sokutai.</i>

438
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:54,436
<i>"A" like "ABC" in English,</i>

439
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:57,259
<i>"A" like "Always," "Ageless"...</i>

440
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,101
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

441
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:03,644
<i>It's not important to me
if I'm the right woman or if I'm not.</i>

442
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,559
<i>It doesn't matter,
because to me, "I" don't exist.</i>

443
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:09,155
<i>Get it?</i>

444
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:29,823
If this woman isn't me,

445
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:33,715
then she must be someone else,
but to me, "I" don't exist.

446
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,942
That is, my "ego" doesn't exist.

447
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:42,902
By definition, the ego doesn't exist.

448
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:45,957
If my ego doesn't exist,
then others don't exist.

449
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,843
Others exist as soon as I myself exist.

450
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:55,197
If there's no difference
between me and others,

451
00:41:55,198 --> 00:41:59,780
Nobody can know if this
woman is me or someone else.

452
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,840
The search is futile.

453
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:07,841
From the start, this woman is nowhere!

454
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:11,649
Very well.

455
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:15,558
If, on the other side of that hotel door,

456
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:18,979
someone has taken your place,

457
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:21,927
I'd like if you could tell me her name.

458
00:42:23,169 --> 00:42:25,708
Sure, we may have exchanged places,

459
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,393
even if we're both the same "I."

460
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,886
That's common in the world of prostitution.

461
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:35,328
Show a real pearl, but sell a fake.

462
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:41,044
You can go.

463
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:08,421
This is the time to wait. Yes.

464
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:11,578
Sometimes you must hide like a cat.

465
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,591
Any movement today is sure to fail.

466
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,859
The walls around us are too thick.

467
00:43:17,056 --> 00:43:20,005
Face it, we would have to retreat.

468
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:23,689
We can't have that,

469
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:25,955
so we must wait.

470
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:31,040
You always say to attack immediately.

471
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:34,643
But waiting for the
right moment like a cat requires

472
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:36,695
determination and courage as well.

473
00:43:36,696 --> 00:43:39,831
You waste time doing nothing
because you're afraid!

474
00:43:39,832 --> 00:43:42,601
You're talking like a lazy coward!

475
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:45,346
Don't wait for an opportunity, create one!

476
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:53,802
What will you find outside?

477
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,248
Only a desert full of stones, and a prison.

478
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:02,276
At the end, there's a gallows!

479
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:05,312
They'll kill you like a dog!

480
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:07,197
I've waited for two years!

481
00:44:07,198 --> 00:44:09,754
Nothing's happened! Nothing's changed!

482
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:12,033
Will you wait until you die like a dog?

483
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:13,436
Not me!

484
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:23,062
I don't want to die like a dog,
or die foolishly.

485
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:26,045
You said the same thing two years ago.

486
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:30,576
And I said that the
appropriate action was to

487
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:34,958
focus on the neutral zone of literature,
and publish "Modern Thought."

488
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,145
That's just intellectual masturbation!
It accomplishes nothing!

489
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:41,076
I'm sick of it!

490
00:44:43,474 --> 00:44:46,098
Of intellectual masturbation?

491
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:49,416
Well said!

492
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,144
Affirming the ego,
developing the individual...

493
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:53,819
I'm in favour of it.

494
00:44:54,814 --> 00:44:59,362
But it's only in dreams where one can
rule the world and satisfy the ego.

495
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,886
In reality, we're oppressed by thick walls.

496
00:45:03,545 --> 00:45:06,191
Stop resisting, despite your resentment,

497
00:45:06,332 --> 00:45:08,645
and retreat into your snail shell.

498
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:12,259
Eternal disobedience is eternal defeat...

499
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:14,272
Run away from society...

500
00:45:14,362 --> 00:45:16,443
This is the prisoner's philosophy.

501
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,767
That's true.

502
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:23,134
We prisoners of thought had enough,
and shut down "Modern Thought."

503
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:28,737
We would rather resurrect the
"Common People's Newspaper,"

504
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:34,725
but we're bound by censorship
and prohibitions one after another.

505
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:45,032
It's almost March! Springtime!

506
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,836
What do we do now?

507
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:49,417
That!

508
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:52,169
Clubs or explosives?

509
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:57,606
Take that path to die like a dog.

510
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:01,143
You're eager to reach the summit.

511
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:04,774
Sure, men can get to
the top of the mountain,

512
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,597
but they can't live there for long.

513
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:11,838
Sakai! You've spoken of
hiding like cats and dying like dogs.

514
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:15,776
Are we monkeys now, climbing a mountain?

515
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,653
Monkeys who keep slipping and falling.

516
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:22,219
Seems like it.

517
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:25,269
Monkeys who can't live at the summit.

518
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,330
Reaching the summit is enough.

519
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:35,732
What do you mean?

520
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:42,195
What I want is
the freedom to reach the summit.

521
00:46:42,877 --> 00:46:45,481
To climb the highest peaks of life.

522
00:46:46,182 --> 00:46:47,800
When we can do that,

523
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:50,507
we'll know the ecstasy of freedom.

524
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:53,562
When the strike happens,

525
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:57,909
not an economic strike, but a general one,

526
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:03,575
propelled by the courage of the individual,
eager to know this ecstasy,

527
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:07,471
workers will be freed
from their enslavement,

528
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,587
to write their own history and values.

529
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:15,926
Ôsugi, your theories are too
personal and literary to follow.

530
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,327
They're like a philosophy of life, but...

531
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:24,501
Who ever said you talk about
your sex life, instead of universal life?

532
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:26,571
Not me!

533
00:47:28,693 --> 00:47:29,938
Whatever...

534
00:47:30,393 --> 00:47:33,209
But this "strike for life" is impossible.

535
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:36,076
In reality,
you can't even publish a journal.

536
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:39,793
It's hard to deal with reality.

537
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:43,699
Waiting, with arms crossed,
is a foolish death.

538
00:47:47,785 --> 00:47:51,205
Tomorrow is the beginning of March.

539
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:53,284
What will we do?

540
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:58,549
Love? Revolution?

541
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:02,331
Both! If the "Common People's Newspaper"
doesn't work out,

542
00:48:02,332 --> 00:48:04,561
we'll rebuild "Modern Thought."

543
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:06,936
We'll also focus on the workers,

544
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:09,400
and start research into unions.

545
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,422
I see...

546
00:48:12,988 --> 00:48:14,967
Repeat the same mistakes!

547
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:18,532
It's better than sitting here, yawning!

548
00:48:18,892 --> 00:48:21,105
Failure is better than inaction!

549
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:27,605
Speaking of love, Ôsugi, your wife...

550
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:31,446
No... Your eight-year partner in
misfortune has brought a package.

551
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:16,484
It's already spring.

552
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:19,282
I brought you some lighter clothes.

553
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:21,837
Oh. Thank you.

554
00:49:27,082 --> 00:49:30,306
I can see you two make a perfect couple.

555
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:35,160
They say you're also crazy about
the brilliant English-language journalist

556
00:49:35,257 --> 00:49:39,216
Itsuko Masaoka,
from the newspaper "Tônichi"!

557
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:42,501
Is that true?

558
00:49:43,015 --> 00:49:44,358
Yes, it's true.

559
00:49:44,843 --> 00:49:47,922
While we're at it, I also love Noe Itô.

560
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:56,732
Is that where we stand?

561
00:49:57,023 --> 00:49:59,628
Our movement is at a standstill,

562
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,435
a complete failure,

563
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:04,436
and you're preoccupied with women!

564
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:07,753
The movement and love
are the same thing to me!

565
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,430
There's no difference.

566
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,817
Even today,

567
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:14,336
I love Yasuko with all my heart.

568
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:21,234
But I can't devote my soul only to Yasuko.

569
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:24,900
Love dies if it's not free.

570
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,987
Yasuko already knows about it.

571
00:50:33,326 --> 00:50:35,357
I hadn't heard about it.

572
00:50:37,192 --> 00:50:39,571
I'm Ôsugi's wife.

573
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:42,519
His only woman.

574
00:50:43,427 --> 00:50:44,867
Certainly.

575
00:50:45,046 --> 00:50:48,245
He's only espousing
his theories about free love.

576
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:53,308
I heard that he courted Yasuko
by setting his kimono on fire.

577
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,661
Going so far to prove your love...

578
00:51:00,763 --> 00:51:02,590
Now that's something!

579
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:05,214
It's true.

580
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:08,986
I was being serious.

581
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,379
I'm searching for free love.

582
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,503
She's still out?

583
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:10,031
She'll be back soon.

584
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:23,496
I have no idea what Noe
has been doing these days.

585
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,248
You think she's changed?

586
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:30,411
We grew up together since the age of seven,

587
00:52:30,516 --> 00:52:32,937
when her family fell into ruin.

588
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:36,419
We wore the same clothes,
ate the same food...

589
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,746
Just like twin sisters!

590
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:48,136
I used to know what she
was thinking at any time.

591
00:52:48,794 --> 00:52:51,090
But now we're completely different!

592
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,975
At age 18,
she was in a hurry to marry you.

593
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:59,665
But I'm over 20 and I
don't know who I'll marry.

594
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:16,977
What is it?

595
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:26,207
Noe...

596
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:28,782
You left me...

597
00:53:31,087 --> 00:53:34,370
From the beginning,
I expected this day would come.

598
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,442
But now...

599
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:40,003
Jun!

600
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:45,857
Looks like the wind picked up.

601
00:53:56,511 --> 00:53:59,761
Noe said the cherry trees
were blooming that day.

602
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:03,828
But I don't remember
if the wind was blowing.

603
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:19,549
I am Haruko Hiraga.

604
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:22,278
...known as Aichô.

605
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,396
Of course!

606
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:30,419
I was trying to see if you were
different from how I imagined you.

607
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,576
So am I different?

608
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,312
Not at all.

609
00:54:41,964 --> 00:54:43,887
I guess that's a lie...

610
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,525
But you wrote,

611
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,935
"In the beginning, woman was the sun."

612
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:52,819
"Now she is the moon,
dependent on another's brilliance.

613
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,332
"But now we must recover our hidden sun."

614
00:54:56,538 --> 00:55:00,058
Your article in "Seitô" really shocked me!

615
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:05,660
So, how did you first picture me?

616
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,330
I can't tell you.

617
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:13,877
Maybe you imagined a much older woman.

618
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:18,092
Did you receive the money?

619
00:55:18,093 --> 00:55:21,738
Yes, I used it to run away
from home and come see you.

620
00:55:22,346 --> 00:55:25,654
Oh, I forgot to thank you for that.

621
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:27,861
I'll repay you when I find work.

622
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:32,154
Nonsense! It's nothing!
No need to repay it.

623
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:33,980
Yes, thank you!

624
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:51,582
This is Itsuko Masaoka.

625
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:53,693
I'm Noe. It's a pleasure!

626
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:56,784
I've heard of you.

627
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,080
The most brilliant
English student at University.

628
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:02,880
I'm resigning from "Seitô" today.

629
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,759
What a pity!

630
00:56:06,173 --> 00:56:09,313
There's a limit to what
a group of women can do.

631
00:56:09,314 --> 00:56:11,751
We must dive into male society.

632
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:14,107
A group of women is safe.

633
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:17,040
Among men, you won't end discrimination.

634
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,212
Equality must be fought for.

635
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:22,449
I'm going to write
for the "Tokyo Nichinichi."

636
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:27,056
Well, good luck...

637
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:29,644
Take care, "Aichô"...

638
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:40,276
Reading your letter has
generated a lot of discussion among us.

639
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:43,928
"She writes with the
determination of a man."

640
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:49,457
"Here's a woman, only 18 years old,
from a region afflicted with poverty,"

641
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,997
"but she writes with
such reason and clarity!"

642
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,932
"This proves that our movement
has finally become authentic."

643
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:04,422
Authentic? But...

644
00:57:05,343 --> 00:57:09,862
You must know that people
think of "Seitô" as merely a distraction

645
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:12,103
for bourgeois young women.

646
00:57:13,435 --> 00:57:16,350
But in reality, there are women like you

647
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:20,578
who are slaves to the family system,
ancient traditions, and poverty,

648
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,384
all over Japan.

649
00:57:24,037 --> 00:57:28,959
Freeing these women
from their bondage is our goal.

650
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,546
This fight is your fight,

651
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,208
but it is not your fight alone.

652
00:57:38,157 --> 00:57:41,295
We must join forces, and do all we can.

653
00:57:42,046 --> 00:57:44,527
But I have no other choice.

654
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:48,389
I was raised by poor peasants in Kyûshû...

655
00:57:57,883 --> 00:57:59,770
What will you do now?

656
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,304
I thought I'd go live with
my former teacher, Jun Tsuji.

657
00:58:04,406 --> 00:58:07,674
You must also think
about how to make a living.

658
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:08,823
I know.

659
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:14,400
I have a job for you.

660
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:16,721
As a writer for "Seitô."

661
00:58:20,216 --> 00:58:23,166
I've been looking for someone like you.

662
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:25,754
It was my goal from the start.

663
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:28,592
I gladly accept! I'll start tomorrow!

664
00:58:37,632 --> 00:58:41,258
Isn't this the window
you wrote about in the magazine?

665
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:43,018
Can I open it?

666
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:45,285
The wind is cold.

667
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:48,432
I just wanted to look outside,

668
00:58:48,522 --> 00:58:50,117
to see what's there.

669
00:58:51,885 --> 00:58:54,085
Just a boring landscape.

670
00:58:54,484 --> 00:58:57,490
Plums, bamboo, peonies in spring...

671
00:58:58,027 --> 00:59:00,172
The moon in autumn...

672
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:02,109
Snow in winter...

673
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:03,294
So on...

674
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:26,191
One of these days...

675
00:59:29,604 --> 00:59:32,590
You'll be the one who picks the fruit

676
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:35,313
that we have grown so carefully.

677
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:50,458
It's getting cold. How strange.

678
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:56,405
I was just wondering...
Where are we going?

679
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:58,249
And why did I come?

680
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,428
It's been two hours. How much longer?

681
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:03,459
It's like the North Pole in here!

682
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,594
The heater's broken.

683
01:00:06,357 --> 01:00:09,259
Thank civilization for giving us the cold.

684
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:14,030
I know! I'm escorting a prostitute!

685
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:15,281
We're running away!

686
01:00:15,283 --> 01:00:18,355
If only. We're going to save someone.

687
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:21,350
- I wonder if she's dead...
- I bet she is.

688
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:25,001
- Me too. But why bet?
- Not a bet like that.

689
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,795
There's no point rushing to a funeral.

690
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:34,067
That's enough. Stop!

691
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:48,515
Where's a hospital?
My wife swallowed pills!

692
01:00:48,516 --> 01:00:51,712
Leave her alone.
She'll just do it again.

693
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:52,716
The hospital!

694
01:00:52,717 --> 01:00:55,400
I don't know where I am,
and it's too cold.

695
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,619
All those who take this path

696
01:01:01,621 --> 01:01:03,669
leave their hopes behind.

697
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:12,851
Perfect for death by jumping...

698
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:25,303
I kissed Noe.

699
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,459
I kissed Noe.

700
01:02:30,835 --> 01:02:32,957
She's in love with me.

701
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,822
That's what you came to say?

702
01:02:39,321 --> 01:02:42,147
You are a cultured and intelligent woman.

703
01:02:44,095 --> 01:02:46,553
You understand my way of thinking.

704
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,979
Yes... I know.

705
01:02:52,255 --> 01:02:54,849
I told you from the beginning.

706
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:59,019
I'm married to Yasuko,
a simple, uneducated woman.

707
01:02:59,405 --> 01:03:03,269
But her character is suited to
the wife of a revolutionary.

708
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:06,379
I cause her much grief, but I love her.

709
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:08,783
I love you too.

710
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,785
And you love Noe too?

711
01:03:13,154 --> 01:03:14,669
That's good.

712
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:19,675
I'm happy for you,
from the bottom of my heart.

713
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:25,033
Yes. The three bonds will hold,

714
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:27,676
if we respect three conditions.

715
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:29,358
What conditions?

716
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:30,506
First:

717
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,246
Each of us is financially independent.

718
01:03:33,386 --> 01:03:34,709
Second:

719
01:03:35,185 --> 01:03:39,696
I won't live with any one of you,
but separately with each.

720
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:41,499
Third:

721
01:03:41,686 --> 01:03:44,165
We must respect each other's freedom.

722
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:47,959
That includes freedom in sexual matters.

723
01:03:52,485 --> 01:03:54,424
I have many friends,

724
01:03:54,573 --> 01:03:59,001
but none of them complain
about insufficient friendship.

725
01:03:59,423 --> 01:04:02,481
We are friends on fair and equal terms.

726
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,912
Our love...

727
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:08,506
is also based on equality,
and winning freedom.

728
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:12,081
In that case,

729
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:14,982
I must ask you to keep your promise.

730
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,601
Promise? What promise?

731
01:04:20,236 --> 01:04:23,098
The first night we spent together...

732
01:04:24,283 --> 01:04:26,098
Have you forgotten it?

733
01:04:26,952 --> 01:04:28,756
I told you back then.

734
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:37,632
Marriage has no value to me.

735
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:41,760
I became convinced of this...

736
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:45,623
after observing
my sisters and their husbands.

737
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:51,367
These days, marriage can't
ensure the happiness of women.

738
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:54,626
That's why I don't want to marry.

739
01:04:57,732 --> 01:05:01,316
Since I don't believe in marriage,
I was able to love you

740
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,437
without feeling guilty towards Yasuko,
or even feeling her presence.

741
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:11,299
But in return, I resolved to
make all my own decisions in life,

742
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:14,343
no matter what difficulties I encounter.

743
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:18,376
I'm listening. What was the promise?

744
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:21,861
Are you saying Noe is
different from Yasuko?

745
01:05:21,956 --> 01:05:25,796
No! I told you the same thing
when there was just Yasuko.

746
01:05:27,363 --> 01:05:30,728
I wanted you to
keep our relationship secret.

747
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:34,620
But you've told Yasuko everything.

748
01:05:36,048 --> 01:05:39,107
Not just Yasuko but your friends too. Why?

749
01:05:39,108 --> 01:05:42,174
I saw no reason to hide it from them.

750
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:50,014
So nobody would disturb us.

751
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,818
We could see each other freely.

752
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:57,040
Freely...

753
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:00,611
You mean so we could escape the rumours.

754
01:06:00,828 --> 01:06:02,558
I don't care about rumours,

755
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,962
or what your friends who are
committed to monogamy think.

756
01:06:06,327 --> 01:06:09,952
But we can't completely
change their way of thinking.

757
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,060
That's why, to preserve our love...

758
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:15,828
Don't worry about them. Ignore them.

759
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,963
Someday, the world will follow.

760
01:06:17,964 --> 01:06:21,347
But we'll be attacked,
and we'll defend ourselves.

761
01:06:22,168 --> 01:06:24,544
You say that because you're a man.

762
01:06:25,488 --> 01:06:28,933
When I was 18,
I was in love with a married man.

763
01:06:29,187 --> 01:06:32,312
I tried to pursue this love,
but it was impossible.

764
01:06:33,396 --> 01:06:38,141
Not just my family,
but the whole world forced us to separate.

765
01:06:38,258 --> 01:06:41,752
So follow society's morals?
Hide in the shadows?

766
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:44,544
You think there's freedom in the shadows?

767
01:06:46,326 --> 01:06:49,099
Let's respect your three conditions.

768
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,501
For liberty and truth.

769
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:54,549
But I am a woman.

770
01:06:55,490 --> 01:07:00,202
I said I wanted to escape from
trouble and responsibility last time.

771
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:05,199
You said you don't want children, right?

772
01:07:05,959 --> 01:07:08,621
That's fine, if you want.

773
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:12,040
I guess that's the second condition.

774
01:07:12,845 --> 01:07:14,292
And the third?

775
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:33,179
Hey...

776
01:07:33,873 --> 01:07:35,805
You don't have to go now...

777
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:43,648
Noe was out of breath when I kissed her.

778
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,734
I could feel her trembling through me.

779
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:50,765
It was surprising.

780
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:03,020
You're doing this on purpose
to make the situation harder.

781
01:08:03,106 --> 01:08:04,843
Seems like fun to you.

782
01:08:10,043 --> 01:08:12,638
Are you going back to Yasuko's?

783
01:08:15,144 --> 01:08:16,222
Wait!

784
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:24,535
You surely need money...

785
01:09:17,637 --> 01:09:19,829
I don't know anything about you.

786
01:09:20,075 --> 01:09:22,154
- You a student?
- I don't know.

787
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:23,459
Yakuza?

788
01:09:25,467 --> 01:09:28,956
I've seen you sleep with a man,
but I haven't slept with you.

789
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:31,237
That's "psychological impotence."

790
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:40,056
Wrong!

791
01:09:40,947 --> 01:09:43,162
That's why I want to sleep with you!

792
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:45,115
You accept!

793
01:09:45,511 --> 01:09:47,134
We go to a hotel!

794
01:09:47,467 --> 01:09:49,071
But I want more!

795
01:09:49,869 --> 01:09:51,406
You refuse!

796
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,292
Say it!

797
01:09:54,943 --> 01:09:56,418
It's my turn now?

798
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:02,487
No! I refuse!

799
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:04,218
Then, suddenly,

800
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:07,643
I punch you right in the stomach!

801
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:10,047
You groan and fall over.

802
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,292
I fall over.

803
01:10:22,983 --> 01:10:26,509
I hold your arms behind your back,
and push you down.

804
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:29,381
You fight back!

805
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:36,458
Keep going, this is good!

806
01:10:37,052 --> 01:10:39,095
I start strangling you...

807
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:42,178
You strangle me...

808
01:10:42,285 --> 01:10:45,178
But you resist with all your might!

809
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:51,374
I resist!

810
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,587
Your skirt is up
and your underwear is torn!

811
01:11:26,695 --> 01:11:28,174
I'm inside you!

812
01:11:32,482 --> 01:11:34,266
You're inside me!

813
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:42,370
Wait! See that?

814
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:54,390
Everyone's running!

815
01:11:54,502 --> 01:11:56,284
There's been an accident!

816
01:11:57,026 --> 01:11:58,987
What happened? Tell me!

817
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:02,033
Murder? Revolution? Traffic accident?

818
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,765
Can't see. Too many people.

819
01:12:06,507 --> 01:12:08,063
Someone's coming!

820
01:12:24,163 --> 01:12:25,871
You saw the accident?

821
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:27,648
Yes! It was scary!

822
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:29,349
Tell us what happened.

823
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:31,747
A giant crane suddenly fell!

824
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:34,656
The cables loosened, one after another.

825
01:12:34,657 --> 01:12:36,051
Why did they loosen?

826
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,516
- A support cable broke!
- And then?

827
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:42,939
The crane was carrying a gondola.

828
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,018
What was in the gondola?

829
01:12:45,185 --> 01:12:46,694
I don't know...

830
01:12:46,831 --> 01:12:48,949
Let's switch places.

831
01:12:54,562 --> 01:12:56,709
It wasn't a gondola.

832
01:12:56,836 --> 01:12:58,849
It was an iron arch!

833
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:00,320
What for?

834
01:13:00,589 --> 01:13:04,577
It should allow us to survive the disaster.

835
01:13:04,957 --> 01:13:06,548
But it fell!

836
01:13:06,645 --> 01:13:10,656
It weighed 16 tons
and fell at a speed of 82 km/s.

837
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:12,158
And then?

838
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:15,731
It fell on a bus
that was passing underneath.

839
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:18,673
A bus...

840
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:21,345
A bus...

841
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:25,429
full of old people from a retirement home!

842
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:33,740
It's a scene straight from Hell!

843
01:13:33,741 --> 01:13:35,635
A sea of blood and flesh!

844
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:39,368
A small handbag rolls into the gutter.

845
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:43,351
Look here! There's a little doll inside!

846
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:45,610
Probably a gift for a granddaughter.

847
01:13:45,611 --> 01:13:48,680
That poor old lady... had a granddaughter?

848
01:13:48,681 --> 01:13:49,888
Old man!

849
01:13:49,889 --> 01:13:51,676
Who said "old lady"?

850
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:54,389
Make way! We must help the wounded!

851
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,337
Make way! More!

852
01:13:57,156 --> 01:13:58,342
More!

853
01:13:58,938 --> 01:14:00,177
More!

854
01:14:12,295 --> 01:14:14,748
This world is no place for you!

855
01:15:03,334 --> 01:15:06,474
You're right. I brought him to the room.

856
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:09,628
But there was another girl waiting inside.

857
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:12,590
You brought me here just to say that?

858
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:16,005
Yes. What else would I say?

859
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:21,909
You expect me to believe that?

860
01:15:23,042 --> 01:15:26,204
But I was just an accomplice. It's true!

861
01:15:30,475 --> 01:15:32,048
Here's my share.

862
01:15:32,652 --> 01:15:34,173
I just got it.

863
01:15:36,082 --> 01:15:37,663
Cut the crap.

864
01:15:43,318 --> 01:15:45,160
You don't believe me...

865
01:15:45,891 --> 01:15:48,173
Who put you up to it?

866
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:50,973
This isn't hard to understand.

867
01:15:51,075 --> 01:15:54,650
You've already decided that I'm a criminal.

868
01:15:54,829 --> 01:15:56,962
You gave me a motive.

869
01:15:58,768 --> 01:16:02,134
The location is... No, find it yourself.

870
01:16:02,498 --> 01:16:06,011
You can find anything,
even imaginary crimes.

871
01:16:06,726 --> 01:16:09,497
I already gave you a motive for free.

872
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:10,706
Now go!

873
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:14,840
You're satisfied with a miserable life.

874
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,240
You think life without purpose isn't life.

875
01:16:18,945 --> 01:16:21,016
But life has no purpose.

876
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:24,206
Life is miserable.

877
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:27,718
The only certain thing is that we all die.

878
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:31,510
Other than that,
no one can know the future.

879
01:16:31,968 --> 01:16:34,887
That's why we live in our imagination.

880
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:38,891
We live... But life is suffering.

881
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:42,797
My murdered mother
taught me that life is a battle.

882
01:16:43,126 --> 01:16:46,361
A battle! Is that what life is about?

883
01:16:47,223 --> 01:16:48,767
Murdered?

884
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:50,580
By who?

885
01:16:51,349 --> 01:16:53,454
By all our fathers!

886
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:56,539
Your imagination is often annoying.

887
01:16:57,009 --> 01:16:58,614
What is imagination?

888
01:16:58,995 --> 01:17:01,179
It's the illusion of the poor.

889
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:04,430
They don't become rich,
but imagine they are.

890
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,584
They dream of revolution.

891
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,588
The man on the phone in front of me...

892
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:14,668
What did he do with his left hand?

893
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:16,808
He started to imagine,

894
01:17:17,263 --> 01:17:20,187
then he confused imagination with reality.

895
01:17:20,975 --> 01:17:22,951
At that precise moment,

896
01:17:23,746 --> 01:17:26,926
his actions became apparent to me.

897
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:33,215
It looked exactly like a crime.

898
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:35,617
And then I...

899
01:17:37,863 --> 01:17:40,533
I sniffed him out, like a dog.

900
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:42,493
And arrested him.

901
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:45,792
How am I able to do this?

902
01:17:46,464 --> 01:17:49,022
Because I don't live in my imagination.

903
01:17:49,744 --> 01:17:51,235
I don't suffer.

904
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,531
I don't believe in the impotence of men.

905
01:17:56,089 --> 01:17:59,832
You know, at this moment,
another me is a prostitute.

906
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:03,512
Those who suffer...

907
01:18:03,643 --> 01:18:06,763
are already in prison, or an asylum.

908
01:18:07,456 --> 01:18:10,012
There's no need to arrest them again.

909
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:15,717
You just had a
bad dream this morning, that's all.

910
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:20,254
I've already found the
prostitution network I was looking for.

911
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:21,835
Yesterday.

912
01:19:03,663 --> 01:19:05,743
I'll show you something good...

913
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,841
I've decided to kill you.

914
01:19:42,109 --> 01:19:44,576
I bought it yesterday in Nihonbashi.

915
01:19:44,672 --> 01:19:48,066
The blade is 16.5 cm. It cost me 50 sen.

916
01:20:00,006 --> 01:20:02,409
I decided not to leave you.

917
01:20:11,518 --> 01:20:14,583
If I left you, I couldn't kill you.

918
01:21:22,614 --> 01:21:25,563
I made the decision to kill you.

919
01:21:33,441 --> 01:21:36,214
This freedom is the foundation of life...

920
01:21:36,364 --> 01:21:38,399
We must give life to it...

921
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,174
Women's liberation...

922
01:21:42,012 --> 01:21:43,570
is for men to...

923
01:21:44,113 --> 01:21:47,835
No, the happiness of
all humanity resides in freedom.

924
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:54,213
If I recognize your freedom and your ego,

925
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,360
I'll write it down in a contract...

926
01:21:58,879 --> 01:22:01,332
Based on the three conditions...

927
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:15,199
It was all a stunt to make fun of me.

928
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:16,758
Why?

929
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,368
Why?

930
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:27,616
It wasn't a stunt.
Eiko was just worried about me.

931
01:22:27,617 --> 01:22:30,138
Nice friendship you have.

932
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:53,288
Wait!

933
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,610
I've never slept with a guy.

934
01:23:11,567 --> 01:23:13,738
Don't leave! I'm scared!

935
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:15,845
Help! I'm scared!

936
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:25,679
I opened my eyes.

937
01:23:25,774 --> 01:23:27,845
I looked at the time as usual.

938
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:29,730
It was 6:37.

939
01:23:30,861 --> 01:23:33,630
I laid motionless and fell asleep.

940
01:23:34,437 --> 01:23:37,390
When I looked at
the time again, it was 10:07.

941
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:43,920
I got up and looked in the mirror.

942
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:48,143
My face was rough, covered in dead skin.

943
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,342
It took 15 minutes to get dressed.

944
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:55,810
I wondered whether
to wear jeans or a skirt.

945
01:23:56,134 --> 01:23:59,034
Then I realized
it doesn't make any difference.

946
01:24:00,028 --> 01:24:03,146
I went into the
bathroom and brushed my teeth.

947
01:24:03,728 --> 01:24:06,569
I realized that I already brushed them.

948
01:24:06,905 --> 01:24:09,455
But it was just yesterday morning.

949
01:24:09,903 --> 01:24:12,788
And the morning before,
I thought the same thing!

950
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,724
The bathroom window was open 3 cm.

951
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,872
The wind blew through it.

952
01:24:21,117 --> 01:24:23,288
The warm wind of spring.

953
01:24:24,803 --> 01:24:26,831
I took a look outside.

954
01:24:27,757 --> 01:24:32,990
On the street, a porter was trying
to cram rolls of cables onto a truck.

955
01:24:33,926 --> 01:24:35,588
But without success.

956
01:24:36,494 --> 01:24:38,655
They would fall out every time.

957
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,363
When he finally finished, I came inside.

958
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,210
I hadn't put on makeup.

959
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:49,223
Just a little cream.

960
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,629
Recently when I do my makeup,

961
01:24:52,531 --> 01:24:56,379
or when I put on lipstick,
I get a cold shiver.

962
01:24:58,270 --> 01:25:00,075
Then I ate.

963
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:05,081
I drank milk, from a 180 ml bottle.

964
01:25:06,259 --> 01:25:08,759
With salad and half a sandwich.

965
01:25:10,496 --> 01:25:13,479
Afterwards, I sat in a chair doing nothing.

966
01:25:13,882 --> 01:25:15,823
Maybe for an hour.

967
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:20,141
Then I remembered
I hadn't watered the plants.

968
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:22,743
I watered them for half an hour.

969
01:25:23,516 --> 01:25:25,709
Maybe I watered them too much!

970
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:30,191
And again, nothing to do.

971
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:33,504
I sat in the chair some more.

972
01:25:35,444 --> 01:25:37,405
Then the phone rang!

973
01:25:37,636 --> 01:25:39,150
It was 11:12.

974
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:44,421
"This is the landlord,
concerning the phone bill."

975
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:46,127
I just said "yes."

976
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:50,605
Again, nothing to do.

977
01:25:50,926 --> 01:25:52,521
I just sat there.

978
01:25:57,187 --> 01:25:59,156
Help me, please!

979
01:25:59,759 --> 01:26:01,981
Help me, please!

980
01:26:22,036 --> 01:26:24,615
Is there a way to live without fear?

981
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:28,686
All year long I only hear
the noises from cars below...

982
01:26:29,483 --> 01:26:32,540
I need to be with someone! Anyone!

983
01:26:59,425 --> 01:27:00,823
Calm down.

984
01:27:01,325 --> 01:27:02,939
Don't think about anything.

985
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:06,299
You don't have to think. Think nothing.

986
01:27:06,817 --> 01:27:07,950
Nothing.

987
01:27:37,806 --> 01:27:39,305
It's my Dad.

988
01:27:40,062 --> 01:27:42,272
I wrote a suicide note.

989
01:27:43,234 --> 01:27:45,516
But I don't want to see my Mum or Dad.

990
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:47,874
Because I left them for Tokyo.

991
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:51,498
You have a country home to return to.

992
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:53,146
You should be happy!

993
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:54,757
Come on.

994
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:57,613
No! I don't want to see them.

995
01:27:57,934 --> 01:27:59,805
I don't want to see anyone!

996
01:28:00,031 --> 01:28:01,543
Tell them I'm out!

997
01:28:01,767 --> 01:28:03,444
Stop this nonsense.

998
01:28:07,557 --> 01:28:08,806
Here...

999
01:28:09,468 --> 01:28:11,388
Dry your tears.

1000
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:22,369
Go open it.

1001
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:30,049
Where are you going? Home?

1002
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:33,264
I need a vacation.

1003
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:35,680
A long vacation.

1004
01:28:38,759 --> 01:28:40,638
Don't open it!

1005
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:43,174
Please, don't open it!

1006
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:18,571
They say that women shouldn't
do anything else when raising children.

1007
01:29:19,068 --> 01:29:21,019
But you're too lenient.

1008
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,854
Noe has become too self-indulgent.

1009
01:29:24,107 --> 01:29:25,771
Don't worry.

1010
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,316
If I didn't let her work,

1011
01:29:29,317 --> 01:29:31,423
she'd become unbearable.

1012
01:29:31,424 --> 01:29:34,372
But she always stays out late at night.

1013
01:29:36,725 --> 01:29:38,356
I'm used to it.

1014
01:29:42,097 --> 01:29:43,749
Used to it...

1015
01:29:44,574 --> 01:29:46,971
Why don't you scold her?

1016
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:52,711
Well...

1017
01:29:53,069 --> 01:29:54,948
I guess I'm just lazy.

1018
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:58,054
I'm fine just playing the shakuhachi.

1019
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:01,178
You don't want to hear more.

1020
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:30,317
Come here.

1021
01:30:35,921 --> 01:30:37,487
Come here.

1022
01:32:01,895 --> 01:32:03,745
My poor brother...

1023
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:09,190
My poor brother...

1024
01:35:26,817 --> 01:35:28,309
It's strange...

1025
01:35:28,853 --> 01:35:30,509
Even just now,

1026
01:35:30,889 --> 01:35:33,447
I was considering living somewhere else.

1027
01:35:34,277 --> 01:35:36,805
Because you're in love with Ôsugi?

1028
01:35:37,822 --> 01:35:38,823
No!

1029
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:44,680
I thought I would leave
both you and Ôsugi, to think quietly.

1030
01:35:49,209 --> 01:35:50,283
Chiyo...

1031
01:35:50,842 --> 01:35:52,967
She's the same age as me.

1032
01:35:53,161 --> 01:35:56,055
We grew up together like twin sisters!

1033
01:35:57,248 --> 01:35:59,286
How could she sleep with you?

1034
01:35:59,389 --> 01:36:01,830
She felt pity, that's all.

1035
01:36:05,623 --> 01:36:09,395
Right now, I understand how jealousy...

1036
01:36:10,077 --> 01:36:12,123
can be a violent feeling.

1037
01:36:13,263 --> 01:36:16,032
So how can you remain so calm?

1038
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:19,818
That's all you can say
to your wife of four years?

1039
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:21,435
Answer!

1040
01:36:24,558 --> 01:36:26,767
Would a truly good wife...

1041
01:36:26,768 --> 01:36:29,312
behave like you've behaved recently?

1042
01:36:30,362 --> 01:36:33,709
"I will do everything
to reveal the true Noe."

1043
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:38,673
"Raise your skills to the highest level
possible and make you a wonderful woman."

1044
01:36:38,761 --> 01:36:40,434
Who said that?

1045
01:36:40,558 --> 01:36:43,772
You said yourself I was no ordinary woman!

1046
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:46,118
You're right.

1047
01:36:46,219 --> 01:36:49,194
You are not an ordinary woman.

1048
01:36:51,468 --> 01:36:53,869
But what has our family become?

1049
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:01,781
No...

1050
01:37:12,121 --> 01:37:14,641
Neither you nor I...

1051
01:37:14,749 --> 01:37:17,636
could bear to see us become...

1052
01:37:17,734 --> 01:37:20,732
the same ordinary people we despise.

1053
01:37:23,638 --> 01:37:26,229
We're unable to fool ourselves.

1054
01:37:26,621 --> 01:37:28,535
Two people,

1055
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,927
desperate to be united to each other,

1056
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:33,885
like any other couple.

1057
01:37:34,237 --> 01:37:37,185
Who realize they're only together...

1058
01:37:37,591 --> 01:37:41,087
because of their memories,
and the state of society,

1059
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:43,426
their children,

1060
01:37:43,587 --> 01:37:45,609
and their own weaknesses.

1061
01:37:46,534 --> 01:37:48,755
We spend each day...

1062
01:37:49,412 --> 01:37:53,072
clinging to each other,
while laughing at ourselves.

1063
01:37:53,073 --> 01:37:54,327
Stop it!

1064
01:37:55,278 --> 01:37:57,319
I am now certain...

1065
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,086
that I love you!

1066
01:38:00,642 --> 01:38:01,872
Impossible!

1067
01:38:08,529 --> 01:38:10,582
That's no longer possible.

1068
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:15,730
You're upset, that's all.

1069
01:38:18,008 --> 01:38:19,467
You're right.

1070
01:38:19,855 --> 01:38:21,451
Jealousy perhaps.

1071
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:24,879
Someone else slept with your husband.

1072
01:38:25,536 --> 01:38:28,004
Your pride as a wife is wounded.

1073
01:38:28,462 --> 01:38:31,370
- And that makes you angry.
- You're wrong!

1074
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:35,218
I'm angry because you betrayed my trust!

1075
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:38,872
Since this winter,

1076
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,071
I've talked about our changing feelings.

1077
01:38:43,066 --> 01:38:45,378
With our state of detachment,

1078
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,869
we can't speak as a couple.

1079
01:38:48,525 --> 01:38:51,031
There's no betrayal to talk about.

1080
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:53,986
You've become angry...

1081
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:57,591
over this meaningless marital offence.

1082
01:38:58,337 --> 01:39:00,717
Doesn't that reveal a little vanity?

1083
01:39:01,778 --> 01:39:03,142
How?

1084
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:06,562
How can you be so calm and detached?

1085
01:39:08,962 --> 01:39:11,338
I can't understand you at all!

1086
01:39:18,775 --> 01:39:21,527
Makoto will probably be sad.

1087
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:26,357
But at least you can leave this house...

1088
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:29,238
with peace of mind.

1089
01:39:30,386 --> 01:39:31,969
Leave me.

1090
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:35,490
Go where you want.

1091
01:39:38,509 --> 01:39:39,724
No...

1092
01:39:41,065 --> 01:39:43,313
I won't leave you.

1093
01:40:18,371 --> 01:40:20,838
Telling me to leave Ôsugi is a problem.

1094
01:40:20,839 --> 01:40:22,091
I'm crazy for him!

1095
01:40:22,092 --> 01:40:24,370
Even if he's a spy?

1096
01:40:24,692 --> 01:40:26,911
A spy? What do you mean?

1097
01:40:28,304 --> 01:40:30,467
The rumours are circulating.

1098
01:40:30,469 --> 01:40:33,710
He'd sell out to
the authorities if he's broke.

1099
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:36,651
Just to support all his wives?

1100
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:40,430
Now that's funny! So funny I'm crying!

1101
01:40:41,598 --> 01:40:44,250
- Ôsugi...
- It's not funny!

1102
01:40:45,597 --> 01:40:48,676
Maybe you want me to investigate?

1103
01:40:57,483 --> 01:40:59,243
Very well.

1104
01:41:00,311 --> 01:41:02,799
I'll tell you if I learn something.

1105
01:41:03,703 --> 01:41:07,228
But spy or not,
I want nothing to do with it.

1106
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:11,151
Ôsugi is just the man I love.

1107
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:36,456
Noe?

1108
01:42:37,716 --> 01:42:39,863
Please don't open the door.

1109
01:42:46,914 --> 01:42:49,152
I'm not a curious woman.

1110
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:51,888
I don't need to know everything.

1111
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:58,071
Do I need to see the face of the
woman who became my husband's mistress?

1112
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:03,004
Wouldn't you feel the same way
if you were in my place?

1113
01:43:04,477 --> 01:43:06,002
Anything else?

1114
01:43:08,496 --> 01:43:10,682
If not, please go home.

1115
01:43:11,901 --> 01:43:13,702
Ôsugi isn't here.

1116
01:43:23,788 --> 01:43:25,674
Please tell him...

1117
01:43:26,188 --> 01:43:27,508
I...

1118
01:43:27,831 --> 01:43:30,826
I've decided to stop seeing him.

1119
01:43:38,033 --> 01:43:40,711
I would like to tell him in person.

1120
01:43:41,055 --> 01:43:44,737
But I'm in a hurry.
I want to settle this immediately.

1121
01:44:45,293 --> 01:44:49,155
Hey, when you're with me,
you're all mine, right?

1122
01:44:49,665 --> 01:44:51,720
You're free to think so.

1123
01:44:52,006 --> 01:44:54,655
But I don't believe I'm bound to anyone.

1124
01:44:54,759 --> 01:44:56,496
Not even me?

1125
01:44:56,589 --> 01:44:59,307
There's also Yasuko, and Noe.

1126
01:45:01,039 --> 01:45:02,717
Don't you think so?

1127
01:45:04,081 --> 01:45:06,119
I don't mean to worry you.

1128
01:45:06,736 --> 01:45:09,452
I just came to break up with Ôsugi.

1129
01:45:09,614 --> 01:45:11,025
Break up?

1130
01:45:11,127 --> 01:45:14,490
You didn't want to leave Tsuji, right?

1131
01:45:14,585 --> 01:45:17,384
Couldn't leave him after all these years.

1132
01:45:17,467 --> 01:45:19,709
No, I'm leaving Tsuji.

1133
01:45:20,609 --> 01:45:22,977
But I won't be with Ôsugi either.

1134
01:45:24,116 --> 01:45:25,841
I will live alone.

1135
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:46,001
From now on,

1136
01:45:46,097 --> 01:45:48,663
I don't depend on Ôsugi, or anyone.

1137
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:53,088
Ultimately,
you're only thinking of you and Tsuji.

1138
01:45:53,187 --> 01:45:56,048
- You may be right.
- Of course.

1139
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:59,991
You don't want to be
responsible for destroying his family!

1140
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:01,668
How dishonest!

1141
01:46:03,364 --> 01:46:07,313
You say you want to
live independently, just to save face!

1142
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:10,075
You really think you can do it?

1143
01:46:10,248 --> 01:46:11,925
You never will!

1144
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,047
Yes I will.
I've already made up my mind.

1145
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:20,811
If you wanted to leave,
you wouldn't have come to say goodbye.

1146
01:46:21,594 --> 01:46:23,667
You have no intention of it.

1147
01:46:41,222 --> 01:46:42,436
Tell me...

1148
01:46:43,365 --> 01:46:47,951
For you, it's not important
if it's Ôsugi or someone else, right?

1149
01:46:50,739 --> 01:46:53,322
Life with Tsuji was too hard.

1150
01:46:53,748 --> 01:46:55,689
To escape that life,

1151
01:46:56,638 --> 01:46:59,137
an affair with any man would do.

1152
01:47:04,563 --> 01:47:07,057
No, it's all the same.

1153
01:47:10,742 --> 01:47:14,206
Maybe you wanted to
trade your old shoes for new ones.

1154
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:22,818
But you barely took a step,
and they're covered in mud.

1155
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:29,825
Take a look.

1156
01:47:31,044 --> 01:47:33,543
It's muddy wherever you go.

1157
01:47:35,497 --> 01:47:36,898
It's funny...

1158
01:47:40,232 --> 01:47:42,077
You... Me...

1159
01:47:45,906 --> 01:47:47,501
Covered in mud.

1160
01:48:35,362 --> 01:48:37,233
Do you love Tsuji?

1161
01:48:37,897 --> 01:48:39,971
Love him with all your heart?

1162
01:48:42,071 --> 01:48:43,822
Do you love Ôsugi?

1163
01:48:45,258 --> 01:48:48,062
Have you thought about what love means?

1164
01:48:49,939 --> 01:48:51,492
Love means...

1165
01:48:52,118 --> 01:48:54,608
To capture someone else's heart,

1166
01:48:55,328 --> 01:48:56,843
and monopolize it.

1167
01:48:57,622 --> 01:48:59,856
That's what love means to me.

1168
01:49:00,583 --> 01:49:02,628
Ôsugi and I are like this.

1169
01:49:03,329 --> 01:49:05,656
We belong to each other.

1170
01:49:08,257 --> 01:49:10,903
Since you became Ôsugi's lover,

1171
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:14,653
you have interfered with the two of us.

1172
01:49:17,099 --> 01:49:19,930
You can't shake us off so easily.

1173
01:49:22,826 --> 01:49:24,877
Not until we're finished.

1174
01:49:28,351 --> 01:49:30,698
One person possessing another...

1175
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:32,506
Nobody can do that!

1176
01:49:32,615 --> 01:49:34,239
Of course they can!

1177
01:49:35,159 --> 01:49:37,906
As a journalist, I make 150 yen per month.

1178
01:49:38,055 --> 01:49:40,456
He's an anarchist with no money.

1179
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:44,024
I support both Ôsugi and Yasuko.

1180
01:49:44,278 --> 01:49:46,313
It's mutually beneficial.

1181
01:49:47,723 --> 01:49:50,039
But he knows it's a sham.

1182
01:49:50,883 --> 01:49:52,902
When I give him 10 yen,

1183
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:55,900
he won't admit that he receives much more.

1184
01:49:57,723 --> 01:50:02,509
Driven by lack of money,
he would have to become a government spy.

1185
01:50:02,878 --> 01:50:05,133
There's no freedom without money.

1186
01:50:05,227 --> 01:50:09,060
But becoming a spy
would mean selling freedom for money.

1187
01:50:09,224 --> 01:50:11,362
And even if he had the money,

1188
01:50:11,459 --> 01:50:13,656
he couldn't escape me.

1189
01:50:13,882 --> 01:50:17,042
I would kill him if he tried to leave me.

1190
01:50:17,132 --> 01:50:20,301
They say you can't buy feelings,
but it's a lie.

1191
01:50:20,518 --> 01:50:22,117
You can even buy...

1192
01:50:22,206 --> 01:50:24,541
a revolutionary and his soul!

1193
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:39,158
This is how Itsuko is.

1194
01:50:39,335 --> 01:50:42,854
Saying this kind of
nonsense makes her happy.

1195
01:50:43,405 --> 01:50:44,927
Don't listen to her.

1196
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:49,104
But all this has nothing to do with me.

1197
01:50:50,309 --> 01:50:51,934
I'm leaving you.

1198
01:50:52,024 --> 01:50:53,697
The rest doesn't matter.

1199
01:51:03,112 --> 01:51:04,279
Well...

1200
01:51:05,238 --> 01:51:06,974
It's over then.

1201
01:51:09,024 --> 01:51:10,160
Yes.

1202
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:14,252
Like Itsuko said,

1203
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,122
maybe I've been dishonest.

1204
01:51:18,868 --> 01:51:23,351
Maybe I just used you
as a springboard to another life.

1205
01:51:27,176 --> 01:51:30,386
I only wanted to untie
the knot that restrained me.

1206
01:51:32,418 --> 01:51:34,699
But by untying this knot,

1207
01:51:35,125 --> 01:51:37,272
you managed to untie them all.

1208
01:51:50,690 --> 01:51:51,902
Goodbye.

1209
01:51:52,951 --> 01:51:54,500
I won't return.

1210
01:53:42,552 --> 01:53:43,805
I see...

1211
01:53:44,946 --> 01:53:47,578
You will end up settling with Ôsugi.

1212
01:53:49,638 --> 01:53:50,779
Yes.

1213
01:53:53,414 --> 01:53:55,092
There is also Yasuko,

1214
01:53:56,756 --> 01:53:58,509
and Itsuko too,

1215
01:53:58,658 --> 01:54:00,699
and this doesn't matter?

1216
01:54:21,605 --> 01:54:22,901
I see...

1217
01:54:24,457 --> 01:54:25,977
Be happy.

1218
01:55:07,157 --> 01:55:11,884
I now believe
that I am enamoured with myself.

1219
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:16,685
The best thing is that
you go where you think you must.

1220
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:19,881
Makoto and Ryûji...

1221
01:55:20,556 --> 01:55:23,123
will surely understand when they're older.

1222
01:55:59,057 --> 01:56:02,240
- Did you have a dream?
- You mean nightmare?

1223
01:56:02,241 --> 01:56:04,149
I did just now.

1224
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:06,409
I hope to give it to you.

1225
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:09,181
I wonder if it
worked out with Megumi and him.

1226
01:56:09,182 --> 01:56:12,171
Work out? What would be worked out?

1227
01:56:13,983 --> 01:56:16,930
Anything and everything.

1228
01:56:17,327 --> 01:56:19,645
We can't go back now.

1229
01:56:29,564 --> 01:56:31,309
What are you thinking?

1230
01:56:38,652 --> 01:56:40,854
I'm not too bad either, right?

1231
01:56:53,488 --> 01:56:55,290
I was in fifth grade.

1232
01:56:56,001 --> 01:56:57,664
Sleet was falling.

1233
01:56:58,281 --> 01:57:00,564
I saw him through the bank window.

1234
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:03,508
I was standing outside, watching.

1235
01:57:04,758 --> 01:57:06,611
He was my mother's lover!

1236
01:57:06,712 --> 01:57:08,445
That's what I thought.

1237
01:57:09,285 --> 01:57:11,381
I often saw him around town.

1238
01:57:38,963 --> 01:57:40,555
That's enough.

1239
01:57:41,142 --> 01:57:43,184
It's the last time we'll meet.

1240
01:57:48,912 --> 01:57:52,573
The good-for-nothing
who made these films ten years late...

1241
01:57:58,315 --> 01:58:00,115
That filmmaker...

1242
01:58:00,374 --> 01:58:02,612
is exactly like my mother's lover.

1243
01:58:23,264 --> 01:58:26,799
You think he wants to use them for an ad?

1244
01:58:53,584 --> 01:58:56,525
<i>On September 19th,
around nine in the morning,</i>

1245
01:58:56,526 --> 01:58:59,235
<i>Ôsugi and Noe left home together,</i>

1246
01:58:59,236 --> 01:59:01,817
<i>as I saw through the backyard hedge.</i>

1247
01:59:02,142 --> 01:59:04,605
<i>Mako, who was playing at my house,</i>

1248
01:59:04,606 --> 01:59:07,415
<i>hurried out as soon
as she saw their shadows.</i>

1249
01:59:07,416 --> 01:59:09,389
<i>But she immediately returned,</i>

1250
01:59:09,390 --> 01:59:11,979
<i>and said, "that's my Papa and Mama!"</i>

1251
01:59:13,268 --> 01:59:15,826
<i>That was the last time I saw Ôsugi.</i>

1252
01:59:17,443 --> 01:59:18,904
<i>The next day,</i>

1253
01:59:18,905 --> 01:59:22,126
<i>and the following days,
Mako came to play as usual.</i>

1254
01:59:22,975 --> 01:59:26,289
<i>One day when she was here,
playing like always,</i>

1255
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:29,224
<i>a journalist came to take a picture of her.</i>

1256
01:59:31,804 --> 01:59:33,689
<i>The following day,</i>

1257
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:36,426
<i>they officially announced Ôsugi's death.</i>

1258
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:41,213
<i>"If Mako comes over to play today,"</i>

1259
01:59:41,618 --> 01:59:44,897
<i>"I forbid you to talk about her Papa!"</i>

1260
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:48,604
<i>"It would break poor Mako's little heart."</i>

1261
01:59:48,776 --> 01:59:50,800
<i>I said this to my son.</i>

1262
01:59:52,102 --> 01:59:56,634
<i>And he seemed to understand
that something terrible had happened,</i>

1263
01:59:56,858 --> 01:59:58,901
<i>and he nodded in silence.</i>

1264
02:00:01,328 --> 02:00:03,129
<i>Just a moment later,</i>

1265
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:06,081
<i>Mako came in
through the back door, as usual.</i>

1266
02:00:07,363 --> 02:00:09,562
<i>When she saw us, she said,</i>

1267
02:00:09,563 --> 02:00:11,881
<i>"Papa and Mama are dead."</i>

1268
02:00:11,882 --> 02:00:15,113
<i>"Grandpa and Uncle came to look for them."</i>

1269
02:00:15,114 --> 02:00:18,126
<i>"I'll go back with them in a car today."</i>

1270
02:00:19,816 --> 02:00:22,914
<i>That smart little girl
understood everything.</i>

1271
02:00:23,464 --> 02:00:27,640
<i>However, she understood it
like a seven-year-old child.</i>

1272
02:00:28,553 --> 02:00:31,327
<i>She knew the sad fate of her parents,</i>

1273
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:34,528
<i>but she played like usual,
in total innocence.</i>

1274
02:00:35,849 --> 02:00:39,448
<i>My son took pity on her,</i>

1275
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,445
<i>and gave her a doll that he loved,</i>

1276
02:00:42,446 --> 02:00:44,719
<i>plus all the colouring paper.</i>

1277
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:39,507
Roan Uchida,

1278
02:02:39,508 --> 02:02:43,012
<i>People I Remember: The Final Days of Ôsugi</i>

1279
02:02:45,423 --> 02:02:48,734
What are you hoping
to find in this dark library?

1280
02:02:49,382 --> 02:02:50,788
The past?

1281
02:02:50,885 --> 02:02:52,175
A story?

1282
02:02:52,265 --> 02:02:53,979
Documents?

1283
02:02:54,069 --> 02:02:55,471
Dust?

1284
02:02:55,568 --> 02:02:57,219
Or culture?

1285
02:03:13,736 --> 02:03:15,814
I would throw it all away.

1286
02:03:15,903 --> 02:03:18,852
I don't know what I did yesterday or why.

1287
02:03:18,945 --> 02:03:21,258
You know a lot about nothing!

1288
02:04:52,812 --> 02:04:54,131
Noe?

1289
02:04:58,725 --> 02:05:00,674
Aren't you Noe Itô?

1290
02:05:03,097 --> 02:05:05,662
Yes, I'm Noe.

1291
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:09,688
I've been looking for you a long time.

1292
02:05:09,778 --> 02:05:11,873
I'm very happy to meet you.

1293
02:05:16,138 --> 02:05:18,551
I even went to Hakata and Imajuku.

1294
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:20,292
This is my dream!

1295
02:05:22,111 --> 02:05:24,007
What can I do for you?

1296
02:05:25,647 --> 02:05:27,727
I just wanted to talk to you.

1297
02:05:36,436 --> 02:05:38,665
Do you know what will happen tomorrow?

1298
02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:40,239
Yes...

1299
02:05:41,011 --> 02:05:43,356
Do you know what you will do?

1300
02:05:43,995 --> 02:05:45,209
Yes...

1301
02:05:45,523 --> 02:05:48,106
Today, I understand about tomorrow.

1302
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:52,079
If you and Ôsugi hadn't been together...

1303
02:05:52,357 --> 02:05:53,969
In other words...

1304
02:05:54,202 --> 02:05:57,344
If Masaoka had won in your love triangle,

1305
02:05:57,476 --> 02:06:01,754
would you have avoided death
seven years later, in 1923,

1306
02:06:01,903 --> 02:06:06,756
in the aftermath of the earthquake?
Have you wondered about this?

1307
02:06:07,536 --> 02:06:09,710
I can't change my principles.

1308
02:06:09,804 --> 02:06:11,697
That's just what they are.

1309
02:06:11,788 --> 02:06:13,676
My principles.

1310
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:16,578
One last question:

1311
02:06:16,675 --> 02:06:19,980
Between 1923 and 1969,
46 years have elapsed.

1312
02:06:20,244 --> 02:06:22,878
How do you see these 46 years?

1313
02:09:03,038 --> 02:09:04,621
I came for a fight!

1314
02:09:04,828 --> 02:09:08,037
- As a comrade or as a friend?
- Both!

1315
02:09:08,521 --> 02:09:10,946
This is my final advice, so listen!

1316
02:09:11,945 --> 02:09:13,891
This doesn't concern you.

1317
02:09:23,428 --> 02:09:25,293
Can you hear the voices?

1318
02:09:26,417 --> 02:09:28,949
- I hear a cat.
- Yasuko is crying.

1319
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:31,287
Itsuko too! Can't you hear them?

1320
02:09:32,669 --> 02:09:35,344
- I hear them.
- Itsuko quit the newspaper.

1321
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:39,599
While you and Noe were
romping around Onjuku with her money,

1322
02:09:39,763 --> 02:09:42,677
she was waiting for you at Ryôgoku Station.

1323
02:09:42,782 --> 02:09:44,944
She's losing her mind.

1324
02:09:45,264 --> 02:09:48,107
Do you even understand what you've done?

1325
02:09:49,375 --> 02:09:51,083
Are you done talking?

1326
02:09:51,171 --> 02:09:52,802
Aren't you ashamed?

1327
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,489
I can't do anything.

1328
02:09:57,846 --> 02:09:59,376
What did you say?

1329
02:09:59,624 --> 02:10:02,615
I love these women equally,
with impartiality.

1330
02:10:02,704 --> 02:10:04,169
All three know it.

1331
02:10:05,812 --> 02:10:09,205
Impartiality? You've got some nerve!

1332
02:10:09,587 --> 02:10:12,015
Don't you pay more attention to Noe?

1333
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:14,604
You live together in Kikufuji Hotel.

1334
02:10:14,699 --> 02:10:16,912
So... What will you do?

1335
02:10:17,007 --> 02:10:19,402
Let the other two die slowly?

1336
02:10:20,346 --> 02:10:22,467
I told you I can't do anything!

1337
02:10:24,467 --> 02:10:28,404
We were supposed to live separately,
in complete independence.

1338
02:10:28,910 --> 02:10:32,258
But Noe doesn't have a job right now.
She's broke.

1339
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:34,681
All we can do is wait.

1340
02:10:34,682 --> 02:10:37,479
And the other two go crazy in the meantime!

1341
02:10:37,867 --> 02:10:40,163
You want me to abandon Noe?

1342
02:10:40,547 --> 02:10:42,300
Your advice is useless.

1343
02:10:45,917 --> 02:10:50,340
Noe has revived
the revolutionary inside of me.

1344
02:10:51,676 --> 02:10:53,805
When we were prohibited from meeting,

1345
02:10:53,806 --> 02:10:57,481
and our publications were censored,
we were all discouraged.

1346
02:10:57,482 --> 02:10:59,110
Speak for yourself!

1347
02:11:00,074 --> 02:11:01,510
We all were!

1348
02:11:02,508 --> 02:11:07,008
We had resigned ourselves
to the persecution of the ruling class,

1349
02:11:07,117 --> 02:11:09,842
and only watched the tragedy in Yanaka.

1350
02:11:10,095 --> 02:11:13,067
She reminded me
of my original determination.

1351
02:11:13,554 --> 02:11:17,221
She taught me to hate the hateful,
take offence at the offensive,

1352
02:11:17,222 --> 02:11:20,903
and adamantly support
the advancement of the oppressed.

1353
02:11:22,094 --> 02:11:26,007
Sakai defined it
as childish sentimentalism,

1354
02:11:26,610 --> 02:11:30,291
but isn't childish sentimentalism
exactly what we need?

1355
02:11:30,984 --> 02:11:34,789
And the result of your
determination is this miserable scandal?

1356
02:11:35,355 --> 02:11:39,229
If those words hadn't come
from one of your mistresses,

1357
02:11:39,705 --> 02:11:42,785
you wouldn't have lost a single comrade!

1358
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:51,148
Comrades...

1359
02:11:51,930 --> 02:11:54,294
My comrades in revolution...

1360
02:11:55,574 --> 02:11:57,757
What does revolution mean to us?

1361
02:11:58,616 --> 02:12:01,884
It's a way to open up
a land of absolute freedom.

1362
02:12:02,966 --> 02:12:07,983
Our most valuable method of
ending man's exploitation of man.

1363
02:12:08,158 --> 02:12:12,855
But the existence of private property
sustains this exploitation.

1364
02:12:13,206 --> 02:12:15,272
And what is private property?

1365
02:12:16,137 --> 02:12:18,298
It's the system through which the state

1366
02:12:18,299 --> 02:12:21,262
renders the morals of matrimony absolute,

1367
02:12:21,263 --> 02:12:23,875
so wealth is something that's inherited.

1368
02:12:23,876 --> 02:12:27,773
Worse! It's our deepest desire!

1369
02:12:28,657 --> 02:12:30,228
That's the problem.

1370
02:12:30,866 --> 02:12:35,177
Revolution is the way
to blow this system to pieces!

1371
02:12:37,369 --> 02:12:38,882
Marriage...

1372
02:12:39,189 --> 02:12:41,537
Marriage that builds the family...

1373
02:12:41,783 --> 02:12:44,118
Family that builds the State...

1374
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:49,434
As long as these are considered
to be sacred, absolute principles,

1375
02:12:50,164 --> 02:12:52,670
revolution will remain out of reach!

1376
02:12:54,335 --> 02:12:56,527
Think about this some more!

1377
02:12:56,528 --> 02:13:00,377
A man with mistresses
is the morality of the bourgeoisie.

1378
02:13:00,378 --> 02:13:03,279
Some reward for women's rights activists!

1379
02:13:04,526 --> 02:13:07,733
You all support revolution
to obtain freedom,

1380
02:13:07,734 --> 02:13:11,826
but as soon as I talk about
free love between a man and a woman,

1381
02:13:11,827 --> 02:13:13,655
you get riled up,

1382
02:13:13,656 --> 02:13:15,994
and shout "Traitor!" or "Whore!"

1383
02:13:15,996 --> 02:13:18,875
You retreat from it... I see...

1384
02:13:19,206 --> 02:13:22,478
I understand it's
difficult to keep a cool head.

1385
02:13:22,808 --> 02:13:24,798
But what will you do?

1386
02:13:25,035 --> 02:13:27,844
You want to become radical Confucianists?

1387
02:13:28,041 --> 02:13:30,125
What a strange situation...

1388
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:32,410
You refuse to look around you,

1389
02:13:32,411 --> 02:13:36,871
and you wonder if true revolution
and freedom are really possible.

1390
02:13:38,827 --> 02:13:40,351
That's enough.

1391
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:42,038
Farewell!

1392
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:49,568
In Russia...

1393
02:13:49,669 --> 02:13:51,788
The situation is changing.

1394
02:13:52,490 --> 02:13:55,632
Some say it won't happen until next March.

1395
02:13:56,372 --> 02:13:57,486
Right!

1396
02:14:01,833 --> 02:14:03,518
Look after Yasuko.

1397
02:15:03,991 --> 02:15:08,050
Ultimately, you ended up
picking the fruit that I grew,

1398
02:15:08,204 --> 02:15:10,522
before throwing it to the ground.

1399
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:13,457
But that's fine.

1400
02:15:13,667 --> 02:15:16,386
I left "Seitô" in your care.

1401
02:15:18,672 --> 02:15:21,666
Do you regret leaving it to me?

1402
02:15:22,554 --> 02:15:24,098
Honey!

1403
02:15:24,307 --> 02:15:26,790
Isn't the wind a bit cold?

1404
02:15:38,986 --> 02:15:41,235
Not the slightest regret!

1405
02:15:41,904 --> 02:15:44,877
Just when I wanted to
stop thinking about the magazine,

1406
02:15:44,878 --> 02:15:47,543
you had the desire to keep it going.

1407
02:15:48,332 --> 02:15:53,488
Our magazine could not have
hoped for a more appropriate end.

1408
02:15:54,959 --> 02:15:58,753
The number of pages
and the paper quality diminished,

1409
02:15:58,754 --> 02:16:01,360
then it died miserably like a dog.

1410
02:16:02,704 --> 02:16:04,947
Perhaps that's what it deserved...

1411
02:16:09,431 --> 02:16:11,102
Could you move please?

1412
02:16:11,221 --> 02:16:13,351
You're blocking the sun.

1413
02:20:26,605 --> 02:20:30,749
Why couldn't she have
told me to start up "Seitô" again?

1414
02:20:31,576 --> 02:20:33,135
Don't blame yourself.

1415
02:20:34,196 --> 02:20:36,908
On your own, you did a great deal of work.

1416
02:20:37,658 --> 02:20:41,119
But these efforts are nothing
to a bourgeois woman,

1417
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:43,638
who sees the magazine as her child.

1418
02:20:44,307 --> 02:20:46,100
I wanted to protest.

1419
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:48,636
Tell her I was trying something new.

1420
02:20:49,086 --> 02:20:50,760
But the words didn't come out.

1421
02:20:50,761 --> 02:20:52,968
Something was holding them back.

1422
02:20:53,465 --> 02:20:54,579
Something?

1423
02:20:59,263 --> 02:21:01,361
I don't mean you, of course.

1424
02:21:01,603 --> 02:21:04,688
Rather, a sort of apprehension from Aichô.

1425
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:09,058
Maybe because we had
distanced ourselves from each other.

1426
02:21:12,318 --> 02:21:15,723
It's true you didn't
behave like you usually would.

1427
02:21:18,866 --> 02:21:22,855
When things calm down,
I'll resume the publication.

1428
02:21:23,135 --> 02:21:27,077
Otherwise, leaving Tsuji
to run with you would make no sense.

1429
02:21:29,649 --> 02:21:31,020
Run with me?

1430
02:21:32,697 --> 02:21:33,797
I see...

1431
02:21:35,674 --> 02:21:37,814
You certainly run quickly.

1432
02:21:40,235 --> 02:21:42,554
Yaeko Nogami also said that to me.

1433
02:21:43,799 --> 02:21:45,836
"If you keep running so fast,"

1434
02:21:45,837 --> 02:21:49,090
"won't you overtake yourself eventually?"

1435
02:21:50,648 --> 02:21:52,902
Maybe it finally happened...

1436
02:23:04,762 --> 02:23:07,344
I didn't think you were busy with Noe.

1437
02:23:08,809 --> 02:23:11,122
The maid said there were two of you,

1438
02:23:11,208 --> 02:23:13,254
but I assumed it was Yasuko.

1439
02:25:02,741 --> 02:25:05,375
I'll go home.

1440
02:26:44,775 --> 02:26:46,266
I'm sorry.

1441
02:26:47,654 --> 02:26:49,952
I probably shouldn't have come.

1442
02:26:51,338 --> 02:26:53,382
If you really believed that,

1443
02:26:53,605 --> 02:26:56,171
it would've been you who left just now.

1444
02:27:06,755 --> 02:27:08,749
But I wanted to see you.

1445
02:27:09,189 --> 02:27:11,709
You can understand that, right?

1446
02:27:12,761 --> 02:27:14,284
Yesterday,

1447
02:27:15,473 --> 02:27:19,212
and the day before,
I was waiting for you desperately.

1448
02:27:21,604 --> 02:27:24,527
When you didn't come, I got worried.

1449
02:27:25,608 --> 02:27:29,101
I wondered if you had gotten sick.

1450
02:27:29,945 --> 02:27:31,291
Sick?

1451
02:27:32,103 --> 02:27:33,377
Yes...

1452
02:27:33,949 --> 02:27:36,364
I have a bit of a cold and fever.

1453
02:27:37,495 --> 02:27:39,698
So let me sleep a little.

1454
02:27:41,373 --> 02:27:43,615
Sleep well then.

1455
02:27:59,225 --> 02:28:01,004
Is it Noe?

1456
02:28:03,375 --> 02:28:06,744
It's her. I'm sure of it.

1457
02:29:08,711 --> 02:29:11,400
I can't find the keys to Kikufuji Hotel!

1458
02:29:11,511 --> 02:29:13,506
I've looked everywhere!

1459
02:29:21,597 --> 02:29:24,147
I was going back to Yokohama,
but I turned back.

1460
02:29:24,370 --> 02:29:26,071
You're so forgetful...

1461
02:29:26,816 --> 02:29:28,906
Wait there. I'll come get you.

1462
02:29:32,693 --> 02:29:36,175
If you have a cold,
you shouldn't go out at night.

1463
02:29:36,822 --> 02:29:38,534
Bring me my coat.

1464
02:35:47,616 --> 02:35:49,734
I'm going home now.

1465
02:37:31,422 --> 02:37:35,161
Noe said she was leaving,
but maybe she's hiding nearby,

1466
02:37:35,162 --> 02:37:36,955
waiting for me to leave.

1467
02:37:37,052 --> 02:37:39,360
Can't you leave me in peace?

1468
02:37:52,359 --> 02:37:55,503
- You're thinking about Noe...
- Enough!

1469
02:37:57,460 --> 02:37:58,868
Noe...

1470
02:37:59,063 --> 02:38:01,285
You afraid she'll come back?

1471
02:38:01,376 --> 02:38:04,450
She won't come back!
She's not that kind of woman.

1472
02:38:04,538 --> 02:38:07,191
What do I know? She's sneaky.

1473
02:38:13,672 --> 02:38:16,314
I think we need to have a serious talk.

1474
02:38:17,096 --> 02:38:20,003
I can't bear this situation anymore!

1475
02:38:20,751 --> 02:38:22,484
You really think so?

1476
02:38:27,352 --> 02:38:28,883
I think so too.

1477
02:38:29,363 --> 02:38:31,726
You're right to find it pitiful.

1478
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:34,756
I'm tired of it!

1479
02:38:35,486 --> 02:38:37,726
Let's end it once and for all.

1480
02:38:38,986 --> 02:38:40,350
So you...

1481
02:38:42,117 --> 02:38:45,051
Our story is over, you could say.

1482
02:38:46,580 --> 02:38:49,764
- That's all you have to say?
- What else?

1483
02:38:52,169 --> 02:38:55,175
Aren't you the proponent of free love?

1484
02:38:58,384 --> 02:39:00,971
I believed your theories
and did as you said.

1485
02:39:00,972 --> 02:39:03,171
But this is too much! Too much!

1486
02:39:03,172 --> 02:39:06,687
You're telling me to
acknowledge that my theory failed?

1487
02:39:06,910 --> 02:39:08,309
With pleasure!

1488
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:10,895
It failed because it had to fail.

1489
02:39:10,896 --> 02:39:12,154
Happy now?

1490
02:39:16,131 --> 02:39:18,749
My egoism ruined everything.

1491
02:39:19,905 --> 02:39:22,763
That's what you're trying to say, right?

1492
02:39:29,707 --> 02:39:31,974
Nothing else is possible between us?

1493
02:39:33,738 --> 02:39:35,035
Free love?

1494
02:39:36,172 --> 02:39:38,196
It is within reach.

1495
02:39:38,426 --> 02:39:39,824
Within reach!

1496
02:39:40,467 --> 02:39:43,646
Some day, men and women, even spouses,

1497
02:39:43,647 --> 02:39:47,049
will make love with no concern for money.

1498
02:40:01,447 --> 02:40:04,009
- I...
- No, it's impossible!

1499
02:40:06,744 --> 02:40:09,599
Now I know what you're thinking.

1500
02:40:12,625 --> 02:40:14,140
You don't know.

1501
02:40:19,507 --> 02:40:24,365
On days when you have money,
and days when you don't...

1502
02:40:24,448 --> 02:40:25,903
Be clear!

1503
02:40:35,648 --> 02:40:38,147
Noe was wearing a pretty kimono.

1504
02:40:41,654 --> 02:40:44,259
When you have some money, you change.

1505
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:47,177
Don't talk nonsense. I won't change.

1506
02:40:47,284 --> 02:40:49,518
Your way of thinking has changed.

1507
02:40:54,416 --> 02:40:56,509
You're good with words.

1508
02:40:56,794 --> 02:40:58,860
But what about actions?

1509
02:40:59,672 --> 02:41:02,103
What's the reality of our relationship?

1510
02:41:02,633 --> 02:41:05,913
What about Noe? She got between us!

1511
02:41:06,839 --> 02:41:10,649
Taking advantage of
your and Yasuko's money without working.

1512
02:41:10,975 --> 02:41:12,224
No...

1513
02:41:12,564 --> 02:41:15,427
Taking advantage of the sacrifices I made!

1514
02:41:16,522 --> 02:41:20,385
A little money,
and she struts around in fancy kimonos!

1515
02:41:24,155 --> 02:41:27,243
That's the reality of free love!

1516
02:41:29,201 --> 02:41:32,705
A little scandal, just like all the others!

1517
02:41:33,455 --> 02:41:37,008
Yes... Merely a scandal!

1518
02:41:38,639 --> 02:41:40,793
Started by all that money!

1519
02:41:48,846 --> 02:41:50,129
I see.

1520
02:41:51,390 --> 02:41:52,941
So that's it?

1521
02:42:13,165 --> 02:42:15,014
So I owe you money.

1522
02:42:15,981 --> 02:42:18,372
That's why you can smugly attack me!

1523
02:42:19,793 --> 02:42:21,362
I'll give it to you!

1524
02:42:22,464 --> 02:42:23,994
It's not spy money.

1525
02:42:24,632 --> 02:42:27,932
I got it by threatening
the Minister of the Interior.

1526
02:42:28,802 --> 02:42:31,095
Our movement is obstructing them,

1527
02:42:31,096 --> 02:42:33,209
so of course they'll give out money!

1528
02:42:33,682 --> 02:42:35,073
It's for you!

1529
02:42:36,018 --> 02:42:39,362
Look, it's money. Take it!

1530
02:42:40,356 --> 02:42:42,630
Take it and go home!

1531
02:42:47,476 --> 02:42:49,565
Now you're a stranger to me.

1532
02:42:49,699 --> 02:42:50,989
A stranger!

1533
02:44:56,575 --> 02:44:58,253
What are you doing?

1534
02:44:59,411 --> 02:45:02,026
I want you to hold me...

1535
02:45:02,915 --> 02:45:05,863
I don't know you anymore.

1536
02:45:09,064 --> 02:45:10,792
I offer my apologies.

1537
02:45:11,507 --> 02:45:14,361
Forgive me. I was wrong.

1538
02:45:15,219 --> 02:45:16,209
So...

1539
02:45:17,054 --> 02:45:19,616
Can you see how pathetic you are?

1540
02:45:20,474 --> 02:45:23,091
Since we haven't settled our problem...

1541
02:45:24,687 --> 02:45:26,240
I'm cold.

1542
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,520
I can't sleep.

1543
02:45:29,108 --> 02:45:32,213
Putting aside problems
before they're resolved...

1544
02:45:32,528 --> 02:45:35,733
I hate that! What a way to think!

1545
02:45:40,286 --> 02:45:43,216
I have my rules... But please just hold me.

1546
02:45:43,299 --> 02:45:44,664
Not a chance.

1547
02:45:52,390 --> 02:45:54,957
You would accept Noe. But not me.

1548
02:45:56,539 --> 02:45:59,155
I've read her letters. I know it all...

1549
02:46:00,199 --> 02:46:01,364
Noe...

1550
02:46:03,100 --> 02:46:04,214
Noe...

1551
02:46:07,354 --> 02:46:09,548
You complain that you're a victim.

1552
02:46:10,266 --> 02:46:13,421
You even went out to buy a knife.

1553
02:46:15,112 --> 02:46:18,463
But by driving me to her,
you have attacked Yasuko.

1554
02:46:19,933 --> 02:46:22,100
An aggressor like yourself,

1555
02:46:23,829 --> 02:46:27,991
under the pretext that you're Noe's victim,

1556
02:46:28,542 --> 02:46:30,388
should not complain.

1557
02:46:32,671 --> 02:46:36,100
I know Noe's presence
seems like an attack to you.

1558
02:46:36,101 --> 02:46:37,647
I've paid attention.

1559
02:46:42,389 --> 02:46:43,538
No...

1560
02:46:46,227 --> 02:46:48,686
I will never be a victim...

1561
02:49:24,969 --> 02:49:26,209
Wait!

1562
02:51:38,811 --> 02:51:40,038
Noe!

1563
02:52:47,671 --> 02:52:48,939
Noe...

1564
02:54:34,028 --> 02:54:35,850
The camera is loaded.

1565
02:54:37,239 --> 02:54:38,788
The past doesn't interest me.

1566
02:54:38,789 --> 02:54:41,553
I have no interest in filming the past.

1567
02:55:02,306 --> 02:55:04,226
What happens next?

1568
02:55:04,934 --> 02:55:07,178
I will do absolutely nothing.

1569
02:55:07,711 --> 02:55:10,254
Will boys say the same thing in 50 years?

1570
02:55:10,343 --> 02:55:11,581
Of course!

1571
02:55:12,858 --> 02:55:14,791
What did he do next?

1572
02:55:14,902 --> 02:55:16,164
Who?

1573
02:55:16,291 --> 02:55:18,125
Your mother's lover.

1574
02:55:19,689 --> 02:55:21,280
He smiled.

1575
02:55:21,392 --> 02:55:23,341
Through the bank window.

1576
02:55:24,098 --> 02:55:26,927
Then he said "come in," and I was there.

1577
02:55:27,048 --> 02:55:28,745
At his house, I mean.

1578
02:55:30,558 --> 02:55:33,517
- What was his house like?
- How should I know?

1579
02:55:34,310 --> 02:55:36,220
I was blindfolded.

1580
02:55:40,386 --> 02:55:41,932
He was a homo.

1581
02:55:43,148 --> 02:55:44,452
Or not.

1582
02:55:45,313 --> 02:55:47,353
He was just playing a trick.

1583
02:55:48,039 --> 02:55:49,339
That's all.

1584
02:56:36,656 --> 02:56:38,088
That's it!

1585
02:56:38,416 --> 02:56:40,064
He chose death.

1586
02:56:44,992 --> 02:56:46,297
Who did?

1587
02:57:00,765 --> 02:57:03,540
He realized death is the greatest pleasure.

1588
02:57:05,638 --> 02:57:07,908
Death reverses his value.

1589
02:57:19,097 --> 02:57:21,865
- Reverses what?
- Value!

1590
02:57:50,182 --> 02:57:52,423
So you're going to kill me?

1591
02:57:54,019 --> 02:57:55,284
Yes.

1592
02:57:55,598 --> 02:57:57,432
I have no other choice.

1593
02:57:57,648 --> 02:57:58,818
Ah...

1594
02:58:00,025 --> 02:58:04,151
In memory of our friendship,
I must ask you to do it quickly.

1595
02:58:11,495 --> 02:58:13,534
Why don't you escape?

1596
02:58:14,456 --> 02:58:18,079
Since you're going to kill me,
it would be pointless.

1597
02:58:19,837 --> 02:58:22,574
You want to escape from yourself...

1598
02:58:22,941 --> 02:58:24,205
Don't you?

1599
02:58:25,587 --> 02:58:29,400
It's not your theories that failed,
but the revolution itself.

1600
02:58:30,764 --> 02:58:33,625
It's yourself that has failed.

1601
02:58:34,935 --> 02:58:38,467
You set this trap to escape your fears.

1602
02:58:40,274 --> 02:58:41,629
This trap?

1603
02:58:42,472 --> 02:58:44,277
This trap, you say?

1604
02:58:47,114 --> 02:58:49,982
The three lines that you have entangled...

1605
02:58:50,951 --> 02:58:53,307
The three women...

1606
02:58:54,455 --> 02:58:57,773
The more they struggle,
the more entangled they become.

1607
02:58:58,918 --> 02:59:01,292
Then comes the ultimate moment.

1608
02:59:04,525 --> 02:59:06,721
The three lines constrict you.

1609
02:59:08,164 --> 02:59:11,954
It's all over. Like you expected.

1610
02:59:13,194 --> 02:59:15,277
Your fears will come to an end.

1611
02:59:17,561 --> 02:59:19,614
Believe what you want.

1612
02:59:20,481 --> 02:59:23,767
But the revolution is
something that nullifies itself.

1613
02:59:24,151 --> 02:59:25,729
To me,

1614
02:59:26,498 --> 02:59:28,803
that amounts to removing me.

1615
02:59:30,765 --> 02:59:34,139
This knife driven into my body...

1616
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:38,069
It whispers words of love and dread.

1617
02:59:39,083 --> 02:59:40,626
Just like you...

1618
02:59:42,002 --> 02:59:44,437
Normal people would be afraid,

1619
02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:48,340
but to me there's no greater ecstasy.

1620
03:00:11,241 --> 03:00:13,870
I refuse to kill you if it helps you!

1621
03:01:07,087 --> 03:01:10,076
Something like this
happened to me before.

1622
03:01:12,510 --> 03:01:15,240
In 3rd year of Cadet School.

1623
03:01:16,847 --> 03:01:18,066
I was...

1624
03:01:21,352 --> 03:01:22,635
You were...

1625
03:01:23,562 --> 03:01:27,734
An out of control bully,
always armed with a knife.

1626
03:01:29,263 --> 03:01:31,053
A juvenile delinquent,

1627
03:01:31,769 --> 03:01:34,919
who was expelled after a knife fight.

1628
03:01:35,808 --> 03:01:39,248
Ending your dream
of becoming an army general.

1629
03:01:44,411 --> 03:01:45,984
Isn't that right?

1630
03:01:49,031 --> 03:01:50,318
No!

1631
03:01:52,099 --> 03:01:55,381
The other guy had pulled a knife.

1632
03:01:55,887 --> 03:01:59,777
I reached into my pocket
to take out my own knife.

1633
03:02:01,139 --> 03:02:06,021
But... I changed my mind
and fought him bare-handed.

1634
03:02:07,731 --> 03:02:09,559
He rushed at me.

1635
03:02:11,902 --> 03:02:13,753
I fell to the ground.

1636
03:02:35,926 --> 03:02:37,452
You knew...

1637
03:02:40,598 --> 03:02:43,212
You knew how it would end!

1638
03:03:30,592 --> 03:03:32,128
My body...

1639
03:03:33,082 --> 03:03:35,909
has suddenly become cold.

1640
03:04:10,693 --> 03:04:12,184
Hey, you...

1641
03:04:17,361 --> 03:04:19,573
You think you can ignite me?

1642
03:05:48,920 --> 03:05:50,906
You can't ignite me.

1643
03:05:54,084 --> 03:05:55,548
You can't do it!

1644
03:06:16,833 --> 03:06:19,676
You can't do it!
You can't do anything!

1645
03:09:13,195 --> 03:09:15,325
I knew it. You were hiding.

1646
03:09:15,326 --> 03:09:18,069
But Ôsugi is mine. You can't have him.

1647
03:09:18,158 --> 03:09:19,957
You can't claim him.

1648
03:09:36,107 --> 03:09:38,412
Thanks to this, he'll be mine.

1649
03:09:50,224 --> 03:09:52,629
You won't just lose Ôsugi with that.

1650
03:09:52,720 --> 03:09:54,855
You'll lose everything.

1651
03:09:59,078 --> 03:10:01,148
Losing everything...

1652
03:10:02,122 --> 03:10:04,108
is still the best choice.

1653
03:10:05,251 --> 03:10:09,769
Ôsugi and his principles are
condemned to die sooner or later.

1654
03:10:10,464 --> 03:10:13,278
It's better if I do it right now!

1655
03:10:23,816 --> 03:10:25,659
Now he's mine!

1656
03:10:33,654 --> 03:10:36,212
Think a little, and drop the knife.

1657
03:10:37,139 --> 03:10:40,321
You won't gain anything but a corpse.

1658
03:10:52,805 --> 03:10:56,528
That's fine with me. That's fine...

1659
03:10:59,346 --> 03:11:02,636
Only in death can he truly belong to me.

1660
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:06,173
I believe that.

1661
03:12:25,577 --> 03:12:26,808
You...

1662
03:12:30,872 --> 03:12:32,941
Why didn't you stab him?

1663
03:12:34,596 --> 03:12:36,207
What was it...

1664
03:12:37,515 --> 03:12:39,578
that held your arms back?

1665
03:12:48,701 --> 03:12:50,087
No...

1666
03:12:50,512 --> 03:12:52,115
I stabbed him!

1667
03:13:00,241 --> 03:13:01,598
Look...

1668
03:13:34,591 --> 03:13:37,134
The blade was plunged into his heart.

1669
03:13:37,316 --> 03:13:38,857
Can't you see?

1670
03:13:40,583 --> 03:13:42,712
The blood flows...

1671
03:13:44,136 --> 03:13:46,327
like sand.

1672
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:52,189
His eyes no longer blink.

1673
03:13:54,092 --> 03:13:56,678
His lips have lost their colour.

1674
03:13:59,805 --> 03:14:03,332
Ôsugi is dead, my Ôsugi...

1675
03:14:05,574 --> 03:14:09,587
As soon as my love pierced him, he died.

1676
03:14:11,086 --> 03:14:13,886
My Ôsugi died at that moment.

1677
03:14:26,178 --> 03:14:28,231
It's true...

1678
03:14:31,469 --> 03:14:33,777
Death makes his face so sweet.

1679
03:14:35,521 --> 03:14:38,094
The cheeks that were once rosy...

1680
03:14:38,095 --> 03:14:41,064
now extend like a white desert.

1681
03:14:42,972 --> 03:14:46,524
All who venture inside are swallowed up.

1682
03:14:47,573 --> 03:14:49,987
These eyes that looked only at me...

1683
03:14:49,988 --> 03:14:52,356
don't look at anything anymore!

1684
03:14:53,596 --> 03:14:54,879
And yet...

1685
03:14:55,374 --> 03:14:58,693
I wasn't supposed to see his face of death.

1686
03:14:58,781 --> 03:14:59,987
Right?

1687
03:15:02,499 --> 03:15:06,323
I defeated Yasuko. I defeated Itsuko.

1688
03:15:06,951 --> 03:15:09,748
I followed in this man's path.

1689
03:15:09,889 --> 03:15:13,869
That's why I will
be killed with him some day.

1690
03:15:14,749 --> 03:15:16,313
That's why, right now,

1691
03:15:18,272 --> 03:15:21,521
I want to look at his sweet face of death.

1692
03:15:29,825 --> 03:15:32,713
You follow me, knowing that you will die?

1693
03:15:36,831 --> 03:15:38,042
Yes.

1694
03:15:38,936 --> 03:15:43,088
Hearing it from your mouth
further confirms my choice.

1695
03:15:43,464 --> 03:15:45,213
You know that.

1696
03:15:46,634 --> 03:15:48,751
What did Ôsugi say?

1697
03:15:51,263 --> 03:15:53,533
What did the dead man say?

1698
03:16:07,085 --> 03:16:09,555
He said, "Sayonara, Itsuko."

1699
03:16:25,172 --> 03:16:26,524
Sayonara...

1700
03:16:37,367 --> 03:16:39,005
Murdered?

1701
03:16:43,665 --> 03:16:47,125
But I'll probably kill our enemies first.

1702
03:16:48,687 --> 03:16:50,812
I am that kind of woman.

1703
03:17:01,836 --> 03:17:04,117
You will be killed because of me.

1704
03:17:05,153 --> 03:17:06,899
You know that?

1705
03:17:09,967 --> 03:17:11,501
I know...

1706
03:18:13,405 --> 03:18:14,977
You're afraid.

1707
03:18:15,616 --> 03:18:18,980
You're afraid because
you know they'll kill you.

1708
03:18:19,183 --> 03:18:21,256
You're just an ordinary woman.

1709
03:18:22,414 --> 03:18:23,711
You're wrong!

1710
03:18:23,800 --> 03:18:26,118
Our game of three is over now!

1711
03:18:26,208 --> 03:18:27,467
Finished!

1712
03:18:30,333 --> 03:18:31,863
Ôsugi is alive.

1713
03:18:33,008 --> 03:18:34,998
When I saw that you couldn't...

1714
03:18:35,752 --> 03:18:38,666
That you were incapable of stabbing him,

1715
03:18:40,599 --> 03:18:43,856
I understood what I had to do.

1716
03:18:45,938 --> 03:18:47,299
I...

1717
03:18:49,775 --> 03:18:51,966
I saw the future in front of me.

1718
03:19:07,126 --> 03:19:08,849
Ôsugi is dead!

1719
03:19:09,170 --> 03:19:12,250
- You can't kill a dead man!
- Wrong...

1720
03:19:13,571 --> 03:19:17,987
You took a chance on this knife,
thinking it was enough to pierce him.

1721
03:19:18,947 --> 03:19:21,191
But you failed.

1722
03:19:33,823 --> 03:19:35,983
It was I who did it!

1723
03:20:07,061 --> 03:20:09,047
It's all over!

1724
03:20:10,847 --> 03:20:13,326
It finished as it had to.

1725
03:20:19,737 --> 03:20:21,949
I stabbed you myself!

1726
03:20:24,578 --> 03:20:28,117
Noe has won the game
of love between three women.

1727
03:20:28,995 --> 03:20:30,624
At the same time,

1728
03:20:31,353 --> 03:20:34,384
you have taken the place of my wife Yasuko.

1729
03:20:35,139 --> 03:20:37,800
The position that you hate the most.

1730
03:20:48,128 --> 03:20:50,830
The grudge of another woman...

1731
03:20:50,938 --> 03:20:53,912
is no reason for a woman to kill a man.

1732
03:21:04,397 --> 03:21:07,338
It wasn't a man that you killed...

1733
03:21:09,133 --> 03:21:10,599
It was...

1734
03:21:12,218 --> 03:21:13,494
Yes.

1735
03:21:15,004 --> 03:21:17,555
It wasn't a man that I killed.

1736
03:21:18,097 --> 03:21:20,178
It was only Ôsugi.

1737
03:21:21,343 --> 03:21:24,875
Don't die! Open your eyes!
Why must you die?

1738
03:21:54,417 --> 03:21:56,522
Tell my comrades:

1739
03:21:57,880 --> 03:22:01,319
On November 7th, 1916,

1740
03:22:02,105 --> 03:22:05,602
Sakae Ôsugi was
killed at the hand of Noe Itô.

1741
03:22:06,972 --> 03:22:11,161
Ôsugi the anarchist
died the only death he deserved.

1742
03:22:24,573 --> 03:22:25,892
Blue...

1743
03:22:27,561 --> 03:22:29,610
I see the blue sky...

1744
03:22:31,747 --> 03:22:34,454
And many black chimneys...

1745
03:22:39,964 --> 03:22:42,008
And, bright as gold,

1746
03:22:43,133 --> 03:22:45,765
strands of wheat swaying in the wind!

1747
03:22:49,026 --> 03:22:50,630
I see it!

1748
03:22:51,039 --> 03:22:53,172
I see everything!

1749
03:22:53,996 --> 03:22:56,693
Even that which can't be seen!

1750
03:23:04,582 --> 03:23:06,139
My love...

1751
03:23:06,531 --> 03:23:09,094
My three loves...

1752
03:23:10,578 --> 03:23:12,281
The revolution!

1753
03:23:12,982 --> 03:23:17,381
The revolution that
brings about its own nullification.

1754
03:23:17,960 --> 03:23:19,391
The truth!

1755
03:23:28,410 --> 03:23:30,627
Noe has stabbed me.

1756
03:23:32,224 --> 03:23:34,180
She ran me through.

1757
03:23:51,660 --> 03:23:52,995
No...

1758
03:23:53,669 --> 03:23:55,678
Noe was able to do it...

1759
03:23:56,957 --> 03:23:59,058
only because she is pregnant.

1760
03:24:00,503 --> 03:24:03,984
Ôsugi's child is
beginning to grow inside her.

1761
03:24:04,131 --> 03:24:06,707
You thought that I didn't know?

1762
03:24:15,911 --> 03:24:18,041
Stupid woman!

1763
03:24:55,558 --> 03:24:57,489
Sleep well...

1764
03:24:57,893 --> 03:25:00,327
You who were mine.

1765
03:25:02,982 --> 03:25:05,711
There was nothing else I could do!

1766
03:25:07,181 --> 03:25:09,738
You understand, right?

1767
03:25:13,075 --> 03:25:15,748
I will be free of you.

1768
03:25:16,829 --> 03:25:18,928
I came back to tell you this.

1769
03:25:21,292 --> 03:25:23,028
At this moment,

1770
03:25:24,378 --> 03:25:26,728
there was no other way

1771
03:25:27,419 --> 03:25:29,450
to go beyond you.

1772
03:25:47,860 --> 03:25:50,070
You must not die!

1773
03:26:15,888 --> 03:26:17,417
One day,

1774
03:26:18,307 --> 03:26:20,998
you pierced me like the wind.

1775
03:26:22,070 --> 03:26:25,046
With that wound, I understood freedom.

1776
03:26:27,233 --> 03:26:32,079
But I knew that one day or another,
I would become your prisoner.

1777
03:26:32,613 --> 03:26:36,287
That's why I needed my turn to pierce you.

1778
03:26:44,416 --> 03:26:47,888
I wanted more freedom... More freedom...

1779
03:26:49,504 --> 03:26:51,086
He's dead.

1780
03:26:51,715 --> 03:26:53,627
He's really dead.

1781
03:26:58,556 --> 03:27:00,200
Ôsugi...

1782
03:27:03,686 --> 03:27:05,998
Say something! Anything!

1783
03:27:16,972 --> 03:27:20,055
What should I say if I'm dead?

1784
03:27:22,705 --> 03:27:24,785
Quick, call a doctor.

1785
03:27:51,817 --> 03:27:54,637
Ôsugi narrowly escaped death that day.

1786
03:27:54,638 --> 03:27:59,707
So, why did Itsuko Masaoka confess,
if she didn't stab him?

1787
03:27:59,708 --> 03:28:01,048
She confessed?

1788
03:28:01,049 --> 03:28:03,800
Soon afterwards, at Scotland Yard.

1789
03:28:03,801 --> 03:28:05,650
She chose to go to prison.

1790
03:28:05,651 --> 03:28:07,348
Is that what you think?

1791
03:28:07,349 --> 03:28:09,002
It's simple:

1792
03:28:09,003 --> 03:28:11,821
Noe organized an imaginary crime.

1793
03:28:11,822 --> 03:28:13,443
In order to win,

1794
03:28:13,444 --> 03:28:16,823
Itsuko committed the
real crime and went to prison.

1795
03:28:19,678 --> 03:28:20,943
That's all.

1796
03:28:20,944 --> 03:28:23,323
To win? Is winning that important?

1797
03:28:23,324 --> 03:28:24,566
I don't know.

1798
03:28:24,567 --> 03:28:26,318
Is there anything else?

1799
03:28:26,319 --> 03:28:28,941
If so, all this didn't even happen.

1800
03:31:26,699 --> 03:31:27,821
Noe!

1801
03:31:28,274 --> 03:31:31,388
When you were massacred,
what really happened?

1802
03:31:31,793 --> 03:31:33,190
Do you know?

1803
03:32:04,573 --> 03:32:15,633
<i>Spring, March, survivors of the massacre,
We dance among the flowers</i>

1804
03:33:44,685 --> 03:33:51,927
<i>Spring, March, survivors of the massacre,
We dance among the flowers</i>

1805
03:33:58,100 --> 03:33:59,473
Lights!

1806
03:34:00,817 --> 03:34:02,303
Action!

1807
03:34:32,843 --> 03:34:36,693
This photo will be a great
monument for future generations.

1808
03:34:42,144 --> 03:34:44,908
Please look at the camera, everyone.

1809
03:34:59,662 --> 03:35:01,603
Thank you very much.

1810
03:35:47,113 --> 03:35:50,537
Someone lost his ears
getting them stuck in this door.

1811
03:35:51,357 --> 03:35:53,028
His ears?

1812
03:35:53,382 --> 03:35:56,092
So, can he hear himself crying?

1813
03:36:10,863 --> 03:36:22,249
EROS + MASSACRE
