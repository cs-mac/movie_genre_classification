1
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:43,393
<i>My father's name was John Kinsella.</i>
<i>It's an Irish name.</i>

2
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:46,270
<i>He was born in North Dakota in 1896...</i>

3
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:47,939
<i>...and never saw a big city...</i>

4
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:51,317
<i>...until he came back from France in 1918.</i>

5
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:55,863
<i>He settled in Chicago, where he learned</i>
<i>to live and die with the White Sox.</i>

6
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:59,283
<i>Died a little</i>
<i>when they lost the 1919 World Series...</i>

7
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:02,745
<i>...died a lot the following summer</i>
<i>when eight teammates...</i>

8
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,123
<i>...were accused of throwing that Series.</i>

9
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:08,710
<i>He played some in the minors,</i>
<i>but nothing came of it.</i>

10
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:11,212
<i>Moved to Brooklyn in '35...</i>

11
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:13,548
<i>...married Mom in '38...</i>

12
00:02:13,673 --> 00:02:16,175
<i>...was already an old man</i>
<i>at the naval yards...</i>

13
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:18,386
<i>...when I was born in 1952.</i>

14
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:21,222
<i>My name's Ray Kinsella.</i>

15
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:26,060
<i>Mom died when I was 3,</i>
<i>and I suppose Dad did the best he could.</i>

16
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:31,482
<i>Instead of Mother Goose, I was put to bed</i>
<i>to stories of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...</i>

17
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:34,152
<i>...and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson.</i>

18
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:38,489
<i>Dad was a Yankees fan then,</i>
<i>so I rooted for Brooklyn.</i>

19
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:43,327
<i>But in '58, the Dodgers moved away,</i>
<i>so we had to find other reasons to fight.</i>

20
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:44,579
<i>We did.</i>

21
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,789
<i>When it came time to go to college...</i>

22
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:49,292
<i>...I picked the farthest</i>
<i>from home I could find.</i>

23
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:54,672
<i>This drove him up the wall,</i>
<i>which, I suppose, was the point.</i>

24
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:59,302
<i>Officially my major was English,</i>
<i>but really it was the '60s.</i>

25
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:02,180
<i>I marched, I smoked some grass...</i>

26
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,850
<i>...I tried to like sitar music,</i>
<i>and I met Annie.</i>

27
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:10,104
<i>The only thing we had in common</i>
<i>was that she came from Iowa...</i>

28
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,065
<i>...and I'd once heard of Iowa.</i>

29
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:15,318
<i>After graduation,</i>
<i>we moved to the Midwest...</i>

30
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:18,112
<i>...and stayed with her family</i>
<i>as long as we could.</i>

31
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:20,156
<i>Almost a full afternoon.</i>

32
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,910
<i>Annie and I got married in June of '74.</i>

33
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,120
<i>Dad died that fall.</i>

34
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:29,082
<i>A few years later, Karin was born.</i>

35
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:31,376
<i>She smelled weird,</i>
<i>but we loved her anyway.</i>

36
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:35,963
<i>Then Annie got the crazy idea</i>
<i>that she could talk me into buying a farm.</i>

37
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,677
<i>I'm 36 years old, I love my family,</i>
<i>I love baseball...</i>

38
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:43,388
<i>...and I'm about to become a farmer.</i>

39
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,224
<i>But until I heard the voice...</i>

40
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:50,019
<i>...I'd never done a crazy thing</i>
<i>in my whole life.</i>

41
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:30,685
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

42
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,999
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

43
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,217
Hey, Annie!

44
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,471
- Annie, what was that?
- What was what?

45
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,142
That voice just now. What was it?

46
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,356
We didn't hear anything.

47
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,611
All right.

48
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:28,201
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

49
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:36,793
- Okay, you must have heard that!
- Sorry.

50
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,379
Hey, come on in to dinner.

51
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,422
Let's go, pumpkin.

52
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,403
Is there a sound truck on the highway?

53
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,406
Nope. Hey, Karin, dinner's ready!

54
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:09,826
- Kids with a radio?
- Nope.

55
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:14,330
- Are you really hearing voices?
- Just one.

56
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,250
What did it say?

57
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,878
"If you build it, he will come."

58
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:27,760
- If you build what, who will come?
- He didn't say.

59
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,473
- I hate it when that happens.
- Me, too.

60
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:50,324
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

61
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:07,133
Build what? What is this?

62
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:13,639
It's okay, honey.

63
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:17,101
I'm just talking to the corn field.

64
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:23,816
<i>Anyway, I was walking</i>
<i>down along the street...</i>

65
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:26,235
<i>...and I heard this voice saying...</i>

66
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,029
<i>..."Good evening, Mr. Dowd."</i>

67
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:30,573
<i>Well, I turned around...</i>

68
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:35,286
<i>...and here was this big six-foot rabbit</i>
<i>leaning up against the lamppost.</i>

69
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:43,961
- Why did you do that? It was funny.
- Trust me. It's not funny.

70
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:46,589
The man is sick. Very sick.

71
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:49,008
Honey, get your book bag. Let's go!

72
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:53,012
I'll take her today.
I've got some errands to do in town.

73
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:54,681
Far-out.

74
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:04,107
- What if the voice calls while you're gone?
- Take a message.

75
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,901
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

76
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:08,319
'Bye.

77
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:13,116
In all those years, did you ever...

78
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:16,994
It's just I've heard
that sometimes farmers in the field...

79
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,622
They hear things. You know, voices.

80
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:23,835
- You hearing voices?
- No. It's just I heard some farmers do.

81
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,381
I, of course, don't, so I was wondering
if I was doing something wrong.

82
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,136
Did you ever hear voices out there?

83
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:36,764
- Who's hearing voices?
- Ray is. Out in the fields.

84
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,266
No, I'm not.

85
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,018
I'm...

86
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,605
Noises.

87
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,983
That darned tractor...

88
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:51,446
I'm just going to get some 3-in-1oil.
That ought to do it.

89
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:54,866
Nice talking to you.

90
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:25,438
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

91
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:28,900
All right, that's it! Who the...

92
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:32,987
Who are you? What do you want from me?

93
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:34,197
Son of a bitch.

94
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:37,658
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

95
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,204
If you build it...

96
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:51,381
If you build it...

97
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,931
...he will come.

98
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,920
You don't suppose
this is like an acid flashback?

99
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:33,339
I never took acid.

100
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:36,718
Maybe you will someday.
It's like a flash-forward.

101
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,137
Annie, there's more.

102
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,931
Honey, why don't you eat a little bit?

103
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,186
I think I know what
"If you build it, he will come" means.

104
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,981
Why do I not think
this is such a good thing?

105
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:54,902
I think it means
that if I build a baseball field out there...

106
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:59,699
...Shoeless Joe Jackson
will come back and play ball again.

107
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:02,910
You're kidding?

108
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:11,794
You're kidding.

109
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:17,216
Boy, I thought my family was crazy...

110
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,719
...but this is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

111
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:21,304
I know it's totally nuts.

112
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:25,266
- I mean, Shoeless Joe!
- He's dead. Died in '51. He's dead.

113
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:28,061
- They suspended him, right?
- Right.

114
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,773
- He's still dead?
- As far as I know.

115
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:37,612
Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing?

116
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,908
If I did, I've forgotten it.

117
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:50,708
He was supposed to be
so graceful and agile.

118
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:54,128
I'd actually like to see him play again...

119
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:57,507
...to let him play, to right an old wrong.

120
00:11:57,632 --> 00:12:00,301
Wait. Wait a minute.

121
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:07,016
- Are you actually thinking of doing this?
- No.

122
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:12,063
I can't think of one good reason
why I should, but...

123
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:24,158
I'm 36. I have a wife,
a child, and a mortgage...

124
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:27,161
...and I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.

125
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:30,540
What does he have to do with all this?

126
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:35,211
I never forgave him for getting old.

127
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:40,925
By the time he was as old as I am now...

128
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,177
...he was ancient.

129
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:50,643
He must have had dreams,
but he never did anything about them.

130
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:55,106
For all I know,
he may have even heard voices, too...

131
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:59,110
...but he sure didn't listen to them.

132
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,406
The man never did one spontaneous thing
in all the years I knew him.

133
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm afraid of that happening to me...

134
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,331
...and something tells me
this may be my last chance...

135
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,417
...to do something about it.

136
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:19,797
I want to build that field.

137
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,718
Do you think I'm crazy?

138
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:25,970
Yes.

139
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:34,896
But I also think
if you really feel you should do this...

140
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,609
...then you should do it.

141
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:57,794
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's plowing under his corn.

142
00:13:58,336 --> 00:13:59,295
Why?

143
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:09,097
Ty Cobb called him
the greatest left fielder of all time.

144
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:13,393
He said his glove
was the place where triples go to die.

145
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,895
- Could he hit?
- Could he hit?

146
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,815
Lifetime average .356,
third highest in history.

147
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:20,900
Why'd they call him "Shoeless Joe"?

148
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,277
When he was in the minors...

149
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,197
...he bought a new pair of spikes
and hurt his feet.

150
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:30,076
<i>In the 6th inning, he took them off</i>
<i>and played in his socks.</i>

151
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:34,622
<i>The players kidded him, called him</i>
<i>"Shoeless Joe" and the name stuck.</i>

152
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,208
He's going to lose his farm.

153
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,501
Damned fool.

154
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,879
<i>Then in 1919,</i>
<i>his team the Chicago White Sox...</i>

155
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,090
<i>...threw the World Series.</i>

156
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,844
- <i>What's "threw"?</i>
- <i>It means they lost it on purpose.</i>

157
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:50,013
<i>Gamblers paid them to.</i>

158
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:52,348
<i>Except Shoeless Joe.</i>

159
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:56,269
<i>He did take their money,</i>
<i>but nobody ever proved he did one thing...</i>

160
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,979
<i>...to lose those games.</i>

161
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:03,568
If he threw it, how do you explain
that he hit .375 for the Series...

162
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,486
...and committed no errors?

163
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:06,612
I can't.

164
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,282
Twelve hits including
the Series' only home run...

165
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,701
...and they said he's trying to lose?

166
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:12,952
It's ridiculous.

167
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:16,581
<i>The commissioner of baseball</i>
<i>suspended eight of the players...</i>

168
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,709
<i>...including the great Shoeless Joe</i>
<i>Jackson, for life.</i>

169
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,461
<i>What's "suspend"?</i>

170
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:25,715
<i>It means they never</i>
<i>let him play the game again.</i>

171
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,636
My father said he saw him years later...

172
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:35,058
...playing under a made-up name
in some 10th-rate league in Carolina.

173
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:38,686
He'd put on 50 pounds,
and his spring was gone from his step...

174
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,688
...but he could still hit.

175
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:44,984
Dad used to say
nobody could hit like Shoeless Joe.

176
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:49,238
I think that's the first time
I've ever seen you smile...

177
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,741
...when you mentioned your father.

178
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:08,883
I have just created something
totally illogical.

179
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,722
That's what I like about it.

180
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,018
Am I completely nuts?

181
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,481
Not completely.

182
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:27,318
It's a good baseball field, Ray.

183
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,571
It's kind of pretty, isn't it?

184
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,804
Any sign?

185
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,351
Something's going to happen out there.

186
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,562
I can feel it.

187
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,960
<i>So, for the veteran southpaw,</i>
<i>his summer of woes continues.</i>

188
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,087
<i>That's four straight hits in the inning.</i>

189
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:30,923
Daddy, what's a "southpaw"?

190
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,845
It means a left-handed pitcher, honey.

191
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:40,350
- So how bad is it?
- Well.

192
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:46,064
Considering how much less acreage
we have for corn, I say we'll probably...

193
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:49,400
...almost break even.

194
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:56,366
We used up all our savings on that field.

195
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,577
- Daddy?
- Just a minute, Karin.

196
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:07,293
So what are you saying?
We can't keep the field?

197
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:12,799
Makes it real hard to keep the farm.

198
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,681
- Daddy.
- In a minute, Karin!

199
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,017
There's a man out there on your lawn.

200
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:14,360
I'll put up some coffee.
Why don't you go on outside?

201
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,563
Sorry.

202
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,402
I'll get some out there.

203
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,225
Hi.

204
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,479
Ray Kinsella.

205
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,274
Joe Jackson.

206
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:29,347
I bet it's good to be playing again.

207
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:38,606
Getting thrown out of baseball...

208
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,944
...was like having part of me amputated.

209
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,156
I've heard that old men wake up...

210
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:51,369
...and scratch itchy legs
that have been dust for over 50 years.

211
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,705
That was me.

212
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,291
I'd wake up at night...

213
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,504
...with the smell
of the ballpark in my nose...

214
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,383
...with the cool of the grass on my feet...

215
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,762
...the thrill of the grass.

216

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,980
Can you pitch?

217
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,108
Yeah.

218
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,028
Not bad.

219
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,630
- Don't we need a catcher?
- Not if you get it near the plate.

220
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:47,800
Right.

221
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,940
I'm pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.

222
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,076
Nice hit.

223
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,009
See if you can hit my curve.

224
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,107
- You can hit the curve ball.
- Put one right here.

225
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:47,443
Right.

226
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,418
Right, you're a low-ball hitter.

227
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,295
Man, I did love this game.

228
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:11,050
I'd have played for food money.

229
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:16,139
It was the game, the sounds, the smells.

230
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:22,812
Did you ever hold a ball
or a glove to your face?

231
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:24,897
Yeah.

232
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:29,402
I used to love traveling on the trains
from town to town.

233
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,241
The hotels, brass spittoons in the lobbies...

234
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,702
...brass beds in the rooms.

235
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,791
It was the crowd...

236
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,713
...rising to their feet
when the ball was hit deep.

237
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:57,930
I'd play for nothing.

238
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,315
It's my family.

239
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,779
What's with the lights?

240
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,199
All the stadiums have them now.

241
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,952
- Even Wrigley Field.
- It's harder to see the ball.

242
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,706
The owners found that more people
can attend night games.

243
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,541
Owners.

244
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,684
Mr. Jackson, this is my wife Annie
and my daughter Karin.

245
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,644
Ma'am.

246
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,314
Are you a ghost?

247
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:53,486
- She's kidding.
- That's okay.

248
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,616
- What do you think?
- You look real to me.

249
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,785
Then I guess I'm real.

250
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:03,830
Would you like to come inside?

251
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,000
Thanks. I don't think I can.

252
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:17,677
Can I come back again?

253
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,598
Yeah. I built this for you.

254
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,646
There are others, you know.

255
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:33,609
There were eight of us.
It would really mean a lot to them.

256
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:38,823
Yeah. Anytime. They're all welcome here.

257
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,377
Is this heaven?

258
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:53,921
No.

259
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,091
It's Iowa.

260
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,477
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

261
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,949
We're keeping this field.

262
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,370
You bet your ass we are.

263
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:31,417
- You're going to lose your farm, pal.
- How can you lose something so big?

264
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:35,129
- He misplaced the house once.
- Yeah, but it turned up two days later.

265
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,882
Come on. Ray?

266
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:41,386
This stupid baseball field will bankrupt you.
Everybody knows it.

267
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,972
If you default on your loan,
you'll lose everything.

268
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,934
If you sell now,
my partners will give you a fair price.

269
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,813
- Thanks, Mark, but no.
- No.

270
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,774
What are you holding onto this place for?

271
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,069
- You never liked Iowa.
- That's not true.

272
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,698
You never liked farming. It is true.
You don't know about farming.

273
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,742
I know a lot about farming.
More than you think.

274
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:08,079
Well, then how could you plow
under your major crop?

275
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,498
What's a crop?

276
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,004
- Come on. That is funny.
- "What's a crop?"

277
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,633
- Daddy, the baseball game is on.
- Excuse us.

278
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,303
Excuse us.

279
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,019
Annie, I don't believe this guy.

280
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,105
I'm trying to bail him out,
and he leaves to watch television.

281
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,025
- He used to be so normal.
- Yeah.

282
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,822
Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!

283
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,241
All right!

284
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,411
Watch Joe's feet.

285
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:35,208
A good left fielder
knows what pitch is coming.

286
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,379
He can tell from the bat's angle
which way the ball's heading.

287
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,843
- Show off!
- Stick it in your ear, Gandil.

288
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,057
If you'd have run like that against Detroit,
I'd have won 20 games that year!

289
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,436
For Pete's sakes, Cicotte,
that was 68 years ago. Give it up!

290
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,816
Hey! You guys want to play ball or what?

291
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,903
- Muscle-bound jerk.
- Oh, yeah? At least I got muscles.

292
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:08,366
- At most, you got muscles.
- Come on, asshole! Pitch!

293
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,910
Weaver, be nice.

294
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,376
- Sorry, kid!
- It's okay. I don't mind.

295
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,879
- All right, Karin.
- Hey, hey, hey!

296
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,770
Mom and everybody are leaving now.

297
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,818
Oh, well, it was...
You know. Thanks for coming.

298
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,906
Think about what I said.
I'm just trying to help.

299
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,408
I know.

300
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,785
Thought you were watching some game.

301
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,414
It's not really a game.
It's more like practice.

302
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,172
There are only eight of them.
They can't play a real game.

303
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,554
- Eight of what?
- Them.

304
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,101
- Who "them"?
- Them them.

305
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,689
- You don't see them?
- Karin, honey, what are you watching?

306
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,568
- The baseball men.
- Baseball men?

307
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,408
- Do you see the baseball men right now?
- Of course, I do.

308
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,955
You really don't see them?

309
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,377
I don't think it's very polite
to try to make other people feel stupid.

310
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,589
Mom, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

311
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,842
Dee, wait. You don't see these people?

312
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,678
It's not funny, Annie.

313
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,360
They couldn't see it.

314
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,780
This is really interesting.

315
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,285
Hey, Ray, look at this.

316
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,997
68 years since I wore this uniform,
still fits me like a glove.

317
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,418
You must keep in pretty good shape.

318
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,462
Now let's see, I died in '70.

319
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,216
That means I haven't had
a cigarette in 18 years.

320
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,927
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No.

321
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,681
Karin! Ray! Dinner!

322
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,018
"Ray, dinner."

323
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,355
- All right.
- Come on. Let's hit the showers.

324
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,399
See you later.

325
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,114
See you, guys.

326
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,623
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"

327
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,126
Come on, you knucklehead.

328
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,047
That is so cool.

329
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,596
- <i>Ease his pain.</i>
- What?

330
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,851
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't understand. What?

331
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,562
<i>Ease his pain.</i>

332
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,400
"Ease his pain."
What the hell does that mean?

333
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,111
"Ease his pain"? What pain?

334
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,031
All right. Whose pain?

335
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,747
Thanks a lot.

336
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,917
Thanks a lot.

337
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,636
Come on, honey, wash up.
We got the PTA meeting after dinner.

338
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,680
They're talking about banning books again.

339
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:03,643
Really subversive books like
<i>The Wizard of Oz, The Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

340
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,479
- What happened to you?
- The voice is back.

341
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:10,525
Oh, Lord! You don't have to build
a football field now, do you?

342
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,527
He said, "Ease his pain."

343
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:16,280
- Ease whose pain?
- I asked him. He wouldn't tell me.

344
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,033
- Shoeless Joe's?
- I don't think so.

345
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,745
- One of the other players?
- I don't think so.

346
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,458
This is a very nonspecific voice out there,
and he's starting to piss me off.

347
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,964
I was having a fun day today. A good day.

348
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,841
Want a fry?

349
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:45,935
And I say smut and filth like this
has no place in our schools.

350
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,526
Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain.

351
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,322
Mrs. Kessinik, that book
you're waving about is hardly smut.

352
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:03,327
It's considered by many critics
to be the classic novel about the 1960s.

353
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,707
- It's pornography!
- No. The Supreme Court says it's not.

354
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,960
- And it's author, Mr. Mann...
- Is sick!

355
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,588
Terence Mann is a Pulitzer Prize winner.

356
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:17,175
He's widely regarded
as the finest satirist of his time.

357
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,762
Yeah, well, I think he's a pervert!
Probably a communist, too!

358
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,140
What planet are these people from?

359
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,769
The so-called novels of Terence Mann...

360
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,064
...endorse promiscuity, godlessness...

361
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,693
...the mongrelization of the races,
and disrespect to high-ranking officers...

362
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,820
...of the United States Army.

363
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,616
And that's why
right-thinking school boards...

364
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:46,329
...all across the country
have been banning this man's s-h-i-t...

365
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,831
...since 1969.

366
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,627
Terence Mann?

367
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,094
You know why he stopped writing books?
Because he masturbates.

368
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,056
Excuse me, madam.

369
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,892
Excuse me.

370
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,731
Terence Mann was a warm
and gentle voice of reason...

371
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,441
...during a time of great madness.

372
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,321
He coined the phrase,
"Make love, not war."

373
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,410
While other people chanted, "Burn,
baby, burn," he was talking about love...

374
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,453
...and peace and understanding.

375
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,250
I cherished every one of his books,
and I dearly wish he had written more.

376
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:37,255
Maybe if you had experienced
even a little bit of the '60s...

377
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,133
...you might feel the same way, too.

378
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,054
I experienced the '60s.

379
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,559
No, you had two '50s
and moved right into the '70s.

380
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,853
Annie, look at this.

381
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,274
Your husband plowed under his corn
and built a baseball field.

382
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:02,780
- Now, there's an intelligent response.
- The weirdo.

383
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,952
- Annie.
- Honey, it's all right. I'll be cool.

384
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,665
At least he is not a book-burner,
you Nazi cow.

385
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,547
At least I'm not married to the biggest
horse's ass in three counties.

386
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,467
All right, Beulah,
do you want to step outside?

387
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,635
Fine!

388
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:33,561
All right, I've got a better idea.
Let's take a vote. Who's for Eva Braun?

389
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,813
Who wants to burn books?

390
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:41,402
Who wants to spit on the Constitution of
the United States of America? Anybody?

391
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,204
All right.
Now, who's for the Bill of Rights?

392
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,749
Who thinks freedom
is a pretty darn good thing?

393
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,670
Come on! Let's see those hands!

394
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,716
Who thinks we have to stand up...

395
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,595
...to the kind of censorship
they had under Stalin?

396
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:26,197
All right. There you go.
America, I love you. I'm proud of you.

397
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,616
- We got to go.
- We got to go.

398
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,034
This is great!

399
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,079
I figured it out.

400
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,124
Was that great, or what?

401
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,710
- I figured it out.
- It's just like the '60s again!

402
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,170
- I figured it out.
- Step outside, you Nazi cow.

403
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:46,467
- I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease.
- What?

404
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,679
I just halted the spread
of neofascism in America...

405
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,681
- Terence Mann.
- What about him?

406
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,183
- That's whose pain.
- How do you know that?

407
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,351
I just know.

408
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,729
I was right about building the field,
wasn't I?

409
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,731
- Yes. What's his pain?
- I don't know.

410
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,567
- How are you supposed to ease it?
- I don't know.

411
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,612
Look, he's my favorite writer, too...

412
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,907
...but what's Terence Mann
got to do with baseball?

413
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,397
It's incredible. By the early '70s,
the guy decides people have become...

414
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,983
...either too extremist
or too apathetic to listen.

415
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:50,073
So he stops writing books,
he starts writing poetry about whales...

416
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,493
...and then he starts fooling around
with a home computer.

417
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,495
Know what he does now?

418
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,122
He writes software
for interactive children's videos.

419
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:02,126
They teach kids
how to resolve their conflicts peacefully.

420
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,838
- God, what an amazing guy.
- What's that got to do with baseball?

421
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,758
In the April 1962 issue of <i>Jet</i> magazine...

422
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,261
...there's a story called
"This Is Not A Kite."

423
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,184
It's not his best work, but the story's hero
is named John Kinsella.

424
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,852
- My father.
- Wow.

425
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,063
What do you mean, "Wow"?

426
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,567
What should I say? Big wow!
What's it got to do with baseball?

427
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,860
You drive.

428
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,244
Okay, the last interview
he ever gave was in 1973.

429
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,205
- Guess what it's about.
- Some kind of team sport.

430
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,375
The guy was a baseball fanatic.
Listen to this:

431
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,087
"As a child, my earliest recurring dream
was to play at Ebbets Field...

432
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,506
"...with Jackie Robinson
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.

433
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,300
"Of course, it never happened.
The Dodgers left Brooklyn.

434
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:55,722
"They tore down Ebbets Field,
but even now, I still dream that dream."

435
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,306
That's sad.

436
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,770
The man wrote the best books
of his generation.

437
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,442
He was a pioneer in the civil rights
and the antiwar movement.

438
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:11,654
He made the cover of <i>Newsweek.</i>
He knew everybody. He did everything.

439
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:15,658
He helped shape his time.
The guy hung out with The Beatles.

440
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,703
It wasn't enough.
What he missed was baseball.

441
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,747
- Oh, my God!
- What?

442
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,583
As a small boy,
he had a bat named Rosebud.

443
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,668
- Give me that.
- Sorry.

444
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,964
The guy hasn't been
to a baseball game since 1958.

445
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,135
So, to ease his pain, you're supposed
to take him to a ball game.

446
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,261
Yes.

447
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,307
Ray, this is nuttier
than building the baseball field.

448
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:43,311
No, it's not. It's pretty weird,
but building the field was weirder.

449
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,937
Five, ten percent weirder.

450
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,690
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to nip this one in the bud.

451
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,069
We're having moderate to heavy
financial difficulties here.

452
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,447
You can't take off for Boston
while we're going broke in Iowa.

453
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,699
This is really new territory for us...

454
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,452
...but we're dealing
with primal forces of nature.

455
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,372
When primal forces of nature tell you
to do something...

456
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,667
...it's not prudent to quibble over details.
- Why do you have to go?

457
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,420
Why can't the voice send somebody else?
How about Shirley MacLaine?

458
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,466
Is she too busy?
What does this have to do with you?

459
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,593
That's what I have to find out.

460
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,054
We are behind on the mortgage.

461
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,307
That field ate up all of our savings.
We could lose this farm.

462
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:25,019
I won't even stay in motels.
I'll sleep in the car. I'll beg for food.

463
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,106
No. Now, this is too much.

464
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:33,778
I understand your need to prove
to yourself and to the world...

465
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,864
...you are not turning into your father,
but you have.

466
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,784
You believed in the magic.
It happened. Isn't that enough?

467
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,578
It's more than that.
I know this is totally nuts...

468
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,790
...but there's another reason
I'm supposed to do it.

469
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:50,086
I feel it as strongly as I've felt anything
in my life. There's a reason.

470
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,797
What? Just tell me what it is.

471
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:57,135
Something's going to happen at the game.
There's something at Fenway Park.

472
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,513
I got to be there
with Terence Mann to find it out.

473
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:05,601
Is Fenway the one
with the big green wall in left field?

474
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,770
Yeah.

475
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,275
I dreamt last night
you were at Fenway with Terence Mann.

476
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,903
- Was I sitting on the first base side?
- Yes.

477
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,322
About halfway up on the aisle?

478
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,950
- Yeah. Eating a hot dog.
- Eating a hot dog.

479
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:24,370
- I had the same dream.
- I'll help you pack.

480
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,108
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.

481
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,277
Hi. No.

482
00:44:56,444 --> 00:45:00,907
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
It's a great pleasure to finally get to...

483
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,951
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella. I'm a big fan of yours.

484
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,328
Hi.

485
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,877
How do you do, Mr. Mann?
I have to take you to a base...

486
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:18,132
All right, stupid,
put your hands up and get in the trunk.

487
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,051
Good.

488
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,181
He lives right around here.
Do you know him?

489
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,227
He's sort of a tall black man.
I'm a friend of his.

490
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,232
If he was much of a friend,
he'd have given you the directions himself.

491
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,153
That's a good point. Thank you.

492
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,784
I don't know where he lives.
Get away from me.

493
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:49,497
I ain't going to tell you nothing.
Go away. You're a pest.

494
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,170
Two blocks down, right-hand side.

495
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,799
First door that doesn't have
a chicken in the window is his.

496
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,384
No chicken.

497
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:47,347
Who the hell are you?

498
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,935
Sir, my name's Ray Kinsella.

499
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:17,251
- We got a learning disability here?
- If I could just have one minute, please.

500
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:22,048
I can't tell you the secret of life,
and I don't have any answers for you.

501
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,843
I don't give interviews,
and I'm no longer a public figure.

502
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:29,013
I just want to be left alone, so piss off.

503
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,974
Wait! Wait!

504
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,852
I've come 1,500 miles to see you...

505
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,606
...at the risk of losing my home
and alienating my wife.

506
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,902
All I'm asking is one minute. Please.

507
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,282
One minute.

508
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:00,712
I understand your desire for privacy...

509
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,674
...and I wouldn't intrude
if this weren't extremely important.

510
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,845
Oh, God. I don't do causes anymore.

511
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:13,391
This isn't a cause.
I don't need money or an endorsement.

512
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,059
Refreshing.

513
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,520
You once wrote, "There comes a time...

514
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,565
"...when all the cosmic tumblers
have clicked into place...

515
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,568
"...and the universe
opens itself up for a few seconds...

516
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,486
"...to show you what's possible."

517
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,990
- Oh, my God!
- What?

518
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:32,410
- You're from the '60s.
- Well, yeah. Actually...

519
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,163
Out!

520
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:38,541
Back to the '60s!
There's no place for you here in the future.

521
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,335
Get back while you still can!

522
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,049
You've changed, you know that?

523
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:50,887
Yes, I suppose I have.
How about this? Peace, love, dope.

524
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,764
Now get the hell out of here!

525
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,312
- You've really pissed me off.
- Just hold it right there.

526
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,439
I didn't want to do it this way.

527
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:47,151
- What the hell is that?
- It's a gun, what do you think it is?

528
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,862
- It's your finger.
- No, it's a gun.

529
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:53,408
- Let me see it.
- I'm not going to show you my gun.

530
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,453
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just need you to come with me...

531
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,039
What are you doing?

532
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,126
I'll beat you with a crowbar
until you go away.

533
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,503
Wait! You can't do that.

534
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:09,298
There are rules here?
Oh, no. There are no rules here.

535
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,968
You're a pacifist!

536
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,224
Shit.

537
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,893
Thank you.

538
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,440
So, what? You're kidnapping me?
What's the deal here?

539
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:32,405
I was hoping I could just convince you
to come with me.

540
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,032
So you are kidnapping me?

541
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:38,411
I have to take you to a baseball game.

542
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:40,038
You what?

543
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,708
Tonight's game. Red Sox, A's.

544
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,335
Why?

545
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,004
Something will happen there.

546
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:51,299
I don't know what,
but we'll find out when it does.

547
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,094
My name's Ray Kinsella.

548
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:59,140
You used my father's name
for a character in one of your stories.

549
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,308
John Kinsella.

550
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,686
You're seeing a whole team
of psychiatrists, aren't you?

551
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:08,358
I don't blame you for thinking that,
but no, I'm not.

552
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,528
I swear to God,
I'm the least crazy person I've ever known.

553
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,199
Why are you kidnapping me
to a baseball game?

554
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:21,162
- May I?
- Oh, please. Want a cup of coffee?

555
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:23,706
No.

556
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,750
Want some cookies?

557
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,711
No.

558
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,964
I read an interview you gave...

559
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,051
...about how you always dreamed
of playing at Ebbets Field...

560
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:38,054
...and how sad you felt
when they tore it down.

561
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:39,389
I never said that.

562
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,766
You didn't?

563
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,394
I don't even recall thinking that.

564
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,400
Weird.

565
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:58,658
This whole thing is so weird.

566
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,787
Then why go through with it?

567
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,542
It's a long story.

568
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:15,967
But it's a really good story.
I'll tell you on the way.

569
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:19,012
- I'm not getting rid of you, am I?
- No.

570
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:23,516
If you come to this game with me,
I swear I'll never bother you again.

571
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,144
Not even a Christmas card.

572
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:37,196
So what do you do with yourself
these days?

573
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,533
I live, I work. I learned how to cook.

574
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:44,203
I take walks and watch sunsets.

575
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,498
Don't you miss being involved?

576
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:51,085
I was the East Coast distributor
of involved.

577
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,422
I ate it and drank it and breathed it.

578
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:57,383
Then they killed Martin, and Bobby...

579
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,511
...they elected Tricky Dick twice...

580
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,389
...and now people like you think
I must be miserable...

581
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,934
...because I'm not involved anymore.
I've got news for you.

582
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,437
I spent all my misery years ago.

583
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,649
I have no more pain left for any of you.
I gave at the office.

584
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,236
So what do you want?

585
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:20,239
I want them to stop
looking to me for answers...

586
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:23,618
...begging me to speak again,
write again, be a leader.

587
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,162
I want them to start thinking
for themselves.

588
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,164
And I want my privacy.

589
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:32,627
No, I meant what do you want?

590
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:41,135
Dog and a beer.

591
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:46,307
- Two.
- $7.

592
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,434
Okay, I understand you.

593
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,145
You should be entitled
to as much privacy as you want.

594
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,231
But why stop writing?

595
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,195
I haven't published a word in 17 years,
and still I have to endure lunatics like you.

596
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,907
What do you think would happen
if I suddenly came out with a new book?

597
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:04,867
They'd bleed me dry.

598
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,217
<i>Go the distance.</i>

599
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,686
<i>Go the distance.</i>

600
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,623
What's the matter?

601
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:59,380
- You didn't see that?
- See what?

602
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:08,931
I'm sorry.
I guess you didn't have to be here.

603
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:10,224
What?

604
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:15,980
Whenever you want to go, we can go.

605
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:18,191
Fine. Let's go.

606
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:07,156
What is it you're not telling me?

607
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:11,202
I've already taken up
too much of your time.

608
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,299
I wish I had your passion.

609
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:29,220
Misdirected though it might be,
it is still a passion.

610
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:32,473
I used to feel that way about things, but...

611
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,063
- You got another message, didn't you?
- You'll think I'm crazy.

612
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:42,191
I already think you're crazy.
What did it say?

613
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,990
It said, "The man's done enough.
Leave him alone."

614
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,095
Moonlight Graham.

615
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,891
- You saw it.
- Saw what?

616
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:20,313
You saw it. New York Giants, 1922.
He played one game. He never got to bat.

617
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:22,023
- You saw it!
- What did I see?

618
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:23,858
Chisholm, Minnesota.

619
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:27,570
We were the only ones who saw it.
Did you hear the voice, too?

620
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,905
It's all right to admit it.

621
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:31,532
It's what told me to find you.
Did you hear it?

622
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:35,411
"Go the distance"?

623
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:40,833
- Yes. Do you know what it means?
- Yes.

624
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,001
What?

625
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:45,463
It means we're going to Minnesota
to find Moonlight Graham.

626
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:48,633
- We're going... We?
- I must be out of my mind.

627
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:53,262
- What do we do when we find him?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

628
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,723
That's right. You're right.

629
00:57:57,308 --> 00:58:00,895
- This is so bitchin'.
- I don't believe I'm doing this.

630
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,000
<i>Hey, Annie, guess what?</i>
<i>I'm with Terence Mann.</i>

631
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:24,127
<i>Oh, my God. You kidnapped him.</i>

632
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,671
<i>No, I didn't. He wanted to.</i>

633
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:30,174
<i>I'm really sorry,</i>
<i>but I'm going to be a few days longer.</i>

634
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,759
<i>We're going to Minnesota.</i>

635
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:34,637
<i>I don't believe this. What's in Minnesota?</i>

636
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:37,598
An old ballplayer.
I'll explain when I get home.

637
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:40,601
- How are things with you?
- <i>Fine.</i>

638
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:43,771
Great. Look, Ann, I got to go, okay?

639
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:47,942
Give Karin a hug for me, and I love you.

640
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,861
I love you, too.

641
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:53,406
Someday explain all this to me, okay?

642
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,825
<i>I'll try. Bye-bye.</i>

643
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,035
'Bye.

644
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,543
Why didn't you tell him?

645
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:10,840
You got no choice in the matter.

646
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,558
Half a dozen Grahams.
No Archibald. No Moonlight.

647
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,603
Follow me.

648
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:36,866
Hello.

649
00:59:38,368 --> 00:59:40,161
Excuse me. Maybe you can help us.

650
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:43,206
We're looking for an ex-baseball player,
Archibald Graham.

651
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:47,377
- Oh, you mean Doc Graham.
- No, I think his nickname was "Moonlight."

652
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:50,463
- That's Dr. Graham.
- Dr. Graham?

653
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:54,967
His baseball career never amounted
to much, so he went back to school.

654
00:59:55,093 --> 00:59:56,427
His father was a doctor.

655
00:59:56,803 --> 01:00:01,641
- Do you know where we can find him?
- It's nothing bad. We're not from the IRS.

656
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:06,771
Doc Graham is dead. He died in 1972.

657
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:13,986
"At times children could not afford
eyeglasses or milk or clothing.

658
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:17,573
"Yet no child was ever denied
these essentials...

659
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:20,743
"...because, in the background,
there was always Dr. Graham.

660
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:25,123
"Without any fanfare or publicity,
the glasses or the milk...

661
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:30,211
"...or the ticket to the ball game
found their way into the child's pocket."

662
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:34,173
- You wrote that.
- The day he died.

663
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,675
Can I see that?

664
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,345
- You're a good writer.
- So are you.

665
01:00:44,976 --> 01:00:46,644
Something's missing.

666
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:51,441
He sounds like he was a wonderful man.

667
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:55,903
Half the towns in North America
have a Doc Graham.

668
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:59,991
Why do we have to travel halfway
across the country to find this one...

669
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:02,660
...sixteen years after he died?

670
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:05,288
There's got to be more.

671
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,211
What else?

672
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,298
He always wore an overcoat...

673
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:19,135
...he had white hair,
and he always carried an umbrella.

674
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,636
What was the umbrella for?

675
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,265
I think it got to be a habit,
something to hang on to.

676
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:28,770
If you asked him, he said he used it
to beat away his lady admirers.

677
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:30,438
Tell me about his wife.

678
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,523
Alicia.

679
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:38,112
She moved to South Carolina
after Doc passed.

680
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,783
She passed a couple years later.

681
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:44,660
She always wore blue.

682
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:50,166
The shopkeepers in town
would stock blue hats...

683
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:55,338
...because they knew if Doc walked by,
he'd buy one.

684
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,009
When they cleaned out his office...

685
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,970
...they found boxes of blue hats...

686
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:07,642
...that he never got around to give her.

687
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:09,686
I'll bet you didn't know that.

688
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,939
No, I didn't.

689
01:02:15,692 --> 01:02:20,530
No screwing, no drinking,
no opium, no midnight abortions.

690
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:25,410
No illegitimate children, no shady finances.

691
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:28,162
You sound disappointed.

692
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:32,750
Shoeless Joe had a problem.
That's why he needed you.

693
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:35,086
This guy doesn't need us.

694
01:02:39,007 --> 01:02:41,217
Do you know you're missing?

695
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,056
Oh, God.

696
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:52,687
"His father, who lives in Baltimore,
notified police after receiving...

697
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:55,857
"...no answer to repeated telephone calls."
Shoot.

698
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:57,942
I better call him.

699
01:02:58,401 --> 01:03:01,195
- You want me to...
- Thanks.

700
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,580
I'm taking a walk. Be back in a while.

701
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:18,296
What do I tell him?

702
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:46,991
"This year's"?

703
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:30,785
Dr. Graham?

704
01:04:39,502 --> 01:04:40,837
Dr. Graham?

705
01:04:45,341 --> 01:04:48,219
My name's Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa.

706
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,598
Are you Moonlight Graham?

707
01:04:57,979 --> 01:05:01,232
No one's called me Moonlight Graham
in 50 years.

708
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:05,737
I've come a very long way to see you.

709
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:09,782
I couldn't sleep tonight.
Usually I sleep like a baby.

710
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,076
I told Alicia I was going to take a walk.

711
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:18,374
Do you mind if I join you?
I'd like to talk to you.

712
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,377
Let's walk over to my office.

713
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:25,340
What do you want to talk to me about?

714
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:29,510
When you got to the majors,
you played only one inning of one game.

715
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:31,637
What happened with you?

716
01:05:32,597 --> 01:05:34,849
It was the last day of the season.

717
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:37,352
Bottom of the eighth inning,
we were way ahead.

718
01:05:37,477 --> 01:05:41,689
I'd been up with the club for three weeks,
but I hadn't seen any action.

719
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:45,151
Suddenly old John McGraw
points a bony finger in my direction...

720
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,195
...and he says, "Right field."

721
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:51,032
I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring.

722
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:55,119
Grabbed my glove, and ran out on the field.

723
01:05:57,747 --> 01:05:59,832
Did you get to make a play?

724
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:02,877
They never hit the ball out of the infield.

725
01:06:04,379 --> 01:06:07,131
The game ended. The season was over.

726
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:10,093
I knew they'd send me back down.

727
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:13,930
I couldn't bear the thought
of another year in the minors.

728
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:17,100
So I decided to hang them up.

729
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:22,188
- Go on. Sit down.
- Thank you.

730
01:06:24,399 --> 01:06:26,317
So what was that like?

731
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:31,739
It was like coming this close
to your dreams...

732
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:35,993
...and then watching them brush past you,
like a stranger in a crowd.

733
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:37,954
At the time, you don't think much of it.

734
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,582
We don't recognize our most significant
moments while they're happening.

735
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:45,586
Back then I thought,
"Well, there'll be other days."

736
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:48,715
I didn't realize that was the only day.

737
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:53,845
And now, I want to ask you a question.

738
01:06:54,846 --> 01:06:59,267
What's so interesting about half an inning
that would make you come from Iowa...

739
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:02,228
...to talk to me about it
50 years after it happened.

740
01:07:03,771 --> 01:07:06,482
I didn't really know till just now...

741
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:11,571
...but I think it's to ask you,
if you could do anything you wanted...

742
01:07:11,738 --> 01:07:14,115
...if you could have a wish...

743
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:21,122
And you're the kind of man
who could grant me that wish?

744
01:07:22,457 --> 01:07:25,126
I don't know. I'm just asking.

745
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:31,174
You know,
I never got to bat in the major leagues.

746
01:07:31,466 --> 01:07:34,344
I'd have liked to have had that chance,
just once...

747
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:36,888
...to stare down a big-league pitcher.

748
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:41,309
Stare him down,
then just as he goes into his windup, wink.

749
01:07:41,893 --> 01:07:44,312
Make him think you know
something he doesn't.

750
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,147
That's what I wish for.

751
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:50,193
The chance to squint at a sky so blue
that it hurts your eyes to look at it.

752
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:53,237
To feel the tingle in your arms
as you connect with the ball.

753
01:07:53,363 --> 01:07:55,907
To run the bases,
stretch a double into a triple...

754
01:07:56,032 --> 01:07:58,701
...and flop face first into third.

755
01:07:58,868 --> 01:08:01,204
Wrap your arms around the bag.

756
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:02,955
That's my wish.

757
01:08:06,376 --> 01:08:09,462
Is there enough magic out there
in the moonlight...

758
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,297
...to make this dream come true?

759
01:08:12,048 --> 01:08:16,969
- What would you say if I said yes?
- I think I'd actually believe you.

760
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:22,016
There's a place
where things like that happen...

761
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:24,686
...and if you want to go, I can take you.

762
01:08:29,357 --> 01:08:32,360
This is my most special place
in all the world.

763
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:37,115
Once a place touches you like this,
the wind never blows so cold again.

764
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:42,161
You feel for it. Like it was your child.

765
01:08:43,955 --> 01:08:45,415
I can't leave Chisholm.

766
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:49,293
I understand. I do.

767
01:08:51,671 --> 01:08:55,341
But I really think
you're supposed to come with us.

768
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,385
No.

769
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:01,973
But your wish?

770
01:09:03,516 --> 01:09:05,351
It'll have to stay a wish.

771
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:09,731
I was born here, I lived here,
I'll die here, but no regrets.

772
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:15,361
Fifty years ago, for five minutes,
you came this close.

773
01:09:15,862 --> 01:09:20,533
It would kill some men to get that close
to their dream and not touch it.

774
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:23,119
They'd consider it a tragedy.

775
01:09:23,453 --> 01:09:27,290
Son, if I'd only gotten to be a doctor
for five minutes...

776
01:09:27,665 --> 01:09:29,625
...now that would have been a tragedy.

777
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:37,759
I better be getting home.
Alicia will think I got a girlfriend.

778
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:40,428
And he smiled.

779
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:47,101
And then I figured, maybe we're not
supposed to take him with us.

780
01:09:47,435 --> 01:09:48,895
I don't know.

781
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:53,649
I don't know why in the hell
we were supposed to come here.

782
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:57,570
Maybe it's to find out
if one inning can change the world.

783
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:01,282
- Think it did?
- It did for these people.

784
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:05,036
If he'd gotten a hit,
he might have stayed in baseball.

785
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:07,080
I don't know.

786
01:10:08,122 --> 01:10:11,584
Your wife called before.
She wants you to call her tonight.

787
01:10:19,634 --> 01:10:22,387
I'm fine. I'm just so glad it's you.

788
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:26,641
Listen, I talked to the bank...

789
01:10:26,766 --> 01:10:30,269
...and I asked them
if we could miss a payment or two...

790
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:34,399
...and they told me that they had just sold
the note on the farm...

791
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:37,944
...to Mark and his partners.

792
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:40,947
Right. So they own the paper now.

793
01:10:41,072 --> 01:10:45,034
He says if we don't sell to them,
they're going to foreclose.

794
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:49,288
We don't have the money.

795
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:55,044
Look, I've got to take Mr. Mann
back to Boston first.

796
01:10:55,336 --> 01:10:58,339
- No.
- Wait a second.

797
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:00,591
I'm going to Iowa with you.

798
01:11:04,637 --> 01:11:05,888
We're coming home.

799
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:13,479
Hell, I can't quit now.
I got to see this ball park.

800
01:11:14,147 --> 01:11:16,816
Not everyone can see it. You might not.

801
01:11:17,859 --> 01:11:19,444
Give it a try.

802
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:27,577
I need all the karma I can get right now.

803
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:37,545
- Thanks. You're the first car by.
- How far you going?

804
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,089
- How far you going?
- Iowa.

805
01:11:40,298 --> 01:11:44,260
If it's okay, I'll just ride along a while.
I play baseball.

806
01:11:46,054 --> 01:11:48,056
- Hop in.
- All right.

807
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:58,483
I'm looking for a place to play.

808
01:11:58,566 --> 01:12:02,320
I heard that all through the Midwest,
they have towns with teams.

809
01:12:02,445 --> 01:12:05,823
And in some places,
they'll even find you a day job...

810
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:08,368
...so you can play ball
nights and weekends.

811
01:12:08,493 --> 01:12:12,914
This is your lucky day, kid.
We're going someplace kind of like that.

812
01:12:13,581 --> 01:12:14,874
All right.

813
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:19,545
- I'm Ray Kinsella. This is Terence Mann.
- Hi.

814
01:12:19,671 --> 01:12:21,464
I'm Archie Graham.

815
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:37,355
It's funny the way he described towns
finding you a job...

816
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:42,276
...so that you could play on their team.
They haven't done that for years.

817
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:46,155
My dad did that for a while,
but that was in the '20s.

818
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:48,116
What happened to your father?

819
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:50,493
He never made it as a ballplayer...

820
01:12:50,618 --> 01:12:53,746
...so he tried to get his son
to make it for him.

821
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,915
By the time I was 10, playing baseball...

822
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,711
...got to be like eating vegetables
or taking out the garbage.

823
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:03,089
So when I was 14, I started to refuse.

824
01:13:04,215 --> 01:13:06,134
Can you believe that?

825
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,387
American boy refusing to have a catch
with his father?

826
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:10,930
Why 14?

827
01:13:13,099 --> 01:13:15,560
That's when I read <i>The Boat Rocker</i>
by Terence Mann.

828
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:16,728
God!

829
01:13:17,103 --> 01:13:18,771
I never played catch with him again.

830
01:13:18,855 --> 01:13:21,232
That's the kind of crap
people always lay on me.

831
01:13:21,357 --> 01:13:23,776
It's not my fault
you wouldn't play catch with him.

832
01:13:23,901 --> 01:13:25,111
I know.

833
01:13:27,989 --> 01:13:30,074
Anyway, when I was 17...

834
01:13:31,242 --> 01:13:34,746
...I packed my things,
said something awful, and left.

835
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:39,000
After a while, I wanted to come home,
but I didn't know how.

836
01:13:40,043 --> 01:13:42,754
Made it back for the funeral, though.

837
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:55,558
What was the awful thing you said?

838
01:13:57,101 --> 01:13:58,686
To your father?

839
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:06,152
I said I could never respect a man
whose hero was a criminal.

840
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:09,238
Who was his hero?

841
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:11,991
Shoeless Joe Jackson.

842
01:14:14,494 --> 01:14:18,498
You knew he wasn't a criminal.
Then why did you say it?

843
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,001
I was 17.

844
01:14:26,339 --> 01:14:29,717
The son of a bitch died
before I could take it back.

845
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:32,887
Before I could tell him...

846
01:14:34,347 --> 01:14:35,765
...you know.

847
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:40,228
He never met my wife.

848
01:14:42,063 --> 01:14:44,065
He never saw his granddaughter.

849
01:14:45,942 --> 01:14:47,819
This is your penance.

850
01:14:48,486 --> 01:14:52,198
I know. I can't bring my father back.

851
01:14:52,365 --> 01:14:55,493
So the least you can do
is bring back his hero.

852
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:57,829
Well...

853
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:04,002
Now I know
what everybody's purpose here is.

854
01:15:05,211 --> 01:15:06,587
Except mine.

855
01:15:38,453 --> 01:15:41,581
- Daddy!
- Karin, come here.

856
01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:46,044
Hi!

857
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,549
- We missed you. Are you okay?
- Yeah. This is Terence Mann.

858
01:15:51,841 --> 01:15:52,925
Terry.

859
01:15:53,259 --> 01:15:54,469
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

860
01:15:54,594 --> 01:15:55,511
Hi, Terry.

861
01:15:56,262 --> 01:15:59,140
And this young fellow is...
This is Archie Graham.

862
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:03,269
- Archie.
- He's come to practice with the team.

863
01:16:03,519 --> 01:16:06,689
Yeah? He's going to be able to do
a lot more than that.

864
01:16:07,023 --> 01:16:08,024
What does that mean?

865
01:16:20,244 --> 01:16:22,830
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, Joe.

866
01:16:22,914 --> 01:16:24,665
- Oh, my God.
- What?

867
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:27,043
That's Shoeless Joe Jackson!

868
01:16:27,293 --> 01:16:30,213
Of course it is.
You mean you didn't believe me?

869
01:16:30,338 --> 01:16:34,008
I thought I did, but... Oh, my God.

870
01:16:35,259 --> 01:16:37,136
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi, Joe.

871
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:42,308
Good to see you. Terry,
I'd like you to meet Shoeless Joe Jackson.

872
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,644
Joe, Terry Mann.

873
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:49,023
- It's a pleasure meeting you.
- The pleasure's mine.

874
01:16:49,232 --> 01:16:52,527
I hope you don't mind,
but we got tired of just having practices...

875
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:56,614
...so we brought another team out
so we could have some real games.

876
01:16:56,739 --> 01:16:59,617
I don't mind. Where'd they come from?

877
01:17:00,034 --> 01:17:01,619
Where did we come from?

878
01:17:01,744 --> 01:17:04,163
You wouldn't believe
how many guys wanted to play.

879
01:17:04,288 --> 01:17:05,998
We had to beat 'em off with a stick.

880
01:17:06,124 --> 01:17:09,794
That's "Smokey" Joe Wood, and Mel Ott...

881
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,839
...and Gil Hodges!

882
01:17:12,922 --> 01:17:14,465
Ty Cobb wanted to play.

883
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,343
We couldn't stand the son of a bitch
when we were alive...

884
01:17:17,468 --> 01:17:19,262
...so we told him to stick it!

885
01:17:24,058 --> 01:17:26,853
- Are you Graham?
- Yes, sir.

886
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,441
What are you doing on the sidelines?
You came to play ball, didn't you?

887
01:17:31,566 --> 01:17:32,984
Yes, sir.

888
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:37,530
- All right. Well, go warm up.
- Yes, sir.

889
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:41,242
Rookies.

890
01:17:42,076 --> 01:17:43,619
Unbelievable.

891
01:17:45,413 --> 01:17:47,123
It's more than that.

892
01:17:48,082 --> 01:17:49,542
It's perfect.

893
01:18:02,472 --> 01:18:03,723
Safe!

894
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:15,360
Go, Graham! Go, kid!

895
01:18:15,485 --> 01:18:17,153
Come on, Archie!

896
01:18:17,278 --> 01:18:19,572
He looks like a baby next to those guys.

897
01:18:19,655 --> 01:18:20,740
He is.

898
01:18:31,793 --> 01:18:33,044
Let's go.

899
01:18:36,464 --> 01:18:37,757
Watch it, boy!

900
01:18:40,551 --> 01:18:43,179
Don't let him shake you up. Hang in there!

901
01:18:43,388 --> 01:18:46,432
Knuckles, what did you throw
at the kid for?

902
01:18:47,058 --> 01:18:49,769
- He winked at me.
- Don't wink, kid.

903
01:18:52,105 --> 01:18:55,191
Good thing for you
he didn't throw the fastball.

904
01:18:59,487 --> 01:19:00,863
Let's see that fastball.

905
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,661
Ball.

906
01:19:06,786 --> 01:19:10,164
Hey! Come on. Give us a break!

907
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:11,666
Hey, ump.

908
01:19:12,959 --> 01:19:17,046
- How about a warning?
- Sure. Watch out you don't get killed.

909
01:19:18,006 --> 01:19:19,173
Time!

910
01:19:20,091 --> 01:19:21,259
Time!

911
01:19:23,261 --> 01:19:27,682
Those first two were high and tight.
So what do you think the next one will be?

912
01:19:29,726 --> 01:19:32,603
Either low and away or in my ear.

913
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:36,357
He's not going to want to load the bases.
So look for low and away.

914
01:19:36,482 --> 01:19:38,067
Right.

915
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:41,154
But watch out for in your ear.

916
01:19:42,655 --> 01:19:44,032
- Come on, Archie!
- Let's go, kid!

917
01:19:44,115 --> 01:19:45,950
Batter, batter, batter!

918
01:19:46,075 --> 01:19:48,828
Come on, Arch. It just takes one.

919
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,134
- Yeah.
- That's deep enough.

920
01:20:04,135 --> 01:20:06,888
Go! Go! Go home!

921
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:10,641
- Safe!
- Son of a...

922
01:20:11,184 --> 01:20:14,145
Way to go, Arch! Way to go!

923
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,272
Attaboy, Arch!

924
01:20:17,482 --> 01:20:19,317
This is the wave!

925
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,528
- Way to go, man!
- Yeah, Archie.

926
01:20:22,862 --> 01:20:25,198
- All right.
- Archie, we need it.

927
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:27,825
- Way to go.
- Yeah. Way to go.

928
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:05,822
- What is this?
- What is this jerk doing?

929
01:21:05,947 --> 01:21:06,989
Hi!

930
01:21:07,824 --> 01:21:10,159
- Shit! Wreck him.
- Let me at him!

931
01:21:10,702 --> 01:21:12,578
You're interrupting the game, Mark.

932
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:18,918
It's time to put away your little fantasies
and come down to Earth.

933
01:21:19,168 --> 01:21:22,755
- It's not a fantasy. They're real.
- Who is real?

934
01:21:23,297 --> 01:21:26,050
Shoeless Joe Jackson, the White Sox,
all of them.

935
01:21:26,676 --> 01:21:29,429
- You mean?
- No. He can't see any of them.

936
01:21:30,972 --> 01:21:32,598
Who is this, Elvis?

937
01:21:33,808 --> 01:21:34,892
Ray.

938
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,229
As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.

939
01:21:38,813 --> 01:21:40,648
How do you do? I'm the Easter Bunny.

940
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:43,943
- Let's settle this thing now.
- Look. I'm not selling.

941
01:21:44,027 --> 01:21:48,322
You have no money.
You have a stack of bills!

942
01:21:48,448 --> 01:21:50,825
Come fall, you got no crop to sell.

943
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:54,162
But, I have a deal
that allows you to stay on the land.

944
01:21:54,412 --> 01:21:57,415
Daddy? We don't have to sell the farm.

945
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:01,961
- You'll live in the house rent-free.
- What about the team...

946
01:22:02,086 --> 01:22:04,172
Do you realize how much
this land is worth?

947
01:22:04,297 --> 01:22:06,174
Yeah. Yeah.

948
01:22:07,842 --> 01:22:09,677
$2,200 an acre.

949
01:22:10,094 --> 01:22:13,973
We can't keep a useless baseball diamond
in rich farmland.

950
01:22:14,098 --> 01:22:16,184
Read my lips. We're staying, all right?

951
01:22:16,309 --> 01:22:18,895
- We're staying.
- Ray, you're bankrupt!

952
01:22:18,978 --> 01:22:22,231
I'm offering you a way to keep your home
because I love my sister.

953
01:22:22,357 --> 01:22:26,486
My partners don't care
and are ready to foreclose right now.

954
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:29,655
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.

955
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:31,949
- Karin, please!
- Just wait! Wait!

956
01:22:36,162 --> 01:22:37,872
People will come.

957
01:22:39,415 --> 01:22:42,669
- What people, sweetheart?
- From all over.

958
01:22:42,794 --> 01:22:45,672
They'll just decide to take a vacation, see?

959
01:22:45,797 --> 01:22:50,009
And they'll come to Iowa City.
They'll think it's really boring.

960
01:22:50,426 --> 01:22:54,138
So they'll want to pay us.
Like buying a ticket.

961
01:22:57,934 --> 01:23:00,687
You're not seriously listening to this,
are you?

962
01:23:00,812 --> 01:23:03,481
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.

963
01:23:04,357 --> 01:23:07,068
Why would anybody
pay money to come here?

964
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:08,945
To watch the games.

965
01:23:09,445 --> 01:23:13,700
It will be just like when they were kids,
a long time ago.

966
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,869
They'll watch the game
and remember what it was like.

967
01:23:17,453 --> 01:23:21,374
- What the hell is she talking about?
- People will come.

968
01:23:21,499 --> 01:23:23,793
All right. This is fascinating...

969
01:23:24,419 --> 01:23:27,672
...but you don't have the money
to bring the mortgage up to date.

970
01:23:27,755 --> 01:23:30,174
So, you're still going to have to sell.

971
01:23:31,342 --> 01:23:34,095
I'm sorry, Ray. We got no choice.

972
01:23:37,849 --> 01:23:41,310
People will come, Ray.

973
01:23:44,063 --> 01:23:47,400
They'll come to Iowa
for reasons they can't even fathom.

974
01:23:48,109 --> 01:23:52,572
They'll turn up your driveway,
not knowing for sure why they're doing it.

975
01:23:52,697 --> 01:23:56,200
They'll arrive at your door
as innocent as children...

976
01:23:56,325 --> 01:23:58,327
...longing for the past.

977
01:23:58,536 --> 01:24:02,206
"Of course, we won't mind
if you look around," you'll say.

978
01:24:03,207 --> 01:24:05,376
"It's only $20 per person."

979
01:24:05,835 --> 01:24:08,880
They'll pass over the money
without even thinking about it.

980
01:24:08,963 --> 01:24:12,342
For it is money they have
and peace they like.

981
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:14,802
Ray! Just sign the papers.

982
01:24:15,345 --> 01:24:18,056
Then they'll walk off to the bleachers...

983
01:24:19,182 --> 01:24:22,894
...and sit in their shirtsleeves
on a perfect afternoon.

984
01:24:25,146 --> 01:24:30,526
They'll find they have reserved seats
somewhere along one of the baselines...

985
01:24:31,944 --> 01:24:36,366
...where they sat when they were children
and cheered their heroes...

986
01:24:36,866 --> 01:24:38,951
...and they'll watch the game...

987
01:24:39,077 --> 01:24:42,914
...and it will be as if they dipped
themselves in magic waters.

988
01:24:43,331 --> 01:24:45,583
The memories will be so thick...

989
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,336
...they'll have to brush them away
from their faces.

990
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:52,757
When the bank opens in the morning,
they'll foreclose.

991
01:24:53,257 --> 01:24:54,926
People will come, Ray.

992
01:24:55,218 --> 01:24:59,097
You're broke, Ray.
You sell now, or you lose everything.

993
01:24:59,806 --> 01:25:04,018
The one constant through all the years,
Ray, has been baseball.

994
01:25:04,936 --> 01:25:08,231
America has rolled by
like an army of steamrollers.

995
01:25:08,773 --> 01:25:12,568
It's been erased like a blackboard,
rebuilt, and erased again.

996
01:25:14,404 --> 01:25:17,198
But baseball has marked the time.

997
01:25:19,075 --> 01:25:21,619
This field, this game.

998
01:25:22,495 --> 01:25:24,789
It's a part of our past, Ray.

999
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:28,668
It reminds us of all that once was good...

1000
01:25:30,003 --> 01:25:32,046
...and it could be again.

1001
01:25:35,216 --> 01:25:37,135
People will come, Ray.

1002
01:25:38,094 --> 01:25:40,221
People will most definitely come.

1003
01:25:41,347 --> 01:25:44,225
Ray, you will lose everything.

1004
01:25:44,892 --> 01:25:47,020
You will be evicted.

1005
01:25:57,905 --> 01:25:59,407
<i>Come on, Ray.</i>

1006
01:26:20,386 --> 01:26:21,512
I'm not signing.

1007
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:24,307
You're crazy! Absolutely nuts!

1008
01:26:25,058 --> 01:26:26,851
I can't do it, pal.

1009
01:26:28,478 --> 01:26:31,439
Ray, you build a baseball field
in the middle of nowhere...

1010
01:26:31,564 --> 01:26:33,358
...and you stare at nothing.

1011
01:26:33,483 --> 01:26:34,525
It's not nothing.

1012
01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:38,488
- Your daughter's turned into a space case.
- Get your hands off her!

1013
01:26:40,406 --> 01:26:41,574
Karin?

1014
01:26:46,537 --> 01:26:48,247
- Is she all right?
- I don't know.

1015
01:26:48,373 --> 01:26:50,875
- Is she breathing?
- Should I get the car?

1016
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:58,132
I'm going to call emergency.

1017
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:01,969
- Annie, wait.
- What?

1018
01:27:20,029 --> 01:27:21,322
Just wait.

1019
01:27:39,799 --> 01:27:42,385
- What have we got here?
- She fell.

1020
01:27:50,393 --> 01:27:53,312
- This child's choking to death.
- Get her up.

1021
01:27:53,813 --> 01:27:55,440
Hold her steady now.

1022
01:28:01,654 --> 01:28:03,781
Hot dog. Stuck in her throat.

1023
01:28:04,907 --> 01:28:06,534
She'll be all right.

1024
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:09,912
She'll be turning handsprings
before you know it.

1025
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,126
Thank you, Doc.

1026
01:28:16,794 --> 01:28:19,464
No, son. Thank you.

1027
01:28:22,842 --> 01:28:24,969
Oh, my God. You can't go back.

1028
01:28:25,303 --> 01:28:26,971
- You can't go back.
- It's all right.

1029
01:28:27,055 --> 01:28:29,140
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1030
01:28:33,978 --> 01:28:35,980
I best be getting on home...

1031
01:28:36,522 --> 01:28:39,859
...before Alicia begins to think
I got a girlfriend.

1032
01:28:44,989 --> 01:28:46,282
Hey, Doc.

1033
01:28:46,949 --> 01:28:48,493
Good work, Doc.

1034
01:28:50,453 --> 01:28:51,996
Nice going, Doc.

1035
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,501
Going to miss you.

1036
01:28:59,087 --> 01:29:01,756
Win one for me one day, will you, boys?

1037
01:29:01,881 --> 01:29:03,508
- Okay, Doc.
- Yeah.

1038
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:14,018
When did these ballplayers get here?

1039
01:29:19,565 --> 01:29:20,983
Hey, rookie!

1040
01:29:32,745 --> 01:29:34,288
You were good.

1041
01:29:48,344 --> 01:29:52,181
Do not sell this farm, Ray.
You got to keep this farm.

1042
01:29:52,515 --> 01:29:54,726
You've had a rough day.

1043
01:29:54,851 --> 01:29:57,979
- Go inside and get something cold to drink.
- Yeah.

1044
01:29:58,104 --> 01:29:59,647
That's a good idea.

1045
01:30:00,982 --> 01:30:02,817
Don't sell the farm, Ray.

1046
01:30:11,993 --> 01:30:13,077
Ray?

1047
01:30:14,203 --> 01:30:16,164
We're going to call it a day.

1048
01:30:16,497 --> 01:30:18,875
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

1049
01:30:23,504 --> 01:30:25,256
Do you want to come with us?

1050
01:30:29,802 --> 01:30:32,263
- You mean it?
- No, not you.

1051
01:30:34,015 --> 01:30:35,058
Him.

1052
01:30:38,686 --> 01:30:40,563
- Him?
- Come with you?

1053
01:30:40,813 --> 01:30:42,523
- Out there.
- What is out there?

1054
01:30:43,274 --> 01:30:44,400
Come and find out.

1055
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:47,153
Wait a second. Why him? I built this field.

1056
01:30:47,278 --> 01:30:51,199
- You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me.
- I'm unattached. You have a family.

1057
01:30:51,324 --> 01:30:52,909
I want to know what's out there.

1058
01:30:52,992 --> 01:30:55,620
- I want to see it.
- But you're not invited.

1059
01:30:58,498 --> 01:31:01,501
"Not invited"?
What do you mean I'm not invited?

1060
01:31:01,626 --> 01:31:04,420
That's my corn out there.
You guys are guests in my corn.

1061
01:31:05,004 --> 01:31:09,217
I've done everything I've been asked to do.
I didn't understand, but I've done it.

1062
01:31:09,342 --> 01:31:11,511
I haven't once asked what's in it for me.

1063
01:31:11,636 --> 01:31:15,390
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, "What's in it for me?"

1064
01:31:16,307 --> 01:31:19,143
Is that why you did this? For you?

1065
01:31:24,857 --> 01:31:27,443
I think you'd better stay here, Ray.

1066
01:31:30,697 --> 01:31:31,698
Why?

1067
01:31:33,658 --> 01:31:36,536
Ray. There's a reason they chose me...

1068
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:39,414
...just as there's a reason
they chose you and this field.

1069
01:31:40,873 --> 01:31:42,250
I gave an interview.

1070
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,544
What are you talking about?

1071
01:31:44,669 --> 01:31:48,923
The one about Ebbets Field,
the one that sent you to Boston to find me.

1072
01:31:51,968 --> 01:31:55,513
- You lied to me.
- You were kidnapping me at the time.

1073
01:31:55,638 --> 01:31:58,391
- You lied to me!
- You said your finger was a gun.

1074
01:32:01,102 --> 01:32:03,187
- That's a good point.
- Ray.

1075
01:32:08,818 --> 01:32:11,112
Listen to me, Ray. Listen to me.

1076
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:15,241
There is something out there...

1077
01:32:15,825 --> 01:32:18,703
...and if I have the courage
to go through with this...

1078
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:20,913
...what a story it'll make.

1079
01:32:22,749 --> 01:32:25,793
"Shoeless Joe Jackson comes to Iowa."

1080
01:32:34,552 --> 01:32:38,222
- Are you going to write about it?
- You bet I'll write about it.

1081
01:32:38,598 --> 01:32:42,435
- You're going to write about it.
- That's what I do.

1082
01:32:46,939 --> 01:32:48,066
Good.

1083
01:32:51,569 --> 01:32:52,695
Good.

1084
01:33:08,378 --> 01:33:10,421
Honey, where's he going?

1085
01:33:11,005 --> 01:33:13,758
Terry's been invited
to go out with the other players.

1086
01:33:13,883 --> 01:33:16,719
- How are you feeling, sweetheart?
- Stupid.

1087
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,221
You mean "out"?

1088
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:19,639
Yeah.

1089
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:21,766
Out.

1090
01:33:22,433 --> 01:33:23,685
Far out.

1091
01:33:25,895 --> 01:33:27,522
I want a full description.

1092
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:30,608
Take care of this family.

1093
01:33:33,069 --> 01:33:34,529
Be careful.

1094
01:34:33,588 --> 01:34:34,672
'Bye.

1095
01:34:37,925 --> 01:34:39,052
What?

1096
01:34:46,184 --> 01:34:48,311
What are you grinning at, you ghost?

1097
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:51,272
"If you build it...


1098
01:34:53,274 --> 01:34:54,734
"...he will come."

1099
01:35:07,038 --> 01:35:10,249
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

1100
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:15,630
It's my father.

1101
01:35:21,302 --> 01:35:22,929
"Ease his pain."

1102
01:35:24,347 --> 01:35:26,307
"Go the distance."

1103
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,520
It was you.

1104
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:37,402
No, Ray. It was you.

1105
01:36:04,137 --> 01:36:05,513
My God.

1106
01:36:06,848 --> 01:36:10,393
I only saw him years later
when he was worn down by life.

1107
01:36:12,478 --> 01:36:13,521
Look at him.

1108
01:36:15,481 --> 01:36:20,319
He's got his whole life in front of him,
and I'm not even a glint in his eye.

1109
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,035
What do I say to him?

1110
01:36:28,828 --> 01:36:31,956
Why don't you introduce him
to his granddaughter?

1111
01:36:35,168 --> 01:36:36,169
Hi.

1112
01:36:37,503 --> 01:36:38,504
Hi.

1113
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:42,342
I just wanted to thank you folks
for putting up this field...

1114
01:36:42,467 --> 01:36:44,344
...letting us play here.

1115
01:36:44,927 --> 01:36:46,512
I'm John Kinsella.

1116
01:36:48,848 --> 01:36:50,058
I'm Ray.

1117
01:36:51,642 --> 01:36:53,144
My wife Annie.

1118
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:57,523
This is my daughter Karin.
Karin, this is my...

1119
01:37:00,943 --> 01:37:02,403
This is John.

1120
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,614
Hi, John.

1121
01:37:07,116 --> 01:37:08,576
Hi, Karin.

1122
01:37:11,245 --> 01:37:14,082
Well, we're going to let you two talk.

1123
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:19,671
If all these people are going to come,
we got a lot of work to do.

1124
01:37:21,798 --> 01:37:24,050
It was very nice meeting you.

1125
01:37:25,093 --> 01:37:26,135
Ma'am.

1126
01:37:27,553 --> 01:37:29,013
Come on.

1127
01:37:43,903 --> 01:37:45,822
You catch a good game.

1128
01:37:46,989 --> 01:37:48,282
Thank you.

1129
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,453
It's so beautiful here.

1130
01:37:54,747 --> 01:37:55,873
For me...

1131
01:37:58,251 --> 01:38:01,129
For me, it's like a dream come true.

1132
01:38:04,674 --> 01:38:06,634
Can I ask you something?

1133
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:12,515
Is this heaven?

1134
01:38:16,811 --> 01:38:18,104
It's Iowa.

1135
01:38:20,189 --> 01:38:22,734
- Iowa?
- Yeah.

1136
01:38:26,612 --> 01:38:28,990
I could have sworn it was heaven.

1137
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:40,585
Is there a heaven?

1138
01:38:42,795 --> 01:38:44,088
Oh, yeah.

1139
01:38:46,382 --> 01:38:48,843
It's the place where dreams come true.

1140
01:39:08,696 --> 01:39:10,573
Maybe this is heaven.

1141
01:39:17,205 --> 01:39:18,706
Good night, Ray.

1142
01:39:21,626 --> 01:39:23,086
Good night, John.

1143
01:39:33,388 --> 01:39:35,056
Hey! Dad?

1144
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,020
You want to have a catch?

1145
01:39:43,731 --> 01:39:45,191
I'd like that.

1146
01:41:28,252 --> 01:41:30,296
