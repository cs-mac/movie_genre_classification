<DAY'S WAIT...>

3
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,837
You'll have to wait outside.

4
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,299
Will it be long?
/I'm almost done.

5
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:15,843
Okay.

6
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,556
Hello?

7
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,100
It's me.

8
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,813
Soojung.

9
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,693
Where are you?

10
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,281
I just got up.

11
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,618
You mean just now?

12
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,455
I'm not feeling very well.

13
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,750
Where are you?

14
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,505
I'm already here.

15
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,134
Are you sick?

16
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,556
I'm sorry.

17
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:37,734
Can't we do this another time?

18
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,992
Soojung. ..

19
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:53,166
Soojung, you know this wasn't easy.

20
00:04:53,751 --> 00:05:01,675
If you're not really sick, please come.

21
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,974
Do we really have to do it today?

22
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,059
Of course.

23
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:23,864
Soojung, You're making
things really difficult.

24
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,455
Where are you?

25
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,583
In the hotel?

26
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,085
Yes.

27
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,884
I'm in the room.

28
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,848
What number?

29
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,394
Room 308.

30
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,316
Grab a taxi. I'll wait.

-The 3rd Painting Exhibition-

00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:41,066
-Growrich Gallery-

34
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,153
Interesting? Not much, yes?

35
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,239
I liked it.

36
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,157
Not interesting at all.

37
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,118
I thought it was fun.

38
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,875
We're right in front of
Kyongbokgoong Palace.

39
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,713
Our palaces are quite small.

40
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,512
Shall we go?

41
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,888
Where to?

42
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,348
How about lunch?

43
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,850
Did we eat?

44
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,352
Didn't we?

45
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,480
You can't remember
whether you had lunch or not?

46
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,607
Anyway, let's have something.

47
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,401
Let's go.

48
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,384
You should start painting again.

49
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,723
What?

50
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,061
You should start painting again.

51
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,856
And what about you?

52
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:12,866
I have a studio
and I go there once a week.

53
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:26,213
And your brother,
why doesn't he trust you?

54
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,471
He thinks there's only one way
to live, just his way.

55
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,435
Nobody can get through to him.

56
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,690
I think I know what you mean.

57
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,487
No, you don't, Youngsoo.

58
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,242
No one can get through to him.

59
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:03,250
Even though you know he's wrong,
it's no use, no use.

60
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,128
I know what you mean.

61
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,392
Excuse me, the toilet.

62
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,353
What's the matter?

63
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,566
It's probably his stomach.

64
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,404
Are you two close?

65
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,869
I've known him for about 5 years.

66
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,376
We don't get together often
but we're fond of each other.

67
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,172
He's a very gentle person, this kid.

68
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,426
The way you talk about him,
you seem very close.

69
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,468
What did I say?

70
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:02,392
I've never seen you be nice
to someone for this long.

71
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,769
What are you trying to say?

72
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,031
What is her name?
/Soojung.

73
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,952
Her last name?
/Yang.

74
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,590
Can you please move?

75
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,051
We're shooting here.

76
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,058
Thank you.

77
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,450
Hello. What a coincidence!

78
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,952
Hello.

79
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,206
You must be here with the crew.

80
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,125
Yes.

81
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,045
Can I see those gloves?

82
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,922
These gloves?

83
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,136
These gloves are really mine.

84
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,555
How did you get them?

85
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,474
These gloves are yours?

86
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,435
I found them on that bench.

87
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,062
I came back but. ..

88
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,523
I didn't think I would find them . ..

89
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:19,154
I must have left them
on the bench during lunch.

90
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,781
Well, how lucky.

91
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:28,121
I can't believe that you, Soojung,
brought them to me.

92
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,040
You remember my name.

93
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:38,339
Of course. Do you remember
my name by any chance?

94
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,008
Yes, of course.

95
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,801
I have a pretty good memory.

96
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,890
I have good memory, too.

97
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,354
Well, I have to go.

98
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,733
It was nice meeting you again.
/It was nice meeting you, too.

99
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,447
Oh, I'm seeing Youngsoo later on.

100
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,491
I see.

101
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,787
Well, so long.
/Good-bye.

102
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,876
And thank you for the gloves.
/That's alright.

103
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:35,563
The independent way is the way
to make the best films.

104
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,235
The industry way isn't right for me.

105
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm ready to struggle.

106
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,534
Then I can help out.

107
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,702
Yes, of course.

108
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,376
But this is a bit embarrassing
for me to talk about, isn't it?

109
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,838
You shouldn't be.

110
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,052
It would be good if you could help.

111
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,723
It would be great if I help out, right?

112
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,519
Can you really?

113
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,314
Just direct as well as
you paint, okay?

114
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,780
It'll be great for me, too.

115
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,757
Is this codfish?

116
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,178
No way. Codfish wouldn't
be this cheap.

117
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,391
But isn't this place called Cod house?

118
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,144
This is crayfish.
I have to go to the bathroom.

119
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,106
Codfish isn't so cheap.

120
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,528
New chopsticks, please!

121
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,197
They're right here.

122
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:14,996
Oh, there they are.

123
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,416
Where did you get
the chopsticks before?

124
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,543
From there.

125
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,511
Let me pour for you.

126
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,186
Do you drink a lot?
/What?

127
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,440
Drinking. ..do you drink a lot?

128
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,525
Yes.

129
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:53,034
I used to drink up to 5 bottles of soju,
and 3 bottles of whiskey.

130
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,455
Really? You drink that much?

131
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,083
Not anymore.

132
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,594
Youngsoo, are you okay?

133
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,396
Are you going to Sadang-dong?

134
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,774
Youngsoo, get in.

135
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,321
Be careful.

136
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,536
Are you alright?

137
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:43,376
To Sadang-dong, please.
/Soojung, will you be alright?

138
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,130
I'll take you home.

139
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,007
I'm okay.

140
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,718
Please go.
/I'll take you home.

141
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,912
You are an odd one, aren't you?

142
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:30,465
I'll show you something funny.

143
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,175
Come.

144
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,926
What is it?

145
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,682
I know it's really cold,
but it'll be fun.

146
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,351
What is it I'll enjoy?

147
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:50,401
There's this strange guy
who lives with this girl. ..it's really funny.

148
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,116
Come on.

149
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,156
They're not here.

150
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,289
You're really funny.

151
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,671
Soojung. ..

152
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:20,366
Stop! Stop it!

153
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,203
I'm sorry.

154
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,293
Are you hurt?

155
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,004
No. ..

156
00:19:53,901 --> 00:20:00,364
I don't know how you think
about me, but I would really
like to start a serious relationship.

157
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,535
But, we don't know each other well.

158
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:13,044
I'm really serious.
I'm not just saying this.

159
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:28,392
If you can trust me, maybe you
could start a relationship with me.

160
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,187
I'm asking for the last time.

161
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,984
No.

162
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,491
I see.

163
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:58,965
Then, I should apologize.

164
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,846
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

165
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,396
I will.

166
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:20,319
Thank you.

167
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,512
I'll return this right after
I'm back from location scouting.

168
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,597
Sure.

169
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,183
Are you sure I can borrow this?

170
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,770
Of course.
/Very nice. ..

171
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,815
I should get one of these.

172
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,568
They're not available in Korea.

173
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,154
I bought this in Japan.

174
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,489
You go to Japan, right Youngsoo?

175
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,533
Why would I go to Japan?

176
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,745
Hey, Park!

177
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,373
If you're not going to shoot,
why did we have to come so early
in the morning and wait?

178
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,088
If you think editing will take
more time, you should have
at least given us a call.

179
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,258
We've been here waiting
from the break of done.

180
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,719
I thought the editing
would be over by then.

181
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:32,808
We have to leave early if we want
to save a day. You should know that.

182
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,728
You always end up spending
3 days to edit, and you know it.

183
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,938
And you still make us come
so bloody early in the morning.

184
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,941
Come on, tell me when you've
taken less than 3 days, huh?

185
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,360
Okay.

186
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:48,783
At least, buy us some lunch.
The crew have been
waiting all day, you know.

187
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,703
Let's do it next time.
I have visitors today.

188
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,716
It's 1 6 to 9.

189
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,057
It's my serve.

190
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:21,107
Oh, don't we have to check
on the staff before they leave?

191
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,152
Okay. We can do that now.

192
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,030
Let's quit playing.

193
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,621
You're good. Why did
you say you're not good?

194
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,665
I'm not good.

195
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,667
This isn't funny.

196
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,628
Why do you say you're
not good when you are?

197
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,889
Hello?
/Hello, is this Park?

198
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:59,812
Oh, Kwon. You didn't
come back so I left.
I told your assistant before I left. ..

199
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,481
I don't want to hear any of that.
So, are you coming tomorrow, or not?

200
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,526
I waited the whole day today.

201
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,113
Besides, something's come up
and I'm out of town tomorrow.

202
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,867
I don't care what your plans are.

203
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,161
Are you coming tomorrow, or not?
We're shooting tomorrow.

204
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,787
Are you gonna be here, or not?

205
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,082
What about Driver Kim?
/Why should he come?

206
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,502
He's the boss' driver, not the driver
for the crew. Why would he come?

207
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,173
You're really not up to this job.

208
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,425
Why don't you just quit?

209
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,719
Okay. You're fired. Now you won't
have to come tomorrow. Satisfied?

210
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,097
What? You, son of a bitch.

211
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,392
What's that? Bastard.

212
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:44,815
You better not move an inch.
Stay right there, you bastard.

213
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,853
I'm sorry.

214
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,066
I'm really sorry.

215
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,695
You know how it is.
We're always behind schedule.

216
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,408
So I was a bit tense, and I said
some things I shouldn't have.

217
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,954
I'm really sorry.

218
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,877
Let's shake hands and make up.

219
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,548
I'm sorry.
/We don't have to shake hands. ..

220
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,343
I'm really sorry, Park.

221
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,930
My mistake. I shouldn't have.

222
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,100
Come on. Give me your hand.

223
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,947
Is everything okay?

224
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,658
Are you okay?

225
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,959
You know, one can't do
everything one wants in life.

226
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,665
This is pretty heavy.

227
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,004
You carry the camera in your pocket?

228
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,968
I just put it in here a while ago.

229
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,764
How did it go with Park?

230
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:38,697
Well, you know. ..I was too thoughtless.
It's his job we're talking about.

231
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,037
It was my temper,
but it was my mistake. My fault.

232
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,792
So is he coming tomorrow?

233
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,253
Oh, I forgot about that.

234
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:07,184
By the way, Youngsoo,
it only takes 30 minutes to recharge.

235
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,188
To Sadang-dong!

236
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,815
To Sungbook-dong.

237
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,818
Yeah, you go.

238
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,737
Soojung, get in. I'll drop you off.

239
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,324
Me? No, I'm fine.
It's the opposite direction.

240
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,576
It's okay. It'll only be
a slight detour.

241
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,663
Bye Youngsoo.

242
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:34,878
Get in.

243
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,215
Bye.

244
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,137
Bye, Youngsoo.

245
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:13,751
How about if I be your girlfriend
only when you drink?

246
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,676
Would you?

247
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,458
I liked that.

248
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,962
Did you like it?

249
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,102
I'll show you something.

250
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,333
When I was young,
I used to stick my head out.

251
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,801
Back then, my parents and
I drove to the airport almost everyday.

252
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:55,561
On the way to the airport,
my brother and I used to fool around. ..

253
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,237
Our car was a foreign car, too.

254
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,789
I guess we were well off, back then.

255
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,812
Please, make yourself at home.

256
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,069
Would you like something to drink?
/No thank you.

257
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,238
Are you sure?
<i>/Yes.</i>

258
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,701
Excuse me while I take a shower.

259
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,541
Would you like to take a shower?

260
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,418
No, thank you.

261
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,925
Just a second.

262
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,100
This is my first time.

263
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,777
What?

264
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,781
I've never done this before.

265
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,538
Really?

266
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:49,211
Yes. I've never done this before.

267
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,178
Really?

268
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,598
I'm a virgin.

269
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,518
Quite funny, isn't it?
/No.

270
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,233
Not at all.

271
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,283
Isn't it funny?

272
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,987
You don't like to wear a bra?

273
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,908
I don't like to in the winter,
because it's uncomfortable.

274
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,662
I see. I guess in the winter,
it doesn't show.

275
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,214
Excuse me.

276
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,842
Can I get you anything else?

277
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,179
I think we're okay.

278
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:26,391
So it seems you come often these days.

279
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,064
That's your car out there, right?

280
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,649
Yes.

281
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,109
It's a very nice car.

282
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,863
Well. Have a nice time.

283
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,385
It's just a fork.

284
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,144
I would if I had a girlfriend.

285
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,481
I think you're being too picky.

286
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,192
Yeah, you're too picky.

287
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,236
It's not easy.

288
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,029
What's not easy?

289
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,531
Well, you know.

290
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,077
I thought you were the simple type,
but I guess not.

291
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,790
I guess I'm kind of chicken.
I think it's in our family blood.

292
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,875
Then how did your older brother manage?

293
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,753
He and my sister-in-law go way back.

294
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,880
They met when she was in high school.

295
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,176
They went to the same church,
and when she was in high school,
he decided that she's the one.

296
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,262
So we can say that he raised
a child, then gobbled her up.

297
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,180
What?

298
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:53,186
Well, I think it's fate and. ..
/I'll take her. Come on.

299
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,487
I think she might have been offended.

300
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,197
What do you mean?

301
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:08,576
She also met her husband
when she was in high school, remember?

302
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,787
Oh, right.

303
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,334
And I said that he raised a child,
then gobbled her up.

304
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,045
She must really be offended.

305
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,798
Oh, no.

306
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,554
Anyway, happy birthday.

307
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,766
Thanks for coming.

308
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,602
Come on. We're in public.

309
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:56,499
To be frank, the type of woman
that's attracted to you,
would probably be half crazy or decadent.

310
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:07,302
But, what you need is a woman
that's disciplined and secure.

311
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,930
That's why it is very hard
to find a right woman for you.

312
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,182
That's enough.

313
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,561
No. I mean it. See, you wife here. ..

314
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,731
Someone's at the door.

315
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,941
I'll get it.
/Okay.

316
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,205
Long time no see.

317
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,500
Jaehoon, you're here.

318
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,085
Hi.

319
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,670
The numbers of the apartment
buildings are so mixed up.

320
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,673
Come in. Come in.

321
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,801
She's a writer and works with me.

322
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,469
Hello.

323
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,346
Come on in.

324
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,723
How come it's so dark?

325
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,477
Where are the lights?
/In the back.

326
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,521
Please sit down.

327
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,607
I've brought some baked sweet potatoes.
/Thank you.

328
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,610
So, it seems you've had
quite a few drinks, already.

329
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,029
How have you been?
/Fine.

330
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,491
What about dinner?
/This will do.

331
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:16,746
Can you hand me the chopsticks.
/Try some of this.

332
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:35,014
Youngsoo, how's your movie
coming along? Going well?

333
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,768
Fuck.

334
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,939
Why do you always have to
call me by my name, Youngsoo,

335
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,191
when you never call their names
when you talk to them?

336
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,490
Have you ever really cared about me?

337
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,784
Soojung, come here.

338
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,830
Come over here.
Move over, damn it.

339
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,208
Come on. Get over here.

340
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,503
Pour a drink for your boss,
the producer. Come on.

341
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,756
Youngsoo!
/I'm just kidding.

342
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,092
Get away.

343
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,823
Soojung. Loosen up.
Just enjoy yourself.

344
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:40,163
You don't have to act so innocent.
Drink up. Go with the flow.

345
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,958
Drink up. Drink up. Drink up.

346
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,338
Are you saying I didn't drink?
I did drink a lot.

347
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,340
You did?

348
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,925
Okay, then I'll drink this.

349
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,599
This is for me?

350
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:11,653
He's a thief. How can he steal
his own friend's camera?

351
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,198
You don't know if he stole it?

352
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,368
He said he lost it.

353
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,828
What do you mean he lost it?

354
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,915
It's so obvious. Just because
there's no proof, we can't
just forget about it.

355
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,251
It's not obvious.

356
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,132
How funny. How really funny.

357
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:39,097
Soojung, so are you saying
that he's not a thief?

358
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:48,439
We don't know. How can you. .. okay.

359
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,276
Producer Kwon made a mistake.

360
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,154
He drank too much tonight,
and he was out of line.

361
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,657
Let's just leave it at that.

362
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,619
Are you saying that I'm accusing
a completely innocent person?

363
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,373
I'm not talking about him
being drunk tonight.

364
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,752
I'm talking about his integrity.
His integrity. You know!

365
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,755
He was out of line
because he doesn't know about us.

366
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,382
Him not knowing has
nothing to do with it.

367
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,009
What about him touching you,
like your legs?

368
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:16,926
Is that also because
he didn't know about us?

369
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,219
Stop it!

370
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,600
We didn't tell him,
so it's our fault, too.

371
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,520
Funny. Very funny.

372
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,482
An innocent mistake
because he didn't know, huh!

373
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,574
Soojung, are you in love
with him or something?

374
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,540
How very funny, mister!

375
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,633
Was it so wrong for me to ask you
to keep our relationship a secret?

376
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,428
Were you that offended?

377
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,305
How can you not know
how I feel about you?

378
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,140
Okay.

379
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,100
No, its not okay.

380
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,606
I don't want our relationship
to be taken as a fling.

381
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,484
I don't want other people
gossiping about us, either.

382
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,404
Or him staring at us with
a knowing eye.

383
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,992
This is really important to me.

384
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,995
You know? Our relationship is.

385
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,373
Alright, okay.

386
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,125
Let's just keep it between us.

387
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:41,219
Soojung, you don't know
what I really want.

388
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:47,850
I really want our relationship
to be really meaningful.

389
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,854
I've never felt like this before.

390
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,940
I was even considering marriage.

391
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,651
Even marriage. ..

392
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,654
How can you not know how I feel?

393
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,579
Me, to consider marriage.

394
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,208
Do you know how hard it is for me
to consider marriage?

395
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:20,133
For me to consider. ..
/Don't make it difficult, then.

396
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,511
Make your life easier.

397
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,389
Let's stop seeing each other, then.

398
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,183
Why should we see each other
if it has to be so difficult?

399
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,685
Am I wrong?

400
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,906
Soojung! Come here.

401
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:50,621
Come here.

402
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,750
Enjoy your meal.

403
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:56,270
Can I see you today?

404
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,690
I have to go somewhere today.

405
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,403
I see.

406
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,825
How are you?

407
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,746
Okay.

408
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,959
Are you going somewhere far?

409
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:24,257
No. A friend has just moved to Ansan,
and invited some friends.

410
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,884
Ansan?

411
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,513
Where's Ansan?

412
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,308
It's close if you take the subway.

413
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,812
She moved to Kojan,
which is right before Ansan.

414
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,649
Kojan?

415
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,833
Do you know how to get to Kojan?

416
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,089
Look for yourself.

417
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,346
You look very nice in a skirt.

418
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,353
What is this?

419
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,022
Beethoven's 6th symphony, "Pastoral".

420
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:09,570
Oh, and thanks for this CD player.

421
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,240
Not at all. Do you like it?

422
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,746
My mother asked me who gave this to me.

423
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,248
Is that so?

424
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:29,715
I told her it was a gift,
and she said it must be
from someone who's very generous.

425
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,760
Is that so?

426
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,955
Is that how you hold your chopsticks?

427
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,624
Why?

428
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,922
You're supposed to hold one still
so it doesn't move.

429
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:18,639
Then, hold the other one
at the end of the three fingers.

430
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,807
Like this?

431
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:23,519
You move them back and
forth with these two fingers.

432
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,439
Very good.

433
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:40,119
If you're not used to it yet,
just do it your way, for now.

434
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,497
I should correct
something if it's wrong.

435
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,186
No.
/Why not?

436
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,021
Let's do it next time.

437
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,400
Again?

438
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,659
I'm really getting tired of this.

439
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,578
Let's do it next time.

440
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,879
Next time, when?

441
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,425
This is all you want to do.

442
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,723
You got my breasts, didn't you?

443
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,091
I really want to do it.

444
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,011
Let's do it next time.

445
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,805
Not today.

446
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,268
I'm having my period.

447
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,270
Period?

448
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,107
It doesn't matter. I don't mind.

449
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,442
I do!

450
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,570
Let's do it when I'm clean.

451
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,703
Are you really having your period?

452
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,205
Of course.

453
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,250
Show me, then.
/It's true!

454
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,186
Let's go somewhere nice.

455
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,276
How about Cheju Island?

456
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,406
Yes. Let's go to Cheju Island.

457
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:17,461
Okay. Let's do it in the most
expensive room in Cheju Island.

458
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,631
Look at that grin.

459
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,982
Soojung. ..

460
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,489
I love you.

461
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,159
I love you, too.

462
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:07,386
<SUSPENDED CABLE CAR>

463
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,768
It's me.

464
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,646
Soojung?

465
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,443
Where are you?

466
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,279
At home.

467
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,909
I just got up.

468
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,329
You mean just now?

469
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,542
I think I'm sick.

470
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,794
Where are you?

471
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,341
I'm here at the hotel.

472
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,095
Are you sick?

473
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:56,226
No. It's just that
I'm not feeling very well.

474
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,448
Hello?

475
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,575
It's Soojung.

476
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,662
What are you doing?

477
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,123
Can you talk on the phone right now?

478
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,168
Where are you?

479
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,755
Myong-dong.

480
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,799
What are you doing there?

481
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,803
Do you think you can come?

482
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:37,893
Let me see. Not today.

483
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,814
The whole family is getting
together at my mother's.

484
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:48,320
I see. Well, then okay. ..

485
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,117
Is something wrong?

486
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:57,496
Well. Then, so long.

487
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:02,167
Do you want me to call later tonight?

488
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,213
No, that's okay.
You should be with your family.

489
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,719
Alright, then.

490
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,658
Calling control room.
Control room. Control room.

491
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,746
The cable car has been suspended
because of a power outage.

492
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,040
Tell the passengers
so they don't panic.

493
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,169
Alright. When will it work again?

494
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,548
We're calling the power utilities
now so bear with us for a while.

495
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,343
We'll use the emergency engine
if it takes too long.

496
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,945
I think the baby had a scare.
/Yes. I think so.

497
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,697
Sorry, but can you hold her for me.

498
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:33,527
<PERHAPS INTENTION>

499
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,993
Okay, see you later.

500
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,079
Bye!

501
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,792
Come here.

502
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,347
My baby. Sweet heart.

503
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,643
Let's go.
/My baby.

504
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,612
What's that?

505
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,575
Did you eat?

506
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,493
No.

507
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,542
Let's go see some paintings.

508
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,965
What's the matter?

509
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,927
Paintings?

510
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,931
You mean a painting exhibit?

511
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,309
Yeah.

512
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,520
Now?

513
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,440
Let's go.

514
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,359
I'll buy you a drink.

515
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,792
We're right in front of
Kyongbokgoong Palace.

516
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,299
Our palaces are quite small.

517
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,260
Why should it be bigger?

518
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,638
Sorry to keep you waiting.

519
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,559
Kim, you can leave early today.

520
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,937
We're going to eat somewhere
here, so I won't need a ride.

521
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,065
No, sir. I'll wait.
I'll be waiting here, sir.

522
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,609
You will?

523
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,409
Then get something to eat.

524
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,077
Yes, sir.

525
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,079
Shall we go?

526
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,707
Okay.
/Let's go this way.

527
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:18,400
Then why don't you move
out of your brother's house.

528
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,778
Get your own place.

529
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:29,161
Youngsoo, I respect my brother.

530
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,997
He's a good person.

531
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,335
There's a lot to learn from him,
in a practical way.

532
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,256
Excuse me. ..

533
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,978
I have to go to the toilet.

534
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,444
I guess he had too much to drink.

535
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,258
Do you drink a lot?

536
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,511
Excuse me?

537
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,807
Drinking. .. do you drink a lot?

538
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:42,484
Yes. I used to drink up to 5 bottles
of soju, and 3 bottles of whiskey.

539
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:49,115
Really? You drink that much?

540
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,578
These days I can't handle that much.

541
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:59,436
Soojung, are you sleeping?

542
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:08,278
Are you sleeping?

543
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,924
Soojung, are you sleeping?

544
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:49,027
Soojung, wake up.

545
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,253
Do you know what time it is?

546
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,093
Don't you get any sleep?

547
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,683
Just once.

548
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,103
Not now. I'm tired.

549
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:30,193
Just once, please?

550
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,321
Try to control yourself.

551
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,074
Don't you have any self control?

552
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,580
I'll be quick, please?

553
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,345
Hurry up, then.

554
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:27,167
Slow down.

555
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,086
Gently. ..

556
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,431
Where are we going?

557
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,351
How about Kyongbokgoong Palace?

558
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,979
Do you know how far that is?

559
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,690
Let's go to Yongsan Park.

560
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,942
It's close by.

561
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,445
We've used Yongsan Park too many times.

562
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,531
Isn't there some other place?

563
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,534
Then, let's go to the riverside.

564
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,038
We won't find any people there
at this time of day.

565
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,584
Let's go to Kyongbokgoong Palace.
We'll find people there.

566
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,781
I'm Youngsoo's. ..

567
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,575
Hello.

568
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:27,287
Soojung, what brought you here?

569
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,914
You remember my name.

570
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,459
I'm here with the crew.

571
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,378
I see.

572
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,215
You must come here often
since you're right across the street.

573
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:46,556
Yes, I think I told you that I come here
almost everyday for lunch.

574
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:58,234
Are these yours by any chance?

575
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,527
Let me see.

576
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:09,829
Really! They're mine.
/They are? This is incredible.

577
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:16,586
I found them on that bench,
and wondered whether they were yours.

578
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,424
Really, what a coincidence.

579
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,886
These are really yours, right?
<i>/Yes.</i>

580
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,223
This is so funny.

581
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,480
Don't lose them again, okay?

582
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,899
Thank you.

583
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,366
How much?

584
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,450
1 0,000 won.

585
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,410
We had one portion of ribs
and Makgulli.
/1 0,000 won.

586
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,455
I was late. I joined the group later.

587
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:52,956
Okay, 8000won.
/How many?

588
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:54,874
Four.

589
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,210
Any minors or not?
/None.

590
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,296
Then come inside.
/Thank you. Bye.

591
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:33,371
Something's got into her.
She's drinking a lot tonight.

592
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:36,374
I'm a strong drinker, you know.

593
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,459
Then we should drink up.

594
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:44,299
Then give me a big smile.

595
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:46,718
What?

596
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:51,306
Oh, I said give me a big smile.

597
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,603
What am I supposed to be?
/Just give him a big smile.

598
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,105
A big smile.

599
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,116
What's blood?

600
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,161
What?

601
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:15,872
I said what's your blood?

602
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,958
Blood?

603
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,295
He's talking about your
blood type, blood type.

604
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:28,926
um, B type.
/I'm A type.

605
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,931
What's B type supposed to be like?

606
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:39,395
Well, it's not that.
I just wanted to ask.

607
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,449
I should have told you.
He can be a bit muggy. ..

608
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,872
I have to go to the toilet.

609
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,303
Some napkins please!

610
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,554
It's okay.

611
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,723
You're wet.

612
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,476
Napkins!

613
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:20,937
There are some napkins here.

614
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,314
I'm not that wet.

615
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,490
Thanks for the gloves.

616
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:56,931
Right after this movement,

617
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,396
attach this.

618
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:07,442
Should I connect them?
/Yeah, next.

619
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,487
How many do we have left?

620
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,119
I think two.

621
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:19,912
Are there any more down there?

622
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:21,956
No.

623
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,208
Then, two.

624
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:41,601
What?

625
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,776
Don't you have a lot of women?

626
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,654
What women?

627
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,119
Is it because of sex?

628
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,497
This kiss, I mean.

629
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,881
How do I get into the office?

630
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:56,425
What office?

631
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,388
Oh, Unicom Seoul.

632
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,015
Can't you see it's right over there.

633
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,851
Over there.

634
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:18,739
I've tried touching.

635
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,495
I really like kissing.

636
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,872
I think kissing is nice.

637
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:36,340
But I've tried once.

638
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:43,306
He was a close friend.

639
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,100
We were talking about this.

640
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:51,397
So one day we decided to do it.

641
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:56,611
We weren't even drunk,
but we went to a motel.

642
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:05,828
But it didn't work.

643
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,457
Why not?

644
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,004
I don't know.

645
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:21,093
Well, it hurt so much. ..

646
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:24,513
And it didn't feel right.

647
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:28,851
Like we shouldn't be doing it.

648
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,104
So we stopped.

649
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,568
What about the guy?

650
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:39,403
Him?

651
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:47,870
He was just a good friend.

652
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:56,796
And we tried it another time.

653
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,966
But it still didn't work.

654
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:09,600
Director Kwon, you have a visitor.

655
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:12,269
I guess I'm late.

656
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:16,607
Oh, it's you. I have to finish up.

657
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,150
You want to wait?

658
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,614
What did you shoot?
/It's nothing.

659
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,241
Can you get some coffee for the guest?

660
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,617
No, I'm fine.

661
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,453
It'll only take a minute.
I'm almost done.

662
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,124
Hello.
/Hello.

663
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,616
Take off your glasses, you bastard.

664
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:17,251
Do you think that you'd be
enjoying all this if you weren't
the nephew of the owner?

665
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,713
Okay. That's enough.

666
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,552
Son of a bitch.

667
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:35,728
You bastard. You get this job just
because you're related to the boss,

668
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:38,814
And what did you stay to me?

669
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:46,697
You think people call you director
cause they respect you?

670
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,534
You loser.

671
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:56,290
What did you say to me? I'm fired?
/I was just. ..

672
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,668
You bastard.

673
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:08,719
I could kill types like you,
and nobody would give a shit.

674
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,305
Where's the bitch?

675
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,557
The fucking bitch.

676
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,060
You two did it, didn't you?

677
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,854
Bastards.

678
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:24,652
If I catch you two fooling
around in the editing room,

679
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,030
I swear I'm gonna kill both of
you right then and there.

680
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,508
To Sadang-dong!

681
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:48,801
To Sungbook-dong.

682
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:51,846
Yeah, you go.

683
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:55,683
Soojung, get in. I'll drop you off.

684
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:59,645
Are you sure? Alright, then.

685
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,234
Bye Youngsoo.
/Yeah, bye.

686
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:53,198
So, this is how it turns out.

687
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:15,471
Are you crying?

688
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:21,852
What's wrong?
/Nothing. I don't know why I'm crying.

689
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,688
What is it?

690
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:28,734
I've never kissed like this before.

691
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,622
I've only had crushes.

692
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,008
Really?

693
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:00,224
What?

694
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,562
Kissing?

695
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,777
Crushes?

696
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:26,625
Come here.

697
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,435
Hi.

698
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,567
Did you go someplace?

699
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,069
I had to get some medication.

700
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:57,239
Why?

701
01:23:58,742 --> 01:23:59,950
I'm not gonna tell.

702
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,998
Why didn't you go to work today?
You weren't there yesterday, either.

703
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:10,461
Did you call the office?

704
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:12,087
Yes.

705
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,301
I'm gonna go back.

706
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,099
What kind of medication did you get?

707
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,437
I told you I'm not gonna tell you.

708
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:37,047
I want to suck your
whole body. Every inch.

709
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,969
I want to sleep with you.

710
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,180
Really?

711
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,475
Yes.

712
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,313
I want to do it, too.

713
01:25:57,777 --> 01:25:59,361
Really?

714
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:03,657
Let's do it somewhere really nice.

715
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:15,586
Do you want to go to Cheju Island?

716
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:18,797
Yes.

717
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:33,770
It's just a spoon.

718
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,969
Hey, big brother, what are you doing?

719
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,348
Mommy made chicken.

720
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,226
What's this?

721
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:16,772
I ate too much.

722
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:19,691
Why are you drawing that?

723
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,237
Get out.

724
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,252
You're not making films anymore?

725
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:43,382
Kodak doesn't develop 8mm's anymore.

726
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:48,595
Then there's no use for all of this?

727
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:51,431
You can't make films anymore?

728
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:55,978
Get out.

729
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,399
Okay.

730
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,819
That's pretty.

731
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,084
Are you going out with Jaehoon?

732
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:07,257
Why?

733
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,550
Well, nothing.

734
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:11,261
Just. ..you know. ..

735
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:17,517
The assistant got the phone,
and he asked for you, not me.

736
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,697
I thought you two were
doing a film together.

737
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:37,829
I'm not gonna beg to him.

738
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,795
1 00 million won isn't
pocket money, you know.
No matter how rich you are.

739
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:54,846
Yeah, shit, he's loaded.

740
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:03,814
He's loaded,
but he isn't returning my calls.

741
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:35,720
You. .. are you two really going out?

742
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:40,892
I guess it's true since
you're changing the subject.

743
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,362
You can tell me. Come on.

744
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:05,750
It just happened.

745
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:09,880
It hasn't been long.

746
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:34,821
Are you alright?

747
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:38,700
It's cold.

748
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:45,749
I'll show you something.
It's really funny.

749
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:49,461
Mr. Kwon!

750
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,379
It's cold.

751
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,668
Look at me.

752
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:32,462
Look at my face.

753
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:43,265
I had a big crush on you.

754
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:52,566
You did?

755
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:58,113
Okay. I'll stop.

756
01:32:58,614 --> 01:33:00,532
Really. ..

757
01:33:06,622 --> 01:33:09,291
I undressed your panties, right?

758
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:22,304
I undressed your panties,
and could have, but I didn't, right?

759
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,234
Yes. Let's stop.

760
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:43,575
That was a scare, wasn't it?

761
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:52,917
You know you were about to rape me.

762
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:56,296
Rape?

763
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:04,512
Rape, my foot!

764
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:40,382
I should have stopped after
I took off your panties.

765
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:22,674
These are hard to take off.

766
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:33,578
Hey, what are you doing?
I'll get it. Move.

767
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,799
Come over here.

768
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,685
How do you open this?

769
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:00,480
Pull, and turn it.

770
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,195
Are you guys picking a lock,
for heaven sakes?

771
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:08,446
Long time no see.

772
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:12,909
Oh, Jaehoon, you're here.

773
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:16,579
Come in.
/Hi. Hi, Youngsoo.

774
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:20,083
Come in. Come in.
She's a writer and works with me.

775
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:20,792
Hi.
/Hello.

776
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:22,752
Take this.
/Thank you.

777
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:25,755
Sit down.
/How come it's so dark?

778
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:27,841
Where are the lights?

779
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:29,133
I've brought some baked
sweet potatoes.

780
01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:30,885
Sit down.
/Thank you.

781
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:33,638
This is nice.

782
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,891
How have you been?
/Fine.

783
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:38,768
What about dinner?

784
01:37:39,603 --> 01:37:40,812
This will do.

785
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:43,481
I'll pour you a glass of wine.
Can you hand me the chopsticks.

786
01:37:43,899 --> 01:37:44,858
Thank you.

787
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:04,669
Soojung, how's life treating
you these days?

788
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:06,880
Are you enjoying it?

789
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:15,763
What about you Mr. Kwon.
How is it with you these days?

790
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:30,945
I'm wearing long underwear.

791
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:45,084
Shit! underwear.

792
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:55,511
You told me to quit,
that I'd be able to find another job.

793
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,639
That's what you said, right?

794
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,436
Yes.

795
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:14,906
If I quit. ..

796
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,332
Let's do a film together.

797
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:26,584
Together.

798
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,129
Then, don't quit.

799
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,386
That's not what you said before.

800
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:54,612
How can you say that so casually?

801
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:04,580
Soojung Yang, why should I?

802
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:56,382
I'll tell you one.
/Okay. Just a minute.

803
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:00,136
Soojung, your phone is ringing.

804
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:04,223
Guess who laughes 1 0 minutes
in the morning and cries
1 0 minutes before going to bed?

805
01:41:04,516 --> 01:41:06,851
Hello?

806
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:08,728
It's me.

807
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:10,480
Jaehoon?

808
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,649
Yes, this is Jaehoon.

809
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,277
This is a surprise.

810
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:21,574
I'm here at Kojan Station.

811
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:24,368
Really?

812
01:41:25,537 --> 01:41:29,248
Yes. I just came. I wanted to see you.

813
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,251
How did you get here?

814
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:34,170
Are you really at Kojan Station?

815
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:39,092
Yes. I didn't bring my car,
I took the subway.

816
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:41,594
I didn't know a subway ride
could be so nice.

817
01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:45,264
I'm not very far from there.

818
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:51,604
Be careful.

819
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:55,858
Oh, be careful.

820
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:05,952
It's okay.

821
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:09,664
Actually it's more dangerous
if there's no cracking sound.

822
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,667
Then, the whole chunk of ice
can crumble in all at once.

823
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:14,460
The water would be so cold.

824
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:15,670
It's okay.

825
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:20,675
There's too much cracking.

826
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:23,678
I told you this means that it's safer.

827
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,849
Look at this.

828
01:42:28,517 --> 01:42:29,725
It's gum wrapping paper.

829
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:35,731
It says "Kiss" gum.

830
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:38,693
Yeah, it really does.

831
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:41,612
Give me a kiss.

832
01:42:51,748 --> 01:42:53,666
Thanks for coming.

833
01:42:57,421 --> 01:42:58,963
Do you want to slide?

834
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:01,549
I'm heavy, you know.

835
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:53,392
Junga!

836
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:10,243
Get up.

837
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:17,458
I called the wrong name, didn't I?

838
01:44:19,878 --> 01:44:22,505
Soojung, are you angry?

839
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,801
I'm sorry, really.

840
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:34,767
What got into me. ..?

841
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:41,232
It was just a slip of the tongue,

842
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:46,195
What? I'm not Junga now?

843
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,665
There aren't any taxis here,
let's try over there.

844
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:41,542
Where are you going?

845
01:45:42,627 --> 01:45:47,423
There might be some taxis on
that big street. Let's go.

846
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:52,256
What do you think you're doing?

847
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:54,508
Where have you been?

848
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:56,177
I've been. ..

849
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:00,055
Do you know how worried sick I was?

850
01:48:02,225 --> 01:48:03,726
Were you worried?

851
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:08,022
Do you know how I ran all over
the place like I was crazy?

852
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:11,650
Really, like I was crazy.
I really thought I would go crazy.

853
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:14,695
What is there to be so angry about. ..?
Did I commit such a major crime?

854
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,490
Don't shout.
/What?

855
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:18,991
You're telling me not to shout?

856
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:22,953
Do you know that I'm going
crazy because of you.

857
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:24,914
Okay, I did. ..

858
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:29,668
So I called someone else's name.

859
01:48:29,794 --> 01:48:31,462
Is this as if I committed murder?

860
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:34,215
Why are you making me go crazy?

861
01:48:34,299 --> 01:48:36,425
Okay. You don't have to die for it.

862
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,052
Are you satisfied?

863
01:48:38,136 --> 01:48:42,097
Did I mean to call her name?

864
01:48:42,557 --> 01:48:44,391
No, Soojung.

865
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:47,520
Right?

866
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:51,899
This is driving me crazy!

867
01:48:52,108 --> 01:48:56,362
Soojung, what's
so important about a name.

868
01:49:18,635 --> 01:49:24,223
Okay. It's my fault.

869
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:34,483
Soojung. ..

870
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:18,611
Is it hard to learn to play?

871
01:50:20,363 --> 01:50:21,447
No.

872
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:28,203
How long would I have to
take lessons to play that?

873
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:33,167
Maybe learn up to Czerny 1 00.

874
01:50:36,588 --> 01:50:39,048
Or maybe, an easier text might do.

875
01:50:42,427 --> 01:50:44,386
You seem to enjoy
having the piano here.

876
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:48,557
This is the kind that
Stevie Wonder plays.

877
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:50,893
Stevie Wonder plays this piano?

878
01:50:51,603 --> 01:50:53,520
It gets recorded inside.

879
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:55,439
Automatically?

880
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:57,566
What are you doing?

881
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:00,402
Are we going or not?
/We're going.

882
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:01,695
Let's go then.

883
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:46,907
Hello?
/Hello?

884
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:49,618
Jaehoon?

885
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,578
Oh, you answered.

886
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:55,666
Nobody else is here.

887
01:51:57,001 --> 01:51:59,503
Why is your cell phone turned off?

888
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:03,757
The batteries are dead.

889
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:05,092
Oh, I see.

890
01:52:08,346 --> 01:52:11,765
You know, about our date. ..

891
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:15,519
Yes. Why?

892
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:20,733
Can we postpone to tomorrow?

893
01:52:21,818 --> 01:52:25,738
Tomorrow? How can we go to
Cheju Island in just one day?

894
01:52:26,322 --> 01:52:29,783
Well, not Cheju, we can do
that some other time.

895
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:35,038
Let's meet in Wooie-dong.
I know a quiet and nice hotel there.

896
01:52:39,627 --> 01:52:40,794
Why?

897
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:45,382
Just. ..

898
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:50,137
I just want to.

899
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:56,810
Tomorrow's a Sunday, right?

900
01:52:56,895 --> 01:52:58,979
Yes, and that's also another reason.

901
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:04,526
You don't want to?

902
01:53:07,697 --> 01:53:09,948
Do we have to go all the way
to Cheju Island?

903
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:14,369
Do you think I'm obsessed
with Cheju Island, or something?

904
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:33,347
Soojung?

905
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:51,698
Okay. Let's meet tomorrow.

906
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:56,662
Is that okay? Great.

907
01:53:58,540 --> 01:53:59,832
Yes.

908
01:54:11,636 --> 01:54:13,262
1 6 to 1 0

909
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:43,667
<NAUGHT SHALL GO ILL
WHEN YOU FIND YOUR MARE>

910
01:56:00,411 --> 01:56:01,703
You're here.

911
01:56:03,665 --> 01:56:04,915
Come in.

912
01:56:07,585 --> 01:56:08,794
So, is this the room?

913
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:20,449
Open them like this.

914
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:22,576
This side, too.

915
01:57:24,245 --> 01:57:26,413
And bend you knees.

916
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:36,381
Hold still.

917
01:57:39,093 --> 01:57:40,635
It hurts.

918
01:57:40,845 --> 01:57:42,637
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

919
01:57:44,724 --> 01:57:46,725
Really, it won't hurt.

920
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,645
Don't move.

921
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:02,032
Relax.

922
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:04,868
Relax your body.

923
01:58:07,997 --> 01:58:11,917
Really, I'll make sure
it doesn't hurt, I promise.

924
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:15,879
It really hurts!

925
01:58:16,964 --> 01:58:18,632
Just a little more.

926
01:58:18,716 --> 01:58:22,135
A little more.
A little more. Hold still.

927
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:25,305
It hurts!

928
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:37,317
That's it.

929
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:41,196
Ow! It hurts!

930
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,615
I'll be gentle.

931
01:58:43,699 --> 01:58:45,742
Very very gentle.

932
01:59:02,176 --> 01:59:12,853
This is Soojung, right?

933
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:15,689
Yes. It's me, Soojung.

934
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:49,014
What should we do?

935
01:59:54,937 --> 01:59:56,938
Really.

936
01:59:58,149 --> 01:59:59,900
Is it supposed to be so much?

937
02:00:01,027 --> 02:00:02,110
I don't know.

938
02:00:03,362 --> 02:00:05,864
It is a lot.

939
02:00:07,325 --> 02:00:09,242
What should we do?

940
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:12,996
Should we take it with us?

941
02:00:15,499 --> 02:00:16,791
Do you want to?

942
02:00:20,796 --> 02:00:21,963
What should we do?

943
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:36,561
You have to use cold water.

944
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:38,897
Really?

945
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:46,154
Why go to all that trouble?

946
02:00:48,115 --> 02:00:49,115
What?

947
02:00:50,409 --> 02:00:53,995
Why don't you just take it
home with you, then?

948
02:00:58,584 --> 02:01:01,169
I thought you didn't want me to.

949
02:01:03,881 --> 02:01:07,509
You don't like me washing
out your blood?

950
02:01:10,846 --> 02:01:14,224
We can't just leave
our trace like this.

951
02:01:15,768 --> 02:01:17,060
Do you want me to stop?

952
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:20,855
No.

953
02:01:22,733 --> 02:01:23,775
Go on.

954
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:29,614
I want to take it with me.

955
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:33,702
But don't you think that's
being too superstitious.

956
02:01:36,455 --> 02:01:41,042
Okay. I'll do it.

957
02:02:17,204 --> 02:02:18,121
Come here.

958
02:02:26,547 --> 02:02:30,091
Are you hungry?

959
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,927
A little.

960
02:02:36,265 --> 02:02:39,976
You've lost blood,
so we should eat some red meat.

961
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:44,147
What?

962
02:02:48,652 --> 02:02:51,654
Are you a good cook?

963
02:02:53,157 --> 02:02:54,741
I don't know.

964
02:02:55,618 --> 02:03:00,830
I'm not good at anything,
so you take care of it.

965
02:03:03,459 --> 02:03:05,001
Really?

966
02:03:07,046 --> 02:03:09,089
What should we do?

967
02:03:10,299 --> 02:03:12,300
Do what?

968
02:03:17,014 --> 02:03:24,854
I'm so happy and tingly that I don't
care if I'm not making any sense.

969
02:03:27,316 --> 02:03:30,110
You really don't mind
me not being good?

970
02:03:32,196 --> 02:03:34,197
I don't mind.

971
02:03:35,366 --> 02:03:45,959
You're my. .. I've found my other pair,
so I really have no problem.

972
02:03:48,879 --> 02:03:50,338
Me neither.

973
02:04:01,642 --> 02:04:08,148
I will correct all the faults I have.
I swear on my life that I will.

974
02:04:10,067 --> 02:04:12,068
I promise, Soojung.
