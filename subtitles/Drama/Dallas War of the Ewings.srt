00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:46,212
for my new methane rig.

162
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:48,081
I don't want
to fight with you, cousin,

163
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:49,449
but oil is here and now.

164
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,686
Methane is 20 years away
from being profitable.

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,023
Until there's infrastructure,
until there's demand...

166
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,777
You're wrong. Okay?
Methane is here and now.

167
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,660
But I'll never be able
to make it profitable

168
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,329
unless this company
invests in more rigs.

169
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:02,665
[ Sighs ]
John Ross is right.

170
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:07,170
This company does need to be
vertically integrated.

171
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,739
But for now,
moving Southfork Oil

172
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:12,075
is being taken care of
by our lease arrangement

173
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:13,109
with Hughes Trucking.

174
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,112
And because of Christopher,

175
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,647
other energy companies
are looking into methane

176
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,715
as an alternative.

177
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,784
We have to get there first.

178
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:25,155
So if we're gonna take this to
a vote, and I think we should...

179
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,092
I vote with Christopher
for the rig.

180
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,130
You and Christopher
have 60% of this company.

181
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:34,998
I have 30%.
Elena's got 10%.

182
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,301
You always talk about this being
a family business,

183
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,503
but your side of the family
is always gonna win.

184
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,140
John Ross, you always think
it's you against us.

185
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,775
When you stop
thinking like that,

186
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,678
you're gonna realize you're just
as much a part of this company

187
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,746
as the rest of us.

188
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,122
Well,
that sounded objective.

189
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,793
Would you give me and John Ross
a minute, please?

190
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,462
Yeah.

191
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:06,331
Thank you.

192
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:13,338
I'm gonna be nice
so I can say I tried,

193
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:15,473
but we both know
it's only a matter of time

194
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:18,242
before you hang yourself and I
get you out of this company.

195
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:20,678
Sounds like a threat.

196
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:22,413
It is.

197
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:45,871
Elena: If you could scan
the notes we had

198
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,206
from the meeting last week and
e-mail them to my assistant,

199
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,607
that would be great.

200
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,843
Okay. I'll get
right on that, Ms. Ramos.

201
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:56,682
Please don't cc
anyone on that.

202
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:57,883
Thank you.

203
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:02,654
Last few weeks, you've
barely looked at me, Elena.

204
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,156
You and I are gonna be
working together every day now.

205
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,591
[ Sighs ]

206
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,427
Look, I know I wore
my welcome out with you, Elena.

207
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:11,296
I ain't asking for any
third or fourth chances.

208
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,467
I just hope that you and I can
work together like we used to.

209
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:19,205
It'll never be the way
it used to, John Ross.

210
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:33,286
I met this other woman
before, but...

211
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,420
Ms. Sutter.

212
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:36,756
It's great
to see you again.

213
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,391
Thank you
for flying me out here.

214
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:39,826
And first class.

215
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:41,428
I'll tell you,
I felt so pampered,

216
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:42,930
I never wanted that flight
to end, Mr. Ewing.

217
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,364
Please, sit.

218
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,599
Ms. Sutter was
just filling me in

219
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:49,235
on the conversations you had
when you met her in des moines,

220
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,538
and what she's
going to testify to.

221
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,974
She truly is your secret weapon,
Christopher.

222
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:56,409
Yes, she is.

223
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,812
No, I'm glad to be helping you
get your annulment.

224
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,447
I'm also glad to be helping

225
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:02,882
put the woman who stole
my identity behind bars,

226
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,819
so you can get custody
of your kids once they're born.

227
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:08,622
But I'm worried
about my brother.

228
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:10,758
I still haven't found Tommy.

229
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:15,363
And I think he's in hiding
because of you.

230
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:16,718
If I help you,
you need to promise

231
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:18,366
you're not gonna try
to put him in jail

232
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,567
once he shows up.

233
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,336
I know you hate him,

234
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,371
but he's just messed up
because of our parents dying.

235
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:29,277
I know what he did to you, but
he deserves a second chance.

236
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,879
Ma'am,
that's not up to us.

237
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,682
I've watched
enough "Law and Order"

238
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:33,984
to know it's you he wronged

239
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,952
and it's you
who can press charges.

240
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:41,425
Now, I like Dallas,
but I'm fine going home.

241
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,933
Your brother
was her partner.

242
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,768
He stole from my family,
tried to defraud me.

243
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,703
He deserves
to be punished.

244
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:59,309
But my babies are what's
most important right now.

245
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,845
I won't press charges.

246
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,913
I promise.

247
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,815
Then I'm your girl.

248
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,984
'Cause in all honesty,
I would've been P.O.'d

249
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,453
if I didn't get to confront
that bitch in court.

250
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,655
You still have no idea
who she is?

251
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,889
No.

252
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,858
She legally changed her name
to yours.

253
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,527
But once we've got her
on the stand,

254
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,929
we can compel her.

255
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,500
Now, I've arranged a car and hotel
for you, but I think it's best

256
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,035
for you to stay out of sight
until the hearing.

257
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,703
Surprise attack.

258
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,404
I like that.

259
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,342
As much as I think I'm gonna
like a first-class hotel.

260

imagined it would be, Charlotte.

Angus really created
something wonderful

264
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,412
for your husband's
new office.

265
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,414
Let me go see
about having it delivered.

266
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,413
With a bow?

267
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,549
Yeah.

268
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,026
Whatever perfume
you're wearing, Annie,

269
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,492
it's very seductive.

270
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:27,889
It's much better
than that scent you wore

271
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:29,790
when we were married.

272
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:32,425
That one was slightly feral.

273
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,860
What do you want, Harris?

274
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,795
I thought we had nothing left
to say to each other.

275
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:38,397
Fortunately for both of us,
that's not true, Annie.

276
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,834
I found our daughter.

277
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:46,105
Emma's alive and well.

278
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,773
If you give me back
that tape you made of me

279
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,009
for Sue Ellen...

280
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:51,877
I'll tell you where she is.

281
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,272
I know it must come
as a shock to you, Annie,

282
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,206
but I never stopped
looking for our little Emma.

283
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,774
I've had private investigators
looking for her

284
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,409
for the last 20 years.

285
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:15,278
Oh, my God.

286
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,079
Where is she?

287
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,480
That's just the rub, Annie.

288
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:20,849
You see, I know you think
that tape you got of me

289
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:22,251
confessing
to money laundering

290
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:24,920
is protecting Sue Ellen
from having to kowtow to me,

291
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,422
but I got to
protect myself, too.

292
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:30,026
So you get me that tape,

293
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,429
every copy, and I'll
tell you where she is.

294
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:36,865
I don't believe you.

295
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,401
I had some DNA
taken from Emma.

296
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:40,903
It's at an S.M.U. Lab.

297
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:42,904
Now, a test proves
that she's my daughter.

298
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,007
I think you can tell
just by looking at her,

299
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,242
but you might want
to run a DNA test, too.

300
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:48,777
Put your mind at ease.

301
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:51,046
Oh, and you got 48 hours
to get me that tape,

302
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,883
or I'll make sure that Emma
goes back to being dead to you.

Why do you care

gets an annulment
or divorce?

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,962
and as a little girl,
that's what my mother called me.

480
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,266
But my father, he likes
to call me by my first name...

481
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:33,304
By my aunt's name...
Pamela.

I changed my name

487
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:50,788
to Rebecca Sutter
because of my father.

488
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:52,824
Because your crazy father
is stuck in a feud

489
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:54,292
that should've ended
decades ago.

490

Christopher.

The truth is, I would've
done anything for you.

495
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:14,280
But sadly, I think we're past
any declarations of love

we may have once had
for each other.

497
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:18,951
So let's
just get to the point.

498
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:20,952
I have
no interest in money.

499
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:23,955
My father can buy and sell you
many times over.

500

is for my children

501

in their lives.

502

I never did growing up,

503
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:31,462
and I'm afraid
that's made me do

504
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:33,298
a great many stupid things
in life.

505
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,499
Like conning me.

506
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:35,934
And lying to me.

510
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,544
I'd like
to make you an offer.

511
00:28:44,578 --> 00:28:46,479
I keep primary custody
of the children,

512

but you can see them
every day.

You screw over my son

514

and then <i>you</i> want
to make an offer?

515

You certainly are
your father's daughter.

My father thinks...
And I agree with him...

517
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:01,289
That since we were married
when you created Ewing Energies,

518
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,124
that I should
get a part of it.

I would like 30%
of your ownership.

You must know that if we go
to divorce court...

521
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:11,131
Our marriage was a fraud
and it will be annulled.

522
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,566
And an annulment will get you
no part of my family's company.

523
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,468
I mean, the fact
that you kept from me

524
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,303
that you're
Cliff Barnes' daughter

525
00:29:17,337 --> 00:29:19,872
proves that our marriage
was a sham from the start.

526
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:22,808
If you don't take
my deal now,

527

I will go to court
and fight you

528
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:28,045
with the full weight
of my father's power.

529

that destroying the ewings

That's what Cliff's wanted
all along.

That's why he put a mole
in this family for two years.

537

You may all think
this is about the methane,

but believe you me,
Barnes' plan is personal.

That's why his daughter is
carrying those two Ewing heirs.
