1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,250
<i>Why isn't anyone helping me get up?</i>

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,510
<i>Why?</i>

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,770
<i>Let's just end this here.</i>

4
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,630
<i>This is too hard.</i>

5
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,350
<i>It's just too hard.</i>

6
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,899
<i>No.</i>

7
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,520
<i>I have to live.</i>

8
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,679
<i>I want to live.</i>

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,139
<i>Someone...</i>

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,779
<i>Someone grab me.</i>

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,780
<i>I want someone to grab me!</i>

12
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,020
How much do you think
this building costs?

13
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,970
Excuse me?

14
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,720
Do you think that there's
anyone out there

15
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,930
who'd want to exchange
their life for this?

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,739
By any chance...

17
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,730
Do you know of any
restrooms in the area

18
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,740
where a lot of homeless
people frequents?

19
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,900
What?

20
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,749
I'm sorry, but the patients in this
area needs absolute peace and quiet.

21
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,709
You cannot interview
anyone in this area.

22
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,960
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk is
admitted here, isn't he?

23
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,230
Yes, he is.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,230
Then I guess we can't do
anything else about it.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,900
I'm sure he'll have
to come out sometime.

26
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,110
Let's just wait for him.

27
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,000
- Yes, Director.
- How's his condition now?

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,210
Okay.

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,460
Don't let him out of your sight
until I get there.

30
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,279
Okay.

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,249
Add him to the family registry quickly.

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,860
But all the reporters
are there already.

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,500
Reporters?

34
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,080
There's Kang Ji Hyuk right there.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,359
Is it true that you're
Chairman Kang Sung Wook's hidden son?

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,139
What's the reason for keeping
that truth a secret all this time?

37
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,969
How do you think things will change as
you come on board as a new heir?

38
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,529
When did you find out that you're
Chairman Kang Sung Wook's son?

39
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,420
Is that fact related to
your recent accident?

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you guys talking about?

41
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,350
- Aren't you Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk?
- Kang Ji Hyuk?

42
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,260
My name is Kim Ji Hyuk.

43
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,700
<i>Ji Hyuk.</i>

44
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,800
Ji Hyuk.

45
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,690
What a relief to see that you're okay.

46
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,030
I'm so glad to see you, Ji Hyuk.

47
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,940
Do you remember anything
from your childhood?

48
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,200
No.

49
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,360
I don't remember a thing.

50
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,219
Let's not rush anything.

51
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,739
Once we come to terms with our own
emotions, and get used to each other

52
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,100
I'm sure we'll be able to form a bond
as father and son, and as family then.

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,540
You understand what I'm
saying, don't you?

54
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,770
No, I have no idea what you're saying.

55
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,849
Okay, I understand.

56
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,770
I'm sure you must be flustered since
that's the way I'm feeling right now.

57
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,630
What I'm saying is that we both should
take some time to get used to the idea.

58
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,030
Get some rest for now.

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,770
What do you do for a living?

60
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,130
You'll find that out soon enough.

61
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,189
Do I have a mother?

62
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,079
Of course you do.

63
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,540
Really?

64
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,260
- Does she know?
- Of course.

65
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,720
You should've just let
the sleeping dogs lie.

66
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,430
We're just going to complicate
everything for one another.

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,490
I can't do that.

68
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,360
Because you're my son.

69
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,800
Because I'm your son?

70
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,250
What's the point of seeking me out now?

71
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,439
Why are they getting so curious about
our family registry all of a sudden?

72
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
I think they received a request
from the investigators.

73
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,190
I think they must've
discovered something

74
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,589
that may have been
done illegally.

75
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,639
Ugh, why now of all times?

76
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,680
Forget it. I don't
think we need to worry

77
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,740
about it since the
office will soon change.

78
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,379
Did you look into the foreign matters
that I told you to look into?

79
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,329
Yes, I think we'll get an
answer from them soon.

80
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,609
You think it'll work?

81
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,409
I think there's more than
a 90 percent chance that it will.

82
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,610
Is that right?

83
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,699
And one more thing.

84
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,759
That guy...

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,679
I want you to confuse him. Throw money,
women, and whatever else at him.

86
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,999
So that he doesn't have a chance
to think about anything else.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,130
Yes, Sir.

88
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,790
That's the life history
of Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk

89
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,780
that we have of
him up to this point.

90
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,640
Don't you rather that you didn't know
any of that?

91
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,259
- Why do I have to know any of this?
- Because he's part of the family.

92
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,340
He's someone whom you need to serve.

93
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,059
I started searching for Kang Ji Hyuk's

94
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,230
whereabouts about a year ago
per Chairman Kang's orders.

95
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,149
I found out about Kang Ji
Hyuk's existence very recently

96
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,990
and I was able to find
his DNA records purely

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,850
by coincidence from
his recent accident.

98
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,380
That's the result of all my findings.

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,759
I just prepared some things that
I thought you may need for the moment.

100
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,229
Just let me know if there's
anything else that you need.

101
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,980
And one more thing.

102
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,920
This is the key to the car
that you'll be driving.

103
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,910
Let me know if the car
isn't to your liking

104
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,490
and I'll swap it out
for something else.

105
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,590
Are you trying to recruit me right now?

106
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,259
You know how those sports teams always
gets the players whatever they want

107
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,669
when trying to recruit them?

108
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,360
Getting them an amazing place to live
with a fancy car to boot.

109
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,800
There's no one in this world
who tries to recruit a son.

110
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,280
I'm sure you guys can do all this
since that guy has so much money.

111
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,569
Anyways, this is nice.

112
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,110
Getting a chance to live...

113
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,170
in an amazing place like this
for having met a nice set of parents.

114
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,230
Money sure is nice.

115
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,770
<i>I want you to bring that scoundrel
back here and rip his heart out!</i>

116
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,640
What floor are we even on?

117
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,110
Crap!

118
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,440
Thank you.

119
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,440
For some strange reason,
I keep having to receive help from you.

120
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,040
Um...

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,000
Call me anytime if there's
anything else that you need.

122
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah, sure.

123
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,890
But...

124
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,460
What is it that you do for them?

125
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,530
I'm an employee of Hyun Sung Group.

126
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,160
I take care of
Chairman Kang's family.

127
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,346
Really?

128
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,096
Then I guess you must get to see
those parents of mine pretty often?

129
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,770
- Yes, I do.
- Go give them a message for me.

130
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,800
Tell them that I'm
tearfully grateful for

131
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,320
buying me this grand
house and the fancy car.

132
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,049
The son that they just threw away
and abandoned for the past 30 years...

133
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,849
is speechless with utter gratefulness.

134
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,590
Please make sure to
relay that message.

135
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,160
Yes, Sir.

136
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,100
Now it's raining?

137
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,690
Well that's just depressing.

138
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,700
You told me to let you know if there's
anything else I might need, right?

139
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,109
Yes, tell me.

140
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,799
What is it that you need?

141
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,340
An extra umbrella so
that I may be able to

142
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,900
shield a lady from getting
soaked in the rain.

143
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,970
Dong Suk.

144
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,480
You're going to get up from that bed
as if nothing even happened, right?

145
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,449
I've been so afraid...

146
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,060
and because of that...

147
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,540
I've never even once got to
tell you that I love you.

148
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,490
So please just get up from that bed.

149
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,530
I can't live without you.

150
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh my, look who it is!
Ji Hyuk's here.

151
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,439
Yes, it's me.

152
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,940
- Are you well?
- Of course!

153
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,829
Why are you still following me?

154
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,810
It's my job to do so.

155
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,530
Mom!

156
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,619
- Mom!
- What are you doing!

157
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,220
Get away from me!
You're grossing me out!

158
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,289
Mom, do you have any idea
how much I've missed you?

159
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,509
- You must've been so worried about me.
- Don't' talk crazy.

160
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,589
Why would I worry about you?
I'm busy enough as is with my own life.

161
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,949
Excuse me, but are you his mother?

162
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,899
His mother?
Mother, my butt.

163
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,339
He thinks that all the middle aged
women in this world are his mom.

164
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,429
Especially if there's something
that he can gain from the woman.

165
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,740
I bet he probably has
more than 30 women

166
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,069
in this market alone
whom he calls 'mom'.

167
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,299
No, Mom.
They're just regular moms.

168
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,260
But you're my mom.

169
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,680
Stop kissing my face.
Hey!

170
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,709
Where and what have you been
doing these past few days?

171
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,290
And... who is this young lady?

172
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,829
Did you cause another accident?

173
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,330
Accident?

174
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,159
Yeah, I did.
A huge accident.

175
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,620
You didn't.

176
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,779
- Before you're even married?
- Excuse me?

177
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,539
Come on, Mom!
What do you take me for?

178
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,889
You're painting a bad picture of me
in front of this lady.

179
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,260
Don't let her mislead you.
I'm much more virtuous than I may look.

180
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,950
Mrs. Hong!
Mrs. Hong, Ji Hyuk is...

181
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,499
Ji... Ji Hyuk!

182
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,289
Your Highness!

183
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,320
Please forgive me for
not having recognized

184
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,380
your status to have
served you properly.

185
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,740
I swear to pledge the rest of my life
in your servitude, Your Highness!

186
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,969
What's wrong with you now?

187
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,420
I told you that I caused
a slight accident.

188
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,439
- What is he talking about?
- Ji Hyuk is...

189
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,530
You know the company,
Hyun Sung Group, right?

190
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,639
Yeah.

191
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,710
He's that Chairman's son! It's all
over the internet and the newspapers!

192
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,250
- Is he serious?
- It's not a sure thing yet.

193
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,740
But that's what those
people are saying.

194
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,910
There's something that
I have to show you.

195
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,430
Is what I heard on the news... true?

196
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,680
What is it?

197
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,370
Is he mom's son too?

198
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,410
- Or is he just your son, Dad?
- Your mom gave birth to him.

199
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,280
Honey.

200
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,710
Madame Choi, he came from your womb.
You can't even remember that?

201
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,120
This is crazy.

202
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,900
Thanks, Dad.

203
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,140
You kept this a secret
for how many decades

204
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,829
just so that you could
surprise me like this?

205
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,729
I sincerely thank you. It was the
biggest surprise gift of my life.

206
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,670
Surprise!

207
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,820
What was the point of
lying to Jin Ah too?

208
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,010
Then you go tell her the truth.

209
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,119
Tell her that we smacked a perfectly
healthy guy on his head

210
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,340
and lied about him
being our son just so

211
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,630
we could save
our own son's life.

212
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,450
Tell her that's how
evil her parents are.

213
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,140
Go tell her that.

214
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,009
Wow, this is like a scene
right out of a movie.

215
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,930
I feel like we're in a drama.
So they've

216
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,869
been watching you all this time?

217
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,549
Couldn't a document like this have
been forged if you guys had wanted to?

218
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,329
It's not like they were shot
in the head or something.

219
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,109
Why would they want to
claim you as their son?

220
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,050
What use could you be
to them when you've

221
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,000
got nothing to offer
them but your body?

222
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,409
Don't you agree?

223
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,650
If you have a hard time believing me,
I can get it authenticated for you.

224
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,820
Well... there's no need to go through
all that trouble.

225
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,110
Hey.

226
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,639
I think others are right about that.
You're being suspicious over nothing.

227
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,990
You should just be grateful that
they even sought out a son like you.

228
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,270
<i>I told you that I'm too
busy to come tomorrow.</i>

229
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,290
<i>What?</i>

230
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,380
Why do you have to put it like that?

231
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,030
Forget it.
I don't need your chump change.

232
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,850
You're the one who needs
to get it straight.

233
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,940
I'm hanging up.

234
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,170
- How unbelievable.
- Who was that?

235
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,400
That was Mr. Kim.

236
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,760
Mr. Kim from the butcher
shop at the market?

237
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,119
Yeah.

238
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,619
When I told him that I was going
to take the day off tomorrow

239
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,909
he threatened that he wasn't going
to pay me my wages that he owes me.

240
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,620
It's not like it's a lot of money.
It's just 100,000 won.

241
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,170
Maybe we should just
buy his butcher shop.

242
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,960
I bet 20-30 million won
is all we would need.

243
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,780
Ji Hyuk, since we're just
sitting around here,

244
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,060
should we call up those
girls for a date?

245
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,550
Don't you think that
they'd go out on a date

246
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,680
with us if we got them
a commercial deal?

247
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,480
- Dae Suk.
- Yeah?

248
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,480
Come over here.

249
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,350
We struggled through so much
all these years, haven't we?

250
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,760
I especially know how much
you struggled because of me.

251
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,199
Ji Hyuk.

252
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,519
Thank you so much for recognizing that.

253
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,910
There's no need to thank me.

254
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,409
Don't you know how well I know you?

255
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,040
You're...

256
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,660
What did you say, you jerk?
Buy the butcher shop?

257
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,560
Bite down.
Bite down real hard!

258
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,340
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

259
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,060
No, I had a few too much to drink,
and I must've been out of my mind.

260
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,340
I'm down on my knees right now.

261
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,360
Yes, I'll be there
first thing in the

262
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,050
morning, and get the
place sparkling clean.

263
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,080
Thank you, Mr. Kim.
Have a good night.

264
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,530
Satisfied?

265
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,990
Of course.

266
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,120
Don't you think that
you're being too harsh?

267
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,580
Let me enjoy some
of your spoils too.

268
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,249
And you should enjoy some of this too.
Doesn't this make you happy?

269
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,789
Your parents are filthy rich.

270
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,110
The parents that you've been wanting
to find all your life.

271
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,980
I didn't want to
find people like that.

272
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,419
Don't be a fool.

273
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,549
I'm sure you must've missed them.
They're your mom and dad.

274
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,569
I was curious to know who they were.

275
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,640
Curious to see how
they were living after

276
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,730
throwing their own child
out on the streets.

277
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,679
But...

278
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,210
they're living a high and mighty life.
Not only that, but they're chaebols.

279
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,629
I definitely didn't want to find
parents like that.

280
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,310
That's why I'm not as resentful.

281
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,090
I was about to get
really pissed about it.

282
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>Ji Hyuk.</i>

283
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,550
It's time for you to get
down from there now.

284
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,070
Your mom and dad aren't coming today.

285
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,450
Just get down from there.

286
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,190
Mom...

287
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,480
Dad...

288
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,889
I received a call from China.
All the preparations are complete.

289
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,259
Really?

290
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,096
- When did they say is possible?
- They said it can be done at anytime.

291
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,199
We said we would prepare the
medical team on our end.

292
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,720
We just have to send the team
as soon they are ready.

293
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,740
Good job.
You did nice work.

294
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,390
And also... I've been giving some
thought to the issue with our guy.

295
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,609
What do you think of sending him to
our branch office in the Philippines?

296
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,429
- To the Philippines?
- Yes.

297
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,590
Kidnapping is a frequent
occurrence over there,

298
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,780
and the chances of
recovering the victim is...

299
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,809
Okay, you do what you think is best.

300
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,710
Yes, Sir.
I will take care of it.

301
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,049
Yeah, what is it?

302
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,230
What?
Who's there?

303
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,250
That bastard is going to drive me
out of my mind.

304
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,950
This is a house?

305
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,880
Ugh, what's wrong with my eyes?

306
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,590
You!

307
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,679
Are you by any chance...

308
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,339
Are you Jin Ah?

309
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,510
- It's great to meet you!
- It's you, isn't it?

310
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,606
You're that trash.

311
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,939
How can you call a person
you just met, 'trash'?

312
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,719
- You have a nasty habit with words.
- Hey!

313
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,269
Do you know how much suffering
you put me through?

314
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,299
I think that you must be
mistaken about something.

315
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,210
But I've never met you
before in my life.

316
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,139
Anyways, it's great to meet you!

317
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,999
Have you lost your mind?
Let go of my hand.

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,230
I'm going to report you
for sexual harassment.

319
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,230
<i>What's going on out here?</i>

320
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,940
- Who are you?
- Mom.

321
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,409
Wait... you're...

322
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,670
You're...

323
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,249
Hello.

324
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,900
Mom, you know this guy?

325
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,630
<i>His name is Kang Ji Hyuk.</i>

326
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,230
He's your older brother.

327
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,900
This trash is my brother?

328
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,719
Dear God!
Thank you so much!

329
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,209
I feel so much better now.

330
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,750
We're going to take our
own doctors too, so

331
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,320
the surgery shouldn't
be a problem at all.

332
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,869
Dear God... thank you!

333
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,670
And that scoundrel, Ji Hyuk, won't be
coming around you anymore after today.

334
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,320
- I'm thinking of sending him overseas.
- Overseas?

335
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,529
Okay.

336
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,376
So treat him like
a real mother would for the night

337
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,100
so that he doesn't become
suspicious of anything.

338
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,999
For one last time.

339
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,980
Okay.

340
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,119
I guess what they say about blood
being thicker than water must be true.

341
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,890
Seeing how you two have already met
by chance like that.

342
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,929
This makes no sense.

343
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,829
I cannot accept any of this.
This seriously can't be happening.

344
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,420
Why of all people...

345
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,429
I should've called to
invite you over sooner.

346
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,820
But everything just
happened so suddenly,

347
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,240
and I needed some time
to prepare myself.

348
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:51,780
So... are you liking the house...
that you're living in right now?

349
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,799
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

350
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,220
- Is there anything else you need?
- No, there isn't.

351
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,400
I see.

352
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,929
- Um...
- Um...

353
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,289
You go ahead first, Honey.

354
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,090
I wasn't... oh, okay.

355
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,160
We really... would like to do something
really nice for you.

356
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,900
We know that you've had to suffer
quite a bit all these years.

357
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,790
We'd like to send you
on a trip overseas.

358
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,559
Why did you abandon me?

359
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,010
- Huh?
- Huh?

360
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,710
We didn't abandon you...

361
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,170
we lost you.

362
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,800
Then...

363
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,590
why seek me out now...

364
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,360
when you haven't sought me out
all these years?

365
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,679
Yeah, I've been curious about that too.

366
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,100
I've never once in my
life heard anything

367
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,539
about me having another
older sibling.

368
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,821
What's the reason for having
kept it a secret from me too?

369
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,500
That's because...

370
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,240
Why don't we do this?

371
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,200
Let's just...

372
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,459
Let's just live our lives
with some distance between us?

373
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,020
Instead of trying to force some
feelings that doesn't even exist.

374
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,560
I think that's the best thing to do.

375
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,780
Thanks for the tea.

376
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,120
I didn't want to tell anyone.

377
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,650
Because I wanted to
forget what had happened.

378
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,130
Whenever I would think of you...

379
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,620
I thought that my heart
would rip to shreds...

380
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,460
and I couldn't handle
the agonizing pain.

381
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,780
I've never once...

382
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,350
in all these years...

383
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,220
have ever stopped...

384
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,240
thinking about you.

385
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,920
I just hoped and prayed...

386
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,950
that you were still alive.

387
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,750
All I prayed for...

388
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,760
was that you were somehow still alive.

389
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,220
I prayed... every single night for you.

390
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,059
Thank you for still being alive.

391
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,030
Thank you... Thank you so
much for still being alive!

392
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,300
Thank you... thank you!

393
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,880
Thank you for still being alive.

394
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,319
Thank you.

395
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,520
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you for still being alive.

396
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,800
What did you parents say?

397
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,980
The woman who calls herself my mom...

398
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,510
held my hand and cried.

399
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,760
Yeah... I can't even imagine
how much you mom must've missed you.

400
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Didn't you feel something when you
held your mom's hand?

401
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,029
You felt the warmth of
your mom's hand, right?

402
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,740
I'm not sure.

403
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,150
Holding a mom's hand...

404
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,410
That's something
I never got to experience before.

405
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,639
There's no need for you to worry.

406
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,519
His health has deteriorated to a point

407
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,259
where the success rate is almost
at a hundred percent right now.

408
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,300
There's almost no chance
of any side effects either.

409
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,720
Being a parent is so hard.

410
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,740
<i>I'll wait for you with
a smile on my face.</i>

411
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,190
<i>Dong Suk.</i>

412
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,689
- Why are you being so loud?
- They want the Golden Boat!

413
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,490
- What's a 'Golden Boat'?
- I need everyone's attention!

414
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,499
In celebration of His Highness, Ji Hyuk,
having found his birth parents

415
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,070
he has offered to pay the drink tab
for everyone that's here tonight!

416
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,299
Hey!
I'm not paying for everyone's tab!

417
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,729
- Your parents are filthy rich!
- I'm not rich. Those people are rich.

418
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,999
That whole thing about the
Golden Boat is void, okay?

419
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,389
You have to pay for
your own drink tabs.

420
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,220
Don't be misled by what you have seen
or heard on the news, okay?

421
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,809
I'm not a rich family's son.

422
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,900
I'm just one of you guys
here at Guchangdo Market.

423
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,590
Don't feel awkward around me, and treat
me casually like you've always done.

424
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,799
- Let's cheers.
- Okay, fine.

425
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,900
If that's what you really
want, then go ahead.

426
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,020
But you have to pay for
our drink tabs, okay?

427
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,459
Okay, fine!
It'll be my treat!

428
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,900
But I'm not paying for the snacks too.
Just your drink tabs, okay?

429
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,950
- Okay, it's a deal!
- Wait! But no beers.

430
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,019
You can only get soju.

431
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,350
Who even drinks beer
anymore these days?

432
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,699
It's just expensive and filling.

433
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,420
Okay, then drink as
much as you'd like.

434
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,159
Okay, we'll take that.

435
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,620
A round of applause!

436
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,970
The guy who calls that a real treat,
and those that are satisfied with it...

437
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,459
You guys are all the same!
Why are you all so cheap!

438
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,660
Ms. Mi Ra!

439
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,550
The heir to the Hyun Sung
Group is going to

440
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,640
treat in celebration of
finding his parents.

441
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,686
But he only offered to pay for soju,
and we're not allowed to get any beer.

442
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,989
Don't you think that's an insult
to Hyun Sung Group's name?

443
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:27,070
I understand. I will pay for
everything with my company card.

444
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,970
Really?

445
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,540
Everything that these
people are having?

446
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,619
Yes, that won't be a problem.

447
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,409
You heard her, right?
Everything is on her!

448
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,780
Hurray for Ji Hyuk!

449
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,169
No, that's not the
right thing to say.

450
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,889
Ji Hyuk didn't pay for a thing.
We should hurray for Ms. Mi Ra.

451
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,620
- Everyone hurray for Ms. Mi Ra!
- Hurray for Ms. Mi Ra!

452
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,290
Here, let me pour you your first drink.

453
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,080
Hey, does she look like
the sort of person

454
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,890
who'd drink soju in a
filthy place like this?

455
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,560
You just don't get it.

456
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,929
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,009
I'll take you to a fancy place later
and buy you a glass of red wine.

458
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,350
No, I'll accept that drink.

459
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,069
Drink the whole thing.
Wow, she's a good drinker!

460
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,970
Let me pour you one too.

461
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,590
<i>Wow, what a great drinker!</i>

462
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,080
- Let me pour you a drink too.
- Stop feeding her drinks!

463
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,300
You scoundrel.
Just because she's your girlfriend...

464
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,239
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Let me see that.

465
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,349
Here.

466
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,310
If you're going to start
dating this rascal,

467
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,300
then you have to let
me pour you a drink.

468
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,730
If you don't,
then I can't give you my blessing.

469
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,579
- No, don't give her another drink!
- No.

470
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,160
I'll accept just one more drink
since you're already here.

471
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,900
I like your style.
Here, let me pour you one.

472
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,020
Take good care of our
Ji Hyuk for us, okay?

473
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,950
Sure!

474
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,140
I think you've had enough.
Let's get you up.

475
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,199
Are you okay?

476
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,340
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Let's go before you drink anymore.

477
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,350
Where do you think you're going?

478
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,499
She can't leave
until she sings us a song first.

479
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,759
Sing a song right now?

480
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,669
You think it's okay to just
let them go or not?

481
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,090
No, of course not!

482
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,970
What are you guys doing!

483
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,450
What do you think you're doing!

484
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,570
Ms. Mi Ra.

485
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,990
<i>What a nice singer!</i>

486
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,380
Ms. Mi Ra.

487
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,850
Ms. Mi Ra, wake up.

488
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,790
Is this the right place?

489
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,860
Thank you.

490
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,570
Thank you for still being alive.

491
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,069
Which one's your house?

492
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,910
I'll take you home.

493
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,009
Forget it.

494
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,530
Stop worrying about me,
and you just worry about yourself.

495
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,169
Me?

496
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,760
But I'm fine.

497
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,850
Look here, Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk.

498
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,520
Let me give you a piece of advice.

499
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,549
But don't get your pride all ruffled up
where it's not needed.

500
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,070
Take the money and
spend it all you like,

501
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,610
and do everything you've
ever wanted to do.

502
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,140
Buy everything you've
ever wanted to buy, and

503
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,270
eat everything you've
ever wanted to eat.

504
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,559
That's what you should do.

505
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,469
Why aren't you doing any of that?

506
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,660
Why?

507
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,149
Why aren't you spending any money
when they're telling you to?

508
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,450
Spend as much as you'd like!

509
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,310
I've never once...

510
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,949
thought of their money as mine.

511
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:18,250
That's why... that's why you're a fool.

512
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
- A fool.
- Excuse me?

513
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,880
Thank you for still being alive.

514
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,630
This is a nice neighborhood.

515
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,850
Can you come over here and
help me pick one out?

516
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,090
I've never been overseas before,
so I'm not sure which one to get.

517
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,410
Um... why didn't you ever join
a girl group or something?

518
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,330
Excuse me?

519
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,900
I don't think it's
too late for you yet.

520
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,590
You should start training or something.
You're a pretty good singer.

521
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,199
What are you talking about?

522
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,140
- You don't remember last night?
- No, not at all.

523
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,090
You must've been really
drunk last night.

524
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,819
I understand.

525
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,150
Because I myself confuse my dreams from
reality from time to time when I drink.

526
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,640
What do you think about this one?

527
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,170
Let me know if you need anything else.

528
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,200
No, I'm all set with this.

529
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,209
I forgot you told me to
go spend all my money.

530
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,859
I should just blow all my money here.

531
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,489
You called me a fool and
told me to spend all my money.

532
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,340
Let's go. I'm going to blow
some serious money on you today.

533
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,249
No. I didn't tell you to
spend it on someone else.

534
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,220
I told you to spend it on yourself...

535
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,990
So you do remember.

536
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,480
You should've told me
that you remember!

537
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,999
Why are you trying to lie to me?

538
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,570
Let's go. I'll show
you how I can spend...

539
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,169
No, please don't be like this.

540
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,940
Everyone can make a mistake or two
when they're drunk. Let's go.

541
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,520
I told you to stop doing this!

542
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,680
- I was just...
- I'm sorry, but I'm working right now.

543
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,050
I hope that we don't make
things uncomfortable

544
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,690
for each other
while I'm working.

545
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,170
<i>Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk?</i>

546
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,219
I'm Reporter Bae from WVS News.

547
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,560
I met you at the hospital.
Can you give me an interview?

548
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,850
- What do you think?
- Huh?

549
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,120
- What interview?
- I'm sorry, but we must get going.

550
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,509
- I just need a few minutes.
- No, I'm sorry.

551
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,150
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk!
Wait!

552
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,880
What did you and the
Chairman talk about?

553
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,050
I told you that you
can't interview him.

554
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,239
What did you two talk about?

555
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,770
Where does your shares
stand compared to.

556
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,319
Director Kang Dong
Suk at the company?

557
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,550
I told you that you
can't interview him!

558
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,380
Reporter Bae!

559
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:39,940
Don't you think that it's time for you
to make a move in your career?

560
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,489
If a man like you came to
work for me at my company

561
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,420
I have a feeling that we could be
quite successful together.

562
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,790
Sir.

563
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,830
Why don't you just be frank with me?

564
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,419
What is it that you
want to hear from me?

565
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,139
I'll just be honest with you
since you're my junior.

566
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,700
Why do you keep digging
around my company?

567
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,419
You know a man by the name
of Jung Won Tae, don't' you?

568
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,646
He was the prosecutor for
Seoul's eastern district?

569
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,559
- Yes, I know him.
- You owe him a debt, don't you?

570
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,289
When he got transferred down to Busan?

571
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,479
Are you saying that I'm responsible
for his transfer?

572
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,149
It has been decided that he'll be
promoted to Chief Prosecutor.

573
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,009
Even though he's slightly starting to
dig around right now

574
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,799
he's going to get serious about it
once he's officially promoted.

575
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,270
I think it would be wise for you to
prepare yourself for a serious battle.

576
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,689
Ta da!

577
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,389
- Study hard, okay?
- Okay!

578
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,599
Okay, next!

579
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,989
- Thank you!
- You're so cute! How old are you?

580
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,830
- I'm five years old.
- You're five?

581
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,150
Study hard, okay?

582
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,430
I want something else.

583
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,799
- Just take what you're given.
- I want a robot too!

584
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,519
I don't have another robot.
Just take the pink pencil case.

585
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,859
I want a robot!

586
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,189
You little rascal.

587
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,739
Give it back if you don't want it,
and I'll give it to someone else.

588
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,880
Next.

589
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,620
What?
Did you just kick me?

590
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,119
Would you look at this kid. How dare
you glare at an adult like that?

591
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,450
Come over here, you rascal.

592
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,430
Hey!
Get over here right now!

593
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,759
You've met your match today.
Come here!

594
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,150
Come over here right now!

595
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,300
How dare you act like I used to
when I was a kid?

596
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,210
I'm going to drown
you with my kisses!

597
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,640
Let go of me!

598
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,460
My Sister Mom!

599
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,660
This is not a lie, but I'm really
going to come here often from now on.

600
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,220
No, it's okay. Don't worry about me,
and you just go live a happy life.

601
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,519
Okay, always be healthy,
and I'm going to get going now.

602
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
No need to see me out.
I'm going to get going.

603
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,950
Ji Hyuk, wait.

604
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,629
I've been holding onto something
that may have helped you

605
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,319
if you ever wanted to
search for your parents.

606
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,646
But now that you've found your parents

607
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,310
there's no reason for me to
hang onto this anymore.

608
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,760
I think this may have been in the bag
that you were carrying with you.

609
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,000
<i>[I know that the
heavens will punish me</i>

610
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,650
<i>[for abandoning my child
at this place...]</i>

611
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,460
<i>[But it's just too
difficult to raise</i>

612
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
<i>[this child on my own
without his father.]</i>

613
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,939
Have you known about it too?

614
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,280
Excuse me?

615
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,789
I'm sure you were just doing
what you were told.

616
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,760
I have an urgent matter to tend to,
so I'll see you later.

617
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,089
What is this about?

618
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,020
If you could just tell me
what this is about...

619
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:40,979
Oh my goodness!

620
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,249
- What are you doing here?
- Where's mother's room?

621
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,480
- Mom isn't here right now.
- Is it over there?

622
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,460
Hey... you! You seem to be
mistaken about something here.

623
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,519
But we don't think
of you as family yet.

624
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,299
No, you'll never be our family.
Do you know why?

625
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,120
It's because you're trash.

626
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,529
Take a good look.

627
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,859
Do you actually think that you and I
look like siblings?

628
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,190
No.
Not even close.

629
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,780
Right?

630
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,500
You don't think so either.

631
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,290
What the hell is his deal?

632
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,780
- Straighten that out.
- Yes, Sir.

633
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,740
Yes, Lady Jin Ah.

634
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,650
<i>The caller you are trying
cannot be reached,</i>

635
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,550
<i>so please leave a
message at the tone.</i>

636
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,160
- Yes, Director.
- What happened?

637
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,890
Why did Kang Ji Hyuk suddenly
cause a scene over at the house?

638
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,160
By any chance...
did he catch on to what's going on?

639
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,760
I think Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk discovered
something at the orphanage.

640
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,710
Really?

641
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,689
Do you remember the thing that I told
you to prepare in case of an emergency?

642
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,279
We need to get it ready in a hurry.

643
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,729
Send out a team over to the company.

644
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:53,890
Okay.

645
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,890
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk.
What brings you by here?

646
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,699
Where's Chairman Kang right now?

647
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,729
I'm actually trying to locate
where Chairman Kang is myself.

648
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,300
I think he may be away
on a business trip.

649
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,899
Can you get in touch with him?

650
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,449
I'm not sure.

651
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:05,609
I tried to reach him,
but I wasn't able to get a hold of him.

652
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,980
He may be in the middle of
an important meeting right now.

653
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,599
What is it that you
need to see him about?

654
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,829
There's something
that I need to verify with him.

655
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:15,929
Why don't you tell me what it is?

656
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,650
- I can check for you when I see him...
- No.

657
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,760
I'd like to speak to him
directly in person.

658
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,200
I'll just wait for him.

659
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,209
Is there something...

660
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,830
that you're disappointed
with the Chairman about?

661
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,770
It's been quite a
while since I started

662
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,690
working for Chairman
Kang and his family.

663
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,210
There's something
that I've learned in

664
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,790
all the years that
I've worked for them.

665
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,720
All the members of that family...
are weary of other people.

666
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,319
Just think about what it would be like
if you had just walked out of a bank

667
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,190
with a huge bag of cash on you.

668
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,350
You begin to be suspicious of everyone
who walks by you.

669
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:04,310
Same goes for blood ties. No, blood
ties are even more suspicious.

670
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,339
Because closer a person is to you

671
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,621
higher the danger of that person
stabbing you in the back.

672
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,959
You cannot expect...

673
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,849
a normal family life
with people like that.

674
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,350
Is that right?

675
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,150
Then... why would people
like that falsely

676
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,620
forge up a family
registry document?

677
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,770
I have no idea what it is
that you're implying right now.

678
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,020
Looking at you right now...

679
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:36,740
I get the feeling that you know this
family better than anyone else.

680
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,550
Then I guess you must
know about it too.

681
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,630
What their true intentions are.

682
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,320
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk.

683
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,910
You seem to be misunderstood
about something.

684
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,360
But you really are
the biological son of Chairman Kang.

685
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,880
There is only one reason why
anyone would show any kindness...

686
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,320
to a stray dog out on the streets.

687
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,910
It's so that they can devour the dog.

688
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,040
Then what do you think
the stray dog in

689
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,730
that situation must do
in order to survive?

690
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,700
The dog must rip them to shreds
as they try to attack.

691
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,550
That's the only way for
the dog to survive!

692
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,319
- What is it that you want from me?
- This is all a misunderstanding.

693
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Do you know what kind of people
I hate the most in this world?

694
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,610
It's those who deceives
me about my parents!

695
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:54,890
No, that's not true.
You must believe me.

696
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,610
It seems as though
whatever you're hiding is

697
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,860
more important to you
than your own life.

698
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,969
Warn Chairman Kang for me.

699
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,660
Because I'm going to meet him
to get the truth out of him myself.

700
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,730
I'm not that generous of a person... so
you won't' get away easy the next time.

701
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,110
He's...

702
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:23,130
at the company's 48th
anniversary event right now.

703
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,590
Is Chairman Kang
in there right now?

704
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,340
No, he's not. But
Director Do is in there.

705
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:56,469
<i>He's on his way there right now.</i>

706
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,930
We don't need to explain
anything to him this time.

707
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,140
Just make it clean...
and get rid of him once and for all.

708
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,900
Don't go.

709
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,559
Please don't go.

710
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,609
I need to go and verify it for myself.

711
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,520
I need to find out who I really am.

712
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,430
Just who it is that I really am.

713
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,590
Hold on.

714
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,460
Yes, I understand.

715
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,050
Move!
Move out of the way!

716
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,310
- Dad.
- You're here.

717
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:51,849
What is it that you're
wearing right now?

718
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,950
That guy came by the house earlier
and caused a huge ruckus.

719
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,670
- Who did?
- Who do you think? Your firstborn son.

720
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,150
Let's talk about that later.

721
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,010
He's fake, isn't he?

722
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,640
- Chairman Cha... you came.
- Yes.

723
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,560
It's me.
We can't let that bastard go in there.

724
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:19,490
Stop him. Stop him even if
you have to ram him down.

725
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,280
What are you planning
to do in there?

726
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,890
I don't know what I'm
going to do either.

727
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,650
I believe that the
only reason Hyun Sung

728
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,099
has been able to endure
the past 48 years

729
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,540
was because of the efforts
put in by everyone at the company.

730
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,819
A leader with the correct set of
principles and experience...

731
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,400
and all the family
members at Hyun Sung who

732
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,990
followed that leadership
with loyalty.

733
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,729
I will do everything within my power

734
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,830
to grow the strength
further to last another

735
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,960
48 years, and longer
into the future.

736
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,309
My Hyun Sung family...

737
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,470
and everyone else who has
dedicated themselves

738
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,650
to the further future
growth of Hyun Sung...

739
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,209
I hope that we can all join our efforts
to grow Hyun Sung into a company

740
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,730
that could become a
leader of the future

741
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,270
for the people of
this country...

742
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,240
I will take the lead to pave the way
for a brighter future.

743
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,550
Chairman Kang Sung Wook.

744
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,190
Tell me the truth.

745
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,700
Am I...

746
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,140
truly your son?

747
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,390
I would like to introduce
you all to the

748
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,690
bright new future
of Hyun Sung Group.

749
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,526
He is the bright new leader who will be
the face of a new branch of Hyun Sung.

750
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,510
A man who will be leading
a whole new branch

751
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,490
of Hyun Sung into a
bright new future.

752
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,640
Allow me to introduce you all to
President Kang Ji Hyuk.

753
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:26,449
<i>Under the orders of
Chairman Kang Sung Wook...</i>

754
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:30,240
<i>I promise to all of
you that I will lead.</i>

755
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:34,040
<i>Hyun Sung Group to a
new age of the future.</i>

756
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,500
[Next Episode Preview]

757
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,359
<i>President Kang Ji Hyuk?</i>

758
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,060
<i>Where did they find a
character like that?</i>

759
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,780
<i>Fight is all about speed.</i>

760
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:46,510
<i>One swift blow to the face,
and all his teeth will be knocked out.</i>

761
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,950
<i>This is in response to
the complaints that</i>

762
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,399
<i>we've received in regards
to your leadership.</i>

763
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,039
<i>Are you trying to punish me?</i>

764
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,350
<i>Is that trash really my brother?</i>

765
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,759
<i>This is the final scene to the play.</i>

766
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,979
<i>Bringing Hyun Sung Group
down to the ground.</i>

767
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,640
<i>- A man is dead.
- Dead?</i>

768
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,970
<i>- Get rid of that jerk!
- This is my company!</i>
